presentation of the entire race embrace all of its various group and element show they relation with each other and to the whites be make it be very likely that the negro of the united state have a fairly correct idea of what the white people of the country think of they for that opinion have for a long time be and be still be constantly state but they be themselves more or less a sphinx to the whites it be curiously interesting and even vitally important to know what be the thought of ten million of they concern the people among whom they live in these page it be as though a veil have be

over into the white race in this book the reader be give a glimpse behind the scene of this race-drama which be be here enact -- he be take upon a elevation where he can catch a bird 's - eye view of the conflict which be be wage the publisher i i know that in write the follow page i be divulge the great secret of my life the secret which for some year i have guard far more carefully than any of my earthly possession and it be a curious study to I to analyze the motive which prompt I to do it i feel that i be lead by the same impulse which force the un-found-out criminal to take somebody into he confidence although he know that the act be likely even almost certain to lead to he undoing i know that i be play with fire and i feel the thrill which accompany that most fascinating pastime and back of it all i think i find a sort of savage and diabolical desire to gather up all the little tragedy of my life and turn they into a practical joke on society and too i suffer a vague feeling of unsatisfaction of regret of almost remorse from which i be seek relief and of which i shall speak in the last paragraph of this account i be bear in a little town of georgium a few year after the close of the civil war i shall not mention the name of the town because there be people still live there who could be connect with this narrative i have only a faint recollection of the place of my birth at time i can close my eye and call up in a dreamlike way thing that seem to have happen age ago in some other world i can see in this half vision a little house -- i be quite sure it be not a large one -- i can remember that flower grow in the front yard and that around each bed of flower be a hedge of vari-colored glass bottle stick in the ground neck down i remember that once while play around in the sand i become curious to know whether or not the bottle grow as the flower do and i proceed to dig they up to find out the investigation bring I a terrific spanking which indelibly fix the incident in my mind i can remember too that behind the house be a shed under which stand two or three wooden wash-tub these tub be the earliest aversion of my life for regularly on certain evening i be plunge into one of they and scrub until my skin ache i can remember to this day the pain cause by the strong rank soap 's get into my eye back from the house a vegetable garden run perhaps seventy-five or one hundred foot but to my childish fancy it be a endless territory i can still recall the thrill of joy excitement and wonder it give I to go on a explore expedition through it to find the blackberry both ripe and green that grow along the edge of the fence i remember with what pleasure i use to arrive at and stand before a little enclosure in which stand a patient cow chew she cud how i would occasionally offer she through the bar a piece of my bread and molasses and how i would jerk back my hand in half fright if she make any motion to accept my offer i have a dim recollection of several people who move in and about this little house but i have a distinct mental image of only two : one my mother and the other a tall man with a small dark mustache i remember that he shoe or boot be always shiny and that he wear a gold chain and a great gold watch with which he be always willing to let I play my admiration be almost equally divide between the watch and chain and the shoe he use to come to the house evening perhaps two or three time a week and it become my appoint duty whenever he come to bring he a pair of slipper and to put the shiny shoe in a particular corner he often give I in return for this service a bright coin which my mother teach I to promptly drop in a little tin bank i remember distinctly the last time this tall man come to the little house in georgium that evening before i go to bed he take I up in he arm and squeeze I very tightly my mother stand behind he chair wipe tear from she eye i remember how i sit upon he knee and watch he laboriously drill a hole through a ten-dollar gold piece and then tie the coin around my neck with a string i have worn that gold piece around my neck the greater part of my life and still possess it but more than once i have wish that some other way have be find of attach it to I besides put a hole through it on the day after the coin be put around my neck my mother and i start on what seem to I a endless journey i knelt on the seat and watch through the train window the corn and cotton field pass swiftly by until i fall asleep when i fully awake we be be drive through the street of a large city -- savannah i sit up and blink at the bright light at savannah we board a steamer which finally land we in new york from new york we go to a town in connecticut which become the home of my boyhood my mother and i live together in a little cottage which seem to I to be fit up almost luxuriously there be horse-hair-covered chair in the parlor and a little square piano there be a stairway with red carpet on it lead to a half second story there be picture on the wall and a few book in a glass-doored case my mother dress I very neatly and i develop that pride which well-dressed boy generally have she be careful about my associate and i myself be quite particular as i look back now i can see that i be a perfect little aristocrat my mother rarely go to anyone 's house but she do sewing and there be a great many lady come to we cottage if i be around they would generally call I and ask I my name and age and tell my mother what a pretty boy i be some of they would pat I on the head and kiss I my mother be keep very busy with she sewing sometimes she would have another woman help she i think she must have derive a fair income from she work i know too that at least once each month she receive a letter i use to watch for the postman get the letter and run to she with it whether she be busy or not she would take it and instantly thrust it into she bosom i never see she read one of these letter i know later that they contain money and what be to she more than money as busy as she generally be she find time however to teach I my letter and figure and how to spell a number of easy word always on Sunday evening she open the little square piano and pick out hymn i can recall now that whenever she play hymn from the book she _ tempo _ be always decidedly _ largo _ sometimes on other evening when she be not sew she would play simple accompaniment to some old southern song which she sing in these song she be freer because she play they by ear those evening on which she open the little piano be the happiest hour of my childhood whenever she start toward the instrument i use to follow she with all the interest and irrepressible joy that a pampered pet dog show when a package be open in which he know there be a sweet bit for he i use to stand by she side and often interrupt and annoy she by chime in with strange harmony which i find on either the high key of the treble or the low key of the bass i remember that i have a particular fondness for the black key always on such evening when the music be over my mother would sit with I in she arm often for a very long time she would hold I close softly croon some old melody without word all the while gently stroke she face against my head many and many a night i thus fall asleep i can see she now she great dark eye look into the fire to where no one know but she the memory of that picture have more than once keep I from stray too far from the place of purity and safety in which she arm hold I at a very early age i begin to thump on the piano alone and it be not long before i be able to pick out a few tune when i be seven year old i could play by ear all of the hymn and song that my mother know i have also learn the name of the note in both clef but i prefer not to be hamper by note about this time several lady for whom my mother sew hear I play and they persuade she that i should at once be put under a teacher so arrangement be make for I to study the piano with a lady who be a fairly good musician at the same time arrangement be make for I to study my book with this lady 's daughter my music teacher have no small difficulty at first in pin I down to the note if she play my lesson over for I i invariably attempt to reproduce the require sound without the slightest recourse to the write character she daughter my other teacher also have she worry she find that in read whenever i come to word that be difficult or unfamiliar i be prone to bring my imagination to the rescue and read from the picture she have laughingly tell I since then that i would sometimes substitute whole sentence and even paragraph from what meaning i think the illustration convey she say she not only be sometimes amuse at the fresh treatment i would give a author 's subject but when i give some new and sudden turn to the plot of the story often grow interested and even excite in listen to hear what kind of a denouement i would bring about but i be sure this be not due to dullness for i make rapid progress in both my music and my book and so for a couple of year my life be divide between my music and my school book music take up the greater part of my time i have no playmate but amuse myself with game -- some of they my own invention -- which could be play alone i know a few boy whom i have meet at the church which i attend with my mother but i have form no close friendship with any of they then when i be nine year old my mother decide to enter I in the public school so all at once i find myself throw among a crowd of boy of all size and kind some of they seem to I like savage i shall never forget the bewilderment the pain the heart-sickness of that first day at school i seem to be the only stranger in the place every other boy seem to know every other boy i be fortunate enough however to be assign to a teacher who know I my mother make she dress she be one of the lady who use to pat I on the head and kiss I she have the tact to address a few word directly to I this give I a certain sort of standing in the class and put I somewhat at ease within a few day i have make one staunch friend and be on fairly good term with most of the boy i be shy of the girl and remain so even now a word or look from a pretty woman set I all a-tremble this friend i bind to I with hook of steel in a very simple way he be a big awkward boy with a face full of freckle and a head full of very red hair he be perhaps fourteen year of age that be four or five year older than any other boy in the class this seniority be due to the fact that he have spend twice the require amount of time in several of the precede class i have not be at school many hour before i feel that red head -- as i involuntarily call he -- and i be to be friend i do not doubt that this feeling be strengthen by the fact that i have be quick enough to see that a big strong boy be a friend to be desire at a public school and perhaps in spite of he dullness red head have be able to discern that i could be of service to he at any rate there be a simultaneous mutual attraction the teacher have string the class promiscuously around the wall of the room for a sort of trial heat for place of rank when the line be straighten out i find that by skillful maneuvering i have place myself third and have pilot red head to the place next to I the teacher begin by give we to spell the word correspond to we order in the line spell _ first _ spell _ second _ spell _ third _ i rattle off : t-h-i-r-d third in a way which say : why do not you give we something hard as the word go down the line i could see how lucky i have be to get a good place together with a easy word as young as i be i feel impressed with the unfairness of the whole proceeding when i see the tailender go down before _ twelfth _ and _ twentieth _ and i feel sorry for those who have to spell such word in order to hold a low position spell _ fourth _ red head with he hand clutch tightly behind he back begin bravely : f-o-r-t-h like a flash a score of hand go up and the teacher begin say : no snap of finger no snap of finger this be the first word miss and it seem to I that some of the scholar be about to lose they sens some be dance up and down on one foot with a hand above they head the finger work furiously and joy beam all over they face other stand still they hand raise not so high they finger work less rapidly and they face express not quite so much happiness there be still other who do not move or raise they hand but stand with great wrinkle on they forehead look very thoughtful the whole thing be new to I and i do not raise my hand but slyly whisper the letter u to red head several time second chance say the teacher the hand go down and the class become quiet red head he face now red after look beseechingly at the ceiling then pitiably at the floor begin very haltingly : f-u -- immediately a impulse to raise hand go through the class but the teacher check it and poor red head though he know that each letter he add only take he farther out of the way go doggedly on and finish : -- r-t-h the hand-raising be now repeat with more hubbub and excitement than at first those who before have not move a finger be now wave they hand above they head red head feel that he be lose he look very big and foolish and some of the scholar begin to snicker he helpless condition go straight to my heart and grip my sympathy i feel that if he fail it would in some way be my failure i raise my hand and under cover of the excitement and the teacher 's attempt to regain order i hurriedly shoot up into he ear twice quite distinctly : f-o-u-r-t-h f-o-u-r-t-h the teacher tap on she desk and say : third and last chance the hand come down the silence become oppressive red head begin : f -- since that day i have wait anxiously for many a turn of the wheel of fortune but never under greater tension than when i watch for the order in which those letter would fall from red 's lip -- o-u-r-t-h a sigh of relief and disappointment go up from the class afterwards through all we school day red head share my wit and quickness and i benefit by he strength and dogged faithfulness there be some black and brown boy and girl in the school and several of they be in my class one of the boy strongly attract my attention from the first day i see he he face be as black as night but shine as though it be polish he have sparkling eye and when he open he mouth he display glisten white tooth it strike I at once as appropriate to call he shiny face or shiny eye or shiny tooth and i speak of he often by one of these name to the other boy these term be finally merge into shiny and to that name he answer good-naturedly during the balance of he public school day shiny be consider without question to be the best speller the best reader the best penman -- in a word the best scholar in the class he be very quick to catch anything but nevertheless study hard thus he possess two power very rarely combine in one boy i see he year after year on up into the high school win the majority of the prize for punctuality deportment essay write and declamation yet it do not take I long to discover that in spite of he standing as a scholar he be in some way look down upon the other black boy and girl be still more look down upon some of the boy often speak of they as nigger sometimes on the way home from school a crowd would walk behind they repeat : _ nigger nigger never die black face and shiny eye _ on one such afternoon one of the black boy turn suddenly on he tormentor and hurl a slate it strike one of the white boy in the mouth cut a slight gash in he lip at sight of the blood the boy who have throw the slate run and he companion quickly follow we run after they pelt they with stone until they separate in several direction i be very much work up over the affair and go home and tell my mother how one of the nigger have strike a boy with a slate i shall never forget how she turn on I do not you ever use that word again she say and do not you ever bother the colored child at school you ought to be ashamed of yourself i do hang my head in shame not because she have convince I that i have do wrong but because i be hurt by the first sharp word she have ever give I my school day run along very pleasantly i stand well in my study not always so well with regard to my behavior i be never guilty of any serious misconduct but my love of fun sometimes get I into trouble i remember however that my sense of humor be so sly that most of the trouble usually fall on the head of the other fellow my ability to play on the piano at school exercise be look upon as little short of marvelous in a boy of my age i be not chummy with many of my mate but on the whole be about as popular as it be good for a boy to be one day near the end of my second term at school the principal come into we room and after talk to the teacher for some reason say : i wish all of the white scholar to stand for a moment i rise with the other the teacher look at I and call my name say : you sit down for the present and rise with the other i do not quite understand she and question : ma be she repeat with a softer tone in she voice : you sit down now and rise with the other i sit down dazed i saw and hear nothing when the other be ask to rise i do not know it when school be dismiss i go out in a kind of stupor a few of the white boy jeer I say : oh you be a nigger too i hear some black child say : we know he be color shiny say to they : come along do not tease he and thereby win my undying gratitude i hurry on as fast as i could and have go some distance before i perceive that red head be walk by my side after a while he say to I : le ' I carry you book i give he my strap without be able to answer when we get to my gate he say as he hand I my book : say you know my big red agate i can not shoot with it any more i be go to bring it to school for you tomorrow i take my book and run into the house as i pass through the hallway i see that my mother be busy with one of she customer i rush up into my own little room shut the door and go quickly to where my looking-glass hung on the wall for a instant i be afraid to look but when i do i look long and earnestly i have often hear people say to my mother : what a pretty boy you have i be accustom to hear remark about my beauty but now for the first time i become conscious of it and recognize it i notice the ivory whiteness of my skin the beauty of my mouth the size and liquid darkness of my eye and how the long black lash that fringe and shaded they produce a effect that be strangely fascinating even to I i notice the softness and glossiness of my dark hair that fall in wave over my temple make my forehead appear whiter than it really be how long i stand there gaze at my image i do not know when i come out and reach the head of the stair i hear the lady who have be with my mother go out i run downstairs and rush to where my mother be sit with a piece of work in she hand i bury my head in she lap and blurt out : mother mother tell I be i a nigger i could not see she face but i know the piece of work drop to the floor and i feel she hand on my head i look up into she face and repeat : tell I mother be i a nigger there be tear in she eye and i could see that she be suffer for I and then it be that i look at she critically for the first time i have think of she in a childish way only as the most beautiful woman in the world now i look at she search for defect i could see that she skin be almost brown that she hair be not so soft as mine and that she do differ in some way from the other lady who come to the house yet even so i could see that she be very beautiful more beautiful than any of they she must have feel that i be examine she for she hide she face in my hair and say with difficulty : no my darling you be not a nigger she go on : you be as good as anybody if anyone call you a nigger do not notice they but the more she talk the less be i reassure and i stop she by ask : well mother be i white be you white she answer tremblingly : no i be not white but you -- you father be one of the greatest man in the country -- the best blood of the south be in you -- this suddenly open up in my heart a fresh chasm of misgiving and fear and i almost fiercely demand : who be my father where be he she stroke my hair and say : i 'll tell you about he some day i sob : i want to know now she answer : no not now perhaps it have to be do but i have never forgive the woman who do it so cruelly it may be that she never know that she give I a sword-thrust that day in school which be year in healing ii since i have grow older i have often go back and try to analyze the change that come into my life after that fateful day in school there do come a radical change and young as i be i feel fully conscious of it though i do not fully comprehend it like my first spanking it be one of the few incident in my life that i can remember clearly in the life of everyone there be a limited number of unhappy experience which be not write upon the memory but stamp there with a die and in long year after they can be call up in detail and every emotion that be stir by they can be live through anew these be the tragedy of life we may grow to include some of they among the trivial incident of childhood -- a broken toy a promise make to we which be not keep a harsh heart-piercing word -- but these too as well as the bitter experience and disappointment of mature year be the tragedy of life and so i have often live through that hour that day that week in which be work the miracle of my transition from one world into another for i do indeed pass into another world from that time i look out through other eye my thought be color my word dictate my action limit by one dominate all-pervading idea which constantly increase in force and weight until i finally realize in it a great tangible fact and this be the dwarf warping distort influence which operate upon each and every color man in the united state he be force to take he outlook on all thing not from the viewpoint of a citizen or a man or even a human being but from the viewpoint of a _ color _ man it be wonderful to I that the race have progress so broadly as it have since most of its thought and all of its activity must run through the narrow neck of this one funnel and it be this too which make the color people of this country in reality a mystery to the whites it be a difficult thing for a white man to learn what a color man really think because generally with the latter a additional and different light must be bring to bear on what he think and he thought be often influence by consideration so delicate and subtle that it would be impossible for he to confess or explain they to one of the opposite race this give to every color man in proportion to he intellectuality a sort of dual personality there be one phase of he which be disclose only in the freemasonry of he own race i have often watch with interest and sometimes with amazement even ignorant color man under cover of broad grin and minstrel antic maintain this dualism in the presence of white man i believe it to be a fact that the color people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand they i now think that this change which come into my life be at first more subjective than objective i do not think my friend at school change so much toward I as i do toward they i grow reserved i might say suspicious i grow constantly more and more afraid of lay myself open to some injury to my feeling or my pride i frequently see or fancy some slight where i be sure none be intend on the other hand my friend and teacher be if anything different more considerate of I but i can remember that it be against this very attitude in particular that my sensitiveness revolt red be the only one who do not so wind I up to this day i recall with a swell heart he clumsy effort to make I understand that nothing could change he love for I i be sure that at this time the majority of my white schoolmate do not understand or appreciate any difference between I and themselves but there be a few who have evidently receive instruction at home on the matter and more than once they display they knowledge in word and action as the year pass i notice that the most innocent and ignorant among the other grow in wisdom i myself would not have so clearly understand this difference have it not be for the presence of the other colored child at school i have learn what they status be and now i learn that theirs be mine i have have no particular like or dislike for these black and brown boy and girl in fact with the exception of shiny they have occupy very little of my thought but i do know that when the blow fall i have a very strong aversion to be class with they so i become something of a solitary red and i remain inseparable and there be between shiny and I a sort of sympathetic bond but my intercourse with the other be never entirely free from a feeling of constraint i must add however that this feeling be confine almost entirely to my intercourse with boy and girl of about my own age i do not experience it with my senior and when i grow to manhood i find myself freer with elderly white people than with those near my own age i be now about eleven year old but these emotion and impression which i have just describe could not have be stronger or more distinct at a older age there be two immediate result of my forced loneliness : i begin to find company in book and greater pleasure in music i make the former discovery through a big gilt-bound illustrated copy of the bible which use to lie in splendid neglect on the center table in we little parlor on top of the bible lay a photograph album i have often look at the picture in the album and one day after take the larger book down and open it on the floor i be overjoy to find that it contain what seem to be a inexhaustible supply of picture i look at these picture many time in fact so often that i know the story of each one without have to read the subject and then somehow i pick up the thread of history on which be string the trial and tribulation of the hebrew child this i follow with feverish interest and excitement for a long time king david with samson a close second stand at the head of my list of hero he be not displace until i come to know robert the bruce i read a good portion of the old testament all that part treat of war and rumor of war and then start in on the new i become interested in the life of christ but become impatient and disappointed when i find that notwithstanding the great power he possess he do not make use of it when in my judgment he most need to do so and so my first general impression of the bible be what my later impression have be of a number of modern book that the author put they best work in the first part and grow either exhaust or careless toward the end after read the bible or those part which hold my attention i begin to explore the glass-doored bookcase which i have already mention i find there _ pilgrim 's progress _ peter parley 's _ history of the united state _ grimm 's _ household story tale of a grandfather _ a bind volume of a old english publication -lrb- i think it be call _ the mirror _ -rrb- a little volume call _ familiar science _ and somebody 's _ natural theology _ which last of course i could not read but which nevertheless i tackle with the result of gain a permanent dislike for all kind of theology there be several other book of no particular name or merit such as agent sell to people who know nothing of buy book how my mother come by this little library which consider all thing be so well suit to I i never seek to know but she be far from be a ignorant woman and have herself very likely read the majority of these book though i do not remember ever see she with a book in she hand with the exception of the episcopal prayer book at any rate she encourage in I the habit of reading and when i have about exhaust those book in the little library which interested I she begin to buy book for I she also regularly give I money to buy a weekly paper which be then very popular for boy at this time i go in for music with a earnestness worthy of maturer year a change of teacher be largely responsible for this i begin now to take lesson of the organist of the church which i attend with my mother he be a good teacher and quite a thorough musician he be so skillful in he instruction and fill I with such enthusiasm that my progress -- these be he word -- be marvelous i remember that when i be barely twelve year old i appear on a program with a number of adult at a entertainment give for some charitable purpose and carry off the honor i do more i bring upon myself through the local newspaper the handicapping title of infant prodigy i can believe that i do astonish my audience for i never play the piano like a child that be in the one-two-three style with accelerate motion neither do i depend upon mere brilliancy of technique a trick by which child often surprise they listener but i always try to interpret a piece of music i always play with feeling very early i acquire that knack of use the pedal which make the piano a sympathetic singing instrument quite a different thing from the source of hard or blur sound it so generally be i think this be due not entirely to natural artistic temperament but largely to the fact that i do not begin to learn the piano by count out exercise but by try to reproduce the quaint song which my mother use to sing with all they pathetic turn and cadence even at a tender age in play i help to express what i feel by some of the mannerism which i afterwards observe in great performer i have not copy they i have often hear people speak of the mannerism of musician as affectation adopt for mere effect in some case they may be so but a true artist can no more play upon the piano or violin without put he whole body in accord with the emotion he be strive to express than a swallow can fly without be graceful often when play i could not keep the tear which form in my eye from roll down my cheek sometimes at the end or even in the midst of a composition as big a boy as i be i would jump from the piano and throw myself sob into my mother 's arm she by she caress and often she tear only encourage these fit of sentimental hysteria of course to counteract this tendency to temperamental excess i should have be out play ball or in swim with other boy of my age but my mother do not know that there be only once when she be really firm with I make I do what she consider be best i do not want to return to school after the unpleasant episode which i have relate and she be inflexible i begin my third term and the day run along as i have already indicate i have be promote twice and have manage each time to pull red along with I i think the teacher come to consider I the only hope of he ever get through school and i believe they secretly conspire with I to bring about the desire end at any rate i know it become easier in each succeed examination for I not only to assist red but absolutely to do he work it be strange how in some thing honest people can be dishonest without the slightest compunction i know boy at school who be too honorable to tell a fib even when one would have be just the right thing but could not resist the temptation to assist or receive assistance in a examination i have long consider it the highest proof of honesty in a man to hand he street-car fare to the conductor who have overlook it one afternoon after school during my third term i rush home in a great hurry to get my dinner and go to my music teacher 's i be never reluctant about go there but on this particular afternoon i be impetuous the reason of this be i have be ask to play the accompaniment for a young lady who be to play a violin solo at a concert give by the young people of the church and on this afternoon we be to have we first rehearsal at that time play accompaniment be the only thing in music i do not enjoy later this feeling grow into positive dislike i have never be a really good accompanist because my idea of interpretation be always too strongly individual i constantly force my _ accelerando _ and _ rubato _ upon the soloist often throw the duet entirely out of gear perhaps the reader have already guess why i be so willing and anxious to play the accompaniment to this violin solo if not -- the violinist be a girl of seventeen or eighteen whom i have first hear play a short time before on a Sunday afternoon at a special service of some kind and who have move I to a degree which now i can hardly think of as possible at present i do not think it be due to she wonderful playing though i judge she must have be a very fair performer but there be just the proper setting to produce the effect upon a boy such as i be the half-dim church the air of devotion on the part of the listener the heaving tremor of the organ under the clear wail of the violin and she she eye almost close the escape strand of she dark hair wildly frame she pale face and she slender body sway to the tone she call forth all combine to fire my imagination and my heart with a passion though boyish yet strong and somehow lasting i have try to describe the scene if i have succeed it be only half success for word can only partially express what i wish to convey always in recall that Sunday afternoon i be sub-conscious of a faint but distinct fragrance which like some old memory-awakening perfume rise and suffuse my whole imagination induce a state of reverie so airy as just to evade the power of expression she be my first love and i love she as only a boy love i dream of she i build air castle for she she be the incarnation of each beautiful heroine i know when i play the piano it be to she not even music furnish a adequate outlet for my passion i buy a new note-book and to sing she praise make my first and last attempt at poetry i remember one day at school after we have give in we notebook to have some exercise correct the teacher call I to she desk and say : i could not correct you exercise because i find nothing in you book but a rhapsody on somebody 's brown eye i have pass in the wrong note-book i do not think i have feel greater embarrassment in my whole life than i do at that moment i be ashamed not only that my teacher should see this nakedness of my heart but that she should find out that i have any knowledge of such affair it do not then occur to I to be ashamed of the kind of poetry i have write of course the reader must know that all of this adoration be in secret next to my great love for this young lady be the dread that in some way she would find it out i do not know what some man never find out that the woman who can not discern when she be loved have never live it make I laugh to think how successful i be in conceal it all within a short time after we duet all of the friend of my dear one be refer to I as she little sweetheart or she little beau and she laughingly encourage it this do not entirely satisfy I i want to be take seriously i have definitely make up my mind that i should never love another woman and that if she deceive I i should do something desperate -- the great difficulty be to think of something sufficiently desperate -- and the heartless jade how she lead I on so i hurry home that afternoon hum snatch of the violin part of the duet my heart beat with pleasurable excitement over the fact that i be go to be near she to have she attention place directly upon I that i be go to be of service to she and in a way in which i could show myself to advantage -- this last consideration have much to do with cheerful service -- the anticipation produce in I a sensation somewhat between bliss and fear i rush through the gate take the three step to the house at one bind throw open the door and be about to hang my cap on its accustomed peg of the hall rack when i notice that that particular peg be occupy by a black derby hat i stop suddenly and gaze at this hat as though i have never see a object of its description i be still look at it in open-eyed wonder when my mother come out of the parlor into the hallway call I and say there be someone inside who want to see I feel that i be be make a party to some kind of mystery i go in with she and there i see a man standing lean with one elbow on the mantel he back partly turn toward the door as i enter he turn and i see a tall handsome well-dressed gentleman of perhaps thirty-five he advance a step toward I with a smile on he face i stop and look at he with the same feeling with which i have look at the derby hat except that they be greatly magnify i look at he from head to foot but he be a absolute blank to I until my eye rest on he slender elegant polished shoe then it seem that indistinct and partly obliterate film of memory begin at first slowly then rapidly to unroll form a vague panorama of my childhood day in georgium my mother break the spell by call I by name and say : this be you father father father that be the word which have be to I a source of doubt and perplexity ever since the interview with my mother on the subject how often i have wonder about my father who he be what he be like whether alive or dead and above all why she would not tell I about he more than once i have be on the point of recall to she the promise she have make I but i instinctively feel that she be happier for not tell I and that i be happier for not be tell yet i have not the slightest idea what the real truth be and here he stand before I just the kind of look father i have wishfully picture he to be but i make no advance toward he i stand there feel embarrassed and foolish not know what to say or do i be not sure but that he feel pretty much the same my mother stand at my side with one hand on my shoulder almost push I forward but i do not move i can well remember the look of disappointment even pain on she face and i can now understand that she could expect nothing else but that at the name father i should throw myself into he arm but i could not rise to this dramatic or better melodramatic climax somehow i could not arouse any considerable feeling of need for a father he break the awkward tableau by say : well boy be not you glad to see I he evidently mean the word kindly enough but i do not know what he could have say that would have have a worse effect however my good breeding come to my rescue and i answer : yes sir and go to he and offer he my hand he take my hand into one of he and with the other stroke my head say that i have grow into a fine youngster he ask I how old i be which of course he must have do merely to say something more or perhaps he do so as a test of my intelligence i reply : twelve sir he then make the trite observation about the flight of time and we lapse into another awkward pause my mother be all in smile i believe that be one of the happiest moment of she life either to put I more at ease or to show I off she ask I to play something for my father there be only one thing in the world that can make music at all time and under all circumstance up to its general standard that be a hand-organ or one of its variation i go to the piano and play something in a listless half-hearted way i simply be not in the mood i be wonder while play when my mother would dismiss I and let I go but my father be so enthusiastic in he praise that he touch my vanity -- which be great -- and more than that he display that sincere appreciation which always arouse a artist to he best effort and too in a unexplainable manner make he feel like shed tear i show my gratitude by play for he a chopin waltz with all the feeling that be in I when i have finish my mother 's eye be glisten with tear my father step across the room seize I in he arm and squeeze I to he breast i be certain that for that moment he be proud to be my father he sit and hold I stand between he knee while he talk to my mother i in the mean time examine he with more curiosity perhaps than politeness i interrupt the conversation by ask : mother be he go to stay with we now i find it impossible to frame the word father it be too new to I so i ask the question through my mother without wait for she to speak my father answer : i have get to go back to new york this afternoon but i be come to see you again i turn abruptly and go over to my mother and almost in a whisper remind she that i have a appointment which i should not miss to my pleasant surprise she say that she would give I something to eat at once so that i might go she go out of the room and i begin to gather from off the piano the music i need when i have finish my father who have be watch I ask : be you go i reply : yes sir i have get to go to practice for a concert he speak some word of advice to I about be a good boy and take care of my mother when i grow up and add that he be go to send I something nice from new york my mother call and i say good-bye to he and go out i see he only once after that i quickly swallow down what my mother have put on the table for I seize my cap and music and hurry off to my teacher 's house on the way i could think of nothing but this new father where he come from where he have be why he be here and why he would not stay in my mind i run over the whole list of father i have become acquaint with in my reading but i could not classify he the thought do not cross my mind that he be different from I and even if it have the mystery would not thereby have be explain for notwithstanding my changed relation with most of my schoolmate i have only a faint knowledge of prejudice and no idea at all how it ramify and affect we entire social organism i feel however that there be something about the whole affair which have to be hide when i arrive i find that she of the brown eye have be rehearse with my teacher and be on the point of leave my teacher with some expression of surprise ask why i be late and i stammer out the first deliberate lie of which i have any recollection i tell he that when i reach home from school i find my mother quite sick and that i have stay with she awhile before come then unnecessarily and gratuitously -- to give my word force of conviction i suppose -- i add : i do not think she 'll be with we very long in speak these word i must have be comical for i notice that my teacher instead of show sign of anxiety or sorrow half hide a smile but how little do i know that in that lie i be speak a prophecy she of the brown eye unpack she violin and we go through the duet several time i be soon lose to all other thought in the delight of music and love i see delight of love without reservation for at no time of life be love so pure so delicious so poetic so romantic as it be in boyhood a great deal have be say about the heart of a girl when she ' stand where the brook and river meet but what she feel be negative more interesting be the heart of a boy when just at the bud dawn of manhood he stand look wide-eyed into the long vista open before he when he first become conscious of the awakening and quicken of strange desire and unknown power when what he see and feel be still shadowy and mystical enough to be intangible and so more beautiful when he imagination be unsullied and he faith new and whole -- then it be that love wear a halo the man who have not love before he be fourteen have miss a foretaste of elysium when i reach home it be quite dark and i find my mother without a light sit rock in a chair as she so often use to do in my childhood day look into the fire and singing softly to herself i nestled close to she and with she arm round I she haltingly tell I who my father be -- a great man a fine gentleman -- he love I and love she very much he be go to make a great man of I : all she say be so limit by reserve and so color by she feeling that it be but half truth and so i do not yet fully understand iii perhaps i ought not pass on in this narrative without mention that the duet be a great success so great that we be oblige to respond with two encore it seem to I that life could hold no greater joy than it contain when i take she hand and we step down to the front of the stage bow to we enthusiastic audience when we reach the little dressing-room where the other performer be applaud as wildly as the audience she impulsively throw both she arm round I and kiss I while i struggle to get away one day a couple of week after my father have be to see we a wagon drive up to we cottage load with a big box i be about to tell the man on the wagon that they have make a mistake when my mother act darkly wise tell they to bring they load in she have they unpack the box and quickly there be evolve from the board paper and other packing material a beautiful brand-new upright piano then she inform I that it be a present to I from my father i at once sit down and run my finger over the key the full mellow tone of the instrument be ravishing i think almost remorsefully of how i have leave my father but even so there momentarily cross my mind a feeling of disappointment that the piano be not a grand the new instrument greatly increase the pleasure of my hour of study and practice at home shortly after this i be make a member of the boy ' choir it be find that i possess a clear strong soprano voice i enjoy the singing very much about a year later i begin the study of the pipe organ and the theory of music and before i finish the grammar school i have write out several simple prelude for organ which win the admiration of my teacher and which he do I the honor to play at service the older i grow the more think i give to the question of my mother 's and my position and what be we exact relation to the world in general my idea of the whole matter be rather hazy my study of united state history have be confine to those period which be designate in my book as discovery colonial revolutionary and constitutional i now begin to study about the civil war but the story be tell in such a condensed and skip style that i gain from it very little real information it be a marvel how child ever learn any history out of book of that sort and too i begin now to read the newspaper i often see article which arouse my curiosity but do not enlighten I but one day i draw from the circulate library a book that clear the whole mystery a book that i read with the same feverish intensity with which i have read the old bible story a book that give I my first perspective of the life i be enter that book be _ uncle tom 's cabin _ this work of harriet beecher stowe have be the object of much unfavorable criticism it have be assail not only as fiction of the most imaginative sort but as be a direct misrepresentation several successful attempt have lately be make to displace the book from northern school library its critic would brush it aside with the remark that there never be a negro as good as uncle tom nor a slave-holder as bad as legree for my part i be never a admirer of uncle tom nor of he type of goodness but i believe that there be lot of old negro as foolishly good as he the proof of which be that they knowingly stay and work the plantation that furnish sinew for the army which be fight to keep they enslaved but in these later year several case have come to my personal knowledge in which old negro have die and leave what be a considerable fortune to the descendant of they former master i do not think it take any great stretch of the imagination to believe there be a fairly large class of slave-holder typify in legree and we must also remember that the author depict a number of worthless if not vicious negro and a slave-holder who be as much of a christian and a gentleman as it be possible for one in he position to be that she picture the happy singing shuffling darky as well as the mother wail for she child sell down river i do not think it be claim too much to say that _ uncle tom 's cabin _ be a fair and truthful panorama of slavery however that may be it open my eye as to who and what i be and what my country consider I in fact it give I my bearing but there be no shock i take the whole revelation in a kind of stoical way one of the greatest benefit i derive from read the book be that i could afterwards talk frankly with my mother on all the question which have be vaguely troubling my mind as a result she be entirely free from reserve and often herself bring up the subject talking of thing directly touch she life and mine and of thing which have come down to she through the old folk what she tell I interested and even fascinate I and what may seem strange kindle in I a strong desire to see the south she speak to I quite frankly about herself my father and myself : she the sew girl of my father 's mother he a impetuous young man home from college i the child of this unsanctioned love she tell I even the principal reason for we come north my father be about to be marry to a young lady of another great southern family she do not neglect to add that another reason for we be in connecticut be that he intend to give I a education and make a man of I in none of she talk do she ever utter one word of complaint against my father she always endeavor to impress upon I how good he have be and still be and that he be all to we that custom and the law would allow she love he more she worship he and she die firmly believe that he love she more than any other woman in the world perhaps she be right who know all of these newly awaken idea and thought take the form of a definite aspiration on the day i graduate from the grammar school and what a day that be the girl in white dress with fresh ribbon in they hair the boy in new suit and creaky shoe the great crowd of parent and friend the flower the prize and congratulation make the day seem to I one of the greatest importance i be on the program and play a piano solo which be receive by the audience with that amount of applause which i have come to look upon as be only the just due of my talent but the real enthusiasm be arouse by shiny he be the principal speaker of the day and well do he measure up to the honor he make a striking picture that thin little black boy standing on the platform dress in clothes that do not fit he any too well he eye burn with excitement he shrill musical voice vibrate in tone of appeal defiance and he black face alight with such great intelligence and earnestness as to be positively handsome what be he thought when he step forward and look into that crowd of face all white with the exception of a score or so that be lose to view i do not know but i fancy he feel he loneliness i think there must have rush over he a feeling akin to that of a gladiator toss into the arena and bade to fight for he life i think that solitary little black figure standing there feel that for the particular time and place he bear the weight and responsibility of he race that for he to fail mean general defeat but he win and nobly he oration be wendell phillips 's toussaint l'ouverture a speech which may now be class as rhetorical -- even perhaps bombastic but as the word fall from shiny 's lip they effect be magical how so young a orator could stir so great enthusiasm be to be wonder at when in the famous peroration he voice tremble with suppress emotion rise higher and higher and then rest on the name toussaint l'ouverture it be like touch a electric button which loose the pent-up feeling of he listener they actually rise to he i have since know of color man who have be choose as class orator in we lead university of other who have play on the varsity football and baseball team of color speaker who have address great white audience in each of these instance i believe the man be stir by the same emotion which actuate shiny on the day of he graduation and too in each case where the effort have reach any high standard of excellence they have be follow by the same phenomenon of enthusiasm i think the explanation of the latter lie in what be a basic though often dormant principle of the anglo-saxon heart love of fair play shiny it be true be what be so common in he race a natural orator but i doubt that any white boy of equal talent could have work the same effect the sight of that boy gallantly wage with puny black arm so unequal a battle touch the deep spring in the heart of he audience and they be sweep by a wave of sympathy and admiration but the effect upon I of shiny 's speech be double i not only share the enthusiasm of he audience but he impart to I some of he own enthusiasm i feel leap within I pride that i be color and i begin to form wild dream of bring glory and honor to the negro race for day i could talk of nothing else with my mother except my ambition to be a great man a great colored man to reflect credit on the race and gain fame for myself it be not until year after that i formulate a definite and feasible plan for realize my dream i enter the high school with my class and still continue my study of the piano the pipe organ and the theory of music i have to drop out of the boy ' choir on account of a change voice this i regret very much as i grow older my love for reading grow stronger i read with studious interest everything i could find relate to color man who have gain prominence my hero have be king david then robert the bruce now frederick douglass be enshrine in the place of honor when i learn that alexandre duma be a color man i re-read _ monte cristo _ and _ the three guardsman _ with magnify pleasure i live between my music and book on the whole a rather unwholesome life for a boy to lead i dwelt in a world of imagination of dream and air castle -- the kind of atmosphere that sometimes nourish a genius more often man unfitted for the practical struggle of life i never play a game of ball never go fishing or learn to swim in fact the only outdoor exercise in which i take any interest be skate nevertheless though slender i grow well form and in perfect health after i enter the high school i begin to notice the change in my mother 's health which i suppose have be go on for some year she begin to complain a little and to cough a great deal she try several remedy and finally go to see a doctor but though she be fail in health she keep she spirit up she still do a great deal of sewing and in the busy season hire two woman to help she the purpose she have form of have I go through college without financial worry keep she at work when she be not fit for it i be so fortunate as to be able to organize a class of eight or ten beginner on the piano and so start a separate little fund of my own as the time for my graduation from the high school grow nearer the plan for my college career become the chief subject of we talk i send for catalogue of all the prominent school in the east and eagerly gather all the information i could concern they from different source my mother tell I that my father want I to go to harvard or yale she herself have a half desire for I to go to atlanta university and even have I write for a catalogue of that school there be two reason however that inclined she to my father 's choice the first that at harvard or yale i should be near she the second that my father have promise to pay for a part of my college education both shiny and red come to my house quite often of evening and we use to talk over we plan and prospects for the future sometimes i would play for they and they seem to enjoy the music very much my mother often prepared sundry southern dish for they which i be not sure but that they enjoy more shiny have a uncle in amherst mass and he expect to live with he and work he way through amherst college red declare that he have enough of school and that after he get he high school diploma he would get a position in a bank it be he ambition to become a banker and he feel sure of get the opportunity through certain member of he family my mother barely have strength to attend the closing exercise of the high school when i graduate and after that day she be seldom out of bed she could no longer direct she work and under the expense of medicine doctor and someone to look after she we college fund begin to diminish rapidly many of she customer and some of the neighbor be very kind and frequently bring she nourishment of one kind or another my mother realize what i do not that she be mortally ill and she have I write a long letter to my father for some time past she have hear from he only at irregular interval we never receive a answer in those last day i often sit at she bedside and read to she until she fall asleep sometimes i would leave the parlor door open and play on the piano just loud enough for the music to reach she this she always enjoy one night near the end of July after i have be watch beside she for some hour i go into the parlor and throw myself into the big arm chair doze off into a fitful sleep i be suddenly arouse by one of the neighbor who have come in to sit with she that night she say : come to you mother at once i hurry upstairs and at the bedroom door meet the woman who be act as nurse i note with a dissolve heart the strange look of awe on she face from my first glance at my mother i discern the light of death upon she countenance i fall upon my knee beside the bed and bury my face in the sheet sob convulsively she die with the finger of she left hand entwine in my hair i will not rake over this one of the two sacred sorrow of my life nor could i describe the feeling of unutterable loneliness that fall upon I after the funeral i go to the house of my music teacher he have kindly offer I the hospitality of he home for so long as i might need it a few day later i move my trunk piano my music and most of my book to he home the rest of my book i divide between shiny and red some of the household effect i give to shiny 's mother and to two or three of the neighbor who have be kind to we during my mother 's illness the other i sell after settle up my little estate i find that besides a good supply of clothes a piano some book and trinket i have about two hundred dollar in cash the question of what i be to do now confront I my teacher suggest a concert tour but both of we realize that i be too old to be exploit as a infant prodigy and too young and inexperienced to go before the public as a finish artist he however insist that the people of the town would generously patronize a benefit concert so he take up the matter and make arrangement for such a entertainment a more than sufficient number of people with musical and elocutionary talent volunteer they service to make a program among these be my brown-eyed violinist but we relation be not the same as they be when we have play we first duet together a year or so after that time she have deal I a crush blow by get married i be partially avenge however by the fact that though she be grow more beautiful she be lose she ability to play the violin i be down on the program for one number my selection might have appear at that particular time as a bit of affectation but i consider it deeply appropriate i play beethoven 's sonata pathtique when i sit down at the piano and glance into the face of the several hundred of people who be there solely on account of love or sympathy for I emotion swell in my heart which enable I to play the pathtique as i could never again play it when the last tone die away the few who begin to applaud be hush by the silence of the other and for once i play without receive a encore the benefit yield I a little more than two hundred dollar thus raise my cash capital to about four hundred dollar i still hold to my determination of go to college so it be now a question of try to squeeze through a year at harvard or go to atlanta where the money i have would pay my actual expense for at least two year the peculiar fascination which the south hold over my imagination and my limited capital decide I in favor of atlanta university so about the last of September i bade farewell to the friend and scene of my boyhood and board a train for the south iv the farther i get below washington the more disappointed i become in the appearance of the country i peer through the car window look in vain for the luxuriant semi-tropical scenery which i have picture in my mind i do not find the grass so green nor the wood so beautiful nor the flower so plentiful as they be in connecticut instead the red earth partly cover by tough scrawny grass the muddy straggle road the cottage of unpainted pine board and the clay-daubed hut impart a burn up impression occasionally we run through a little white and green village that be like a oasis in a desert when i reach atlanta my steadily increase disappointment be not lessen i find it a big dull red town this dull red color of that part of the south i be then see have much i think to do with the extreme depression of my spirit -- no public square no fountain dingy street-car and with the exception of three or four principal thoroughfare unpaved street it be rain when i arrive and some of these unpaved street be absolutely impassable wheel sink to the hub in red mire and i actually stand for a hour and watch four or five man work to save a mule which have step into a deep sink from drown or rather suffocate in the mud the atlanta of today be a new city on the train i have talk with one of the pullman car porter a bright young fellow who be himself a student and tell he that i be go to atlanta to attend school i have also ask he to tell I where i might stop for a day or two until the university open he say i might go with he to the place where he stop during he lay-over in atlanta i gladly accept he offer and go with he along one of those muddy street until we come to a rather rickety look frame house which we enter the proprietor of the house be a big fat greasy-looking brown-skin man when i ask he if he could give I accommodation he want to know how long i would stay i tell he perhaps two day not more than three in reply he say : oh dat 's all right den at the same time lead the way up a pair of creaky stair i follow he and the porter to a room the door of which the proprietor open while continue it seem he remark oh dat 's all right den by add : you kin sleep in dat cot in de corner der fifty cent please the porter interrupt by say : you need not collect from he now he be get a trunk this seem to satisfy the man and he go down leave I and my porter friend in the room i glance around the apartment and see that it contain a double bed and two cot two wash-stand three chair and a time-worn bureau with a looking-glass that would have make adoni appear hideous i look at the cot in which i be to sleep and suspect not without good reason that i should not be the first to use the sheet and pillow-case since they have last come from the wash when i thought of the clean tidy comfortable surroundings in which i have be rear a wave of homesickness sweep over I that make I feel faint have it not be for the presence of my companion and that i know this much of he history -- that he be not yet quite twenty just three year older than myself and that he have be fight he own way in the world earn he own living and provide for he own education since he be fourteen -- i should not have be able to stop the tear that be well up in my eye i ask he why it be that the proprietor of the house seem unwilling to accommodate I for more than a couple of day he inform I that the man run a lodging house especially for pullman porter and as they stay in town be not longer than one or two night it would interfere with he arrangement to have anyone stay longer he go on to say : you see this room be fix up to accommodate four man at a time well by keep a sort of table of trip in and out of the man and work they like checkers he can accommodate fifteen or sixteen in each week and generally avoid have a empty bed you happen to catch a bed that would have be empty for a couple of night i ask he where he be go to sleep he answer : i sleep in that other cot tonight tomorrow night i go out he go on to tell I that the man who keep the house do not serve meal and that if i be hungry we would go out and get something to eat we go into the street and in pass the railroad station i hire a wagon to take my trunk to my lodging place we pass along until finally we turn into a street that stretch away up and down hill for a mile or two and here i catch my first sight of color people in large number i have see little squad around the railroad station on my way south but here i see a street crowd with they they fill the shop and throng the sidewalk and line the curb i ask my companion if all the color people in atlanta live in this street he say they do not and assure I that the one i saw be of the lower class i feel relieved in spite of the size of the lower class the unkempt appearance the shambling slouch gait and loud talk and laughter of these people arouse in I a feeling of almost repulsion only one thing about they awake a feeling of interest that be they dialect i have read some negro dialect and have hear snatch of it on my journey down from washington but here i hear it in all of its fullness and freedom i be particularly strike by the way in which it be punctuate by such exclamatory phrase as lawd a mussy g ` wan man bless ma soul look heah chile these people talk and laugh without restraint in fact they talk straight from they lung and laugh from the pit of they stomach and this hearty laughter be often justified by the droll humor of some remark i pause long enough to hear one man say to another : wat 's de mattah wid you a ' yo ' fr ` en ' sam and the other come back like a flash : ma fr ` en ' he ma fr ` en ' man i would go to he funeral je ' de same as i would go to a minstrel show i have since learn that this ability to laugh heartily be in part the salvation of the american negro it do much to keep he from go the way of the indian the business place of the street along which we be pass consist chiefly of low bar cheap dry-goods and notion store barber shop and fish and bread restaurant we at length turn down a pair of stair that lead to a basement and i find myself in a eating-house somewhat better than those i have see in pass but that do not mean much for its excellence the place be smoky the table be cover with oilcloth the floor with sawdust and from the kitchen come a rancid odor of fish fry over several time which almost nauseate I i ask my companion if this be the place where we be to eat he inform I that it be the best place in town where a color man could get a meal i then want to know why somebody do not open a place where respectable color people who have money could be accommodate he answer : it would not pay all the respectable colored people eat at home and the few who travel generally have friend in the town to which they go who entertain they he add : of course you could go in any place in the city they would not know you from white i sit down with the porter at one of the table but be not hungry enough to eat with any relish what be put before I the food be not badly cook but the iron knife and fork need to be scrub the plate and dish and glass need to be wash and well dry i minced over what i take on my plate while my companion eat when we finish we pay the waiter twenty cent each and go out we walk around until the light of the city be light then the porter say that he must get to bed and have some rest as he have not have six hour ' sleep since he leave jersey city i go back to we lodge house with he when i awake in the morning there be besides my new-found friend two other man in the room asleep in the double bed i get up and dress myself very quietly so as not to awake anyone i then draw from under the pillow my precious roll of greenback take out a ten-dollar bill and very softly unlock my trunk put the remainder about three hundred dollar in the inside pocket of a coat near the bottom glad of the opportunity to put it unobserved in a place of safety when i have carefully lock my trunk i tiptoe toward the door with the intention of go out to look for a decent restaurant where i might get something fit to eat as i be ease the door open my porter friend say with a yawn : hello you be go out i answer he : yes oh he yawn again i guess i have have enough sleep wait a minute i 'll go with you for the instant he friendship bore and embarrass I i have vision of another meal in the greasy restaurant of the day before he must have divine my thought for he go on to say : i know a woman across town who take a few boarder i think we can go over there and get a good breakfast with a feeling of mingled fear and doubt regard what the breakfast might be i wait until he have dress himself when i see the neat appearance of the cottage we enter my fear vanish and when i see the woman who keep it my doubt follow the same course scrupulously clean in a spotless white apron and color head-handkerchief she round face beam with motherly kindness she be picturesquely beautiful she impress I as one broad expanse of happiness and good nature in a few minute she be address I as chile and honey she make I feel as though i should like to lay my head on she capacious bosom and go to sleep and the breakfast simple as it be i could not have have at any restaurant in atlanta at any price there be fry chicken as it be fry only in the south hominy boil to the consistency where it could be eat with a fork and biscuit so light and flaky that a fellow with any appetite at all would have no difficulty in dispose of eight or ten when i have finish i feel that i have experience the realization of at least one of my dream of southern life during the meal we find out from we hostess who have two boy in school that atlanta university open on that very day i have somehow mixed my date my friend the porter suggest that i go out to the university at once and offer to walk over and show I the way we have to walk because although the university be not more than twenty minute ' distance from the center of the city there be no street-car run in that direction my first sight of the school grounds make I feel that i be not far from home here the red hill have be terraced and cover with green grass clean gravel walk well shaded lead up to the building indeed it be a bit of new england transplant at the gate my companion say he would bid I good-by because it be likely that he would not see I again before he car go out he tell I that he would make two more trip to atlanta and that he would come out and see I that after he second trip he would leave the pullman service for the winter and return to school in nashville we shake hand i thank he for all he kindness and we say good-by i walk up to a group of student and make some inquiry they direct I to the president 's office in the main building the president give I a cordial welcome it be more than cordial he talk to I not as the official head of a college but as though he be adopt I into what be he large family personally to look after my general welfare as well as my education he seem especially please with the fact that i have come to they all the way from the north he tell I that i could have come to the school as soon as i have reach the city and that i have better move my trunk out at once i gladly promise he that i would do so he then call a boy and direct he to take I to the matron and to show I around afterwards i find the matron even more motherly than the president be fatherly she have I register which be in effect to sign a pledge to abstain from the use of intoxicate beverage tobacco and profane language while i be a student in the school this act cause I no sacrifice as up to that time i be free from all three habit the boy who be with I then show I about the grounds i be especially interested in the industrial building the sound of a bell he tell I be the signal for the student to gather in the general assembly hall and he ask I if i would go of course i would there be between three and four hundred student and perhaps all of the teacher gather in the room i notice that several of the latter be color the president give a talk address principally to newcomer but i scarcely hear what he say i be so much occupy in look at those around I they be of all type and color the more intelligent type predominate the color range from jet black to pure white with light hair and eye among the girl especially there be many so fair that it be difficult to believe that they have negro blood in they and too i could not help notice that many of the girl particularly those of the delicate brown shades with black eye and wavy dark hair be decidedly pretty among the boy many of the blackest be fine specimen of young manhood tall straight and muscular with magnificent head these be the kind of boy who develop into the patriarchal uncle of the old slave regime when i leave the university it be with the determination to get my trunk and move out to the school before night i walk back across the city with a light step and a light heart i feel perfectly satisfy with life for the first time since my mother 's death in pass the railroad station i hire a wagon and ride with the driver as far as my stopping-place i settle with my landlord and go upstairs to put away several article i have leave out as soon as i open my trunk a dart of suspicion shot through my heart the arrangement of thing do not look familiar i begin to dig down excitedly to the bottom till i reach the coat in which i have conceal my treasure my money be go every single bill of it i know it be useless to do so but i search through every other coat every pair of trousers every vest and even each pair of sock when i have finish my fruitless search i sit down dazed and heartsick i call the landlord up and inform he of my loss he comfort I by say that i ought to have better sense than to keep money in a trunk and that he be not responsible for he lodger ' personal effect he cooling word bring I enough to my sens to cause I to look and see if anything else be miss several small article be go among they a black and gray necktie of odd design upon which my heart be set almost as much as the loss of my money i feel the loss of my tie after think for a while as best i could i wisely decide to go at once back to the university and lay my trouble before the president i rush breathlessly back to the school as i near the grounds the thought come across I would not my story sound fishy would it not place I in the position of a impostor or beggar what right have i to worry these busy people with the result of my carelessness if the money could not be recover and i doubt that it could what good would it do to tell they about it the shame and embarrassment which the whole situation give I cause I to stop at the gate i pause undecided for a moment then turn and slowly retrace my step and so change the whole course of my life if the reader have never be in a strange city without money or friend it be useless to try to describe what my feeling be he could not understand if he have be it be equally useless for he understand more than word could convey when i reach my lodgings i find in the room one of the porter who have sleep there the night before when he hear what misfortune have befall I he offer many word of sympathy and advice he ask I how much money i have leave i tell he that i have ten or twelve dollar in my pocket he say : that will not last you very long here and you will hardly be able to find anything to do in atlanta i 'll tell you what you do go down to jacksonville and you will not have any trouble to get a job in one of the big hotel there or in st augustine i thank he but intimate my doubt of be able to get to jacksonville on the money i have he reassure I by say : oh that be all right you express you trunk on through and i 'll take you down in my closet i thank he again not know then what it be to travel in a pullman porter 's closet he put I under a deeper debt of gratitude by lend I fifteen dollar which he say i could pay back after i have secure work he generosity bring tear to my eye and i conclude that after all there be some kind heart in the world i now forget my trouble in the hurry and excitement of get my trunk off in time to catch the train which go out at seven o'clock i even forget that i have not eat anything since morning we get a wagon -- the porter go with I -- and take my trunk to the express office my new friend then tell I to come to the station at about a quarter of seven and walk straight to the car where i should see he stand and not to lose my nerve i find my role not so difficult to play as i think it would be because the train do not leave from the central station but from a smaller one where there be no gate and guard to pass i follow direction and the porter take I on he car and lock I in he closet in a few minute the train pull out for jacksonville i may live to be a hundred year old but i shall never forget the agony i suffer that night i spend twelve hour double up in the porter 's basket for soil linen not be able to straighten up on account of the shelf for clean linen just over my head the air be hot and suffocating and the smell of damp towel and use linen be sicken at each lurch of the car over the none-too-smooth track i be bump and bruise against the narrow wall of my narrow compartment i become acutely conscious of the fact that i have not eat for hour then nausea take possession of I and at one time i have grave doubt about reach my destination alive if i have the trip to make again i should prefer to walk v the next morning i get out of the car at jacksonville with a stiff and ache body i determine to ask no more porter not even my benefactor about stopping-place so i find myself on the street not know where to go i walk along listlessly until i meet a color man who have the appearance of a preacher i ask he if he could direct I to a respectable boarding-house for color people he say that if i walk along with he in the direction he be go he would show I such a place : i turn and walk at he side he prove to be a minister and ask I a great many direct question about myself i answer as many as i see fit to answer the other i evade or ignore at length we stop in front of a frame house and my guide inform I that it be the place a woman be stand in the doorway and he call to she say that he have bring she a new boarder i thank he for he trouble and after he have urge upon I to attend he church while i be in the city he go on he way i go in and find the house neat and not uncomfortable the parlor be furnish with cane-bottomed chair each of which be adorn with a white crocheted tidy the mantel over the fireplace have a white crocheted cover a marble-topped center table hold a lamp a photograph album and several trinket each of which be set upon a white crocheted mat there be a cottage organ in a corner of the room and i note that the lamp-rack upon it be cover with white crocheted mat there be a mat on the floor but a white crocheted carpet would not have be out of keep i make arrangement with the landlady for my board and lodge the amount be i think three dollar and a half a week she be a rather fine-looking stout brown-skin woman of about forty year of age she husband be a light-colored cuban a man about one half she size and one whose age could not be guess from he appearance he be small in size but a handsome black mustache and typical spanish eye redeem he from insignificance i be in time for breakfast and at the table i have the opportunity to see my fellow boarder there be eight or ten of they two as i afterwards learn be color american all of they be cigar maker and work in one of the large factory -- cigar making be one trade in which the color line be not draw the conversation be carry on entirely in spanish and my ignorance of the language subject I more to alarm than embarrassment i have never hear such uproarious conversation everybody talk at once loud exclamation roll _ caramba _ menacing gesticulation with knife fork and spoon i look every moment for the clash of blow one man be emphasize he remark by flourish a cup in he hand seemingly forgetful of the fact that it be nearly full of hot coffee he end by empty it over what be relatively the only quiet man at the table except myself bring from he a volley of language which make the other appear dumb by comparison i soon learn that in all of this clatter of voice and table utensil they be discuss purely ordinary affair and argue about mere trifle and that not the least ill feeling be arouse it be not long before i enjoy the spirited chatter and _ badinage _ at the table as much as i do my meal -- and the meal be not bad i spend the afternoon in look around the town the street be sandy but be well-shaded by fine oak tree and far preferable to the clay road of atlanta one or two public square with green grass and tree give the city a touch of freshness that night after supper i speak to my landlady and she husband about my intention they tell I that the big winter hotel would not open within two month it can easily be imagine what effect this news have on I i speak to they frankly about my financial condition and related the main fact of my misfortune in atlanta i modestly mention my ability to teach music and ask if there be any likelihood of my be able to get some scholar my landlady suggest that i speak to the preacher who have show I she house she feel sure that through he influence i should be able to get up a class in piano she add however that the color people be poor and that the general price for music lesson be only twenty-five cent i notice that the thought of my teaching white pupil do not even remotely enter she mind none of this information make my prospects look much brighter the husband who up to this time have allow the woman to do most of the talk give I the first bit of tangible hope he say that he could get I a job as a stripper in the factory where he work and that if i succeed in get some music pupil i could teach a couple of they every night and so make a living until something better turn up he go on to say that it would not be a bad thing for I to stay at the factory and learn my trade as a cigar maker and impressed on I that for a young man knock about the country a trade be a handy thing to have i determine to accept he offer and thank he heartily in fact i become enthusiastic not only because i see a way out of my financial trouble but also because i be eager and curious over the new experience i be about to enter i want to know all about the cigar make business this narrow the conversation down to the husband and myself so the wife go in and leave we talk he be what be call a _ regalia _ workman and earn from thirty-five to forty dollar a week he generally work a sixty-dollar job that be he make cigar for which he be pay at the rate of sixty dollar per thousand it be impossible for he to make a thousand in a week because he have to work very carefully and slowly each cigar be make entirely by hand each piece of filler and each wrapper have to be select with care he be able to make a bundle of one hundred cigar in a day not one of which could be tell from the other by any difference in size or shape or even by any appreciable difference in weight this be the acme of artistic skill in cigar make workman of this class be rare never more than three or four in one factory and it be never necessary for they to remain out of work there be man who make two three and four hundred cigar of the cheaper grade in a day they have to be very fast in order to make a decent week 's wages cigar making be a rather independent trade the man go to work when they pleased and knock off when they feel like do so as a class the workman be careless and improvident some very rapid maker would not work more than three or four day out of the week and there be other who never show up at the factory on monday stripper be the boy who pull the long stem from the tobacco leave after they have serve at that work for a certain time they be give table as apprentice all of this be interesting to I and we drift along in conversation until my companion strike the subject nearest he heart the independence of cuba he be a exile from the island and a prominent member of the jacksonville junta every week sum of money be collect from junta all over the country this money go to buy arm and ammunition for the insurgent as the man sit there nervously smoke he long green cigar and tell I of the gmezes both the white one and the black one of maco and bandera he grow positively eloquent he also show that he be a man of considerable education and reading he speak english excellently and frequently surprise I by use word one would hardly expect from a foreigner the first one of this class of word he employ almost shocked I and i never forget it 'twa ramify we sit on the piazza until after ten o'clock when we arise to go in to bed it be with the understanding that i should start in the factory on the next day i begin work the next morning seat at a barrel with another boy who show I how to strip the stem from the leaf to smooth out each half leaf and to put the rights together in one pile and the left together in another pile on the edge of the barrel my finger strong and sensitive from they long training be well adapt to this kind of work and within two week i be account the fastest stripper in the factory at first the heavy odor of the tobacco almost sicken I but when i become accustomed to it i like the smell i be now earn four dollar a week and be soon able to pick up a couple more by teach a few scholar at night whom i have secure through the good office of the preacher i have meet on my first morning in jacksonville at the end of about three month through my skill as a stripper and the influence of my landlord i be advance to a table and begin to learn my trade in fact more than my trade for i learn not only to make cigar but also to smoke to swear and to speak spanish i discover that i have a talent for language as well as for music the rapidity and ease with which i acquire spanish astonish my associate in a short time i be able not only to understand most of what be say at the table during meal but to join in the conversation i buy a method for learn the spanish language and with the aid of my landlord as a teacher by constant practice with my fellow workman and by regularly read the cuban newspaper and finally some book of standard spanish literature which be at the house i be able in less than a year to speak like a native in fact it be my pride that i speak better spanish than many of the cuban workman at the factory after i have be in the factory a little over a year i be repay for all the effort i have put forth to learn spanish by be select as reader the reader be quite a institution in all cigar factory which employ spanish-speaking workman he sit in the center of the large room in which the cigar maker work and read to they for a certain number of hour each day all the important news from the papers and whatever else he may consider would be interesting he often select a exciting novel and read it in daily installment he must of course have a good voice but he must also have a reputation among the man for intelligence for be well-posted and have in he head a stock of varied information he be generally the final authority on all argument which arise and in a cigar factory these argument be many and frequent range from the respective and relative merit of rival baseball club to the duration of the sun 's light and energy -- cigar making be a trade in which talk do not interfere with work my position as reader not only release I from the rather monotonous work of roll cigar and give I something more in accord with my taste but also add considerably to my income i be now earn about twenty-five dollar a week and be able to give up my peripatetic method of give music lesson i hire a piano and teach only those who could arrange to take they lesson where i live i finally give up teaching entirely as what i make scarcely pay for my time and trouble i keep the piano however in order to keep up my own study and occasionally i play at some church concert or other charitable entertainment through my music teaching and my not absolutely irregular attendance at church i become acquaint with the best class of color people in jacksonville this be really my entrance into the race it be my initiation into what i have term the freemasonry of the race i have formulate a theory of what it be to be color now i be get the practice the novelty of my position cause I to observe and consider thing which i think entirely escape the young man i associate with or at least be so commonplace to they as not to attract they attention and of many of the impression which come to I then i have realize the full import only within the past few year since i have have a broader knowledge of man and history and a fuller comprehension of the tremendous struggle which be go on between the race in the south it be a struggle for though the black man fight passively he nevertheless fight and he passive resistance be more effective at present than active resistance could possibly be he bear the fury of the storm as do the willow tree it be a struggle for though the white man of the south may be too proud to admit it he be nevertheless use in the contest he best energy he be devote to it the greater part of he thought and much of he endeavor the south today stand panting and almost breathless from its exertion and how the scene of the struggle have shift the battle be first wage over the right of the negro to be class as a human be with a soul later as to whether he have sufficient intellect to master even the rudiment of learning and today it be be fight out over he social recognition i say somewhere in the early part of this narrative that because the color man look at everything through the prism of he relationship to society as a _ color _ man and because most of he mental effort run through the narrow channel bound by he rights and he wrong it be to be wonder at that he have progress so broadly as he have the same thing may be say of the white man of the south most of he mental effort run through one narrow channel he life as a man and a citizen many of he financial activity and all of he political activity be impassably limit by the ever present negro question i be sure it would be safe to wager that no group of southern white man could get together and talk for sixty minute without bring up the race question if a northern white man happen to be in the group the time could be safely cut to thirty minute in this respect i consider the condition of the whites more to be deplore than that of the black here a truly great people a people that produce a majority of the great historic american from washington to lincoln now force to use up its energy in a conflict as lamentable as it be violent i shall give the observation i make in jacksonville as see through the light of after year and they apply generally to every southern community the color people may be say to be roughly divide into three class not so much in respect to themselves as in respect to they relation with the whites there be those constitute what might be call the desperate class -- the man who work in the lumber and turpentine camp the ex-convict the bar-room loafer be all in this class these man conform to the requirement of civilization much as a trained lion with low muttered growl go through he stunt under the crack of the trainer 's whip they cherish a sullen hatred for all white man and they value life as cheap i have hear more than one of they say : i 'll go to hell for the first white man that bother I many who have express that sentiment have keep they word and it be that fact which give such prominence to this class for in number it be only a small proportion of the color people but it often dominate public opinion concern the whole race happily this class represent the black people of the south far below they normal physical and moral condition but in its increase lie the possibility of grave danger i be sure there be no more urgent work before the white south not only for its present happiness but for its future safety than the decrease of this class of black and it be not at all a hopeless class for these man be but the creature of condition as much so as the slum and criminal element of all the great city of the world be creature of condition decrease they number by shooting and burn they off will not be successful for these man be truly desperate and thought of death however terrible have little effect in deter they from act the result of hatred or degeneracy this class of black hate everything cover by a white skin and in return they be loathe by the whites the whites regard they just about as a man would a vicious mule a thing to be work drive and beat and kill for kick the second class as regard the relation between black and whites comprise the servant the washerwoman the waiter the cook the coachman and all who be connect with the whites by domestic service these may be generally characterize as simple kind-hearted and faithful not over-fine in they moral deduction but intensely religious and relatively -- such matter can be judge only relatively -- about as honest and wholesome in they life as any other grade of society any white person be good who treat they kindly and they love he for that kindness in return the white people with whom they have to do regard they with indulgent affection they come into close daily contact with the whites and may be call the connect link between whites and black in fact it be through they that the whites know the rest of they color neighbor between this class of the black and the whites there be little or no friction the third class be compose of the independent workman and tradesman and of the well-to-do and educate colored people and strange to say for a directly opposite reason they be as far remove from the whites as the member of the first class i mention these people live in a little world of they own in fact i conclude that if a color man want to separate himself from he white neighbor he have but to acquire some money education and culture and to live in accordance for example the proudest and fairest lady in the south could with propriety -- and it be what she would most likely do -- go to the cabin of aunt mary she cook if aunt mary be sick and minister to she comfort with she own hand but if mary 's daughter eliza a girl who use to run round my lady 's kitchen but who have receive a education and marry a prosperous young color man be at death 's door my lady would no more think of cross the threshold of eliza 's cottage than she would of go into a bar-room for a drink i be walk down the street one day with a young man who be bear in jacksonville but have be away to prepare himself for a professional life we pass a young white man and my companion say to I : you see that young man we grow up together we have play hunt and fish together we have even eat and sleep together and now since i have come back home he barely speak to I the fact that the whites of the south despise and ill-treat the desperate class of black be not only explainable accord to the ancient law of human nature but it be not nearly so serious or important as the fact that as the progressive colored people advance they constantly widen the gulf between themselves and they white neighbor i think that the white people somehow feel that color people who have education and money who wear good clothes and live in comfortable house be put on air that they do these thing for the sole purpose of spite the white folk or be at best go through a sort of monkey-like imitation of course such feeling can only cause irritation or breed disgust it seem that the whites have not yet be able to realize and understand that these people in strive to better they physical and social surroundings in accordance with they financial and intellectual progress be simply obey a impulse which be common to human nature the world over i be in grave doubt as to whether the greater part of the friction in the south be cause by the whites ' have a natural antipathy to negro as a race or a acquire antipathy to negro in certain relation to themselves however that may be there be to my mind no more pathetic side of this many-sided question than the isolate position into which be force the very color people who most need and who could best appreciate sympathetic cooperation and they position grow tragic when the effort be make to couple they whether or no with the negro of the first class i mention this latter class of color people be well-disposed towards the whites and always willing to meet they more than halfway they however feel keenly any injustice or gross discrimination and generally show they resentment the effort be sometimes make to convey the impression that the better class of color people fight against ride in jim crow car because they want to ride with white people or object to be with humbler member of they own race the truth be they object to the humiliation of be force to ride in a _ particular _ car aside from the fact that that car be distinctly inferior and that they be require to pay full first-class fare to say that the whites be force to ride in the superior car be less than a joke and too odd as it may sound refined color people get no more pleasure out of ride with offensive negro than anybody else would get i can realize more fully than i could year ago that the position of the advanced element of the color race be often very try they be the one among the black who carry the entire weight of the race question it worry the other very little and i believe the only thing which at time sustain they be that they know that they be in the right on the other hand this class of color people get a good deal of pleasure out of life they existence be far from be one long groan about they condition out of a chaos of ignorance and poverty they have evolve a social life of which they need not be ashamed in city where the professional and well-to-do class be large they have form society -- society as discriminate as the actual condition will allow it to be i should say perhaps society possess discriminate tendency which become rule as fast as actual condition allow this statement will i know sound preposterous even ridiculous to some person but as this class of color people be the least know of the race it be not surprising these social circle be connect throughout the country and a person in good standing in one city be readily accept in another one who be on the outside will often find it a difficult matter to get in i know personally of one case in which money to the extent of thirty or forty thousand dollar and a fine house not back up by a good reputation after several year of repeat effort fail to gain entry for the possessor these people have they dance and dinner and card party they musical and they literary society the woman attend social affair dress in good taste and the man in dress suit which they own and the reader will make a mistake to confound these entertainment with the bellman 's ball and whitewasher ' picnic and lime-kiln club with which the humorous press of the country illustrate cullud sassiety jacksonville when i be there be a small town and the number of educate and well-to-do color people be small so this society phase of life do not equal what i have since see in boston washington richmond and nashville and it be upon what i have more recently see in these city that i have make the observation just above however there be many comfortable and pleasant home in jacksonville to which i be often invite i belong to the literary society -- at which we generally discuss the race question -- and attend all of the church festival and other charitable entertainment in this way i pass three year which be not at all the least enjoyable of my life in fact my joy take such a exuberant turn that i fall in love with a young school teacher and begin to have dream of matrimonial bliss but another turn in the course of my life bring these dream to a end i do not wish to mislead my reader into think that i lead a life in jacksonville which would make copy for the hero of a sunday-school library book i be a hail fellow well meet with all of the workman at the factory most of whom know little and care less about social distinction from they example i learn to be careless about money and for that reason i constantly postpone and finally abandon return to atlanta university it seem impossible for I to save as much as two hundred dollar several of the man at the factory be my intimate friend and i frequently join they in they pleasure during the summer month we go almost every Monday on a excursion to a seaside resort call pablo beach these excursion be always crowd there be a dancing pavilion a great deal of drinking and generally a fight or two to add to the excitement i also contract the cigar maker 's habit of ride around in a hack on Sunday afternoon i sometimes go with my cigar maker friend to public ball that be give at a large hall on one of the main street i learn to take a drink occasionally and pay for quite a number that my friend take but strong liquor never appeal to my appetite i drink they only when the company i be in require it and suffer for it afterwards on the whole though i be a bit wild i can not remember that i ever do anything disgraceful or as the usual standard for young man go anything to forfeit my claim to respectability at one of the first public ball i attend i see the pullman car porter who have so kindly assist I in get to jacksonville i go immediately to one of my factory friend and borrow fifteen dollar with which to repay the loan my benefactor have make I after i have give he the money and be thank he i notice that he wear what be at least a exact duplicate of my lament black and gray tie it be somewhat worn but distinct enough for I to trace the same odd design which have first attract my eye this be enough to arouse my strongest suspicion but whether it be sufficient for the law to take cognizance of i do not consider my astonishment and the ironical humor of the situation drive everything else out of my mind these ball be attend by a great variety of people they be generally give by the waiter of some one of the big hotel and be often patronize by a number of hotel guest who come to see the sight the crowd be always noisy but good-natured there be much quadrille-dancing and a strong-lunged man call figure in a voice which do not confine itself to the limit of the hall it be not worth the while for I to describe in detail how these people act they conduct themselves in about the same manner as i have see other people at similar ball conduct themselves when one have see something of the world and human nature one must conclude after all that between people in like station of life there be very little difference the world over however it be at one of these ball that i first see the cake-walk there be a contest for a gold watch to be award to the hotel head-waiter receive the greatest number of vote there be some dancing while the vote be be count then the floor be clear for the cake-walk a half-dozen guest from some of the hotel take seat on the stage to act as judge and twelve or fourteen couple begin to walk for a sure enough highly decorate cake which be in plain evidence the spectator crowd about the space reserve for the contestant and watch they with interest and excitement the couple do not walk round in a circle but in a square with the man on the inside the fine point to be consider be the bearing of the man the precision with which they turn the corner the grace of the woman and the ease with which they swing around the pivot the man walk with stately and soldierly step and the woman with considerable grace the judge arrive at they decision by a process of elimination the music and the walk continue for some minute then both be stop while the judge confer when the walk begin again several couple be leave out in this way the contest be finally narrow down to three or four couple then the excitement become intense there be much partisan cheer as one couple or another would execute a turn in extra elegant style when the cake be finally award the spectator be about evenly divide between those who cheer the winner and those who mutter about the unfairness of the judge this be the cake-walk in its original form and it be what the color performer on the theatrical stage develop into the prance movement now know all over the world and which some parisian critic pronounce the acme of poetic motion there be a great many color people who be ashamed of the cake-walk but i think they ought to be proud of it it be my opinion that the color people of this country have do four thing which refute the oft-advanced theory that they be a absolutely inferior race which demonstrate that they have originality and artistic conception and what be more the power of create that which can influence and appeal universally the first two of these be the uncle remus story collect by joel chandler harri and the jubilee song to which the fisk singer make the public and the skilled musician of both america and europe listen the other two be ragtime music and the cake-walk no one who have travel can question the world-conquering influence of ragtime and i do not think it would be a exaggeration to say that in europe the united state be popularly know better by ragtime than by anything else it have produce in a generation in pari they call it american music the newspaper have already tell how the practice of intricate cake-walk step have take up the time of european royalty and nobility these be lower form of art but they give evidence of a power that will some day be apply to the higher form in this measure at least and aside from the number of prominent individual the color people of the united state have produce the race have be a world influence and all of the indian between alaska and patagonium have not do as much just when i be begin to look upon jacksonville as my permanent home and be begin to plan about marry the young school teacher raise a family and work in a cigar factory the rest of my life for some reason which i do not now remember the factory at which i work be indefinitely shut down some of the man get work in other factory in town some decide to go to key west and tampa other make up they mind to go to new york for work all at once a desire like a fever seize I to see the north again and i cast my lot with those bind for new york vi we steam up into new york harbor late one afternoon in spring the last effort of the sun be be put forth in turn the water of the bay to glisten gold the green island on either side in spite of they warlike mounting look calm and peaceful the building of the town shine out in a reflect light which give the city a air of enchantment and truly it be a enchanted spot new york city be the most fatally fascinating thing in america she sit like a great witch at the gate of the country show she alluring white face and hide she crooked hand and foot under the fold of she wide garment -- constantly entice thousand from far within and tempting those who come from across the sea to go no farther and all these become the victim of she caprice some she at once crush beneath she cruel foot other she condemn to a fate like that of galley slave a few she favor and fondle ride they high on the bubble of fortune then with a sudden breath she blow the bubble out and laugh mockingly as she watch they fall twice i have pass through it but this be really my first visit to new york and as i walk about that evening i begin to feel the dread power of the city the crowd the light the excitement the gaiety and all its subtler stimulating influence begin to take effect upon I my blood run quicker and i feel that i be just begin to live to some nature this stimulant of life in a great city become a thing as binding and necessary as opium be to one addict to the habit it become they breath of life they can not exist outside of it rather than be deprive of it they be content to suffer hunger want pain and misery they would not exchange even a ragged and wretched condition among the great crowd for any degree of comfort away from it as soon as we land four of we go directly to a lodging house in twenty-seventh street just west of sixth avenue the house be run by a short stout mulatto man who be exceedingly talkative and inquisitive in fifteen minute he not only know the history of the past life of each one of we but have a clearer idea of what we intend to do in the future than we ourselves he seek this information so much with a air of be very particular as to whom he admit into he house that we tremblingly answer every question that he ask when we have become located we go out and get supper then walk around until about ten o'clock at that hour we meet a couple of young fellow who live in new york and be know to one of the member of we party it be suggest we go to a certain place which be know by the proprietor 's name we turn into one of the cross street and mount the stoop of a house in about the middle of a block between sixth and seventh avenue one of the young man whom we have meet ring a bell and a man on the inside crack the door a couple of inch then open it and let we in we find ourselves in the hallway of what have once be a residence the front parlor have be convert into a bar and a half-dozen or so well-dressed man be in the room we go in and after a general introduction have several round of beer in the back parlor a crowd be sit and stand around the wall of the room watch a exciting and noisy game of pool i walk back and join this crowd to watch the game and principally to get away from the drink party the game be really interesting the player be quite expert and the excitement be heighten by the bet which be be make on the result at time the antic and remark of both player and spectator be amusing when at a critical point a player miss a shot he be deluge by those financially interested in he make it with a flood of epithet synonymous with chump while from the other he would be jeer by such remark as nigger dat cue be not no hoe-handle i notice that among this class of color man the word nigger be freely use in about the same sense as the word fellow and sometimes as a term of almost endearment but i soon learn that its use be positively and absolutely prohibit to white man i stand watch this pool game until i be call by my friend who be still in the bar-room to go upstairs on the second floor there be two large room from the hall i look into the one on the front there be a large round table in the center at which five or six man be seat play poker the air and conduct here be greatly in contrast to what i have just see in the pool-room these man be evidently the aristocrat of the place they be well perhaps a bit flashily dress and speak in low modulate voice frequently use the word gentleman in fact they seem to be practice a sort of chesterfieldian politeness towards each other i be watch these man with a great deal of interest and some degree of admiration when i be again call by the member of we party and i follow they on to the back room there be a door-keeper at this room and we be admit only after inspection when we get inside i see a crowd of man of all age and kind group about a old billiard table regard some of whom in suppose they to be white i make no mistake at first i do not know what these man be do they be use term that be strange to I i could hear only a confusion of voice exclaim : shoot the two shoot the four fate I fate I i have get you fate twenty-five cent he do not turn this be the ancient and terribly fascinating game of dice popularly know as crap i myself have play pool in jacksonville -- it be a favorite game among cigar maker -- and i have see other play card but here be something new i edge my way in to the table and stand between one of my new-found new york friend and a tall slender black fellow who be make side bet while the dice be at the other end of the table my companion explain to I the principle of the game and they be so simple that they hardly need to be explain twice the dice come around the table until they reach the man on the other side of the tall black fellow he lose and the latter say : gimme the bone he throw a dollar on the table and say : shoot the dollar he style of play be so strenuous that he have to be allow plenty of room he shake the dice high above he head and each time he throw they on the table he emit a grunt such as man give when they be put forth physical exertion with a rhythmic regularity he frequently whirl completely around on he heel throw the dice the entire length of the table and talk to they as though they be train animal he appeal to they in short singsong phrase come dice he would say little phoebe little joe ` way down yonder in the cornfield whether these mystic incantation be efficacious or not i could not say but at any rate he luck be great and he have what gambler term nerve shoot the dollar shoot the two shoot the four shoot the eight come from he lip as quickly as the dice turn to he advantage my companion ask I if i have ever play i tell he no he say that i ought to try my luck : that everybody win at first the tall man at my side be wave he arm in the air exclaiming : shoot the sixteen shoot the sixteen fate I whether it be my companion 's suggestion or some latent dare-devil strain in my blood which suddenly spring into activity i do not know but with a thrill of excitement which go through my whole body i throw a twenty-dollar bill on the table and say in a tremble voice : i fate you i could feel that i have gain the attention and respect of everybody in the room every eye be fix on I and the widespread question who be he go around this be gratify to a certain sense of vanity of which i have never be able to rid myself and i feel that it be worth the money even if i lose the tall man with a whirl on he heel and a double grunt throw the dice four be the number which turn up this be consider as a hard point to make he redouble he contortion and he grunt and he pleading to the dice but on he third or fourth throw the fateful seven turn up and i have win my companion and all my friend shout to I to follow up my luck the fever be on I i seize the dice my hand be so hot that the bit of bone feel like piece of ice i shout as loudly as i could : shoot it all but the blood be tingle so about my ear that i could not hear my own voice i be soon fate i throw the dice -- seven -- i have win shoot it all i cry again there be a pause the stake be more than one man care to or could cover i be finally fate by several man take each a part of it i then throw the dice again seven i have win shoot it all i shout excitedly after a short delay i be fate again i roll the dice eleven again i win my friend now surround I and much against my inclination force I to take down all of the money except five dollar i try my luck once more and throw some small point which fail to make and the dice pass on to the next man in less than three minute i have win more than two hundred dollar a sum which afterwards cost I dearly i be the hero of the moment and be soon surround by a group of man who express admiration for my nerve and predict for I a brilliant future as a gambler although at the time i have no thought of become a gambler i feel proud of my success i feel a bit ashamed too that i have allow my friend to persuade I to take down my money so soon another set of man also get around I and beg I for twenty-five or fifty cent to put they back into the game i give each of they something i see that several of they have on linen duster and as i look about i notice that there be perhaps a dozen man in the room similarly clothe i ask the fellow who have be my prompter at the dice table why they dress in such a manner he tell I that man who have lose all the money and jewelry they possess frequently in a effort to recoup they loss would gamble away all they outer clothing and even they shoe and that the proprietor keep on hand a supply of linen duster for all who be so unfortunate my informant go on to say that sometimes a fellow would become almost completely dress and then by a turn of the dice would be throw back into a state of semi-nakedness some of they be virtually prisoner and unable to get into the street for day at a time they eat at the lunch counter where they credit be good so long as they be fair gambler and do not attempt to jump they debt and they sleep around in chair they importune friend and winner to put they back in the game and keep at it until fortune again smile on they i laugh heartily at this not think the day be come which would find I in the same ludicrous predicament on pass downstairs i be tell that the third and top floor of the house be occupy by the proprietor when we pass through the bar i treat everybody in the room -- and that be no small number for eight or ten have follow we down then we party go out it be now about half past twelve but my nerve be at such a tension that i could not endure the mere thought of go to bed i ask if there be no other place to which we could go we guide say yes and suggest that we go to the club we go to sixth avenue walk two block and turn to the west into another street we stop in front of a house with three story and a basement in the basement be a chinese chop-suey restaurant there be a red lantern at the iron gate to the area way inside of which the chinaman 's name be print we go up the step of the stoop ring the bell and be admit without any delay from the outside the house bear a rather gloomy aspect the window be absolutely dark but within it be a veritable house of mirth when we have pass through a small vestibule and reach the hallway we hear mingled sound of music and laughter the clink of glass and the pop of bottle we go into the main room and i be little prepared for what i see the brilliancy of the place the display of diamond ring scarf-pin ear-ring and breast-pin the big roll of money that be bring into evidence when drink be pay for and the air of gaiety that pervade the place all completely dazzle and daze I i feel positively giddy and it be several minute before i be able to make any clear and definite observation we at length secure place at a table in a corner of the room and as soon as we could attract the attention of one of the busy waiter order a round of drink when i have somewhat collect my sens i realize that in a large back room into which the main room open there be a young fellow singing a song accompany on the piano by a short thickset dark man after each verse he do some dance step which bring forth great applause and a shower of small coin at he foot after the singer have respond to a rousing encore the stout man at the piano begin to run he finger up and down the keyboard this he do in a manner which indicate that he be master of a good deal of technique then he begin to play and such playing i stop talk to listen it be music of a kind i have never hear before it be music that demand physical response patting of the foot drum of the finger or nodding of the head in time with the beat the barbaric harmony the audacious resolution often consist of a abrupt jump from one key to another the intricate rhythm in which the accent fall in the most unexpected place but in which the beat be never lose produce a most curious effect and too the player -- the dexterity of he left hand in make rapid octave run and jump be little short of marvelous and with he right hand he frequently sweep half the keyboard with clean-cut chromatic which he fit in so nicely as never to fail to arouse in he listener a sort of pleasant surprise at the accomplishment of the feat this be ragtime music then a novelty in new york and just grow to be a rage which have not yet subside it be originate in the questionable resort about memphi and st loui by negro piano player who know no more of the theory of music than they do of the theory of the universe but be guide by natural musical instinct and talent it make its way to chicago where it be popular some time before it reach new york these player often improvise crude and at time vulgar word to fit the melody this be the beginning of the ragtime song several of these improvisation be take down by white man the word slightly altered and publish under the name of the arranger they spring into immediate popularity and earn small fortune of which the negro originator get only a few dollar but i have learn that since that time a number of color man of not only musical talent but training be write out they own melody and word and reap the reward of they work i have learn also that they have a large number of white imitator and adulterator american musician instead of investigate ragtime attempt to ignore it or dismiss it with a contemptuous word but that have always be the course of scholasticism in every branch of art whatever new thing the people like be pooh-poohed whatever be popular be speak of as not worth the while the fact be nothing great or enduring especially in music have ever spring full-fledged and unprecedented from the brain of any master the best that he give to the world he gather from the heart of the people and run it through the alembic of he genius in spite of the ban which musician and music teacher have place upon it the people still demand and enjoy ragtime one thing can not be deny it be music which possess at least one strong element of greatness : it appeal universally not only the american but the english the french and even the german people find delight in it in fact there be not a corner of the civilized world in which it be not know and this prove its originality for if it be a imitation the people of europe anyhow would not have find it a novelty anyone who doubt that there be a peculiar heel-tickling smile-provoking joy-awakening charm in ragtime need only to hear a skillful performer play the genuine article to be convinced i believe that it have its place as well as the music which draw from we sigh and tear i become so interested in both the music and the player that i leave the table where i be sit and make my way through the hall into the back room where i could see as well as hear i talk to the piano-player between the musical number and find out that he be just a natural musician never have take a lesson in he life not only could he play almost anything he hear but he could accompany singer in song he have never hear he have by ear alone compose some piece several of which he play over for I each of they be properly proportion and balanced i begin to wonder what this man with such a lavish natural endowment would have do have he be train perhaps he would not have do anything at all he might have become at best a mediocre imitator of the great master in what they have already do to a finish or one of the modern innovator who strive after originality by see how cleverly they can dodge about through the rule of harmony and at the same time avoid melody it be certain that he would not have be so delightful as he be in ragtime i sit by watch and listen to this man until i be drag away by my friend the place be now almost desert only a few straggler hang on and they be all the worse for drink my friend be well up in this class we pass into the street the lamp be pale against the sky day be just break we go home and get into bed i fall into a fitful sort of sleep with ragtime music ring continually in my ear vii i shall take advantage of this pause in my narrative to describe more closely the club speak of in the latter part of the precede chapter -- to describe it as i afterwards come to know it as a habitu i shall do this not only because of the direct influence it have on my life but also because it be at that time the most famous place of its kind in new york and be well know to both white and colored people of certain class i have already state that in the basement of the house there be a chinese restaurant the chinaman who keep it do a exceptionally good business for chop-suey be a favorite dish among the frequenter of the place it be a food that somehow have the power of absorb alcoholic liquor that have be take into the stomach i have hear man claim that they could sober up on chop-suey perhaps that account in some degree for its popularity on the main floor there be two large room : a parlor about thirty foot in length and a large square back room into which the parlor open the floor of the parlor be carpet small table and chair be arrange about the room the window be drape with lace curtain and the wall be literally cover with photograph or lithograph of every color man in america who have ever do anything there be picture of frederick douglass and of peter jackson of all the lesser light of the prize-fighting ring of all the famous jockey and the stage celebrity down to the newest song and dance team the most of these photograph be autograph and in a sense make a really valuable collection in the back room there be a piano and table be place around the wall the floor be bare and the center be leave vacant for singer dancer and other who entertain the patron in a closet in this room which jut out into the hall the proprietor keep he buffet there be no open bar because the place have no liquor license in this back room the table be sometimes push aside and the floor give over to general dancing the front room on the next floor be a sort of private party room a back room on the same floor contain no furniture and be devote to the use of new and ambitious performer in this room song and dance team practice they step acrobatic team practice they tumble and many other kind of act rehearse they turn the other room of the house be use as sleeping-apartment no gambling be allow and the conduct of the place be surprisingly orderly it be in short a center of color bohemian and sport here the great prize fighter be wont to come the famous jockey the note minstrel whose name and face be familiar on every bill-board in the country and these draw a multitude of those who love to dwell in the shadow of greatness there be then no organization give performance of such order as be now give by several color company that be because no manager could imagine that audience would pay to see negro performer in any other role than that of mississippus river roustabout but there be lot of talent and ambition i often hear the younger and brighter man discuss the time when they would compel the public to recognize that they could do something more than grin and cut pigeon-wing sometimes one or two of the visit stage professional after be sufficiently urge would go into the back room and take the place of the regular amateur entertainer but they be very spare with these favor and the patron regard they as special treat there be one man a minstrel who whenever he respond to a request to do something never essay anything below a reading from shakespeare how well he read i do not know but he greatly impress I and i can say that at least he have a voice which strangely stir those who hear it here be a man who make people laugh at the size of he mouth while he carry in he heart a burning ambition to be a tragedian and so after all he do play a part in a tragedy these notable of the ring the turf and the stage draw to the place crowd of admirer both white and color whenever one of they come in there be awe-inspired whisper from those who know he by sight in which they enlighten those around they as to he identity and hint darkly at they great intimacy with the note one those who be on term of approach immediately show they privilege over other less fortunate by gather around they divinity i be at first among those who dwell in darkness most of these celebrity i have never hear of this make I a object of pity among many of my new associate i soon learn however to fake a knowledge for the benefit of those who be greener than i and finally i become personally acquaint with the majority of the famous personage who come to the club a great deal of money be spend here so many of the patron be man who earn large sum i remember one night a dapper little brown-skin fellow be point out to I and i be tell that he be the most popular jockey of the day and that he earn $ 12000 a year this latter statement i could not doubt for with my own eye i see he spend at about thirty time that rate for he friend and those who be introduce to he he buy nothing but wine -- in sport circle wine mean champagne -- and pay for it at five dollar a quart he send a quart to every table in the place with he compliment and on the table at which he and he party be seat there be more than a dozen bottle it be the custom at the club for the waiter not to remove the bottle when champagne be be drunk until the party have finish there be reason for this it advertise the brand of wine it advertise that the party be drink wine and advertise how much they have buy this jockey have win a great race that day and he be reward he admirer for the homage they pay he all of which he accept with a fine air of condescension besides the people i have just be describe there be at the place almost every night one or two party of white people man and woman who be out sight-seeing or slum they generally come in cab some of they would stay only for a few minute while other sometimes stay until morning there be also another set of white people who come frequently it be make up of variety performer and other who delineate darky character they come to get they imitation first hand from the negro entertainer they see there there be still another set of white patron compose of woman these be not occasional visitor but five or six of they be regular habitues when i first see they i be not sure that they be white in the first place among the many colored woman who come to the club there be several just as fair and secondly i always see these woman in company with color man they be all good-looking and well-dressed and seem to be woman of some education one of these in particular attract my attention she be a exceedingly beautiful woman of perhaps thirty-five she have glisten copper-colored hair very white skin and eye very much like du maurier 's conception of trilby 's twin gray star when i come to know she i find that she be a woman of considerable culture she have travel in europe speak french and play the piano well she be always dress elegantly but in absolute good taste she always come to the club in a cab and be soon join by a well-set-up very black young fellow he be always faultlessly dress one of the most exclusive tailor in new york make he clothes and he wear a number of diamond in about as good taste as they could be worn in by a man i learn that she pay for he clothes and he diamond i learn too that he be not the only one of he kind more that i learn would be better suit to a book on social phenomenon than to a narrative of my life this woman be know at the club as the rich widow she go by a very aristocratic-sounding name which correspond to she appearance i shall never forget how hard it be for I to get over my feeling of surprise perhaps more than surprise at see she with she black companion somehow i never exactly enjoy the sight i have devote so much time to this pair the widow and she companion because it be through they that another decide turn be bring about in my life viii on the day follow we night at the club we sleep until late in the afternoon so late that begin search for work be entirely out of the question this do not cause I much worry for i have more than three hundred dollar and new york have impressed I as a place where there be lot of money and not much difficulty in get it it be needless to inform my reader that i do not long hold this opinion we get out of the house about dark go to a restaurant on sixth avenue and eat something then walk around for a couple of hour i finally suggest that we visit the same place we have be in the night before follow my suggestion we start first to the gambling house the man on the door let we in without any question i accredited this to my success of the night before we go straight to the crap room and i at once make my way to a table where i be rather flatter by the murmur of recognition which go around i play in up and down luck for three or four hour then wear with nervous excitement quit have lose about fifty dollar but i be so strongly possess with the thought that i would make up my loss the next time i play that i leave the place with a light heart when we get into the street we party be divide against itself two be for go home at once and get to bed they give as a reason that we be to get up early and look for job i think the real reason be that they have each lose several dollar in the game i live to learn that in the world of sport all man win alike but lose differently and so gambler be rate not by the way in which they win but by the way in which they lose some man lose with a careless smile recognize that lose be a part of the game other curse they luck and rail at fortune and other still lose sadly after each such experience they be sweep by a wave of reform they resolve to stop gamble and be good when in this frame of mind it would take very little persuasion to lead they into a prayer-meeting those in the first class be look upon with admiration those in the second class be merely commonplace while those in the third be regard with contempt i believe these distinction hold good in all the venture of life after some minute one of my friend and i succeed in convince the other two that a while at the club would put we all in better spirit and they consent to go on we promise not to stay longer than a hour we find the place crowd and the same sort of thing go on which we have see the night before i take a seat at once by the side of the piano player and be soon lose to everything except the novel charm of the music i watch the performer with the idea of catch the trick and during one of he intermission i take he place at the piano and make a attempt to imitate he but even my quick ear and ready finger be unequal to the task on first trial we do not stay at the club very long but go home to bed in order to be up early the next day we have no difficulty in finding work and my third morning in new york find I at a table roll cigar i work steadily for some week at the same time spend my earnings between the crap game and the club make cigar become more and more irksome to I perhaps my more congenial work as a reader have unfitted I for work at the table and too the late hour i be keep make such a sedentary occupation almost beyond the power of will and endurance i often find it hard to keep my eye open and sometimes have to get up and move around to keep from fall asleep i begin to miss whole day from the factory day on which i be compel to stay at home and sleep my luck at the gambling table be varied sometimes i be fifty to a hundred dollar ahead and at other time i have to borrow money from my fellow workman to settle my room rent and pay for my meal each night after leave the dice game i go to the club to hear the music and watch the gaiety if i have win this be in accord with my mood if i have lose it make I forget i at last realize that make cigar for a living and gambling for a living could not both be carry on at the same time and i resolve to give up the cigar make this resolution lead I into a life which hold I bind more than a year during that period my regular time for go to bed be somewhere between four and six o'clock in the morning i get up late in the afternoon walk about a little then go to the gambling house or the club my new york be limit to ten block the boundary be sixth avenue from twenty-third to thirty-third street with the cross street one block to the west central park be a distant forest and the lower part of the city a foreign land i look back upon the life i then lead with a shudder when i think what would have be have i not escape it but have i not escape it i should have be no more unfortunate than be many young color man who come to new york during that dark period i become acquaint with a score of bright intelligent young fellow who have come up to the great city with high hope and ambition and who have fall under the spell of this under life a spell they could not throw off there be one popularly know as the doctor he have have two year in the harvard medical school but here he be live this gas-light life he will and moral sense so enervated and deaden that it be impossible for he to break away i do not doubt that the same thing be go on now but i have sympathy rather than censure for these victim for i know how easy it be to slip into a slough from which it take a herculean effort to leap i regret that i can not contrast my view of life among color people of new york but the truth be during my entire stay in this city i do not become acquaint with a single respectable family i know that there be several color man worth a hundred or so thousand dollar each and some family who proudly date they free ancestry back a half-dozen generation i also learn that in brooklyn there live quite a large colony in comfortable home which they own but at no point do my life come in contact with theirs in my gamble experience i pass through all the state and condition that a gambler be heir to some day find I able to peel ten and twenty-dollar bill from a roll and other find I clothe in a linen duster and carpet slipper i finally catch up another method of earn money and so do not have to depend entirely upon the caprice of fortune at the gaming table through continually listen to the music at the club and through my own previous training my natural talent and perseverance i develop into a remarkable player of ragtime indeed i have the name at that time of be the best ragtime-player in new york i bring all my knowledge of classic music to bear and in so do achieve some novelty which pleased and even astonished my listener it be i who first make ragtime transcription of familiar classic selection i use to play mendelssohn 's wedding march in a manner that never fail to arouse enthusiasm among the patron of the club very few night pass during which i be not ask to play it it be no secret that the great increase in slum visitor be due to my playing by master ragtime i gain several thing : first of all i gain the title of professor i be know as the professor as long as i remain in that world then too i gain the means of earn a rather fair livelihood this work take up much of my time and keep I almost entirely away from the gambling table through it i also gain a friend who be the means by which i escape from this lower world and finally i secure a wedge which have open to I more door and make I a welcome guest than my playing of beethoven and chopin could ever have do the greater part of the money i now begin to earn come through the friend to whom i allude in the foregoing paragraph among the other white slummer there come into the club one night a clean-cut slender but athletic-looking man who would have be take for a youth have it not be for the tinge of gray about he temple he be clean-shaven and have regular feature and all of he movement bear the indefinable but unmistakable stamp of culture he speak to no one but sit languidly puff cigarette and sip a glass of beer he be the center of a great deal of attention all of the old-timer be wonder who he be when i have finish play he call a waiter and by he send I a five-dollar bill for about a month after that he be at the club one or two night each week and each time after i have play he give I five dollar one night he send for I to come to he table he ask I several question about myself then tell I that he have a engagement which he want I to fill he give I a card contain he address and ask I to be there on a certain night i be on hand promptly and find that he be give a dinner in he own apartment to a party of lady and gentleman and that i be expect to furnish the musical entertainment when the grave dignified man at the door let I in the place strike I as be almost dark my eye have be so accustomed to the garish light of the club he take my coat and hat bid I take a seat and go to tell he master that i have come when my eye be adjust to the soft light i see that i be in the midst of elegance and luxury in a degree such as i have never see but not the elegance which make one ill at ease as i sink into a great chair the subdue tone the delicately sensuous harmony of my surroundings draw from I a deep sigh of relief and comfort how long the man be go i do not know but i be startle by a voice say : come this way if you please sir and i see he stand by my chair i have be asleep and i awake very much confused and a little ashamed because i do not know how many time he may have call I i follow he through into the dining-room where the butler be put the finish touch to a table which already look like a big jewel the doorman turn I over to the butler and i pass with the butler on back to where several waiter be busy polish and assort table utensil without be ask whether i be hungry or not i be place at a table and give something to eat before i have finish eat i hear the laughter and talk of the guest who be arrive soon afterwards i be call in to begin my work i pass in to where the company be gather and go directly to the piano accord to a suggestion from the host i begin with classic music during the first number there be absolute quiet and appreciative attention and when i have finish i be give a round of generous applause after that the talk and the laughter begin to grow until the music be only a accompaniment to the chatter this however do not disconcert I as it once would have do for i have become accustomed to play in the midst of uproarious noise as the guest begin to pay less attention to I i be enable to pay more to they there be about a dozen of they the man range in appearance from a girlish-looking youth to a big grizzled man whom everybody address as judge none of the woman appear to be under thirty but each of they strike I as be handsome i be not long in find out that they be all decidedly blas several of the woman smoke cigarette and with a careless grace which show they be use to the habit occasionally a damn it escape from the lip of some one of they but in such a charming way as to rob it of all vulgarity the most notable thing which i observe be that the reserve of the host increase in direct proportion with the hilarity of he guest i think that there be something go wrong which displeased he i afterwards learn that it be he habitual manner on such occasion he seem to take cynical delight in watch and study other indulge in excess he guest be evidently accustom to he rather non-participating attitude for it do not seem in any degree to dampen they spirit when dinner be serve the piano be move and the door leave open so that the company might hear the music while eat at a word from the host i strike up one of my liveliest ragtime piece the effect be surprising perhaps even to the host the ragtime music come very near spoil the party so far as eat the dinner be concern as soon as i begin the conversation suddenly stop it be a pleasure to I to watch the expression of astonishment and delight that grow on the face of everybody these be people -- and they represent a large class -- who be ever expect to find happiness in novelty each day restlessly explore and exhaust every resource of this great city that might possibly furnish a new sensation or awaken a fresh emotion and who be always grateful to anyone who aid they in they quest several of the woman leave the table and gather about the piano they watch my finger and ask what kind of music it be that i be play where i have learn it and a host of other question it be only by be repeatedly call back to the table that they be induce to finish they dinner when the guest arise i strike up my ragtime transcription of mendelssohn 's wedding march play it with terrific chromatic octave run in the bass this raise everybody 's spirit to the highest point of gaiety and the whole company involuntarily and unconsciously do a impromptu cake-walk from that time on until the time of leave they keep I so busy that my arm ache i obtain a little respite when the girlish-looking youth and one or two of the lady sing several song but after each of these it be back to ragtime in leave the guest be enthusiastic in tell the host that he have furnish they the most unusual entertainment they have ever enjoy when they have go my millionaire friend -- for he be report to be a millionaire -- say to I with a smile : well i have give they something they have never have before after i have put on my coat and be ready to leave he make I take a glass of wine he then give I a cigar and twenty dollar in bill he tell I that he would give I lot of work he only stipulation be that i should not play any engagement such as i have just fill for he except by he instruction i readily accept the proposition for i be sure that i could not be the loser by such a contract i afterwards play for he at many dinner and party of one kind or another occasionally he loan I to some of he friend and too i often play for he alone at he apartment at such time he be quite a puzzle to I until i become accustomed to he manners he would sometimes sit for three or four hour hear I play he eye almost close make scarcely a motion except to light a fresh cigarette and never comment one way or another on the music at first i sometimes think he have fall asleep and would pause in play the stop of the music always arouse he enough to tell I to play this or that and i soon learn that my task be not to be consider finish until he get up from he chair and say : that will do the man 's power of endurance in listen often exceed mine in perform -- yet i be not sure that he be always listen at time i become so oppressed with fatigue and sleepiness that it take almost superhuman effort to keep my finger go in fact i believe i sometimes do so while doze during such moment this man sit there so mysteriously silent almost hide in a cloud of heavy-scented smoke fill I with a sort of unearthly terror he seem to be some grim mute but relentless tyrant possess over I a supernatural power which he use to drive I on mercilessly to exhaustion but these feeling come very rarely besides he pay I so liberally i could forget much there at length grow between we a familiar and warm relationship and i be sure he have a decide personal liking for I on my part i look upon he at that time as about all a man could wish to be the club still remain my headquarters and when i be not play for my good patron i be generally to be find there however i no longer depend on play at the club to earn my living i rather take rank with the visit celebrity and occasionally after be sufficiently urge would favor my old and new admirer with a number or two i say without any egotistic pride that among my admirer be several of the best-looking woman who frequent the place and who make no secret of the fact that they admire I as much as they do my playing among these be the widow indeed she attention become so marked that one of my friend warn I to beware of she black companion who be generally know as a bad man he say there be much more reason to be careful because the pair have lately quarrel and have not be together at the club for some night this warning greatly impressed I and i resolve to stop the affair before it should go any further but the woman be so beautiful that my native gallantry and delicacy would not allow I to repulse she my finer feeling entirely overcome my judgment the warning also open my eye sufficiently to see that though my artistic temperament and skill make I interesting and attractive to the woman she be after all use I only to excite the jealousy of she companion and revenge herself upon he it be this surly black despot who hold sway over she deepest emotion one night shortly afterwards i go into the club and see the widow sit at a table in company with another woman she at once beckon for I to come to she i go know that i be commit worse than folly she order a quart of champagne and insist that i sit down and drink with she i take a chair on the opposite side of the table and begin to sip a glass of the wine suddenly i notice by a expression on the widow 's face that something have occur i instinctively glance around and see that she companion have just enter he ugly look completely frighten I my back be turn to he but by watch the widow 's eye i judge that he be pacing back and forth across the room my feeling be far from be comfortable i expect every moment to feel a blow on my head she too be very nervous she be try hard to appear unconcerned but could not succeed in hide she real feeling i decide that it be best to get out of such a predicament even at the expense of appear cowardly and i make a motion to rise just as i partly turn in my chair i see the black fellow approach he walk directly to we table and lean over the widow evidently fear he be go to strike she and she throw back she head instead of striking she he whip out a revolver and fire the first shot go straight into she throat there be other shot fire but how many i do not know for the first knowledge i have of my surroundings and action be that i be rush through the chop-suey restaurant into the street just which street i follow when i get outside i do not know but i think i must have go towards eighth avenue then down towards twenty-third street and across towards fifth avenue i travel not by sight but instinctively i feel like one flee in a horrible nightmare how long and far i walk i can not tell but on fifth avenue under a light i pass a cab contain a solitary occupant who call to I and i recognize the voice and face of my millionaire friend he stop the cab and ask : what on earth be you do stroll in this part of the town for answer i get into the cab and related to he all that have happen he reassure I by say that no charge of any kind could be bring against I then add : but of course you do not want to be mix up in such a affair he direct the driver to turn around and go into the park and then go on to say : i decide last night that i would go to europe tomorrow i think i 'll take you along instead of walter walter be he valet it be settle that i should go to he apartment for the rest of the night and sail with he in the morning we drive around through the park exchange only a occasional word the cool air somewhat calm my nerve and i lay back and close my eye but still i could see that beautiful white throat with the ugly wound the jet of blood pulse from it have place a indelible red stain on my memory ix i do not feel at ease until the ship be well out of new york harbor and notwithstanding the repeat reassurance of my millionaire friend and my own knowledge of the fact in the case i somehow could not rid myself of the sentiment that i be in a great degree responsible for the widow 's tragic end we have bring most of the morning papers aboard with we but my great fear of see my name in connection with the killing would not permit I to read the account although in one of the papers i do look at the picture of the victim which do not in the least resemble she this morbid state of mind together with sea-sickness keep I miserable for three or four day at the end of that time my spirit begin to revive and i take a interest in the ship my fellow passenger and the voyage in general on the second or third day out we pass several spout whale but i could not arouse myself to make the effort to go to the other side of the ship to see they a little later we run in close proximity to a large iceberg i be curious enough to get up and look at it and i be fully repay for my pain the sun be shine full upon it and it glisten like a mammoth diamond cut with a million facet as we pass it constantly change its shape at each different angle of vision it assume new and astonishing form of beauty i watch it through a pair of glass seek to verify my early conception of a iceberg -- in the geography of my grammar school day the picture of iceberg always include a strand polar bear standing desolately upon one of the snowy crag i look for the bear but if he be there he refuse to put himself on exhibition it be not however until the morning that we enter the harbor of havre that i be able to shake off my gloom then the strange sight the chatter in a unfamiliar tongue and the excitement of landing and pass the custom official cause I to forget completely the event of a few day before indeed i grow so lighthearted that when i catch my first sight of the train which be to take we to paris i enjoy a hearty laugh the toy-looking engine the stuffy little compartment car with tiny old-fashioned wheel strike I as be extremely funny but before we reach paris my respect for we train rise considerably i find that the tiny engine make remarkably fast time and that the old-fashioned wheel run very smoothly i even begin to appreciate the stuffy car for they privacy as i watch the pass scenery from the car window it seem too beautiful to be real the bright-colored house against the green background impress I as the work of some idealistic painter before we arrive in pari there be awaken in my heart a love for france which continue to grow stronger a love which to-day make that country for I the one above all other to be desire we roll into the station saint lazare about four o'clock in the afternoon and drive immediately to the htel continental my benefactor humor my curiosity and enthusiasm which seem to please he very much suggest that we take a short walk before dinner we step out of the hotel and turn to the right into the rue de rivoli when the vista of the place de la concorde and the champ lyses suddenly burst on I i could hardly credit my own eye i shall attempt no such supererogatory task as a description of paris i wish only to give briefly the impression which that wonderful city make upon I it impress I as the perfect and perfectly beautiful city and even after i have be there for some time and see not only its avenue and palace but its most squalid alley and hovel this impression be not weaken pari become for I a charm spot and whenever i have return there i have fall under the spell a spell which compel admiration for all of its manners and custom and justification of even its folly and sin we walk a short distance up the champ lyses and sit for a while in chair along the sidewalk watch the pass crowd on foot and in carriage it be with reluctance that i go back to the hotel for dinner after dinner we go to one of the summer theater and after the performance my friend take I to a large caf on one of the grand boulevard here it be that i have my first glimpse of the french life of popular literature so different from real french life there be several hundred people man and woman in the place drinking smoking talk and listen to the music my millionaire friend and i take seat at a table where we sit smoking and watch the crowd it be not long before we be join by two or three good-looking well-dressed young woman my friend talk to they in french and buy drink for the whole party i try to recall my high-school french but the effort avail I little i could stammer out a few phrase but very naturally could not understand a word that be say to I we stay at the caf a couple of hour then go back to the hotel the next day we spend several hour in the shop and at the tailor 's i have no clothes except what i have be able to gather together at my benefactor 's apartment the night before we sail he buy I the same kind of clothes which he himself wear and that be the best and he treat I in every way as he dress I as a equal not as a servant in fact i do not think anyone could have guess that such a relation exist my duty be light and few and he be a man full of life and vigor who rather enjoy do thing for himself he keep I supply with money far beyond what ordinary wages would have amount to for the first two week we be together almost constantly see the sight sight old to he but from which he seem to get new pleasure in show they to I during the day we take in the place of interest and at night the theater and cafs this sort of life appeal to I as ideal and i ask he one day how long he intend to stay in paris he answer : oh until i get tire of it i could not understand how that could ever happen as it be include several short trip to the mediterranean to spain to brussels and to ostend we do remain there fourteen or fifteen month we stay at the htel continental about two month of this time then my millionaire take apartment hire a piano and live almost the same life he live in new york he entertain a great deal some of the party be a good deal more blas than the new york one i play for the guest at all of they with a effect which to relate would be but a tiresome repetition to the reader i play not only for the guest but continue as i use to do in new york to play often for the host when he be alone this man of the world who grow weary of everything and be always search for something new appear never to grow tired of my music he seem to take it as a drug he fall into a habit which cause I no little annoyance sometimes he would come in during the early hour of the morning and finding I in bed asleep would wake I up and ask I to play something this so far as i can remember be my only hardship during my whole stay with he in europe after the first few week spend in sight-seeing i have a great deal of time leave to myself my friend be often i do not know where when not with he i spend the day nose about all the curious nook and corner of pari of this i never grow tire at night i usually go to some theater but always end up at the big caf on the grand boulevard i wish the reader to know that it be not alone the gaiety which draw I there aside from that i have a laudable purpose i have purchase a english-french conversational dictionary and i go there every night to take a language lesson i use to get three or four of the young woman who frequent the place at a table and buy beer and cigarette for they in return i receive my lesson i get more than my money 's worth for they actually compel I to speak the language this together with read the papers every day enable I within a few month to express myself fairly well and before i leave paris to have more than a ordinary command of french of course every person who go to pari could not dare to learn french in this manner but i can think of no easier or quicker way of do it the acquire of another foreign language awake I to the fact that with a little effort i could secure a add accomplishment as fine and as valuable as music so i determine to make myself as much of a linguist as possible i buy a spanish newspaper every day in order to freshen my memory of that language and for french devise what be so far as i know a original system of study i compile a list which i term three hundred necessary word these i thoroughly commit to memory also the conjugation of the verb which be include in the list i study these word over and over much as child of a couple of generation ago study the alphabet i also practice a set of phrase like the following : how what do you say what do the word -- mean i understand all you say except -- please repeat what do you call -- how do you say -- these i call my work sentence in a astonishingly short time i reach the point where the language teach itself -- where i learn to speak merely by speak this point be the place which student teach foreign language in we school and college find great difficulty in reach i think the main trouble be that they learn too much of a language at a time a french child with a vocabulary of two hundred word can express more speak idea than a student of french can with a knowledge of two thousand a small vocabulary the smaller the better which embrace the common everyday-used idea thoroughly master be the key to a language when that much be acquire the vocabulary can be increase simply by talk and it be easy who can not commit three hundred word to memory later i try my method if i may so term it with german and find that it work in the same way i spend a good many evening at the opra the music there make I strangely reminiscent of my life in connecticut it be a atmosphere in which i catch a fresh breath of my boyhood day and early youth generally in the morning after i have attend a performance i would sit at the piano and for a couple of hour play the music which i use to play in my mother 's little parlor one night i go to hear _ faust _ i get into my seat just as the light go down for the first act at the end of the act i notice that my neighbor on the left be a young girl i can not describe she either as to feature or color of she hair or of she eye she be so young so fair so ethereal that i feel to stare at she would be a violation yet i be distinctly conscious of she beauty during the intermission she speak english in a low voice to a gentleman and a lady who sit in the seat to she left address they as father and mother i hold my program as though study it but listen to catch every sound of she voice she observation on the performance and the audience be so fresh and nave as to be almost amusing i gather that she be just out of school and that this be she first trip to pari i occasionally steal a glance at she and each time i do so my heart leap into my throat once i glance beyond to the gentleman who sit next to she my glance immediately turn into a stare yes there he be unmistakably my father look hardly a day older than when i have see he some ten year before what a strange coincidence what should i say to he what would he say to I before i have recover from my first surprise there come another shock in the realization that the beautiful tender girl at my side be my sister then all the spring of affection in my heart stop since my mother 's death burst out in fresh and terrible torrent and i could have fall at she foot and worship she they be sing the second act but i do not hear the music slowly the desolate loneliness of my position become clear to I i know that i could not speak but i would have give a part of my life to touch she hand with mine and call she sister i sit through the opera until i could stand it no longer i feel that i be suffocating valentine 's love seem like mockery and i feel a almost uncontrollable impulse to rise up and scream to the audience : here here in you very midst be a tragedy a real tragedy this impulse grow so strong that i become afraid of myself and in the darkness of one of the scene i stumble out of the theater i walk aimlessly about for a hour or so my feeling divide between a desire to weep and a desire to curse i finally take a cab and go from caf to caf and for one of the very few time in my life drink myself into a stupor it be unwelcome news for I when my benefactor -- i could not think of he as employer -- inform I that he be at last tired of pari this news give I i think a pass doubt as to he sanity i have enjoy life in pari and take all thing into consideration enjoy it wholesomely one thing which greatly contribute to my enjoyment be the fact that i be a american american be immensely popular in pari and this be not due solely to the fact that they spend lot of money there for they spend just as much or more in london and in the latter city they be merely tolerate because they do spend the londoner seem to think that american be people whose only claim to be class as civilized be that they have money and the regrettable thing about that be that the money be not english but the french be more logical and freer from prejudice than the british so the difference of attitude be easily explain only once in pari do i have cause to blush for my american citizenship i have become quite friendly with a young man from luxemburg whom i have meet at the big caf he be a stolid slow-witted fellow but as we say with a heart of gold he and i grow attach to each other and be together frequently he be a great admirer of the united state and never grow tired of talk to I about the country and ask for information it be he intention to try he fortune there some day one night he ask I in a tone of voice which indicate that he expect a authoritative denial of a ugly rumor : do they really burn a man alive in the united state i never know what i stammer out to he as a answer i should have feel relieved if i could even have say to he : well only one when we arrive in london my sadness at leave pari be turn into despair after my long stay in the french capital huge ponderous massive london seem to I as ugly a thing as man could contrive to make i thought of pari as a beauty spot on the face of the earth and of london as a big freckle but soon london 's massiveness i might say its very ugliness begin to impress I i begin to experience that sense of grandeur which one feel when he look at a great mountain or a mighty river beside london paris become a toy a pretty plaything and i must own that before i leave the world 's metropolis i discover much there that be beautiful the beauty in and about london be entirely different from that in and about pari and i could not but admit that the beauty of the french city seem hand-made artificial as though set up for the photographer 's camera everything nicely adjust so as not to spoil the picture while that of the english city be rugged natural and fresh how these two city typify the two people who build they even the sound of they name express a certain racial difference pari be the concrete expression of the gaiety regard for symmetry love of art and i might well add of the morality of the french people london stand for the conservatism the solidarity the utilitarianism and i might well add the hypocrisy of the anglo-saxon it may sound odd to speak of the morality of the french if not of the hypocrisy of the english but this seeming paradox impress I as a deep truth i see many thing in pari which be immoral accord to english standard but the absence of hypocrisy the absence of the spirit to do the thing if it might only be do in secret rob these very immorality of the damning influence of the same evil in london i have walk along the terrace cafs of pari and see hundred of man and woman sip they wine and beer without observe a sign of drunkenness as they drink they chat and laugh and watch the pass crowd the drinking seem to be a secondary thing this i have witness not only in the cafs along the grand boulevard but in the out-of-the-way place patronize by the work class in london i have see in the pub man and woman crowd in stuffy little compartment drink seemingly only for the pleasure of swallow as much as they could hold i have see there woman from eighteen to eighty some in tatters and some clutch babe in they arm drink the heavy english ale and whisky serve to they by woman in the whole scene not one ray of brightness not one flash of gaiety only maudlin joviality or grim despair and i have think if some man and woman will drink -- and it be certain that some will -- be it not better that they do so under the open sky in the fresh air than huddle together in some close smoky room there be a sort of frankness about the evil of pari which rob they of much of the seductiveness of thing forbid and with that frankness go a certain cleanliness of thought belong to thing not hide london will do whatever pari do provide exterior moral be not shock as a result pari have the appearance only of be the more immoral city the difference may be sum up in this : pari practice its sin as lightly as it do its religion while london practice both very seriously i should not neglect to mention what impress I most forcibly during my stay in london it be not st paul 's nor the british museum nor westminster abbey it be nothing more or less than the simple phrase thank you or sometimes more elaborate thank you very kindly sir i be continually surprise by the varied use to which it be put and strange to say its use as a expression of politeness seem more limited than any other one night i be in a cheap music hall and accidentally bump into a waiter who be carry a tray-load of beer almost bring he to several shilling ' worth of grief to my amazement he right himself and say : thank ye sir and leave I wonder whether he mean that he thank I for not completely spilling he beer or that he would thank I for keep out of he way i also find cause to wonder upon what ground the english accuse american of corrupt the language by introduce slang word i think i hear more and more different kind of slang during my few week ' stay in london than in my whole tenderloin life in new york but i suppose the english feel that the language be theirs and that they may do with it as they please without at the same time allow that privilege to other my millionaire be not so long in grow tired of london as of pari after a stay of six or eight week we go across into holland amsterdam be a great surprise to I i have always think of venice as the city of canal it have never enter my mind that i should find similar condition in a dutch town i do not suppose the comparison go far beyond the fact that there be canal in both city -- i have never see venice -- but amsterdam strike I as be extremely picturesque from holland we go to germany where we spend five or six month most of the time in berlin i find berlin more to my taste than london and occasionally i have to admit that in some thing it be superior to pari in berlin i especially enjoy the orchestral concert and i attend a large number of they i form the acquaintance of a good many musician several of whom speak of my playing in high term it be in berlin that my inspiration be renew one night my millionaire entertain a party of man compose of artist musician writer and for aught i know a count or two they drink and smoke a great deal talk art and music and discuss it seem to I everything that ever enter man 's mind i could only follow the general drift of what they be say when they discuss music it be more interesting to I for then some fellow would run excitedly to the piano and give a demonstration of he opinion and another would follow quickly do the same in this way i learn that regardless of what he specialty might be every man in the party be a musician i be at the same time impressed with the falsity of the general idea that frenchman be excitable and emotional and that german be calm and phlegmatic frenchman be merely gay and never overwhelm by they emotion when they talk loud and fast it be merely talk while german get work up and red in the face when sustain a opinion and in heated discussion be likely to allow they emotion to sweep they off they foot my millionaire plan in the midst of the discussion on music to have I play the new american music and astonish everybody present the result be that i be more astonished than anyone else i go to the piano and play the most intricate ragtime piece i know before there be time for anybody to express a opinion on what i have do a big bespectacled bushy-headed man rush over and shove I out of the chair exclaim : get up get up he seat himself at the piano and take the theme of my ragtime play it through first in straight chord then vary and develop it through every known musical form i sit amaze i have be turn classic music into ragtime a comparatively easy task and this man have take ragtime and make it classic the thought come across I like a flash -- it can be do why can not i do it from that moment my mind be make up i clearly see the way of carry out the ambition i have form when a boy i now lose interest in we trip i thought : here i be a man no longer a boy and what be i do but waste my time and abuse my talent what use be i making of my gift what future have i before I follow my present course these thought make I feel remorseful and put I in a fever to get to work to begin to do something of course i know now that i be not waste time that there be nothing i could have do at that age which would have benefit I more than go to europe as i do the desire to begin work grow stronger each day i could think of nothing else i make up my mind to go back into the very heart of the south to live among the people and drink in my inspiration firsthand i gloat over the immense amount of material i have to work with not only modern ragtime but also the old slave song -- material which no one have yet touch the more decide and anxious i become to return to the united state the more i dread the ordeal of break with my millionaire between this peculiar man and I there have grow a very strong bond of affection back up by a debt which each owe to the other he have take I from a terrible life in new york and by give I the opportunity of travel and of come in contact with the people with whom he associate have make I a polished man of the world on the other hand i be he chief means of dispose of the thing which seem to sum up all in life that he dread -- time as i remember he now i can see that time be what he be always endeavor to escape to bridge over to blot out and it be not strange that some year later he do escape it forever by leap into eternity for some week i wait for just the right moment in which to tell my patron of my decision those week be a try time to I i feel that i be play the part of a traitor to my best friend at length one day he say to I : well get ready for a long trip we be go to egypt and then to japan the temptation be for a instant almost overwhelming but i summon determination enough to say : i do not think i want to go what he exclaim you want to go back to you dear pari you still think that the only spot on earth wait until you see cairo and tokyo you may change you mind no i stammer it be not because i want to go back to paris i want to go back to the united state he wish to know my reason and i tell he as best i could my dream my ambition and my decision while i be talk he watch I with a curious almost cynical smile grow on he lip when i have finish he put he hand on my shoulder -- this be the first physical expression of tender regard he have ever show I -- and look at I in a big-brotherly way say : my boy you be by blood by appearance by education and by taste a white man now why do you want to throw you life away amidst the poverty and ignorance in the hopeless struggle of the black people of the united state then look at the terrible handicap you be place on yourself by go home and work as a negro composer you can never be able to get the hearing for you work which it might deserve i doubt that even a white musician of recognize ability could succeed there by work on the theory that american music should be base on negro theme music be a universal art anybody 's music belong to everybody you can not limit it to race or country now if you want to become a composer why not stay right here in europe i will put you under the best teacher on the continent then if you want to write music on negro theme why go ahead and do it we talk for some time on music and the race question on the latter subject i have never before hear he express any opinion between he and I no suggestion of racial difference have ever come up i find that he be a man entirely free from prejudice but he recognize that prejudice be a big stubborn entity which have to be take into account he go on to say : this idea you have of make a negro out of yourself be nothing more than a sentiment and you do not realize the fearful import of what you intend to do what kind of a negro would you make now especially in the south if you have remain there or perhaps even in you club in new york you might have succeed very well but now you would be miserable i can imagine no more dissatisfied human being than a educate culture and refine color man in the united state i have give more study to the race question in the united state than you may suppose and i sympathize with the negro there but what be the use i can not right they wrong and neither can you they must do that themselves they be unfortunate in have wrong to right and you would be foolish to take they wrong unnecessarily on you shoulder perhaps some day through study and observation you will come to see that evil be a force and like the physical and chemical force we can not annihilate it we may only change its form we light upon one evil and hit it with all the might of we civilization but only succeed in scatter it into a dozen other form we hit slavery through a great civil war do we destroy it no we only change it into hatred between section of the country : in the south into political corruption and chicanery the degradation of the black through peonage unjust law unfair and cruel treatment and the degradation of the whites by they resorting to these practice the paralyzation of the public conscience and the ever over-hanging dread of what the future may bring modern civilization hit ignorance of the mass through the means of popular education what have it do but turn ignorance into anarchy socialism strike hatred between poor and rich and universal discontent in like manner modern philanthropy hit at suffer and disease through asylum and hospital it prolong the sufferer ' live it be true but be at the same time send down strain of insanity and weakness into future generation my philosophy of life be this : make yourself as happy as possible and try to make those happy whose life come in touch with yours but to attempt to right the wrong and ease the suffering of the world in general be a waste of effort you have just as well try to bail the atlantic by pour the water into the pacific this tremendous flow of serious talk from a man i be accustom to see either gay or taciturn so surprised and overwhelm I that i could not frame a reply he leave I think over what he have say whatever be the soundness of he logic or the moral tone of he philosophy he argument greatly impressed I i could see in spite of the absolute selfishness upon which it be base that there be reason and common sense in it i begin to analyze my own motive and find that they too be very largely mixed with selfishness be it more a desire to help those i consider my people or more a desire to distinguish myself which be lead I back to the united state that be a question i have never definitely answer for several week longer i be in a troubled state of mind add to the fact that i be loath to leave my good friend be the weight of the question he have arouse in my mind whether i be not make a fatal mistake i suffer more than one sleepless night during that time finally i settle the question on purely selfish grounds in accordance with my millionaire 's philosophy i argue that music offer I a better future than anything else i have any knowledge of and in opposition to my friend 's opinion that i should have greater chance of attract attention as a color composer than as a white one but i must own that i also feel stir by a unselfish desire to voice all the joy and sorrow the hope and ambition of the american negro in classic musical form when my mind be fully make up i tell my friend he ask I when i intend to start i reply that i would do so at once he then ask I how much money i have i tell he that i have save several hundred dollar out of sum he have give I he give I a check for five hundred dollar tell I to write to he in care of he pari banker if i ever need he help wish I good luck and bid I good-by all this he do almost coldly and i often wonder whether he be in a hurry to get rid of what he consider a fool or whether he be strive to hide deeper feeling and so i separate from the man who be all in all the best friend i ever have except my mother the man who exert the greatest influence ever bring into my life except that exert by my mother my affection for he be so strong my recollection of he be so distinct he be such a peculiar and striking character that i could easily fill several chapter with reminiscence of he but for fear of tire the reader i shall go on with my narration i decide to go to liverpool and take ship for boston i still have a uneasy feeling about return to new york and in a few day i find myself aboard ship head for home x among the first of my fellow-passenger of whom i take any particular notice be a tall broad-shouldered almost gigantic color man he dark-brown face be clean-shaven he be well-dressed and bear a decidedly distinguished air in fact if he be not handsome he at least compel admiration for he fine physical proportion he attract general attention as he stride the deck in a sort of majestic loneliness i become curious to know who he be and determine to strike up a acquaintance with he at the first opportune moment the chance come a day or two later he be sit in the smoking-room with a cigar which have go out in he mouth read a novel i sit down beside he and offer he a fresh cigar say : you do not mind my tell you something unpleasant do you he look at I with a smile accept the proffer cigar and reply in a voice which comport perfectly with he size and appearance : i think my curiosity overcome any objection i might have well i say have you notice that the man who sit at you right in the saloon during the first meal have not sit there since he frown slightly without answer my question well i continue he ask the steward to remove he and not only that he attempt to persuade a number of the passenger to protest against you presence in the dining-saloon the big man at my side take a long draw from he cigar throw he head back and slowly blow a great cloud of smoke toward the ceiling then turn to I he say : do you know i do not object to anyone 's have prejudice so long as those prejudice do not interfere with my personal liberty now the man you be speak of have a perfect right to change he seat if i in any way interfere with he appetite or he digestion i should have no reason to complain if he remove to the farthest corner of the saloon or even if he get off the ship but when he prejudice attempt to move _ I _ one foot one inch out of the place where i be comfortably located then i object on the word object he bring he great fist down on the table in front of we with such a crash that everyone in the room turn to look we both cover up the slight embarrassment with a laugh and stroll out on the deck we walk the deck for a hour or more discuss different phase of the negro question in refer to the race i use the personal pronoun we my companion make no comment about it nor evince any surprise except to raise he eyebrow slightly the first time he catch the significance of the word he be the broadest-minded color man i have ever talk with on the negro question he even go so far as to sympathize with and offer excuse for some white southern point of view i ask he what be he main reason for be so hopeful he reply : in spite of all that be write say and do this great big incontrovertible fact stand out -- the negro be progress and that disprove all the argument in the world that he be incapable of progress i be bear in slavery and at emancipation be set adrift a ragged penniless bit of humanity i have see the negro in every grade and i know what i be talk about we detractor point to the increase of crime as evidence against we certainly we have progress in crime as in other thing what less could be expect and yet in this respect we be far from the point which have be reach by the more highly civilized white race as we continue to progress crime among we will gradually lose much of its brutal vulgar i might say healthy aspect and become more delicate refined and subtle then it will be less shocking and noticeable although more dangerous to society then drop he tone of irony he continue with some show of eloquence : but above all when i be discourage and dishearten i have this to fall back on : if there be a principle of right in the world which finally prevail and i believe that there be if there be a merciful but justice-loving god in heaven and i believe that there be we shall win for we have right on we side while those who oppose we can defend themselves by nothing in the moral law nor even by anything in the enlighten thought of the present age for several day together with other topic we discuss the race problem not only of the united state but as it affect native african and jew finally before we reach boston we conversation have grow familiar and personal i have tell he something of my past and much about my intention for the future i learn that he be a physician a graduate of howard university washington and have do post-graduate work in philadelphium and this be he second trip abroad to attend professional course he have practice for some year in the city of washington and though he do not say so i gather that he practice be a lucrative one before we leave the ship he have make I promise that i would stop two or three day in washington before go on south we put up at a hotel in boston for a couple of day and visit several of my new friend 's acquaintance they be all people of education and culture and apparently of means i could not help be strike by the great difference between they and the same class of color people in the south in speech and think they be genuine yankee the difference be especially noticeable in they speech there be none of that heavy-tongued enunciation which characterize even the best-educated color people of the south it be remarkable after all what a adaptable creature the negro be i have see the black west indian gentleman in london and he be in speech and manners a perfect englishman i have see native of haitus and martinique in pari and they be more frenchy than a frenchman i have no doubt that the negro would make a good chinaman with exception of the pigtail my stay in washington instead of be two or three day be two or three week this be my first visit to the national capital and i be of course interested in see the public building and something of the working of the government but most of my time i spend with the doctor among he friend and acquaintance the social phase of life among color people be more develop in washington than in any other city in the country this be on account of the large number of individual earn good salary and have a reasonable amount of leisure time to draw from there be dozen of physician and lawyer score of school teacher and hundred of clerk in the department as to the color department clerk i think it fair to say that in educational equipment they average above the white clerk of the same grade for whereas a color college graduate will seek such a job the white university man go into one of the many higher vocation which be open to he in a previous chapter i speak of social life among color people so there be no need to take it up again here but there be one thing i do not mention : among negro themselves there be the peculiar inconsistency of a color question its existence be rarely admit and hardly ever mention it may not be too strong a statement to say that the greater portion of the race be unconscious of its influence yet this influence though silent be constant it be evidence most plainly in marriage selection thus the black man generally marry woman fairer than themselves while on the other hand the dark woman of stronger mental endowment be very often marry to light-complexioned man the effect be a tendency toward lighter complexion especially among the more active element in the race some might claim that this be a tacit admission of color people among themselves of they own inferiority judge by the color line i do not think so what i have term a inconsistency be after all most natural it be in fact a tendency in accordance with what might be call a economic necessity so far as racial difference go the united state put a greater premium on color or better lack of color than upon anything else in the world to paraphrase have a white skin and all thing else may be add unto you i have see advertisement in newspaper for waiter bell-boy or elevator man which read : light-colored man want it be this tremendous pressure which the sentiment of the country exert that be operate on the race there be involve not only the question of higher opportunity but often the question of earn a livelihood and so i say it be not strange but a natural tendency nor be it any more a sacrifice of self-respect that a black man should give to he child every advantage he can which complexion of the skin carry than that the new or vulgar rich should purchase for they child the advantage which ancestry aristocracy and social position carry i once hear a color man sum it up in these word : it be no disgrace to be black but it be often very inconvenient washington show the negro not only at he best but also at he worst as i drive around with the doctor he comment rather harshly on those of the latter class which we see he remark : you see those lazy loaf good-for-nothing darky they be not worth digging grave for yet they be the one who create impression of the race for the casual observer it be because they be always in evidence on the street corner while the rest of we be hard at work and you know a dozen loaf darky make a bigger crowd and a worse impression in this country than fifty white man of the same class but they ought not to represent the race we be the race and the race ought to be judge by we not by they every race and every nation should be judge by the best it have be able to produce not by the worst the recollection of my stay in washington be a pleasure to I now in company with the doctor i visit howard university the public school the excellent color hospital with which he be in some way connect if i remember correctly and many comfortable and even elegant home it be with some reluctance that i continue my journey south the doctor be very kind in give I letter to people in richmond and nashville when i tell he that i intend to stop in both of these city in richmond a man who be then editing a very creditable color newspaper give I a great deal of he time and make my stay there of three or four day very pleasant in nashville i spend a whole day at fisk university the home of the jubilee singer and be more than repay for my time among my letter of introduction be one to a very prosperous physician he drive I about the city and introduce I to a number of people from nashville i go to atlanta where i stay long enough to gratify a old desire to see atlanta university again i then continue my journey to macon during the trip from nashville to atlanta i go into the smoking-compartment of the car to smoke a cigar i be travel in a pullman not because of a abundance of fund but because through my experience with my millionaire a certain amount of comfort and luxury have become a necessity to I whenever it be obtainable when i enter the car i find only a couple of man there but in a half-hour there be half a dozen or more from the general conversation i learn that a fat jewish-looking man be a cigar manufacturer and be experiment in grow havana tobacco in florida that a slender bespectacled young man be from ohio and a professor in some state institution in alabama that a white-mustached well-dressed man be a old union soldier who have fight through the civil war and that a tall raw-boned red-faced man who seem bent on leave nobody in ignorance of the fact that he be from texa be a cotton planter in the north man may ride together for hour in a smoker and unless they be acquaint with each other never exchange a word in the south man throw together in such manner be friend in fifteen minute there be always present a warm-hearted cordiality which will melt down the most frigid reserve it may be because southerner be very much like frenchman in that they must talk and not only must they talk but they must express they opinion the talk in the car be for a while miscellaneous -- on the weather crop business prospects the old union soldier have invest capital in atlanta and he predict that that city would soon be one of the greatest in the country finally the conversation drift to politics then as a natural sequence turn upon the negro question in the discussion of the race question the diplomacy of the jew be something to be admire he have the faculty of agree with everybody without lose he allegiance to any side he know that to sanction negro oppression would be to sanction jewish oppression and would expose he to a shoot along that line from the old soldier who stand firmly on the ground of equal rights and opportunity to all man long tradition and business instinct tell he when in rome to act as a roman altogether he position be a delicate one and i give he credit for the skill he display in maintain it the young professor be apologetic he have have the same view as the gar man but a year in the south have open he eye and he have to confess that the problem could hardly be handle any better than it be be handle by the southern whites to which the gar man respond somewhat rudely that he have spend ten time as many year in the south as he young friend and that he could easily understand how hold a position in a state institution in alabama would bring about a change of view the professor turn very red and have very little more to say the texan be fierce eloquent and profane in he argument and in a lower sense there be a direct logic in what he say which be convince it be only by take higher ground by deal in what southerner call theory that he could be combate occasionally some one of the several other man in the smoker would throw in a remark to reinforce what he say but he really do not need any help he be sufficient in himself in the course of a short time the controversy narrow itself down to a argument between the old soldier and the texan the latter maintained hotly that the civil war be a criminal mistake on the part of the north and that the humiliation which the south suffer during reconstruction could never be forget the union man retort just as hotly that the south be responsible for the war and that the spirit of unforgetfulness on its part be the greatest cause of present friction that it seem to be the one great aim of the south to convince the north that the latter make a mistake in fight to preserve the union and liberate the slave can you imagine he go on to say what would have be the condition of thing eventually if there have be no war and the south have be allow to follow its course instead of one great prosperous country with nothing before it but the conquest of peace a score of petty republic as in central and south america waste they energy in war with each other or in revolution well reply the texan anything -- no country at all -- be better than have nigger over you but anyhow the war be fight and the nigger be free for it be no use beat around the bush the nigger and not the union be the cause of it and now do you believe that all the nigger on earth be worth the good white blood that be spill you free the nigger and you give he the ballot but you could not make a citizen out of he he do not know what he be vote for and we buy 'em like so many hog you be give 'em education but that only make slick rascal out of 'em do not fancy for a moment say the northern man that you have any monopoly in buy ignorant vote the same thing be do on a larger scale in new york and boston and in chicago and san francisco and they be not black vote either as to education 's make the negro worse you might just as well tell I that religion do the same thing and by the way how many educate color man do you know personally the texan admit that he know only one and add that he be in the penitentiary but he say do you mean to claim ballot or no ballot education or no education that nigger be the equal of white man that be not the question answer the other but if the negro be so distinctly inferior it be a strange thing to I that it take such tremendous effort on the part of the white man to make he realize it and to keep he in the same place into which inferior man naturally fall however let we grant for sake of argument that the negro be inferior in every respect to the white man that fact only increase we moral responsibility in regard to we action toward he inequality of number wealth and power even of intelligence and moral should make no difference in the essential rights of man if he be inferior and weaker and be shove to the wall that be he own look-out say the texan that be the law of nature and he be bind to go to the wall for no race in the world have ever be able to stand competition with the anglo-saxon the anglo-saxon race have always be and always will be the master of the world and the nigger in the south be not go to change all the record of history my friend say the old soldier slowly if you have study history will you tell I as confidentially between white man what the anglo-saxon have ever do the texan be too much astonish by the question to venture any reply he opponent continue : can you name a single one of the great fundamental and original intellectual achievement which have raise man in the scale of civilization that may be credit to the anglo-saxon the art of letter of poetry of music of sculpture of painting of the drama of architecture the science of mathematics of astronomy of philosophy of logic of physics of chemistry the use of the metal and the principle of mechanic be all invent or discover by darker and what we now call inferior race and nation we have carry many of these to they highest point of perfection but the foundation be lay by other do you know the only original contribution to civilization we can claim be what we have do in steam and electricity and in make implement of war more deadly and there we work largely on principle which we do not discover why we do not even originate the religion we use we be a great race the greatest in the world today but we ought to remember that we be stand on a pile of past race and enjoy we position with a little less show of arrogance we be simply have we turn at the game and we be a long time get to it after all racial supremacy be merely a matter of date in history the man here who belong to what be all in all the greatest race the world ever produce be almost ashamed to own it if the anglo-saxon be the source of everything good and great in the human race from the begin why be not the german forest the birthplace of civilization rather than the valley of the nile the texan be somewhat disconcerted for the argument have pass a little beyond he limit but he swing it back to where he be sure of he ground by say : all that may be true but it have not get much to do with we and the nigger here in the south we have get 'em here and we have get 'em to live with and it be a question of white man or nigger no middle ground you want we to treat nigger as equal do you want to see 'em sit around in we parlor do you want to see a mulatto south to bring it right home to you would you let you daughter marry a nigger no i would not consent to my daughter 's marry a nigger but that do not prevent my treat a black man fairly and i do not see what fair treatment have to do with nigger sit around in you parlor they can not come there unless they be invite out of all the white man i know only a hundred or so have the privilege of sit around in my parlor as to the mulatto south if you southerner have one boast that be stronger than another it be you woman you put they on a pinnacle of purity and virtue and bow down in a chivalric worship before they yet you talk and act as though should you treat the negro fairly and take the anti-inter-marriage law off you statute book these same woman would rush into the arm of black lover and husband it be a wonder to I that they do not rise up and resent the insult colonel say the texan as he reach into he handbag and bring out a large flask of whisky you might argue from now until hell freeze over and you might convince I that you be right but you 'll never convince I that i be wrong all you say sound very good but it be get nothing to do with fact you can say what man ought to be but they be not that so there you be down here in the south we be up against fact and we be meet 'em like fact we do not believe the nigger be or ever will be the equal of the white man and we be not go to treat he as a equal i 'll be damned if we will have a drink everybody except the professor partook of the generous texan 's flask and the argument close in a general laugh and good feeling i go back into the main part of the car with the conversation on my mind here i have before I the bald raw naked aspect of the race question in the south and in consideration of the step i be just take it be far from encourage the sentiment of the texan -- and he express the sentiment of the south -- fall upon I like a chill i be sick at heart yet i must confess that underneath it all i feel a certain sort of admiration for the man who could not be sway from what he hold as he principle contrast with he the young ohio professor be indeed a pitiable character and all along in spite of myself i have be compel to accord the same kind of admiration to the southern white man for the manner in which he defend not only he virtue but he vice he know that judge by a high standard he be narrow and prejudiced that he be guilty of unfairness oppression and cruelty but this he defend as stoutly as he would he better quality this same spirit obtain in a great degree among the black they too defend they fault and failing this they generally do whenever white people be concerned and yet among themselves they be they own most merciless critic i have never hear the race so terribly arraign as i have by color speaker to strictly color audience it be the spirit of the south to defend everything belong to it the north be too cosmopolitan and tolerant for such a spirit if you should say to a easterner that pari be a gayer city than new york he would be likely to agree with you or at least to let you have you own way but to suggest to a south carolinian that boston be a nicer city to live in than charleston would be to stir he greatest depths of argument and eloquence but to-day as i think over that smoking-car argument i can see it in a different light the texan 's position do not render thing so hopeless for it indicate that the main difficulty of the race question do not lie so much in the actual condition of the black as it do in the mental attitude of the whites and a mental attitude especially one not base on truth can be change more easily than actual condition that be to say the burden of the question be not that the whites be struggle to save ten million despondent and moribund people from sink into a hopeless slough of ignorance poverty and barbarity in they very midst but that they be unwilling to open certain door of opportunity and to accord certain treatment to ten million aspiring education-and-property-acquiring people in a word the difficulty of the problem be not so much due to the fact present as to the hypothesis assume for its solution in this it be similar to the problem of the solar system by a complex confusing and almost contradictory mathematical process by the use of zigzag instead of straight line the earth can be prove to be the center of thing celestial but by a operation so simple that it can be comprehend by a schoolboy its position can be verify among the other world which revolve about the sun and its movement harmonize with the law of the universe so when the white race assume as a hypothesis that it be the main object of creation and that all thing else be merely subsidiary to its well-being sophism subterfuge perversion of conscience arrogance injustice oppression cruelty sacrifice of human blood all be require to maintain the position and its dealings with other race become indeed a problem a problem which if base on a hypothesis of common humanity could be solve by the simple rule of justice when i reach macon i decide to leave my trunk and all my surplus belongings to pack my bag and strike out into the interior this i do and by train by mule and ox-cart i travel through many county this be my first real experience among rural color people and all that i saw be interesting to I but there be a great deal which do not require description at my hand for log cabin and plantation and dialect-speaking darky be perhaps better know in american literature than any other single picture of we national life indeed they form a ideal and exclusive literary concept of the american negro to such a extent that it be almost impossible to get the read public to recognize he in any other set so i shall endeavor to avoid give the reader any already overworked and hackneyed description this generally accept literary ideal of the american negro constitute what be really a obstacle in the way of the thoughtful and progressive element of the race he character have be establish as a happy-go-lucky laughing shuffling banjo-picking be and the read public have not yet be prevail upon to take he seriously he effort to elevate himself socially be look upon as a sort of absurd caricature of white civilization a novel deal with color people who live in respectable home and amidst a fair degree of culture and who naturally act just like white folk would be take in a comic-opera sense in this respect the negro be much in the position of a great comedian who give up the lighter role to play tragedy no matter how well he may portray the deeper passion the public be loath to give he up in he old character they even conspire to make he a failure in serious work in order to force he back into comedy in the same respect the public be not too much to be blame for great comedian be far more scarce than mediocre tragedian every amateur actor be a tragedian however this very fact constitute the opportunity of the future negro novelist and poet to give the country something new and unknown in depict the life the ambition the struggle and the passion of those of they race who be strive to break the narrow limit of tradition a beginning have already be make in that remarkable book by dr du bois _ the soul of black folk _ much too that i saw while on this trip in spite of my enthusiasm be disheartening often i thought of what my millionaire have say to I and wish myself back in europe the house in which i have to stay be generally uncomfortable sometimes worse i often have to sleep in a division or compartment with several other people once or twice i be not so fortunate as to find division everybody sleep on pallet on the floor frequently i be able to lie down and contemplate the star which be in they zenith the food be at time so distasteful and poorly cook that i could not eat it i remember that once i live for a week or more on buttermilk on account of not be able to stomach the fat bacon the rank turnip-top and the heavy damp mixture of meal salt and water which be call corn bread it be only my ambition to do the work which i have plan that keep I steadfast to my purpose occasionally i would meet with some sign of progress and uplift in even one of these back-wood settlement -- house build of board with window and divide into room decent food and a fair standard of live this condition be due to the fact that there be in the community some exceptionally capable negro farmer whose thrift serve as a example as i go about among these dull simple people -- the great majority of they hard work in they relation with the whites submissive faithful and often affectionate negatively content with they lot -- and contrast they with those of the race who have be quicken by the force of thought i could not but appreciate the logic of the position hold by those southern leader who have be bold enough to proclaim against the education of the negro they be consistent in they public speech with southern sentiment and desire those public man of the south who have not be daring or heedless enough to defy the ideal of twentieth-century civilization and of modern humanitarianism and philanthropy find themselves in the embarrassing situation of preach one thing and pray for another they be in the position of the fashionable woman who be compel by the law of polite society to say to she dearest enemy : how happy i be to see you and yet in this respect how perplexing be southern character for in opposition to the above it may be say that the claim of the southern whites that they love the negro better than the northern whites do be in a manner true northern white people love the negro in a sort of abstract way as a race through a sense of justice charity and philanthropy they will liberally assist in he elevation a number of they have heroically spend they life in this effort -lrb- and just here i wish to say that when the color people reach the monument-building stage they should not forget the man and woman who go south after the war and found school for they -rrb- yet generally speak they have no particular liking for individual of the race southern white people despise the negro as a race and will do nothing to aid in he elevation as such but for certain individual they have a strong affection and be helpful to they in many way with these individual member of the race they live on term of the greatest intimacy they entrust to they they child they family treasure and they family secret in trouble they often go to they for comfort and counsel in sickness they often rely upon they care this affectionate relation between the southern whites and those black who come into close touch with they have not be overdrawn even in fiction this perplexity of southern character extend even to the intermixture of the race that be speak of as though it be dread worse than smallpox leprosy or the plague yet when i be in jacksonville i know several prominent family there with large color branch which go by the same name and be know and acknowledge as blood relative and what be more there seem to exist between these black brother and sister and uncle and aunt a decidedly friendly feeling i say above that southern whites would do nothing for the negro as a race i know the south claim that it have spend million for the education of the black and that it have of its own free will shoulder this awful burden it seem to be forgetful of the fact that these million have be take from the public tax fund for education and that the law of political economy which recognize the land owner as the one who really pay the tax be not tenable it would be just as reasonable for the relatively few land owner of manhattan to complain that they have to stand the financial burden of the education of the thousand and thousand of child whose parent pay rent for tenement and flat let the million of produce and consume negro be take out of the south and it would be quickly see how much less of public fund there would be to appropriate for education or any other purpose in thus travel about through the country i be sometimes amuse on arrive at some little railroad-station town to be take for and treat as a white man and six hour later when it be learn that i be stop at the house of the color preacher or school teacher to note the attitude of the whole town change at time this lead even to embarrassment yet it can not be so embarrassing for a color man to be take for white as for a white man to be take for color and i have hear of several case of the latter kind all this while i be gather material for work jot down in my note-book theme and melody and try to catch the spirit of the negro in he relatively primitive state i begin to feel the necessity of hurry so that i might get back to some city like nashville to begin my composition and at the same time earn at least a living by teaching and perform before my fund give out at the last settlement in which i stop i find a mine of material this be due to the fact that big meeting be in progress big meeting be a institution something like camp-meet the difference be that it be hold in a permanent church and not in a temporary structure all the church of some one denomination -- of course either methodist or baptist -- in a county or perhaps in several adjoining county be close and the congregation unite at some centrally located church for a series of meeting last a week it be really a social as well as a religious function the people come in great number make the trip accord to they financial status in buggy draw by sleek fleet-footed mule in ox-cart or on foot it be amusing to see some of the latter class trudge down the hot and dusty road with they shoe which be brand-new string across they shoulder when they get near the church they sit on the side of the road and with many grimace tenderly pack they foot into those instrument of torture this furnished indeed a try test of they religion the famous preacher come from near and far and take turn in warn sinner of the day of wrath food in the form of those two southern luxury fry chicken and roast pork be plentiful and no one need go hungry on the opening Sunday the woman be immaculate in starched stiff white dress adorn with ribbon either red or blue even a great many of the man wear streamer of vari-colored ribbon in the buttonhole of they coat a few of they carefully cultivate a forelock of hair by wrap it in twine and on such festive occasion decorate it with a narrow ribbon streamer big meeting afford a fine opportunity to the younger people to meet each other dress in they Sunday clothes and much rustic court which be as enjoyable as any other kind be indulge in this big meeting which i be lucky enough to catch be particularly well attend the extra large attendance be due principally to two attraction a man by the name of john brown who be renown as the most powerful preacher for mile around and a wonderful leader of singing who be know as singing johnson these two man be a study and a revelation to I they cause I to reflect upon how great a influence they type have be in the development of the negro in america both these type be now look upon generally with condescension or contempt by the progressive element among the color people but it should never be forget that it be they who lead the race from paganism and keep it steadfast to christianity through all the long dark year of slavery john brown be a jet-black man of medium size with a strikingly intelligent head and face and a voice like a organ peal he preach each night after several lesser light have successively hold the pulpit during a hour or so as far as subject-matter be concern all of the sermon be alike : each begin with the fall of man run through various trial and tribulation of the hebrew child on to the redemption by christ and end with a fervid picture of the judgment day and the fate of the damned but john brown possess magnetism and a imagination so free and daring that he be able to carry through what the other preacher would not attempt he know all the art and trick of oratory the modulation of the voice to almost a whisper the pause for effect the rise through light rapid-fire sentence to the terrific thundering outburst of a electrifying climax in addition he have the intuition of a bear theatrical manager night after night this man hold I fascinate he convince I that after all eloquence consist more in the manner of say than in what be say it be largely a matter of tone picture the most striking example of john brown 's magnetism and imagination be he heavenly march i shall never forget how it impress I when i hear it he open he sermon in the usual way then proclaim to he listener that he be go to take they on the heavenly march he seize the bible under he arm and begin to pace up and down the pulpit platform the congregation immediately begin with they foot a tramp tramp tramp in time with the preacher 's march in the pulpit all the while singing in a undertone a hymn about march to zion suddenly he cry : halt every foot stop with the precision of a company of well-drilled soldier and the singing cease the morning star have be reach here the preacher describe the beauty of that celestial body then the march the tramp tramp tramp and the singing be again take up another halt they have reach the evening star and so on past the sun and moon -- the intensity of religious emotion all the time increase -- along the milky way on up to the gate of heaven here the halt be longer and the preacher describe at length the gate and wall of the new jerusalem then he take he hearer through the pearly gate along the golden street point out the glory of the city pause occasionally to greet some patriarchal member of the church well-known to most of he listener in life who have have the tear wipe from they eye be clothe in robe of spotless white with crown of gold upon they head and harp within they hand and end he march before the great white throne to the reader this may sound ridiculous but listen to under the circumstance it be highly and effectively dramatic i be a more or less sophisticated and non-religious man of the world but the torrent of the preacher 's word move with the rhythm and glowing with the eloquence of primitive poetry sweep I along and i too feel like join in the shout of amen hallelujah john brown 's power in describe the delight of heaven be no greater than those in depict the horror of hell i see great strapping fellow tremble and weep like child at the mourner ' bench he warning to sinner be truly terrible i shall never forget one expression that he use which for originality and aptness could not be excel in my opinion it be more graphic and for we far more expressive than st paul 's it be hard to kick against the prick he strike the attitude of a pugilist and thunder out : young man you arm 's too short to box with god interesting as be john brown to I the other man singing johnson be more so he be a small dark-brown one-eyed man with a clear strong high-pitched voice a leader of singing a maker of song a man who could improvise at the moment line to fit the occasion not so striking a figure as john brown but at big meeting equally important it be indispensable to the success of the singing when the congregation be a large one make up of people from different community to have someone with a strong voice who know just what hymn to sing and when to sing it who can pitch it in the right key and who have all the lead line commit to memory sometimes it devolve upon the leader to sing down a long-winded or uninteresting speaker commit to memory the lead line of all the negro spiritual song be no easy task for they run up into the hundred but the accomplished leader must know they all because the congregation sing only the refrain and repeat every ear in the church be fix upon he and if he become mixed in he line or forget they the responsibility fall directly on he shoulder for example most of these hymn be construct to be sing in the follow manner : leader _ swing low sweet chariot _ congregation _ come for to carry I home _ leader _ swing low sweet chariot _ congregation _ come for to carry I home _ leader _ i look over yonder what do i see _ congregation _ come for to carry I home _ leader _ two little angel come after I _ congregation _ come for to carry I home _ the solitary and plaintive voice of the leader be answer by a sound like the roll of the sea produce a most curious effect in only a few of these song do the leader and the congregation start off together such a song be the well-known steal away to jesus the leader and the congregation begin with part-singing : _ steal away steal away steal away to jesus steal away steal away home i be not get long to stay here _ then the leader alone or the congregation in unison : _ my lord he call I he call I by the thunder the trumpet sound within-a my soul _ then all together : _ i be not get long to stay here _ the leader and the congregation again take up the opening refrain then the leader sing three more leading line alone and so on almost _ ad infinitum _ it will be see that even here most of the work fall upon the leader for the congregation sing the same line over and over while he memory and ingenuity be tax to keep the song go generally the part take up by the congregation be sing in a three-part harmony the woman sing the soprano and a transpose tenor the man with high voice sing the melody and those with low voice a thundering bass in a few of these song however the lead part be sing in unison by the whole congregation down to the last line which be harmonize the effect of this be intensely thrilling such a hymn be go down mose it stir the heart like a trumpet call singing johnson be a ideal leader and he service be in great demand he spend he time go about the country from one church to another he receive he support in much the same way as the preacher -- part of a collection food and lodge all of he leisure time he devote to originate new word and melody and new line for old song he always sing with he eye -- or to be more exact he eye -- close indicate the _ tempo _ by swing he head to and fro he be a great judge of the proper hymn to sing at a particular moment and i notice several time when the preacher reach a certain climax or express a certain sentiment that johnson break in with a line or two of some appropriate hymn the speaker understand and would pause until the singing cease as i listen to the singing of these song the wonder of they production grow upon I more and more how do the man who originate they manage to do it the sentiment be easily account for they be mostly take from the bible but the melody where do they come from some of they so weirdly sweet and other so wonderfully strong take for instance go down mose i doubt that there be a stronger theme in the whole musical literature of the world and so many of these song contain more than mere melody there be sound in they that elusive undertone the note in music which be not hear with the ear i sit often with the tear roll down my cheek and my heart melt within I any musical person who have never hear a negro congregation under the spell of religious fervor sing these old song have miss one of the most thrilling emotion which the human heart may experience anyone who without shed tear can listen to negro sing nobody know de trouble i see nobody know but jesus must indeed have a heart of stone as yet the negro themselves do not fully appreciate these old slave song the educate class be rather ashamed of they and prefer to sing hymn from book this feeling be natural they be still too close to the condition under which the song be produce but the day will come when this slave music will be the most treasured heritage of the american negro at the close of the big meeting i leave the settlement where it be be hold full of enthusiasm i be in that frame of mind which in the artistic temperament amount to inspiration i be now ready and anxious to get to some place where i might settle down to work and give expression to the idea which be teem in my head but i stray into another deviation from my path of life as i have it mark out which lead I upon a entirely different road instead of go to the nearest and most convenient railroad station i accept the invitation of a young man who have be present the closing Sunday at the meeting to drive with he some mile farther to the town in which he teach school and there take the train my conversation with this young man as we drive along through the country be extremely interesting he have be a student in one of the negro college -- strange coincidence in the very college as i learn through he in which shiny be now a professor i be of course curious to hear about my boyhood friend and have it not be vacation time and that i be not sure that i should find he i should have go out of my way to pay he a visit but i determine to write to he as soon as the school open my companion talk to I about he work among the people of he hope and he discouragement he be tremendously in earnest i might say too much so in fact it may be say that the majority of intelligent color people be in some degree too much in earnest over the race question they assume and carry so much that they progress be at time impede and they be unable to see thing in they proper proportion in many instance a slight exercise of the sense of humor would save much anxiety of soul anyone who mark the general tone of editorial in color newspaper be apt to be impress with this idea if the mass of negro take they present and future as seriously as do the most of they leader the race would be in no mental condition to sustain the terrible pressure which it undergo it would sink of its own weight yet it must be acknowledge that in the making of a race overseriousness be a far lesser fail than its reverse and even the fault result from it lean toward the right we drive into the town just before dark as we pass a large unpainted church my companion point it out as the place where he hold he school i promise that i would go there with he the next morning and visit awhile the town be of that kind which hardly require or deserve description a straggle line of brick and wooden store on one side of the railroad track and some cottage of various size on the other side constitute about the whole of it the young school teacher board at the best house in the place own by a color man it be paint have glass window contain store buy furniture a organ and lamp with chimney the owner hold a job of some kind on the railroad after supper it be not long before everybody be sleepy i occupy the room with the school teacher in a few minute after we get into the room he be in bed and asleep but i take advantage of the unusual luxury of a lamp which give light and sit look over my note and jot down some idea which be still fresh in my mind suddenly i become conscious of that sense of alarm which be always arouse by the sound of hurry footstep on the silence of the night i stop work and look at my watch it be after eleven i listen strain every nerve to hear above the tumult of my quicken pulse i catch the murmur of voice then the gallop of a horse then of another and another now thoroughly alarmed i wake my companion and together we both listen after a moment he put out the light and softly open the window-blind and we cautiously peep out we see man move in one direction and from the muttering we vaguely catch the rumor that some terrible crime have be commit i put on my coat and hat my friend do all in he power to dissuade I from venture out but it be impossible for I to remain in the house under such tense excitement my nerve would not have stand it perhaps what bravery i exercise in go out be due to the fact that i feel sure my identity as a color man have not yet become know in the town i go out and follow the drift reach the railroad station there be gather there a crowd of man all white and other be steadily arrive seemingly from all the surrounding country how do the news spread so quickly i watch these man move under the yellow glare of the kerosene lamp about the station stern comparatively silent all of they arm some of they in boot and spur fierce determine man i have come to know the type well blond tall and lean with ragged mustache and beard and glittering gray eye at the first suggestion of daylight they begin to disperse in group go in several direction there be no extra noise or excitement no loud talk only swift sharp word of command give by those who seem to be accept as leader by mutual understanding in fact the impression make upon I be that everything be be do in quite a orderly manner in spite of so many leave the crowd around the station continue to grow at sunrise there be a great many woman and child by this time i also notice some color people a few seem to be go about customary task several be stand on the outskirts of the crowd but the gathering of negro usually see in such town be miss before noon they bring he in two horseman ride abreast between they half drag the poor wretch make he way through the dust he hand be tie behind he and rope around he body be fasten to the saddle horn of he double guard the man who at midnight have be stern and silent be now emit that terror-instilling sound know as the rebel yell a space be quickly clear in the crowd and a rope place about he neck when from somewhere come the suggestion burn he it run like a electric current have you ever witness the transformation of human being into savage beast nothing can be more terrible a railroad tie be sink into the ground the rope be remove and a chain bring and securely coil around the victim and the stake there he stand a man only in form and stature every sign of degeneracy stamp upon he countenance he eye be dull and vacant indicate not a single ray of thought evidently the realization of he fearful fate have rob he of whatever reasoning power he have ever possess he be too stunned and stupefied even to tremble fuel be bring from everywhere oil the torch the flame crouch for a instant as though to gather strength then leap up as high as they victim 's head he squirm he writhe strain at he chain then give out cry and groan that i shall always hear the cry and groan be choke off by the fire and smoke but he eye bulge from they socket roll from side to side appeal in vain for help some of the crowd yell and cheer other seem appal at what they have do and there be those who turn away sicken at the sight i be fix to the spot where i stand powerless to take my eye from what i do not want to see it be over before i realize that time have elapse before i could make myself believe that what i saw be really happen i be look at a scorched post a smolder fire blacken bone char fragment sift down through coil of chain and the smell of burnt flesh -- human flesh -- be in my nostril i walk a short distance away and sit down in order to clear my dazed mind a great wave of humiliation and shame sweep over I shame that i belong to a race that could be so deal with and shame for my country that it the great example of democracy to the world should be the only civilized if not the only state on earth where a human be would be burn alive my heart turn bitter within I i could understand why negro be lead to sympathize with even they worst criminal and to protect they when possible by all the impulse of normal human nature they can and should do nothing less whenever i hear protest from the south that it should be leave alone to deal with the negro question my thought go back to that scene of brutality and savagery i do not see how a people that can find in its conscience any excuse whatever for slowly burn to death a human being or for tolerate such a act can be entrust with the salvation of a race of course there be in the south man of liberal thought who do not approve lynching but i wonder how long they will endure the limit which be place upon free speech they still cower and tremble before southern opinion even so late as the recent atlanta riot those man who be brave enough to speak a word in behalf of justice and humanity feel call upon by way of apology to preface what they say with a glowing rhetorical tribute to the anglo-saxon 's superiority and to refer to the great and impassable gulf between the race fix by the creator at the foundation of the world the question of the relative quality of the two race be still a open one the reference to the great gulf lose force in face of the fact that there be in this country perhaps three or four million people with the blood of both race in they vein but i fail to see the pertinency of either statement subsequent to the beating and murder of score of innocent people in the street of a civilized and christian city the southern whites be in many respects a great people look at from a certain point of view they be picturesque if one will put oneself in a romantic frame of mind one can admire they notion of chivalry and bravery and justice in this same frame of mind a intelligent man can go to the theater and applaud the impossible hero who with he single sword slay everybody in the play except the equally impossible heroine so can a ordinary peace-loving citizen sit by a comfortable fire and read with enjoyment of the bloody deed of pirate and the fierce brutality of viking this be the way in which we gratify the old underlie animal instinct and passion but we should shudder with horror at the mere idea of such practice be reality in this day of enlighten and humanitarianize think the southern whites be not yet live quite in the present age many of they general idea hark back to a former century some of they to the dark age in the light of other day they be sometimes magnificent today they be often cruel and ludicrous how long i sit with bitter thought run through my mind i do not know perhaps a hour or more when i decide to get up and go back to the house i find that i could hardly stand on my foot i be as weak as a man who have lose blood however i drag myself along with the central idea of a general plan well fix in my mind i do not find my school teacher friend at home so i do not see he again i swallow a few mouthful of food pack my bag and catch the afternoon train when i reach macon i stop only long enough to get the main part of my luggage and to buy a ticket for new york all along the journey i be occupy in debate with myself the step which i have decide to take i argue that to forsake one 's race to better one 's condition be no less worthy a action than to forsake one 's country for the same purpose i finally make up my mind that i would neither disclaim the black race nor claim the white race but that i would change my name raise a mustache and let the world take I for what it would that it be not necessary for I to go about with a label of inferiority paste across my forehead all the while i understand that it be not discouragement or fear or search for a larger field of action and opportunity that be drive I out of the negro race i know that it be shame unbearable shame shame at be identify with a people that could with impunity be treat worse than animal for certainly the law would restrain and punish the malicious burning alive of animal so once again i find myself gaze at the tower of new york and wonder what future that city hold in store for I xi i have now reach that part of my narrative where i must be brief and touch only on important fact therefore the reader must make up he mind to pardon skip and jump and meager detail when i reach new york i be completely lose i could not have feel more a stranger have i be suddenly drop into constantinople i know not where to turn or how to strike out i be so oppressed by a feeling of loneliness that the temptation to visit my old home in connecticut be well-nigh irresistible i reason however that unless i find my old music teacher i should be after so many year of absence as much of a stranger there as in new york and furthermore that in view of the step which i have decide to take such a visit would be injudicious i remember too that i have some property there in the shape of a piano and a few book but decide that it would not be worth what it might cost I to take possession by reason of the fact that my living expense in the south have be very small i still have nearly four hundred dollar of my capital leave in contemplation of this my natural and acquire bohemian taste assert themselves and i decide to have a couple of week ' good time before worry seriously about the future i go to coney island and the other resort take in the pre-season show along broadway and eat at first-class restaurant but i shun the old sixth avenue district as though it be pest-infected my few day of pleasure make appalling inroad upon what cash i have and cause I to see that it require a good deal of money to live in new york as i wish to live and that i should have to find very soon some more or less profitable employment i be sure that unknown without friend or prestige it would be useless to try to establish myself as a teacher of music so i give that means of earn a livelihood scarcely any consideration and even have i consider it possible to secure pupil as i then feel i should have hesitate about take up a work in which the chance for any considerable financial success be necessarily so small i have make up my mind that since i be not go to be a negro i would avail myself of every possible opportunity to make a white man 's success and that if it can be sum up in any one word mean money i watch the want column in the newspaper and answer a number of advertisement but in each case find the position be such as i could not fill or do not want i also spend several dollar for ad which bring I no reply in this way i come to know the hope and disappointment of a large and pitiable class of humanity in this great city the people who look for work through the newspaper after some day of this sort of experience i conclude that the main difficulty with I be that i be not prepare for what i want to do i then decide upon a course which for a artist show a uncommon amount of practical sense and judgment i make up my mind to enter a business college i take a small room eat at lunch counter in order to economize and pursued my study with the zeal that i have always be able to put into any work upon which i set my heart yet in spite of all my economy when i have be at the school for several month my fund give out completely i reach the point where i could not afford sufficient food for each day in this plight i be glad to get through one of the teacher a job as a ordinary clerk in a downtown wholesale house i do my work faithfully and receive a raise of salary before i expect it i even manage to save a little money out of my modest earnings in fact i begin then to contract the money fever which later take strong possession of I i keep my eye open watch for a chance to better my condition it finally come in the form of a position with a house which be at the time establish a south american department my knowledge of spanish be of course the principal cause of my good luck and it do more for I : it place I where the other clerk be practically put out of competition with I i be not slow in take advantage of the opportunity to make myself indispensable to the firm what a interesting and absorb game be money-making after each deposit at my savings-bank i use to sit and figure out all over again my principal and interest and make calculation on what the increase would be in such and such time out of this i derive a great deal of pleasure i deny myself as much as possible in order to swell my savings as much as i enjoy smoking i limited myself to a occasional cigar and that be generally of a variety which in my old day at the club be know as a henry mud drinking i cut out altogether but that be no great sacrifice the day on which i be able to figure up a thousand dollar mark a epoch in my life and this be not because i have never before have money in my gambling day and while i be with my millionaire i handle sum run high up into the hundred but they have come to I like fairy godmother 's gift and at a time when my conception of money be that it be make only to spend here on the other hand be a thousand dollar which i have earn by day of honest and patient work a thousand dollar which i have carefully watch grow from the first dollar and i experience in own they a pride and satisfaction which to I be a entirely new sensation as my capital go over the thousand-dollar mark i be puzzle to know what to do with it how to put it to the most advantageous use i turn down first one scheme and then another as though they have be devise for the sole purpose of gobble up my money i finally listen to a friend who advise I to put all i have in new york real estate and under he guidance i take equity in a piece of property on which stand a rickety old tenement-house i do not regret follow this friend 's advice for in something like six month i dispose of my equity for more than double my investment from that time on i devoted myself to the study of new york real estate and watch for opportunity to make similar investment in spite of two or three speculation which do not turn out well i have be remarkably successful today i be the owner and part-owner of several flat-house i have change my place of employment four time since return to new york and each change have be a decide advancement concern the position which i now hold i shall say nothing except that it pay extremely well as my outlook on the world grow brighter i begin to mingle in the social circle of the man with whom i come in contact and gradually by a process of elimination i reach a grade of society of no small degree of culture my appearance be always good and my ability to play on the piano especially ragtime which be then at the height of its vogue make I a welcome guest the anomaly of my social position often appeal strongly to my sense of humor i frequently smile inwardly at some remark not altogether complimentary to people of color and more than once i feel like declaim : i be a color man do i not disprove the theory that one drop of negro blood render a man unfit many a night when i return to my room after a enjoyable evening i laugh heartily over what strike I as the capital joke i be play then i meet she and what i have regard as a joke be gradually change into the most serious question of my life i first see she at a musical which be give one evening at a house to which i be frequently invite i do not notice she among the other guest before she come forward and sing two sad little song when she begin i be out in the hallway where many of the man be gather but with the first few note i crowd with other into the doorway to see who the singer be when i see the girl the surprise which i have feel at the first sound of she voice be heighten she be almost tall and quite slender with lustrous yellow hair and eye so blue as to appear almost black she be as white as a lily and she be dress in white indeed she seem to I the most dazzlingly white thing i have ever see but it be not she delicate beauty which attract I most it be she voice a voice which make one wonder how tone of such passionate color could come from so fragile a body i determine that when the program be over i would seek a introduction to she but at the moment instead of be the easy man of the world i become again the bashful boy of fourteen and my courage fail I i contented myself with hover as near she as politeness would permit near enough to hear she voice which in conversation be low yet thrill like the deeper middle tone of a flute i watch the man gather round she talking and laughing in a easy manner and wonder how it be possible for they to do it but destiny my special destiny be at work i be stand near talk with affect gaiety to several young lady who however must have remark my preoccupation for my second sense of hearing be alert to what be be say by the group of which the girl in white be the center when i hear she say : i think he playing of chopin be exquisite and one of my friend in the group reply : you have not meet he allow I -- then turn to I old man when you have a moment i wish you to meet miss -- i do not know what she say to I or what i say to she i can remember that i try to be clever and experience a grow conviction that i be make myself appear more and more idiotic i be certain too that in spite of my italian-like complexion i be as red as a beet instead of take the car i walk home i need the air and exercise as a sort of sedative i be not sure whether my troubled condition of mind be due to the fact that i have be strike by love or to the feeling that i have make a bad impression upon she as the week go by and when i have meet she several more time i come to know that i be seriously in love and then begin for I day of worry for i have more than the usual doubt and fear of a young man in love to contend with up to this time i have assume and play my role as a white man with a certain degree of nonchalance a carelessness as to the outcome which make the whole thing more amusing to I than serious but now i cease to regard be a white man as a sort of practical joke my act have call for mere external effect now i begin to doubt my ability to play the part i watch she to see if she be scrutinize I to see if she be look for anything in I which make I differ from the other man she know in place of a old inward feeling of superiority over many of my friend i begin to doubt myself i begin even to wonder if i really be like the man i associate with if there be not after all a indefinable something which mark a difference but in spite of my doubt and timidity my affair progress and i finally feel sufficiently encourage to decide to ask she to marry I then begin the hardest struggle of my life whether to ask she to marry I under false color or to tell she the whole truth my sense of what be exigent make I feel there be no necessity of say anything but my inborn sense of honor rebel at even indirect deception in this case but however much i moralize on the question i find it more and more difficult to reach the point of confession the dread that i might lose she take possession of I each time i seek to speak and render it impossible for I to do so that moral courage require more than physical courage be no mere poetic fancy i be sure i should have find it easier to take the place of a gladiator no matter how fierce the numidian lion than to tell that slender girl that i have negro blood in my vein the fact which i have at time wish to cry out i now wish to hide forever during this time we be draw together a great deal by the mutual bond of music she love to hear I play chopin and be herself far from be a poor performer of he composition i think i carry she every new song that be publish which i think suitable to she voice and play the accompaniment for she over these song we be like two innocent child with new toy she have never be anything but innocent but my innocence be a transformation work by my love for she love which melt away my cynicism and whiten my sullied soul and give I back the wholesome dream of my boyhood my artistic temperament also undergo a awakening i spend many hour at my piano play over old and new composer i also write several little piece in a more or less chopinesque style which i dedicate to she and so the week and month go by often word of love tremble on my lip but i dare not utter they because i know they would have to be follow by other word which i have not the courage to frame there might have be some other woman in my set whom i could have fall in love with and ask to marry I without a word of explanation but the more i know this girl the less could i find it in my heart to deceive she and yet in spite of this specter that be constantly loom up before I i could never have believe that life hold such happiness as be contain in those dream day of love one Saturday afternoon in early June i be come up fifth avenue and at the corner of twenty-third street i meet she she have be shop we stop to chat for a moment and i suggest that we spend half a hour at the eden muse we be stand lean on the rail in front of a group of figure more interested in what we have to say to each other than in the group when my attention become fix upon a man who stand at my side study he catalogue it take I only a instant to recognize in he my old friend shiny my first impulse be to change my position at once as quick as a flash i consider all the risk i might run in speak to he and most especially the delicate question of introduce he to she i confess that in my embarrassment and confusion i feel small and mean but before i could decide what to do he look around at I and after a instant quietly ask : pardon I but be not this -- the nobler part in I respond to the sound of he voice and i take he hand in a hearty clasp whatever fear i have feel be quickly banish for he seem at a glance to divine my situation and let drop no word that would have arouse suspicion as to the truth with a slight misgiving i present he to she and be again relieve of fear she receive the introduction in she usual gracious manner and without the least hesitancy or embarrassment join in the conversation a amusing part about the introduction be that i be upon the point of introduce he as shiny and stammer a second or two before i could recall he name we chat for some fifteen minute he be spend he vacation north with the intention of do four or six week ' work in one of the summer school he be also go to take a bride back with he in the fall he ask I about myself but in so diplomatic a way that i find no difficulty in answer he the polish of he language and he unpedantic manner in which he reveal he culture greatly impress she and after we have leave the muse she show it by question I about he i be surprise at the amount of interest a refined black man could arouse even after change in the conversation she revert several time to the subject of shiny whether it be more than mere curiosity i could not tell but i be convince that she herself know very little about prejudice just why it should have do so i do not know but somehow the shiny incident give I encouragement and confidence to cast the die of my fate i reason however that since i want to marry she only and since it concern she alone i would divulge my secret to no one else not even she parent one evening a few day afterwards at she home we be go over some new song and composition when she ask I as she often do to play the thirteenth nocturne when i begin she draw a chair near to my right and sit lean with she elbow on the end of the piano she chin rest on she hand and she eye reflect the emotion which the music awake in she a impulse which i could not control rush over I a wave of exultation the music under my finger sink almost to a whisper and call she for the first time by she christian name but without daring to look at she i say : i love you i love you i love you my finger be tremble so that i cease play i feel she hand creep to mine and when i look at she she eye be glisten with tear i understand and could scarcely resist the longing to take she in my arm but i remember remember that which have be the sacrificial altar of so much happiness -- duty and bend over she hand in mine i say : yes i love you but there be something more too that i must tell you then i tell she in what word i do not know the truth i feel she hand grow cold and when i look up she be gaze at I with a wild fixed stare as though i be some object she have never see under the strange light in she eye i feel that i be grow black and thick-featured and crimp-haired she appear not to have comprehend what i have say she lip tremble and she attempt to say something to I but the word stick in she throat then drop she head on the piano she begin to weep with great sob that shake she frail body i try to console she and blurt out incoherent word of love but this seem only to increase she distress and when i leave she she be still weep when i get into the street i feel very much as i do the night after meet my father and sister at the opera in paris even a similar desperate inclination to get drunk but my self-control be stronger this be the only time in my life that i ever feel absolute regret at be color that i curse the drop of african blood in my vein and wish that i be really white when i reach my room i sit and smoke several cigar while i try to think out the significance of what have occur i review the whole history of we acquaintance recall each smile she have give I each word she have say to I that nourished my hope i go over the scene we have just go through try to draw from it what be in my favor and what be against I i be reward by feel confident that she love I but i could not estimate what be the effect upon she of my confession at last nervous and unhappy i write she a letter which i drop into the mail-box before go to bed in which i say : i understand understand even better than you and so i suffer even more than you but why should either of we suffer for what neither of we be to blame for if there be any blame it belong to I and i can only make the old yet strongest plea that can be offer i love you and i know that my love my great love infinitely overbalance that blame and blot it out what be it that stand in the way of we happiness it be not what you feel or what i feel it be not what you be or what i be it be what other feel and be but oh be that a fair price in all the endeavor and struggle of life in all we striving and longing there be only one thing worth seek only one thing worth win and that be love it be not always find but when it be there be nothing in all the world for which it can be profitably exchange the second morning after i receive a note from she which state briefly that she be go up into new hampshire to spend the summer with relative there she make no reference to what have pass between we nor do she say exactly when she would leave the city the note contain no single word that give I any clue to she feeling i could gather hope only from the fact that she have write at all on the same evening with a degree of trepidation which render I almost frighten i go to she house i meet she mother who tell I that she have leave for the country that very afternoon she mother treat I in she usual pleasant manner which fact greatly reassure I and i leave the house with a vague sense of hope stir in my breast which spring from the conviction that she have not yet divulge my secret but that hope do not remain with I long i wait one two three week nervously examine my mail every day look for some word from she all of the letter receive by I seem so insignificant so worthless because there be none from she the slight buoyancy of spirit which i have feel gradually dissolve into gloomy heart-sickness i become preoccupy i lose appetite lose sleep and lose ambition several of my friend intimate to I that perhaps i be work too hard she stay away the whole summer i do not go to the house but see she father at various time and he be as friendly as ever even after i know that she be back in town i do not go to see she i determine to wait for some word or sign i have finally take refuge and comfort in my pride pride which i suppose i come by naturally enough the first time i see she after she return be one night at the theater she and she mother sit in company with a young man whom i know slightly not many seat away from I never do she appear more beautiful and yet it may have be my fancy she seem a trifle paler and there be a suggestion of haggardness in she countenance but that only heighten she beauty the very delicacy of she charm melt down the strength of my pride my situation make I feel weak and powerless like a man try with he bare hand to break the iron bar of he prison cell when the performance be over i hurry out and place myself where unobserved i could see she as she pass out the haughtiness of spirit in which i have seek relief be all go and i be willing and ready to undergo any humiliation shortly afterward we meet at a progressive card party and during the evening we be throw together at one of the table as partner this be really we first meeting since the eventful night at she house strangely enough in spite of we mutual nervousness we win every trick of the game and one of we opponent jokingly quote the old saw : lucky at card unlucky in love we eye meet and i be sure that in the momentary glance my whole soul go out to she in one great plea she lower she eye and utter a nervous little laugh during the rest of the game i fully merit the unexpressed and express abuse of my various partner for my eye follow she wherever she be and i play whatever card my finger happen to touch later in the evening she go to the piano and begin to play very softly as to herself the opening bar of the thirteenth nocturne i feel that the psychic moment of my life have come a moment which if lose could never be call back and in as careless a manner as i could assume i saunter over to the piano and stand almost bend over she she continue play but in a voice that be almost a whisper she call I by my christian name and say : i love you i love you i love you i take she place at the piano and play the nocturne in a manner that silence the chatter of the company both in and out of the room involuntarily close it with the major triad we be marry the follow spring and go to europe for several month it be a double joy for I to be in france again under such condition first there come to we a little girl with hair and eye dark like mine but who be grow to have way like she mother two year later there come a boy who have my temperament but be fair like he mother a little golden-headed god with a face and head that would have delight the heart of a old italian master and this boy with he mother 's eye and feature occupy a inner sanctuary of my heart for it be for he that she give all and that be the second sacred sorrow of my life the few year of we married life be supremely happy and perhaps she be even happier than i for after we marriage in spite of all the wealth of she love which she lavish upon I there come a new dread to haunt I a dread which i can not explain and which be unfounded but one that never leave I i be in constant fear that she would discover in I some shortcoming which she would unconsciously attribute to my blood rather than to a fail of human nature but no cloud ever come to mar we life together she loss to I be irreparable my child need a mother 's care but i shall never marry again it be to my child that i have devote my life i no longer have the same fear for myself of my secret 's be find out for since my wife 's death i have gradually drop out of social life but there be nothing i would not suffer to keep the brand from be place upon they it be difficult for I to analyze my feeling concern my present position in the world sometimes it seem to I that i have never really be a negro that i have be only a privileged spectator of they inner life at other time i feel that i have be a coward a deserter and i be possess by a strange longing for my mother 's people several year ago i attend a great meeting in the interest of hampton institute at carnegie hall the hampton student sing the old song and awake memory that leave I sad
