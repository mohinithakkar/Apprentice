have fail whether they have fail or succeed more knowledge of practical cooperation can be gain from they experience than can ever be learn from book the consumer ' league feel that the experience of these society should not be waste for this reason it be tell the story of several cooperative in new york some of which be successfully establish and some of which have fall by the roadside in these brief story be write a hundred lesson that cooperative should heed successful cooperation the utica cooperative society at the corner of court and schuyler street in utica stand a grocery store which be different from a ordinary store it be different because it be a cooperative store and it belong to those who buy as well as to those who serve there be no need for the purchaser to be on guard lest the bargain be to he disadvantage for he be deal with friendly clerk who be there to help he find what he want not to sell he something he can not use in this store the purchaser can find all the article carry by a first-class grocer can goods green goods dairy product and in addition a complete supply of baked goods baked by the cooperative society itself the bakery be to be find behind the grocery large high window throw a flood of light into the mix room the oven be of a modern type large easily control and economical five man work at the bake and a boy wrap bread in wax paper with a mechanical device which automatically fold and seal the three delivery wagon bear the cooperative motto each for all and all for each they be use in the morning for the delivery of baked goods and in the afternoon for the delivery of grocery it keep three boy busy all day cover the territory between the cooperator ' home the delivery system be essential because the membership be scatter throughout the entire city there be fourteen employee in the grocery and bakery hitherto they have receive wages higher than those generally prevail throughout the city for the same kind of work but recently on they own initiative they vote themselves a ten per cent decrease in a cooperative all member may know the financial status of the business and the employee find that due to the diminish margin of profit the business could not support such a high scale of wages they wage cut follow because as member of the cooperative they be interested not only in they own wages but in the good of the society as a whole the utica cooperative society be organize in 1915 by a group of german half a dozen nationality be now represent although american predominate although they have only ninety-two member and $ 1250 to start they buy out a private store and begin cooperative business they bakery be originally in the cellar under the store the former owner be employ as manager for three or four year they experience many difficulty within two year two manager prove inefficient and have to be replace only the tenacious loyalty of a few keep the society alive but they have the foresight and determination to fight through those lean year now for five year they have have the same manager he insist upon scrupulous bookkeeping method careful buy close supervision of he work by the board of fifteen director strict regard for the need and desire of the membership and exceptional precaution against waste and leakage the president a man have a private business of he own have a idealism almost religious in quality these two man cooperate closely on matter of policy and provide much of the leadership which have bring success the membership be now 380 the capital stock have increase from $ 1250 to $ 27594 the business in 1921 amount to $ 105598 forty per cent of which be do by the bakery since 1915 the rebate to member on patronage have total $ 8207 fluctuate from nothing at all in some year to eight per cent and ten per cent in other year during this period the lump sum save to purchaser include rebate the earnings on stock share and reserve fund amount to $ 12642 this sum would have go into the pocket of private storekeeper except for the cooperative store the utica society have succeed because it have meet the prime requirement for effective cooperation the greater part of the membership be loyal during critical time when the easy way would have be to withdraw and trade at chain store the management work unceasingly to put the business on a economical basis finally they win out because they put service over profit and carry out that rule in the most practical and businesslike way they could find \* \* \* \* \* we cooperative cafeteria if you should drop in for lunch at any one of the three branch of we cooperative cafeteria in new york city the first thing that would strike you would be the friendly spirit of those back of the serve table before you pay you check you would observe further that the food have a variety and flavor not find in the ordinary restaurant if you be discerning you would detect that a complex machinery be at work which have nearly escape you because of its smooth operation that genial spirit which infect the whole place and those subtle thing which appeal to you eye and palate explain the success of the cafeteria but there be some underlying cause for these thing that we must get hold of and to do that we must go back to the year 1919 in October of that year a private cafeteria be start by two woman with a record of successful cafeteria experience behind they the experiment prove successful and the follow April a momentous step be take it be propose that the person who eat there become the owner a cooperative society be form and in two week share be sell to the value of two thousand dollar the new owner take over the cafeteria and the former owner become they hire employee this be the beginning of we cooperative cafeteria the cafeteria have from the outset advantage which be gain by many cooperative only after bitter and costly experience they have skillful and experienced management to which they immediately give over all technical control hold they responsible through a active board of director and a accounting system devise by expert the management justify the confidence of the shareholder on April 1 1921 after one year of operation they have outgrow the first plant and a new branch have be run for two month there be in all 379 member the year 's business have be $ 96000 of which $ 6000 be net earnings the stockholder have receive six per cent on they investment a reserve fund have be lay aside and every month the member-patron have receive rebate on the food eat of from six per cent to sixteen per cent at the end of the second year the third branch larger than either of the other located in the wall street business section have be in operation for three month the membership of the society have increase to 750 the business for the year have be $ 190000 and the net earnings be $ 12000 the cafeteria now employ sixty-eight worker most of whom be shareholder and vote as such in membership meeting the worker receive the same food as the patron serve at the same counter against all restaurant tradition the worker be serve before the meal so that she may have the best there be and have it before she be too tired to eat it the minimum wage be higher than the customary rate for restaurant worker in new york the forty-eight hour week be the standard although as yet some of the help work over that time overtime be one thing that the management have not yet be able wholly to eliminate it have be find that the policy determining function of the stockholder and board of director can not operate independently of the plan of the management the two in a business organization must be closely inter-related the stockholder have not try to supervise the detail of the business as have sometimes be do to the disaster of cooperative the general manager instead have go to the board of director and sit there practically as a full member as a result the policy function of the board and the management function be closely link together as they must be in a business that be to be permanent the stockholder be not idle however through they committee they have amend the by-law they have recently call a general meeting for the consideration of labor policy and they publish monthly a little paper know as the cooperative crier the average attendance at the shareholder ' monthly meeting be sixty or sixty-five to a unusual degree the success of we cooperative cafeteria be bind up with its management not only because it be technically expert but because it be thoroughly imbue with the cooperative spirit around the first nucleus have grow a staff of intelligent young man and woman usually college breed who be devote all they brain and energy to see that this cooperative cafeteria succeed they seem to find a peculiar satisfaction in know that they effort will not enrich a few individual at the expense of patron and employee alike but will increase the common welfare of the community itself like other cooperative the cafeteria have find the need for expert and trained worker in place of the hard-pressed volunteer much of the work on education and cooperative organization be carry on by trained member of the staff this interest of the pay employee in thing other than mere technical efficiency contribute much to that friendly spirit which make we cooperative cafeteria unique among the restaurant of new york \* \* \* \* \* the village cooperative society inc after nearly two year of discussion and meeting and after long consultation with expert a group compose largely of the housewife in greenwich village in the heart of new york city start in January 1921 a cooperative laundry the second-hand machinery which they purchase be not a laundry unit the capacity of the washer be one-fourth that of the ironer they have insufficient capital half of it borrow they employ a inexperienced manager and a green bookkeeper and for the first eight month the supervision be almost entirely carry on by volunteer hard work but without the foresight and power of control so essential to a new organization under these handicap the cooperative laundry lose money every month it exist through those month due largely to two thing first they be force almost immediately to employ a new manager who consistently turn out high grade work and secondly a small group of volunteer put all they energy into make the thing a success then the cause of the continued failure be one by one eliminate a business manager who have a intense interest in cooperation be hire to supervise general operation he take over much of the work of the volunteer and for the first time the laundry develop a well think out policy the inexperienced bookkeeper be eliminate and all supervision head up in the new manager better service bring more work and new machinery make greater output possible without additional labor the manager find labor cost too high and introduce method which save both labor and money he find the machinery badly arrange when the plumber tell he it would cost twenty-five dollar to rearrange it he spend a dollar and forty cent and do it himself after a discussion in the board of director which nearly wreck the organization a board policy of leave all detail of management to the manager and chairman of a managing committee be determine upon while the board devoted itself to the determination of general policy the result of these change be soon apparent for the first time the dead line between loss and earnings be cross and net earnings gradually begin to mount in September 1921 the amount of business waver around a hundred dollar a week in march 1922 it average about $ 330 per week and net earnings have run as high as $ 75 per week the laundry be still small and be located in quarter for which it pay a regular commercial rent it have expand several time and now have three power washer a ironer or mangle a dry room and other equipment it employ a business manager who supervise the plant and do everything from keep the book to collect the laundry in a pinch a work manager a washer a sorter and marker four ironer and a delivery boy it still hold hard to the policy of put out the very best kind of work and economize in every particular its very success have in a way embarrass the laundry the manager have be offer special inducement to leave the delivery system have be tamper with there have even be acid throw on the clothes by outsider jealous of its business but this have only stimulate the whole membership to fight harder to realize they aim of get they own laundry work do the way they want it and without profit \* \* \* \* \* the finnish cooperative society of brooklyn what be it that make the finn so successful at cooperation industry and cleanliness at any rate those be the striking characteristic of the finn of brooklyn up to the present time they have never pay any dividend it have be explain to they as they manager say that if the business be to serve they properly it must grow and in order to grow it need all the surplus earnings for expansion and so because the member be industrious and far-sighted they have foregone they dividend the cleanliness of they store too be a inspiration not only to they membership but to hundred of other who have visit they plant this be one of the biggest business asset they possess these virtue have enable the finnish group in brooklyn to build cooperatively a three-story modern business block to run therein a wholesale bakery a retail bakery a meat shop and grocery store a cooperative restaurant and a cooperative pool room to build adjacent to this two modern cooperative apartment house and to lay the foundation for a third

dollar early in 1922 they incorporate they then own a fine modern restaurant have do $ 70000 worth of business in 1921 and have three thousand dollar in the bank and no one have ever pay a cent into the business with all this they sell they food at unusually low price well cook wholesome and clean in 1917 a larger group determine to have a bakery which come up to they standard in 1919 they have raise enough money to start construction then they face they first test they money give out undaunted they organize a money raise army as they call it of thirty or forty man the money be raise by the time the new bakery be open they have fourteen hundred member and have raise $ 140000 the total organization expense for three year come to $ 400 less than three-tenth of one per cent for promotion expense the new business block be open in may 1920 all but the restaurant be under one general manager he be bond for $ 10000 he have have business experience in run a cooperative bank in wisconsin to he be delegate a large degree of freedom but he be hold strictly accountable to the board of director a thorough and comprehensive system of bookkeeping and accounting be install each separate business the bakery the pool room the meat shop be put on a cost accounting basis and the manager know just which one be make or lose money all the branch of the business however have make money over $ 12000 in net earnings after allow for interest on the investment have be make since the business start last year the bakery do business to the extent of $ 135000 the meat market and grocery $ 58000 and the pool room $ 12000 already the business have outgrow its quarter a new oven have be add to the bakery the third floor which be use exclusively as a pool room have be invade and the thirteen

association alone be eighteen hundred and forty the employee of the association work among almost ideal condition the twelve baker be all union man and member of the cooperative association as well they work seven and one-half hour a day and be pay from forty-five to fifty dollar per week the light airy bakery be always keep spotless adjacent to it be a commodious room with locker for each man and two shower bath make it easy to keep clean down on the first floor the retail bakery be so immaculately clean that you would be willing to defy anyone to find one speck of dust in the place every article of food be under shine glass the floor be white tiled but the food be what attract one the pie swell out as if about to burst to look at the bread and roll make one hungry and to smell they hungrier still this you be tell be because only the purest ingredient be use many baker use powdered egg for bake commonly import from china this cooperative use only fresh egg they buy a better grade of flour than they competitor do the same thing be true of the meat shop next door they do not aim to make money on they meat they sole aim be to sell only the best this policy have be so popular that the quantity sell the first three month of 1922 be almost treble that for the same month in 1921 and the meat store too have make substantial net earnings the two cooperative apartment which lie adjacent to the business block house thirty-two family the apartment contain five room and bath and be thoroughly modern they be light and airy with high ceiling and hardwood floor needless to say they tenant-owner keep they in the most immaculate condition recently a group of business man several of they builder go through the building and many express the wish that they could get similar apartment for three time the money that these cooperator be pay for the best apartment the rent have recently be raise to $ 3150 per month but out of this amount the tenant-owner be not only pay all upkeep but be pay off the mortgage at the rate of $ 1000 per year similar apartment in the locality rent from $ 75 to $ 80 per month the tenant-owner of course run they apartment on the cooperative plan of one vote per member the member of the finnish cooperative society of brooklyn be fast become independent of the middleman for cooperation touch they on many side they have learn to serve themselves and they get what they want honest goods -- and clean cooperative that fail when one have make mistake the importance which be attach to they depend upon the gravity of the consequence this be the case the stone of cooperative which follow be worth attention for as a result of they mistake they be now dead one of the most pitiful aspect of cooperative failure be that one group after another will go on make the identical mistake that have bring ruin to other sometimes it be the result of sheer ignorance and sometimes of shameful negligence in either case the result be the same -- the stockholder lose they savings and cooperation feel the blow two year ago the state authority be call upon to investigate a cooperative that be about to fail several member make the claim that the officer have default with property of the association a accountant be call in to examine the book after considerable coax the secretary-treasurer unearth they and turn they over they consist of a old black bag full of all the bill voucher and other scrap paper for the previous six month those be he book he have sell the store without take a inventory when a inventory be finally make it be find that some of the stock have not turn over for a year on one top shelf two hundred pepper shaker full of pepper stretch half the length of the room full value have be pay for this dead stock and several hundred dollar to boot for good will from the cooperative standpoint the most dangerous thing be that half the director have become disgruntled and though remain on the board refuse to attend meeting a quorum could not be obtain and for month the president and treasurer have run the business without reference to director or stockholder the cooperative society fail and every cent of the four thousand dollar of the cooperator be lose another cooperative store this time in the bronx be take over by the manager within one year upon inquiry its director proudly exhibit its book it be a beautiful set cost they say nearly seventy-five dollar the store have start in November for November and the first three day of December everything be keep in good shape but during the entire next year not a entry have be make the director have the book but the manager have the store the stockholder lose all they capital a thriving business be be do by still another cooperative store in new york at the outset the director have vote to bond the manager but the matter be put off and put off one day the manager disappear and with he two thousand dollar belong to the cooperative after a few month the manager be find but the money be go the loss of the total sum be more than the cooperative could stand however and after struggle along for a few month it close its door a clever organizer two year ago start organize a cooperative store in new york on the society 's letter head he have print a picture of the world and across the world the word big he be go to start a whole chain of store in three month the first and only store be put into the hand of a assignee and the man leave the city a audit of he account show that he have collect $ 3600 one-fourth of this have go for promotion expense $ 2350 for rental fixture etc leave only $ 350 for operating expense where the finn spend three-tenth of one per cent for promotion he have spend twenty-five per cent this have force the association to start with so small a operating capital that it be soon badly embarrassed for lack of fund and could do nothing but close its door it would be possible to go on with many other illustration such failure as these be not really a test of genuine cooperation any ordinary business with such management would also have fail but it be significant that most of the recent cooperative failure have be among grocery store in this particular business the margin of profit be so small that only the most skillful and economical management can bring success a recent survey of all the private grocery store in one city show that the average annual profit be only $ 400 per grocer there be no longer any excuse for cooperative to follow the blind into the pit there be many source of information and advice available to cooperative that should be fully utilize before any money be spend in a cooperative enterprise that promise only failure false cooperative the impractical cooperative which fail be bad enough for it discourage many people from make a second attempt but the false cooperative be a greater menace to the cooperative movement the private promoter with he selfish interest rig up a scheme to look like cooperation but the actual purpose be to provide a channel whereby thousand of dollar will flow from the pocket of the work people into those of the promoter inasmuch as new york state have a law which forbid the use of the word cooperation by any concern which be not organize under the cooperative law such promoter have to be uncommonly shrewd \* \* \* \* \* the glynn system early in 1920 a group of three or four private business man in buffalo establish a promote corporation and then set out to organize a cooperative wholesale which be to be a separate concern from they promote enterprise but be to be control by it the promoter sell share in the buffalo wholesale to individual in fifteen or twenty city and town all the way across the central part of the state they open up six or seven store and handle goods in large quantity through they wholesale plant the capital be solicit chiefly through labor union elaborate promise be make to prospective shareholder : they be to have a local store in they neighborhood dividend be to be pay regularly goods could be buy at price below those prevail at the chain store and the local group be to have local autonomy as a matter of fact the ultimate control be always in the hand of the few promoter in buffalo these man have two large source of revenue from the many transaction carry on they exact from each member five dollar for organize expense and they take a commission on all the business handle through the wholesale by the spring of 1921 some of the member in one or two center become suspicious and begin a investigation they find that store be in many case grossly mismanage one manager have abscond with $ 600 organize or promote expense in some place be as high as thirty-three per cent the weekly newspaper be discontinue for lack of fund some wholesale merchant finally refuse to give further credit to the buffalo headquarters and at the end of the first year of operation one of the office force confide to a friend that there be a ten thousand dollar deficit when bankruptcy be finally declare in midsummer the promoter be not to be find the principal organizer a ardent friend of labor for many year have be completely dupe by these promoter and be leave penniless and alone to face hundred of investor cooperation be put in disrepute for thousand of man and woman in dozen of city and town throughout the state cooperation can not be develop downward from a central wholesale organization with a corps of organizer nor will it grow when build upon mercenary motive in this case organize labor in the state be partly to blame for not heed the warning of a few group of cooperator who be aware of the nature of the concern early in its history but the ultimate blame lie with the individual man and woman who join the corporation without look carefully into its organization \* \* \* \* \* the cooperative society of america in 1920 the cooperative society of america be do a flourish business in chicago and vicinity one of the leader of the enterprise go to europe in 1921 and convinced most of the lead cooperator of those country that he be the greatest power in the cooperative movement in the united state by the summer of 1921 the agent of the principal promoter of this scheme harrison parker be operate in new york city and score of salesman be cover the various borough sell stock within two week all the agency interested in protect cooperation be organize to fight this fraud the matter be place in the hand of the attorney general and a special deputy appoint to prosecute the lead newspaper run a expose of its operation at this juncture the chicago headquarters suddenly go into the hand of a receiver and the new york office close its door late in the year federal action be institute against harrison parker in chicago the entire business of the so-called cooperative be disclose to the court it be find that 81000 people have invest fifteen million in this gigantic fraud here in new york there be many hundred if not several thousand of man and woman who lose large sum of money in the ensue bankruptcy these people be take in by the dramatic appeal to they selfish interest the chicago organization show they photograph of the massive building in chicago in which it be do business speak glibly of its banking and insurance department and then promise they a share in the spoil if they would pay $ 75 for they certificate which be worth only $ 25 or $ 50 at they face value that so many people could be dupe by these get-rich-quick method be a indication of the amazing lack of cooperative understanding which prevail in the united state it be a part of the purpose of this bulletin to correct the misunderstanding which prevail because of the fraudulent use of the word cooperation in the case of a suspect false cooperative test it by the rochdale principle if it fail to measure up to they take the matter up directly with the state authority or the cooperative league of america how to start a cooperative enterprise in new york state in start a cooperative enterprise two thing must be consider : first the kind of business to go into and second the method of organization any group desire to engage in a cooperative venture should first of all through a committee and by consultation with expert determine what type of enterprise will serve they most effectively where competition be unusually keen and profit margin be low cooperation be less likely to be of service than where the opposite be the case whatever enterprise be start man experience in that business should be consult as to the location of the business the stock and equipment need the operating capital necessary etc preliminary organization should likewise be handle by a committee which might estimate the number of person who would become member the service each could contribute to the society etc meeting should be hold to educate the group in both cooperation and the special need of the undertaking for this purpose many educational bulletin may be obtain from the cooperative league of america and other reliable source actual organization of the society consist of incorporation election of officer the adoption of by-law and the immediate adoption of a sound system of bookkeeping no action undertake before incorporation have any legal effect on a incorporated body so early incorporation be desirable the new york state law require that all firm use the word cooperation incorporate under one of the three state cooperative law outside of farmer ' cooperative practically all cooperative society be incorporate under the stock law know as article iii copy of these law may be obtain from the state department of farm and market the department have prepare simple form for incorporation under this law when these be fill out and swear to and the papers file with the secretary of state and the county clerk the society may legally begin business the fee of the secretary of state be $ 30 a board of director be name in the incorporation papers and this board through a pay manager will transact the society 's business model by-law upon which the by-law control the organization may be base may be obtain from the state department of farm and market or from the cooperative league of america the present trend of cooperation there have be significant development in the cooperative enterprise in new york in the last two year in the first place while a number of small grocery close they door the larger cooperative have grow larger and more prosperous at last there appear to have develop cooperative which have pass that critical stage connect with the life of a newly-organized business one of these larger cooperative which do over $ 200000 worth of business in 1921 have turn its surplus into its business ever since it start and be now buy more land to erect a second business block in order to take care of expansion which be force upon it by the grow trade another cooperative have establish two prosperous branch and be now do a business of a quarter of a million dollar a year a third follow a profitable year in which its business amount to $ 205000 be likewise build a new plant the balance sheet of each of these association would be the envy of most business undertaking a second development be the appearance of a new type of management a group of younger man and woman with a broad background a intense interest in cooperation and a capacity of grow up with the business be work now to make these cooperative even more successful the cooperative movement be likely to grow in pretty close proportion to the ability of these leader and the man and woman they can attach to themselves heretofore the greatest handicap of the cooperative movement in this country have be the lack of trained and able leader a third significant development be the adoption by cooperative of the best method of management and accounting until this have be do the cooperative have small chance of succeed it be probable that cooperative which lack some of the incentive of the ordinary commercial business will be compel constantly to adopt the most efficient and advanced type of machinery in set this up as a definite standard they will escape the inertia and conservatism that ordinarily characterize large group a condition which at the present time be retard the british cooperative movement two year ago accurate accounting be a unusual thing among cooperative at the present time practically all the cooperative in the state have they book go over periodically by trained public accountant a still further trend in the cooperative development be the extension of the movement into new line of business to this extent the failure of cooperative grocery store have have a beneficial effect since it have force group to undertake different kind of cooperative business in new york city at the present time cooperative be engage in such diverse business as that of restaurant cafeteria bakery coal association pool room print establishment meat store and laundry this mean that the cooperative be not follow tradition but be think for themselves and be select that enterprise which will serve they most effectively in go into these business where profit be greatest they be not only prosper themselves but they be perform one of they most legitimate function that of protect the consumer from extortionate profit bibliography book bubnoff jv the cooperative movement
