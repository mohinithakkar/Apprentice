how i lucia dacre come to write this history at the time that i with my sister be lodge in a desert house in london when the great plague be at its height which be in the month of July and August anno sixteen hundred and sixty-five now that my sister and myself be in such a strange melancholy case and i enforce to spend many hour daily in idleness i find the time hang very heavy for i can not like althea entertain any longer the hope that bring we hither she continue daily to make great exertion in pursue they but do not often admit my help and be afraid that i may fall into mere desperation i have bethought I how to amuse some hour daily by set down the manner of we present trouble and the beginning that lead to they may i live to write of they happy end but my fear be very great and almost forbid I to pray thus have thus resolve how to beguile the heavy time i begin spy about for paper and pen and ink and finding in a kind of lumber room a great many sheet of coarse paper i stitch they together then with much tremble i peep into the study of the late poor master of the house and there find a bundle of quill and some ink and leave money in he desk to the full value of the thing i take i carry my writing-tool into the great front parlor and set myself to the work now while i sit consider how to begin althea come softly behind I and look over my shoulder ask I what i would be at and when i tell she ` what child ' say she ` art go to turn historian thy spirit be more settle than mine if thou canst sit quietly down to such work with sight like these daily before thine eye ' point with she hand to the window now i have pull the table into a corner well out of sight from the street wish not to be discern for as yet but one know of we be hide in this house and we would fain keep it a secret still but rise and follow with my eye she point hand i could behold a sight common enough but too dismal to be look on without fresh apprehension each time : in the middle of the street which be quite grow with grass a horse and cart standing no driver in sight near it and the cart as we too well know be that which go round daily to take away such as die of the plague though as it then stand we could not discern if any dead person lay in it ` it be wait for we neighbor next door ' say althea ` as i stand by a open casement up-stair i plainly hear the family bemoan themselves because the master be dead i hear also how they be devise to get away unobserved in the early morning and escape to some place of safety in the country how sayest thou lucy be it not well for thee to go also in they company ' ` never i while you stay here ' i answer ` it repent I often ' she say ` that i discover to you my design of come up hither i would you be safe at home again ' ' i have no home but where you be ' say i ` poor faithful little heart ' she say sigh ` well get on with thy history-writing i must go forth presently when all be quiet again and when i return thou shalt show I what thou hast write tell the tale orderly lucy begin at the beginning with once upon a time there live two sister the elder be a fool but the younger one love she ' -- and before i could say a word she have slipt away i sit awhile too much disquiet to write listen against my will for the heavy sound that tell how the dead man next door be be carry forth and lay in the cart but the thing lumber away at last its crack bell tinkle dolefully and i find courage to take to my work but to begin at the beginning be not so easy especially for one so unskilful with she pen as i and who shall say what be the beginning of the thing that befall we perhaps they lie far off long before we little life itself begin chapter i how we be visit by two of we kinsfolk we father be dead and how they behave themselves toward we think however that the trouble that now lie upon we might not have be ours have not we father die when he do which be the cause of we be take into the house of we mother 's sister mr margaret golding -- a happy thing we then think it that she would receive we for we be in great strait -- so i will begin my history at that sad period we father william dacre be indeed a gentleman bear to a competent estate and marry into a honest stock and to some fortune but he fair prospects be all blighted and we mother 's money well-nigh waste before he die to he great loss he stand steadily for the king against the parliament all through the late rebellion as he would ever call it and we mother 's people be very stiff on the other side and she die while we be little child we be sunder from they while we father live he take such care of we as he could strive to breed we up like gentlewoman sometimes we live with he in london lodgings sometimes be leave at he manor-house of milthorpe but the last two year of he life be very uneasy to he and to we for when the young king charle the second be bring in again five year agone we father be draw up to court by some i will not name who tempt he with hope of preferment and reward to recompense he loyalty he waste he means much through the ill counsel of these false friend but obtain no fruit of they promise and at last he die suddenly whether broken-hearted or not i leave to the judgment of god and to the conscience of the man who for they own end have betray he into those vain expectation at that time althea be barely nineteen and i a little past sixteen we have no brother nor other sister we be then at milthorpe and thither we father be bring to be bury that be a black time for we though lately we have be keep apart from we father we love he dearly and we know of no other friend and protector and when the funeral be over we could not tell which way to turn for we find we father 's land must need pass to the next male heir mr john dacre we distant cousin he i know not how have contrived to thrive where we father have decay and have get a good share of favor at the new court my memory offer thing past to I as if in separate picture this and that accident that befall we show much more clear and bright than thing quite as important which lie between i remember but dimly all the sad time of we father 's death and burial the grief i myself feel and all the bustle and stir about we make those day cloudy to I but all the more plainly i remember a certain day that follow the funeral when althea and i be sit together in a little parlor where we have be wont to sew -- i weep on she neck and she try to turn my thought from my grief with plan how we two should live -- when the door open some one come briskly in who call we by we name ` what althea what lucy all in the dump and not a word to say to you mother 's own sister ' and in great surprise we look up on we aunt whom we have see but once since we mother die when we be quite little she be look kindly on we she eye be quick black and sparkling but have something very tender in they at that moment i notice directly how plain she be as to she clothes wear a common country-made riding-suit all of black and how she shape be a little too plump for she low stature while she comely face be tan quite brown with the sun but methought the kind look she bent on we be even sweeter because of she homely aspect so i get up and run to she hold out both my hand but she take I into she arm and kiss I lovingly say -- ` poor lamb poor fatherless motherless lamb thou shalt feel no lack of a mother while i live ' then hold I in one arm she stretch out the other hand to althea who have come up more slowly and she say -- ` and you too my fair lady-niece i have room in my heart for the two of you if you will come in ' on which the water stand in althea 's eye and she take we aunt 's hand and kiss it say -- ` god reward you madam for you goodness to we desolate orphan i receive it most thankfully ' ` that be well ' quoth we aunt cordially and she proceed to tell we how when she get the news of we father 's death she make haste to come down to milthorpe ` not that i hope ' say she ` to be here in time for the bury but it be bear in on my mind there should be a friend of we side of the house to stand by you be mr dacre here ' ` he come down to the funeral ' say althea ` and have speak to we on some small business matter but he have be constantly out of the house ride about the estate and so we have see little of he ' as she say this the door open again and we cousin the new master of milthorpe enter i have scarce note he look be drown in my grief at the time when as althea say he have talk with we on business accounting to we for some money the poor wreck of we fortune which have be lodge in he hand but i now think what a grand gentleman he look in he rich mourning suit and indeed he be of a very graceful appearance and smile on we most courtly he hold he plumed hat in he hand and bow low to we aunt -- ' i be much honor ' say he ` that mr golding should grace my poor house with she presence before i have have time to sue for it will it please you lady to step into the dining-parlour and sit down with I to a homely refection i have order to be spread there i must return to-day to town so if mr gold will bestow half a hour of she time on I to talk over some needful matter i shall take it as a favor ' mr gold bent she head to he say ` at you pleasure sir ' and we follow to the dining-room where we find what i should have call a plentiful dinner but mr dacre keep excuse its meanness at every dish he offer we this be very grating to althea seem a reflection both on we way at milthorpe and on we poor old faithful servant and mr gold like it no better i see she turn very red and at last she say bluntly -- ` the dinner be all very well and i think margery cook need not so many excuse so will you please leave speaking of meat and drink and turn to the needful matter you speak of instead ' ' i might have choose ' say mr dacre ` to talk to you in private first about those thing but perhaps it be as well my fair cousin should hear at once what i have to say i be a married man as you know mr golding and my wife love the town and can not endure to hear of a country life i have no hope she will ever live at the manor here but i will not let it and i shall want it keep in good order against my come down which will be frequent so if my cousin mistress althea like to remain here as housekeeper she will be very welcome ' ` and what do you think of pay she for she service ' say we aunt mr dacre lift he eyebrow and look at she as if much surprised ` she would have meat and lodge free ' say he ` and servant to do she bidding also if she can make anything by keep of a dairy or of fowl or selling of fruit from the garden or such like device of country dame i shall ask no account of she gain and if she management please I i shall find a broad piece for she from time to time i doubt not so she may do very well ' ` and be she sister mistress lucium to dwell in you house and receive you bounty also ' say mr gold ` that make no part of my plan ' say he smile and bow ' i shall hardly need two housekeeper here ' ` then it may chance you must look otherwhere for you one housekeeper ' say mr gold ` what sayest althea wilt be part from thy sister that thou mayest have the honor of keep house for so liberal a kinsman and master or wilt go with lucy and I to my farm at west fazeby where you two shall be to I as daughter for i be a childless widow and will gladly cherish you young thing the choice lie before you althea ' althea be now red as any rose and the tear ' that have be in she eye seem turn to spark of fire she rise from the table and make a deep curtsey to mr dacre ' i be exceed grateful for you preference of I ' she say ` but see i be only a young maid and inexpert in the management of a house i must beg to refuse you princely offer ' -- she speak with infinite scorn -- ` and betake myself instead to the home mr gold will give I where i may improve myself and become fitter in time both in year and skill for some such post as you would now prefer I to ' she stop and pant be quite out of breath mr dacre do but lift he eyebrow again and say ` as you will madam ' and then beg she would sit down and finish eating but she remain standing and look pitifully at mr gold on which we aunt rise also and i do the same -- ` you go to town to-day i think you say ' question mr gold ` we will therefore take we leave of you now not to importune you further my niece and i will endeavor to be go from here to-morrow so please you to endure they presence in they father 's house until then for you must think it will ask a few hour for they to remove they apparel and other goods ' ` assuredly madam they have full liberty ' say mr dacre rise and bow and for a wonder look a little abashed ` and i think it be well we lose no time ' continue we aunt so we take we leave of he gladly enough and i think he be full as glad to have we go and we go back to the little parlor ' i guess what sort of kindness john dacre would show you ' say we aunt look at we with a smile ` you father my sweet maiden of whom you have a heavy loss indeed be of a much nobler nature than this he kinsman and it be doubtless for that reason that one of they have thrive in the bad air where the other could not thrive but perish ' and then come tear into she lively black eye and she be fain to sit down and weep awhile in which we bear she company then althea wipe she eye and say with a tremble voice -- ' i can not think however why we cousin should make so strange a proffer to I -- one so unfitting for a well-taught maiden to accept ' ` he make it that you might refuse it child ' say we aunt ` now he can truly say he be willing to do somewhat for you and that you would none of it but think scorn of he goodwill it have ever be he way to get much credit for little goodness well lucy child what art thinking of ' ' i be think ' stammer i surprise with she question -- ' i be think that the day be not so far spend but we could get away from milthorpe before night i wish not to sleep under mr dacre 's roof again ' ` that might be manage ' say mrs gold ' i leave my horse and my man at the little inn in you village where i have some thought of sleep myself and yet it be but a little inn nor should i care to turn andrew out of he lodging even to please thee pretty lucy no child put thy hand to some work and thy pride in thy pocket and submit even to spend one night in the house of a unkind kinsman he will not be in it thou knowest see where he ride out of the gate ' so i look and see mr dacre ride off a very grand gentleman on he tall black horse with he man also well mount follow he ` he will be in town before nightfall ' quoth mr gold it do not seem so insupportable to stay one more night in we old home now its new master have leave it but i be in haste to be go for all that and althea too so we fall to work with great eagerness gather all we own possession together and pack they for removal while mr gold help we with she hand and she counsel and so well we work that the sun have not go down before we have all in readiness for we departure in the early morning for it be the height of summer and the day therefore long then mr golding would have we take she into the garden and show we what use to be we mother 's favorite walk and alcove there be a good prospect of the house from one of they and she stand some time regard it ` it be a stately place ' say she -- ' a very noble house indeed and a fair garden too you mother have a pride in it once i know and there be a time when it would have grieve she sore to think how she child should leave it but what signify that to she now -- a happy glorified spirit who may scorn the transitory riches and joy of this poor world which be far outvalue by one ray shine on we from the father of light at he right hand be pleasure for evermore ' althea and i look on each other surprised for we have then hear little of that kind of talk and we aunt espy it -- ` ah child ' she say ' i have learn a new language since i see you and i see you know it not but you mother could speak it before i could i think thou art most like she lucy there be more of you poor father about althea ' i look at althea and think mr gold be not much mistaken for if i be to write my sister 's description it would need but the change of a word or two to make it pass for a portrait of my father like he she be tall and slender and well-shaped she complexion pale and clear she hair almost black very thick softer than the finest silk and curling in loose ring at the end she brow and eyelash black also but she eye a blue-grey appear black when she be much move or in deep thought and she move with admirable grace show a kind of nobleness in all she carriage myself be of low stature and of shape nothing like so slender indeed one have tell I i be dark and round as a blackheart cherry so i could well think that at mr golding 's year i should be very like she though perhaps less comely mr gold be still compare we with each other and speaking of we parent when i be aware of a tall man come up to the garden gate and my aunt turn as she hear the latch clink cry -- ` ah here be andrew he will have come to have my order for the night i think we may welcome he in niece ' so she step to he and take he by the hand lead he to we ` this ' quoth she ` be my husband 's nephew and mine but he be something more -- he be my steward and my heir i hold he for my son i be but a lose woman without he he would not hear of my come to milthorpe with no company but that of my serving-men but must need be my conductor himself so precious a jewel as i be sure to be lose in the hedge otherwise ' and she laugh cordially ` and andrew these be two poor fatherless girl althea and lucium dacre by name fatherless i say but not motherless for i be they mother from this day forth and so they be you sister see you use they kindly ' andrew color up to he hair and bow to we with some confused word about the honor of be as a brother to such gentle lady then he turn to she and they talk of we morrow 's journey and how we mail should be convey and mr gold tell he she would sleep at the manor bid he be early at the gate with horse for we ` for we have many a mile to go ' she say to we ` and make what speed we may we shall be a day or two on the road ' and althea speak very prettily to mr golding pray he to sup with we but he excuse himself still in a confused and disturbed way and go away while he stand and talk i be able to take note of he aspect and i think he look a very homely youth indeed after mr dacre though he be taller and of a better shape and i believe a better face too though burnt with the sun and ruddy like a country-man he have well-cut feature and a full mild eye with a right pleasant smile but he garb be so ordinary being of some dark cloth and cut very plainly and he hat with no feather in it that though i have little cause to love mr dacre yet i wish we new friend be more like he outwardly and think i should then have be prouder to ride in he company and mr gold praise he to we and say how good he be and wise beyond he year i think it be pity such good people as he and she do not go handsomer so little i know of what belong to goodness chapter ii how we journey up to yorkshire and how we be welcome there though i remember so plainly what pass on we last day in milthorpe manor-house i be not very clear about we journey up to yorkshire which be tedious enough we keep to the king 's highway and yet be sometimes put in much fear of thief but happily we fall in with none the only notable thing that befall we be in leave a little market town i can not call to mind its name where we have stop to dine we have ride but a little way forth of the town when we hear a great din of shout and hoot behind we which make we woman afraid and presently a noisy rabblement of people come run up they be chiefly of the baser sort both man and woman some very ragged and some red-faced and half tipsy one or two gentleman in lace coat ride among they i think at first they have some spite at we but it prove not so we draw to the wayside to let they pass and they go by very disorderly yell and swearing the woman not less than the man push and haul some poor creature drag along in they midst i look earnestly to see who it might be and presently discern the person -- a tall thin man in a kind of loose garment gird about he and i think it be make of some hempen stuff a kind of sack this man be very pale with longish dark hair hang about he face which as i say be pale indeed but not dismayed i think he even smile when one strike he on the head and another push he bid he with a curse go faster i see the blood trickle a little from the blow that have alight on he head as they hurry he past andrew who see all this as well as i do look full of horror he catch one of the hindmost of the rabble by the sleeve and ask he harshly ` what have this man do and whither be you take he ' at which the man turn towards we he red jovial face reply -- ` it be a mad quaker that take upon he this noon to stand up in we market-place it be market day and every one mighty busy and he tell we all to we face we be a set of cheating rogue that he have mark we doings and see how bad they be and that he have a commission from god to bid we repent and amend or a sudden dreadful judgment should fall on we do ever hear of such a fool ' ` and what more do he ' say andrew ` to make you handle he so roughly ' at which the man stare and say -- ` nay what more need there matter be come to a pretty pass if free englishman who be pleased to cheat and be cheat accord to the fashion of this world may not do so neighbourly and kindly without some canting rogue start up to control they we bid he hold he peace for a mad ass but he would not so we judge he frenzy to be something too hot and that a cold bath be good to cure it and squire ride up and see the bustle we be in offer we he own duck-pond for the duck of we preacher stay I no longer i shall lose the best sport ' and andrew snatch at he again to make he stay he break from he and run as hard as he could after the crowd that be now get some way from we ` you hear and see this mr gold ' say andrew turn to she he mild countenance grow dark with anger ` there may be murder do yet let I ride after and see what i can do to hinder it ' and set spur to he horse he gallop off after the rabble we see he press in among they ride close up to the chief horseman talk earnestly to he then we see no more of they they go round the turn of the road and mr gold half frowning half smile say -- ` it be ever so with andrew he can not see mischief a-foot but he be all afire to stop it i like it in the lad but i wish yon poor fanatic have be content to stay at home and mind he own business instead of cross we so unluckily here ' she look anxiously presently andrew come back to we ride pretty quickly and mr golding call to he -- ` now my lad hast not go on a fool 's errand this time also ' but he say smile -- ` that be as you take it good mother yon squire have some humanity in he and some wit for when i begin vehemently to urge how sinful be the murder of yon poor man he smile and let I know he proffer of the duck-pond be but to get the man out of the hand of he ill-wisher for he mean to draw the quaker within he gate and then have they shut as if by mistake on the rabble who be already grow aweary with the length of the way and so be drop off by two and three ' ` so thou hast have thy labor for thy pain ' say mr gold smile as one well pleased ` not altogether ' say andrew ` for the squire will we to turn into the byway here and keep from the high road awhile lest we meet the baser rascal come back in all they fury and disappointment ' ` good counsel ' say mr gold ` we will take it ' and so we keep to that byway for a mile or so and it be rough uneasy ride though a pretty green lane enough althea say to I half aside ` we have have none of these discomfort if we have ride as we be wont with we father in a good coach like gentlewoman and not a-horseback in the country fashion ' the first discontented word she have say and mr gold hear it -- ` child ' say she ' i can not away with these coach they be proud lazy invention and nothing like so wholesome as this we old country fashion of travel ' at which althea blush and say nothing more and mr golding begin pleasantly to chide andrew for he hazarding of we safety as he have do which have put althea into these discontent and he hang he head smile and have not a word to say for himself i should scarce have remember this accident or andrew 's behavior on it have it not be for thing that befall after i be heartily weary of journey by the time we get to west fazeby the way be long the manner of travel new to I i have not so much as sleep at a inn before we former home be no great distance from town and my company be not such as to shorten the way for aunt golding be the only frank and cheerful-spoken person in we party althea behave as i tell she like a enchanted princess in a fairy tale so melancholy proud and silent and andrew be so dash with she stately way that the poor youth be not less tongue-tied than she so i be glad indeed when we ride out of york one fine morning and mr gold tell we we must reach she house before the day be out in which she say no more than truth she have always talk of it as a poor farmhouse we surprise be not little when we see it at last it stand a little away from the village it be no great house but be a right fair one to my think build of red brick with a great deal of wood handsomely carve about the gable and the porch it be much grow with ivy at which we aunt would often rail but i think for all that she love it see it make the house green and pleasant even in winter and at the back look into the garden and orchard be a pleasant porch a very large one grow with rose as well as ivy wherein althea and i have spend many a happy hour in summer-time sit there with we needlework or we lute i can see it in fancy and would very fain be in it look on we lily bed and green walk and arbor instead of these hot and dreary street but it be too likely i shall never see west fazeby or any other pleasant place on earth again a good comely man and woman plainly habit like serve folk come forth to greet mr gold and she commend we to they much as she have do to andrew say to we ` these be matthew standfast and he wife grace good kind soul who look well to my house when i can not do it and how doth little patience ' she go on to ask dame standfast ` and have you see aught of mr truelocke while i have be go ' and so chat she lead we into the hall where we find a table ready covered and the little patience standfast ready to attend we at it a pretty child fair-haired and blue-eyed very civil and modest we be not long in find that she and she parent with a serving-man or two make all my aunt 's household and that she do very much work with she own hand and would expect the like of we a thing which displeased althea not a little but she say nothing of it only to I when we be get to we own chamber ` and it be a odd thing ' she continue when i do not reply ` that mr golding should sit and should take she meal in the open hall when there be one or two fair parlor more fitting for she occupation ' ` but the hall be a pleasant place ' i say and indeed it be so to I i hardly know why be a very plain apartment with a checkered pavement of blue and white stone and furnish only with bright oaken table and settle and a great chair or two also the great fireplace be well garnish with green bough and flower it be summer i look all about it that evening as we sit in it chat with we aunt and be think i should always like it plain as it be when i be aware of two person come into the porch one walk feebly like a old man and one step firmly and strongly and mr golding spring up run forward to greet they say -- ` welcome welcome good mr truelocke this be a greater kindness than i have hope for ' so she draw into the light of we candle a reverend old gentleman clothe in a black gown he have white hair hang about he face and in he hand a stout staff on which he lean as he walk there come at he side a young strongly-framed man in a seaman 's habit who i think look something like he have the same strong feature but a clear merry blue eye and brown curl hair he be very watchful over the old gentleman who seem to move feebly we aunt greet he kindly by the name of ` master harry ' and say ` it be good of you to bring you father up so soon to welcome I ' whereon the young man smile and say -- ` nay it be he that have bring I there be no hold he when he have hear of you return i would gladly have keep he within door fear the night damp for he ' and we aunt laugh also and say to we -- ` come althea come lucy and speak to my best friend who be a good friend to you mother also it be the parson of this parish mr truelocke and this he son harry newly come home from the sea ' so we come up and greet the old gentleman reverently and he son as kindly as we might and mr gold put mr truelocke into a great armed chair and sit look at he with vast contentment he look at she and smile a wonderfully sweet smile ` have you bring these young maid home a month or two later mr gold ' say he ` you could not truly tell they i be the parson of this parish or of any other but we 'll let that pass ' and turn to we he begin to speak to we kindly and fatherly pity we affliction and bid we praise and thank god who have raise up so good a friend to help we i be glad to hear he word though they bring the tear into mine eye but we aunt sit impatiently and presently break in on he discourse say -- ` what mean you sir by tell I in a month or two you will be no parson of this parish be there anything new ' ` nothing but the fall of a full-ripe fruit that begin to blossom two year agone ' say the old gentleman cheerfully ` it have be long a-ripening 'twa time it should fall ' ` give I none of you parable good friend i want plain speech ' cry we aunt and master harry say bluntly -- ` madam it be all along of the new act for uniformity which be print and set forth this last may you be too full at that time of you apprehension for these young lady to be curious to read that mischievous act but since it touch my father nearly he master its meaning with great pain and have think of little else for many day and the upshot of all this be that next bartholomew-tide he will go forth like abraham of old to wander he know not whither ' at which word mr gold sigh deeply and sit as one amaze ` it be even so my kind friend ' say mr truelocke smile ` well i can not tell what you may think here of the matter ' go on master harry ` but in my conscience i think my father 's conscience something too tender ' ` you speak like a man of this world harry ' say andrew who have come in and be look at the young man with frown brow and angry eye ` how else would you have I speak ' say harry ' i be but a plain sailor and i pretend not to know any world but this work-a-day world that i have to get my bread in i leave the new world in the moon or beyond it to poet and madman and i 'll tell you my mind of the matter if you will hear I he stop and mr golding say ` speak you mind master harry it be ever a honest mind and full of goodwill ' ' i will venture then ' say he ` and do you bear with I andrew and father too i take it the church of this country be a good ship that have to sail whither she owner will a while since they be all for steer she straight to the presbyterian port now that voyage like they not and they would have she make for prelacy it be pity that the good ship have owner of such inconstant mind but why should not the crew obey order and sail the ship as they be bid ' ` wrong all wrong all wrong harry my boy ' say the old man with a groan ` thou hast no spiritual sense of these thing how dare christ 's liegeman take they order from the carnal ruler of this or any other country have i not see the government of england change like the moon ay and more strangely and shall i follow the change moon as doth the faithless sea ebb and flow in my zeal for truth like the tide nay verily what be god 's truth in oliver 's day be the truth of god still and i will cleave to it ' as i gazed at the old man 's face pale and wrinkled and awful i think that so might have look the prophet mose when he brake the table of the law mr truelocke 's deepset dark eye flash fire under he long white eyebrow which themselves seem to stir and to rise and fall as he speak with great passion and he strike he staff against the floor althea be look from one to another something puzzle presently she silver voice break the silence that have fall upon we she say ` all that you say be so dark to I it make I feel like a fool for my lack of comprehension will you madam tell I in a few word what it be that trouble you and mr truelocke ' ` it be we new master dear heart who have be make of new law ' say mr golding and andrew add instantly -- ` we pastor madam must consent to renounce the covenant and must use the common prayer-book as newly set forth by authority of king charle the second and he parliament or they must leave to preach and to pray in the church call of england and must renounce they living too and this by the twenty-fourth of August next which the papist and such-like cattle call st bartholomew 's day that be the story in little of the doings which afflict we good mother and we reverend friend ' ` it be a dry short setting forth of the matter friend andrew ' say the old man ` but be it a true one ' ask althea ` yea ' say he ` too true this be the new law but i shall as i think follow after the footstep of godly mr baxter he have already cease preach that he weaker brethren such as i may be in no manner of doubt as to what he thinketh i shall not change my mind twice once have see the great error of my early prelatical opinion -- as you good aunt knoweth i have see it ' ` well ' say mrs golding sigh heavily ` we will pray you may have illumination from above i can not tell how we shall do bereft of we father in christ but i dare not urge any man against he conscience and now be i ashamed that you have be so long within my door and i have yet set nothing before you lucy althea come help I ' and she bustle about and presently with we help have set a dish of strawberry and cream with nut and cake and wine before we guest mr truelocke eat but little which grieve my aunt and he would drink nothing but spring water but harry be gay enough for two we could get he to touch nothing until he have both of we girl serve he say we be greater stranger than he and since i choose to eat nut he would do the same and would crack all mine for I he have a clever way of do this with he hand only which be small but like iron for strength i make a cup of my hand that he might pour the sweet kernel into it and so do we scatter some on the floor and both dropt on we knee to pick they up when i be nimbler than he have they all snatch up before he could touch one then we both laugh heartily i be startle to hear myself laugh and look at althea and she seem to be regard I with scorn as if she despise I perfectly so i check my laughing and sit down quite crestfallen then harry sit by I half whisper ` now sweet madam if you do but know what music a heart-free laugh be to mine ear you would not stop yours in the middle i have no quarrel with my father 's nor you aunt 's piety but there be too little laughing in it ' ` it be not piety that check I now ' i say ` do not credit I with more than i have but a new-made orphan like I might well feel it something heartless to be very mirthful ' ` that be it be it ' say he look comically from I to althea and then at I again ` now tell I sweet lady if you know any good reason why mirth should be a thing forbid to those who have have a cruel loss if in the middle of a winter voyage when the stormy wind do blow we mariner should have one fair sunshine day we do not spend it in bemoan the black day that go before and the black day that will come after ' ` and what have that to do with I and my grief ' ask i ` only this ' say he ` that you should not be less wise than a sailor lad think no shame to be glad when you heart bid you whatever sorrow lie before or behind you and i 'll keep you in countenance whenever i see you fair mournful sister reprove you gaiety with she eye but you must do the same by I with my father and you aunt be it a bargain strike hand on it ' he hold out he hand and i put mine into it -- i could not help it though i steal a look at althea but she attention be draw away by andrew who be half timidly urge she to eat some more of mr golding 's dainty she would not however and presently mr truelocke who have be talk apart with mr gold get up and would be go so when he and harry be withdraw we all go shortly to we bed be very weary and for my part i feel that i be in a new world i could not half understand but there seem some pleasant thing in it i like it better still as the day run on country life at west fazeby be more to my mind than ever it have be at milthorpe there we be wait on dutifully by kind old servant and might not soil we finger by any coarse work here i be take into the dairy and the still-room and instruct in they mystery and in many another useful household art i might feed the pigeon and the other pretty feathered folk in the barnyard and i get no reproof for my coarse taste when i be find learn from grace standfast how to milk a cow and make acquaintance with young foal and calf there be prettier work too gather and make conserve of rose and share in the pleasant harvest of the strawberry bed and the cherry orchard or toss of hay in the meadow i will not deny that all these thing be more pleasant to I that year than they have ever be since partly because i be so new to they and partly because harry truelocke often take part in they also my merry and kind playfellow i wonder if you have yet any heart for such simple pleasure or if in the midst of misery and peril you can still jest and laugh althea go with I and share in these occupation except in the haymaking and the milk but she do so with a grave and serious air seem to give she whole mind to the work as if it be a task she have to learn whereas i think it but a delightful pastime that i loved in spite of its be profitable mr gold take no note as it seem of althea 's sad and steadfast way but andrew mark they i could see though be daily busy with out-door matter and care of we aunt 's estate he be but little in we company when he be with we he surround althea with a careful watchful kindness treat she so reverently as if she be some sacred thing and indeed never venture to say much to she unless she speak first all which she never appear to notice now it be a strange thing that in this pretty peaceful time the stormiest day and the fruitfullest of future mischief should have be a certain lord 's day only a week or two after we come it be from mr truelocke that i learn to say ` the lord 's day ' Sunday say he be a heathenish idolatrous word nor would he allow of the fashion of call the day of rest ` the sabbath ' ` we keep not holy ' say he ` the seventh-day sabbath of the people of israel but the first day make holy for we by the resurrection of we lord ' and i say idly to he out of the poet shakespeare whom my father love -- ` what be in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet ' -- he look sternly almost angrily on I and say ` madam what have end of stage-play and the idle talk of a lovesick girl about she lover 's name and the name of flower -- i say what have these vanity to do with a glorious divine thing like the christian 's day of rest and believe I there be much in name too much in name what a spell to conjure with be the name of king and the name of priest may make wild work in we poor england yet ' i be dumb when he reprove I thus and thinking of it after i begin to have some glimmer why this good man should resolve to give up he all rather than use a prayer-book he deem not accord to right doctrine since he be so earnest about the right name for one holy day i find it to be a strong point with he some of he flock murmur at he about it and say how could we appeal to the fourth commandment if we holy day might not be call the sabbath but he care not for they word no nor for king nor for parliament compare with what he deem right i use to wonder if he heart would have be so stout have he have wife and child to care for but he have be many year widow and harry he only child have carve he own way in the world be now part owner of the ship he sail himself but by whatever name folk call it the lord 's day in west fazeby be then a sweet religious holy day and i love it alas to think of the change wicked man have make chapter iii how mr truelocke preach he last sermon in west fazeby on that lord 's day of which i speak the weather be fair and bright when we go to worship in the church where mr truelocke still minister week after week more people come to hear he for the time be grow short and he be much loved so this day the church be throng and we have some ado to get to we own place as i say the day be fair enough when we set forth a little too hot indeed but we have not be long at we prayer before there come a gloom and a darkness make the church full of shadow and i see the sky through the window of a strange greenish and coppery color we be sing the hymn before the sermon when i be aware of a tall man in a whitish garment standing directly below the pulpit still as a stone it seem to I i have see he once before when the singing be do and we be all in readiness to hear the sermon this man suddenly stand up on the bench so that even in the dusky light every one could see he tall white figure and look up to mr truelocke in the pulpit he say -- ` may i have liberty to speak a few word to this people ' ` you have liberty ' say mr truelocke then folding he arm on the desk he lean forward and look very intently on the man who have turn himself to face the people they be all rustling and stir in they place very uneasy at the interruption he stretch out he arm in the form of a cross and begin to speak in a full and rich voice very musical with strange change in it and always the sky grow darker in the great window behind he while he speak ` friend ' say he ' i have listen earnestly to you singing and now i be constrain to speak to you and tell you the word you sing be very unsuitable to you state for the word be those of holy humble soul who be athirst after god and how many of you be there that could truly answer yea if one should ask whether you be come here because you hunger and thirst after righteousness be it not true that the best of you only take delight in the preaching of the man who stand in yon pulpit because it be to you as a very lovely song of one that can play on a pleasant instrument but you hear he word and do they not and there be some of you that only come here to display you gay apparel caring not how foul you be within if you be but fair without and some of you appear here weekly because it be a decent and seemly thing to be here and you desire the praise of man though you care not for please god you religious worship and way be vain for they be make up only of speaking and singing other man 's word which be not yours nor do ye mean they truly you be better to sit in humble silence before god wait till he spirit that enlighteneth every man should speak in secret to you spirit ` and i have a word to thee emanuel truelocke ' he continue suddenly turn lift he long right arm and point he long finger towards mr truelocke whose pale countenance frame in he long white hair could still be see look quietly at he ' i desire to speak to thee in love and show thee the secret of thy ill success in thy ministering to this worldly people who have not the excellent spirit that i gladly acknowledge in thyself the canker of gold have be on these ministering of thine for thou hast yearly take hire for they and therefore it be that so many of these people be cold and sickly in divine thing but the lord have have mercy on thee and will take away from thee the mammon whereby thou hast be deceive and for thy sake i rejoice in thy come downfall ' -- here there begin a mighty hubbub in the place man stand up on bench shake they stick and clenched fist against the speaker woman cry ` shame on he pull he down have he away ' and many rush upon he strike he drag he down and would soon have trample he under they foot but mr truelocke speak with a voice that ring like a trumpet and say -- ` do the man no harm for shame my brethren do not i tell he he have liberty to speak make I not a liar by you violence ' and then i see several man andrew and harry be foremost raise up the stranger for he have be fell to he knee push off those who be striking he and lead he forth of the church then a mighty flash of lightning glare through the building and a great peal of thunder roar and echo after it and the rain rush down like a torrent drive and beat against the window the stranger who have be get to the door now turn round cry -- ` hearken o people to the voice of the lord bearing witness against you madness ' with which word he vanish friendly hand pull he out of sight against he will a great silence seem at once to fall upon the people while the storm blaze and thunder on and in the midst of it mr truelocke begin he discourse ` my brethren ' say he ' i do not think to have be so cruelly put to shame as i have be by you this day long have i toil to make you follow he righteousness who when he be revile revile not again long have i trust that you be indeed partaker of that spirit whose fruit be love joy peace longsuffer gentleness goodness alas what longsuffer what peace what gentleness have you show to-day ye have well-nigh do a man to death in the very house of god and before the eye of I you pastor i stand rebuke here a teacher whose teaching be prove useless and fruitless from this day forth i will preach to you no more but will lay down a little before the law take it from I the office i have so ill discharge now hearken to I once more and once only and let not my last sermon prove so idle as those i have preach to you before ' with this preamble which strike every one into awe he begin to preach with a uncommon fervor as one who be all on fire to have man turn from they sin and to close with the offer of god 's mercy while yet it be time and this earnestness of he and a certain passionate tenderness in he look and tone something more than ordinary would not let we forget the resolve he have express he text be ` how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation ' and have enlarged on it with such piercing eloquence as i have speak of and come to a end of he discourse he make a little pause and then say -- ` little as i like to mingle any private matter of mine own with the message i stand here to deliver i have determine when i should come before you for the last time to say something of the reason why i can not comply with what we ruler require of we i will not depart from that determination because a strange cause have move I to lay down mine office some few day sooner than law require ' he stop a moment look troubled then he resume : ` not my own humor nor the pride of a vain consistency hold I back from compliance i have seek in prayer and in study and in discourse with my brethren for light on this matter but in my mind be something still unsatisfied that bid I persevere in my fixed opinion so long adopt i can do no other therefore submit patiently to leave my church and my flock i pray you pardon for any fault i make in this resolution of god 's pardon i be assure ' have say thus he bow he fatherly head pray inwardly and all the congregation weep and pray with he though many of they afterwards show themselves highly displeased with the way he have take of rebuke they violence also great effort be use to make he break he resolve of preach there no more it want more than a week or two of the appoint day in August when he must need desist but he would not yield to do more than pray publicly and the pulpit be for a season supply by other man i be wander away however from that day and its doings of which i have not finish the account while mr truelocke be preach the storm draw off and die away in distant muttering so that it be in a very great stillness that he speak he last word however the rain be still fall though without violence when we come out of the church so we wait awhile in the porch till the cloud have roll away many other who do not love a wet do the same as we and there be much talk none of we party say aught till mr bonithorne one of the wealthiest farmer ' wife in the parish turn herself to aunt golding say -- ` hear you ever anything so strange neighbor as yon awful thunder-clap come close on the malicious word of the brawl quaker he ought to have quake and tremble indeed at the voice of heaven rebuke he madness ' ` but that he do not mistress ' say i something too pertly i fear ` for he bid the people hearken to the voice of god bearing witness against _ they _ ' ` do he so ' cry she ` the more be he impudence to wrest the heavenly sign in he favor but what make you then of the pass away of the storm when mr truelocke begin to preach and of the sweet calm that have fall on all thing when he end be that a witness in favor of quaker madness ' ` nay i make nothing of it ' say i and aunt golding add -- ` you would not interpret it as a sign of approval grant to mr truelocke for he hasty resolve never to preach to we again for my part i hope he will be persuade otherwise ' ` truly i hope so ' say dame bonithorne she ruddy color deepen ` for it be too cruel a affront he put on we poor people ' and i know not how much more she might have say but for harry truelocke who now come up to the porch and beckon aunt golding forth whisper to she how andrew have carry the quaker to the grange and now desire she presence at which we all set forth together the rain have cease and on the road harry tell we what sore disquieted aunt golding that the man have only come to west fazeby on andrew 's account ` it seem ' say he ` you meet he on you road hither when he be in the hand of some base fellow that have a mind to maul he -- do you remember such a matter ' and aunt golding say how she remember it very well harry go on to say that the man have note andrew 's willingness to serve he have ever since ` have a concern on he mind for the good youth ' -- that be he phrase -- and have be lead to we village and to the very church be assure he would see andrew there ` it be a strange mad story ' quoth harry althea have give earnest heed to this tale and now she ask ` and what say master andrew to such wild talk i suppose he will use the poor deluded wretch gently and kindly that be he nature but sure he will scorn he ravings ' ' i can not tell what andrew may think in he heart ' say harry moodily ` but he use the man as if he think he a saint or a martyr or both i wish harm may not come of this day 's doings ' and he fall into a gloomy silence i have never see he look so nearly angry before we be now get to the parsonage and harry arouse himself to take leave of we we aunt say to he -- ' i shall ask you to do I a great good turn by bring you father to sup with we at the grange i would have he reason peaceably with yon poor distraught man and convince he of he folly so he may do a service to my andrew also if he have indeed a lean to such delusion ' ` well madam i will do it for you ' say harry ` but there be only one other person in the world to please whom i would bring my father into such odd company as yon man 's ' and he go in look but half pleased and as we take we way to the grange i be muse who that other person might be harry be so fain to please when we get into the hall we see andrew sit there and talk with the stranger who be now clothe like any other man he face have be bruise and he hair tear by the violence of the people but for all these disfigurement i look earnestly at he could see he be the very one the sight of whose ill-usage have so move andrew on we journey there be the same compose look and the same strange inward light in he eye he rise when he see aunt golding come in salute she with the word ` peace be to thee ' on which she gravely smile say -- ` you do not bring peace with you to we place of worship sir but i trust no one will break you peace in my house where you be welcome to rest and refresh you this day ' ` no man can break my peace ' say he ` my soul be ever at rest in the holy city the new jerusalem ' ` that be a good resting-place indeed ' say we aunt ` will you tell I by what name i be to call you while you stay here i think no one in we village know who you be ' ` not every one can know my name but they that have the light ' say the man ` and the world can never know it ' ` but sure man you have a name of you own by which the world do know you ' say we aunt a little impatiently ' i wish not to deny it ' he reply ` therefore fret not thyself good friend -- my worldly name be james westrop and i will tell thee what thou askest not that my errand hither be to this young man andrew golding i have now tell he my message so i be free to depart and if thou likest not of my talk or my way i refuse not to leave thy house and protection this hour ' ` but i will not have you go ' say she 'till you be refresh and rest and in good time here come the vicar whom i have desire to sup with we and to reason with you you will not refuse he company he scorn not yours ' ' i will not refuse it ' say westrop gravely and mr truelocke come in at that moment with harry we all go presently to table i marvelled greatly during the meal at mr truelocke 's courtesy so kindly do he speak to the quaker and he strive to excuse to he the mad behavior of the people ascribe it to they regard for they ancient pastor now about to leave they ' i pray you ' he say ` to pardon they for my sake ' ` friend ' say jame westrop ' i have pardon they before they offend but thou art deceive if thou thinkest it be love to thee which move they they could not endure my word because they own spirit be foul my word be to they as the shine of a candle into a dark dirty place and the sight of they foulness make they mad against I but in thee i perceive purity of intention and i will gladly reason with thee of the thing of the spirit accord to this good woman 's desire ' so after supper aunt golding show the quaker and mr truelocke into a parlor and herself with andrew go in to hear they reasoning but althea whisper I and say ` let we go and walk in the garden i can not stay and hear the man 's insolent talk ' so we step out and begin to pace up and down one of the walk the moon be just rise and the evening very sweet and calm -- a pleasant change it be after the heat and storm of that afternoon 's work presently harry join we and say at once ` well sweet lady so you have no mind to turn quaker ' ` as soon shall this rise turn nettle ' say althea pluck a white rise off a bush and give it to he ` keep it i pray you and when you find it will sting you to touch it then conclude althea dacre have turn quaker ' ` give I you rise too mistress lucium ' say harry so i gather one and put it in he hand but i feel oblige to say -- ' i can not speak so confidently as my sister i know nothing of these people and they doctrine ' ` you see they doings ' say althea indignantly ` that should be enough mr truelocke lucium and i be breed up true churchwoman and so i will continue to my die day i love not all these sect that spring up like weed in the ruin place of the church i be for those who be build up she wall again and make they stronger ' ` and be this you mind too mistress lucium ' say harry ' i fear I if it be you will not approve my good father either ' at which althea go red and go pale for she have not think how she word might hit mr truelocke but since she do not speak i say -- ` be so ignorant about these thing i do not like to say much except that i hate these new harsh law -- axis i think they lop off from we church she true faithful member as if they be diseased limb i fear I the poor trunk that be leave will be like a headless handless corpse without they ' ` well god mend all ' say harry draw a long breath ` for my part all i know be that i would these great folk who rule we now have let my father end he day in peace without pester he about surplice and prayer-book and the sign of the cross all which he hold for rank papistry i suppose and i can not wish he to lie even about such foolish trifle as these thing appear to I but what profit wish ' ` very little ' say althea sigh softly ' i might wish too all in vain that i have not speak with such needless warmth even now ' and she begin entreat he to believe she have mean no disrespect to he father but he cut she short assure she he know it already ` my father be not in all you thought ' say he ` but he be seldom out of mine i be ever longing to see he settle in some peaceful shelter before i go to sea ' and he look more downcast than i have ever see he we be get into the orchard now wind in and out among the tree and althea go muse by herself but i could not help linger beside harry to say some comfortable word about how all folk love mr truelocke my aunt especially and i know it be in she mind to have the old gentleman make he home at the grange with she if he only would ` ay ' say harry ` that be a larger if than you wot of sweet lucy but would it please you as well as mr gold to have the old man living under this roof ' and i answer hastily -- ` nothing could like I better than to have so kind and fatherly a man dwelling with we not to say that he holiness and piety would bring down heaven 's blessing on any house that sheltered he and i promise you ' i go on ` that i for my part would show he all a daughter 's love and duty ' -- ` and so will althea ' -- i would fain have add have not harry cut my speech short say -- ` that be a charming word on you lip when you speak of my father -- the word of daughter i hope you consider what it may mean to I ' ` sure ' i say ' i be very willing to take you for my brother if that be what you aim at ' ` no no lucy ' say he ' i wish not to be you brother i refuse altogether to let you think of I as such but i have nothing to say against mistress althea as a sister think well of my word will you ' and take my hand he put it to he lip and it be not the first time in truth that such a courtesy have be show I but with a fine gentleman it seem such a matter of course it be not so with the frank and blunt sailor who have have a kind of puritan bringing-up too so i suppose that be the reason it make I tremble so strangely or perhaps the look on he face be the cause i be therefore not sorry to see althea come up to we again ` we have better keep nearer the house they conference may be over and mr golding will not know where to find we ' she say so we turn back and all three pace up and down the terrace under the window for a while then we go into the hall and sit there await the end of the disputation at last we see mr truelocke mr gold jame westrop and andrew all issue forth together and all but one seem mightily disturbed mr truelocke look stern and sad and mr golding have be weep andrew gaze on the quaker with much anxiety but with such reverence as if he see in he a angel of god as for jame westrop there be no change in he only he usual composure seem a little exalted if i may so phrase it he walk straight to the hall door andrew keep by he there he make a stand and raise he hand as if in blessing -- ` peace be to this house ' he say ' i have be well entreat in it though it approve I not friend andrew thou and i will meet again but now follow I not i may not sleep under this roof have many mile to go before the sun rise ' and with that he turn and walk out of the door which he shut after he and andrew who have stop at he word come slowly back to we althea now rise from she place and go towards he she eye be very bright and there be unusual color in she cheek indeed she seem carry quite out of herself yet she keep she queenly look and gait withal ` mr golding say she put she hand on he arm ` what mean that man by he farewell to you sure you be not befooled and lead away by he deceive word to believe such madness as he speak ' andrew start at she touch like a man wake from a dream he then look seriously at she and say -- ` madam i can not say yet how much i believe of yon good man 's doctrine but i will not rest till i know more of it if i find it to be as heavenly true as it have seem to I this day not all the joy and glory of the world should hold I back from embrace it at which althea let she hand fall from he arm stand as if she be turn into stone she eye remain fix on he sorrowfully i suppose he could not endure that look for he turn away sharply and go out of the hall ' i fear this ' say mr truelocke he look quite weary and spend ` these man have a strange eloquence and i can not wonder that such youth as we andrew should think they word be indeed set off by some superior power -- the more since none can deny that they preach what they practice i would i could have imbue all my hearer with a like burning sincerity ' this be nearly all i hear about that long conference of theirs for after some more lamentation over its ill result which harry whisper I they might have expect mr truelocke depart with he son and aunt golding remain so troubled that i do not like to question she about what have pass but all the more be i curious to know what the man 's doctrine be and on the first fair occasion i find i begin to ask andrew to describe it to I poor youth he be mightily please with my inquiry think doubtless that it spring from a real thirst for truth like he own and to the best of he power he comply with my wish i find he have not be altogether ignorant of this new teaching for some month back ` we english christian ' say he ` have fall into many hurtful snare by we lack of faith in god 's great gift of the holy spirit the mighty boon which the rise savior promise to he follower and which truly come accord to he word i have often wonder ' say he ` that we all profess and say as often as we repeat the creed i believe in the holy ghost yet we act and think as if we believe not in he ' and from this point he go on to tell I how george fox first of all and many other after he have be go about the country endeavor to make people alive to the high privilege they have so long slight to they own exceed hurt ` also ' say he ` these man in obedience to the inward voice that instruct they strive to bring people off from they formal man-made religion to the primitive purity of christ 's religion which consist not in rite and ceremony repeat of form of prayer singing of hymn and ringing of bell but in a holy and harmless life ' and he quote many thing out of the sermon on the mount ` which ' say he ` the common run of christian never dream of obey but the poor friend practice they most strictly ' all this be most alluring to andrew for as i have often notice he detest nothing so much as false profession and a show of goodness where none be i ask he curiously why the friend behave themselves in such strange fashion in public place and church when he answer I by refer to the bold speech of ancient prophet in rebuke of sin and ask I if i could think that a man might now-a-days refuse to carry god 's message to sinner because it might bring he into bodily peril ` it be far worse ' say he ` to disobey the divine voice that still small voice that be hear by the restful soul than to endure a little pain at man 's hand or even the death of the body ' well i could not wonder that he be charm with such teaching for while i listen to he my own heart be move strangely but it evermore end with my resolve to keep to the opinion of my aunt and mr truelocke i think they be both too good to be far mistaken but andrew now begin to be often away from home and he make no secret that he go to meet with westrop and other friend from whom he often have letter also he be never at west fazeby on the lord 's day and aunt golding and althea also show themselves mightily afflict thereat chapter iv how harry truelocke leave we for the sea and now come fast upon we that black day the twenty-fourth of August 1662 when such number of faithful minister be stript of they office and living because they would not go against they conscience and we own mr truelocke among they i think he be more stiffly set than ever in he opinion of the unlawfulness of conformity since he have that talk with jame westrop at least aunt golding think so but on other point he show himself mild and persuadable so that there be nothing like the difficulty harry and all of we have look for in win he to come and dwell at the grange for a season at least and he agree to make the change before the fatal day should come so we have all a busy time of it that last week in get he many book and he simple household stuff remove from the parsonage house and in bestow they suitably at the grange where aunt golding have prepare two fair room for he particular use and however bad the occasion for we do this work some of we find pleasure in it i must own i myself always love a busy bustling time when there seem a little more to be do in each day than we could crowd into it which be we case now wheat harvest have begin and i be gladder than common of the stir and the bustle for it help to stupefy and dull a pain there be at my heart whenever the thought cross I how soon harry would be go he be to depart on a long voyage to the east indy and would indeed have sail already but for he loving care about he father which make he resolute to tarry until he see the old gentleman in a manner provide for some perverse whimsy of mine have make I careful never to be leave alone in harry 's company since that talk with he by moonlight in the orchard it be no wonder that i so perfectly recollect all the saying and doings of that day for it be a fateful day indeed to some of we little company but the thing that dwell most constantly in my memory to the shut out of weightier matter be harry 's look and word on my say i would be as a daughter to mr truelocke there be small need to bid I think well of they i thought of they whether i would or no all the while tell myself that i be a poor fool for brood over such airy trifle that i have not know aught of harry nor he of I six month before and that i deserve whipping for fancy he could mean anything serious and so between a kind of fear and a good deal of pride i try as i have say to avoid any private talk with he and i succeed pretty well but harry 's blunt plain-spoken way overmatch I after all the first evening after mr truelocke have come to the grange -- i can not say after we have he settle there for he be mightily unsettled -- he be not able to rest in the room we have fit for he study and so come to sit among we in the hall seem to please himself with watch we occupation as he sit in he great chair andrew be write somewhat at he desk althea have some sewing and i be have a lesson from aunt golding in the right use of the little flax-wheel for i have take a extraordinary fancy for spin and we aunt encourage I in it and take pain to teach I say i be a apt scholar thus we be busy when harry come in and sit down among we ` you all look peaceful and content methink ' quoth he ' i wish i be a skilful painter then might i make a picture of this pretty scene to carry with I and cheer my heart in distant sea but since i can not do that i must try for some other comfort to take away with I ' here he stopt and aunt golding say kindly ` what be in my power to do for you master harry i will do as freely as you father could ' ` thanks madam ' say harry ` there be much you and my father can do for I i know only one other person who can do more father i look for you in you study even now but i be not sorry to find you here instead hardly any one here but have some interest in my business with you i want you consent and mr golding 's to my seek mistress lucy here for my wife ' i hear the word plainly and i suppose they sense reach I but if they have be so many blow of a axe upon my head they could not have leave I more stupid so i sit helpless hearing aunt golding cry out -- ` here be hasty work indeed do you speak seriously master harry ' ` never more seriously ' say he ` if they be the last word i should speak i could not mean they more truly and heartily and i hope you have a good answer for I ' ' i do not say no ' she reply ` but there be other to be consult beside I ' so harry look at mr truelocke say ` father call you thought off from you unkind mother church and bestow some of they on you dutiful son will you give I you sanction and you blessing if i can win this lady to say she will be mine ' ' i can never refuse thee my blessing harry and that thou knowest ' say the old man ` but it be fitting that i should think of the lady too and bid she consider what she do ' he turn to I which trouble I greatly and look sadly and kindly at I say -- ` if you take this boy of mine madam ' say he ` you take the son of a poor despise aged man who can give you and he nothing but a father 's blessing couple with he burdensome infirmity to care for and tend till death remove it ' word which loose my tongue straightway to say i should deem such a office a pride and honor ` that be not all ' say mr truelocke ` harry have choose to embrace a dangerous wander way of life neither very glorious nor very profitable and he bride will have to spend many a sad lonely hour while she husband be toss on the sea and she sit tremble at home deprive of he protection and doubtful of he fate ' ` that be a very odd way of recommend my suit father ' say harry a little uneasily ` nay i have not do my recommendation ' reply mr truelocke ` let I say all you should further consider mistress lucy that this son of mine be so light of spirit and careless of speech that some will say he have no constancy of disposition i will not so far slander he for i know he better but this i must say for it be truth that he have not yet that confirm and settle piety i should desire in the husband of mine own daughter if i have one now i have lay before you all the disadvantage of the match it be for you to say if you will have it ' i wonder if ever a love-suit be so urge before it make I heartily angry to hear poor harry so disparaged to he face and to see he sit so downcast a cloud of angry color mount to he very forehead i suppose pity for he kill all my bashfulness for i stand up and say passionately i think no worse of a man for have the bold adventurous nature which love seafare that be a noble trade i say and we mariner the very flower of england and as for light spirit and merry speech they be but flower cover a rock for steadfast as a rock be the heart under that gay show ` and if you speak of piety ' i wind up ' i be sure harry have as much of it as i have at least he have some faith some love and so i hope have i but we will help each other up to better thing and here be my hand on it if he will take it ' with that i hold out my hand to he and he spring up and grasp it in both he look exultingly at he father it be a pleasure to see how he face have change all in a moment mr truelocke smile but he shake he head too say -- ` well child i blame you not the lord will surely teach you and lead you it may be in way you will not like for it be on my mind that you both have much to learn and much to suffer before you marriage day shall dawn ' and now aunt golding who love harry and never could endure to have he cross begin to laugh outright ' i will own ' she say ' i think you very unmerciful to you good son mr truelocke while you continue to run he down so shamefully but now i see you take the right way to advance he cause it be wonderful what a spice of contradiction will do with a woman lucy you would never have make this bold open confession without some such provocation ' -- word which abashed I much for they be true and now no one present have a word more to say against it harry and i exchange ring and mr truelocke in a few pathetic word besought heaven 's blessing on we contract i do believe harry would not have be sorry could he have call I wife before he go away but every one frown on this fancy of he when he distantly hint it he do not urge it and truly the time be too short i be a little afraid of althea lest she should think i have every way demean myself but she never have own that she think so ` these thing go by destiny little lucy ' she say once ' i be not strong enough to control fate and certainly you be not so why should i blame you be not all we folly write in the star when we be bear ' i could not tell then what to make of she mocking word know how she despise what people call astrology as for andrew he could talk cheerfully of nothing at this time and the hopefullest word he could find for harry and I be that though in these evil day there could be no love-thought or marriage-thought for such as he he would not say they be forbid to other and he wish we all the happiness we could get poor cold word but harry say 'twa wonderful andrew could say as much on any worldly matter this be the manner of we betrothing and be it not for harry 's ring still shine on my finger and also for the odd unusual fashion of the whole thing which be what i never could have dream i should be sadly apt to think of it as a dream too pleasant to be true for within a day or two harry have leave we and go to hull from which port he sail i have never see he since also it be now a full twelve-month since any letter from he reach we yet i can not believe he be dead and if he be live i know he be true and living or dead i have a strong persuasion that my little ruby ring which be my mother 's once be on he finger still but many a time have i think on mr truelocke 's word how we both should have much to learn and much to suffer before we marriage day i think the word be true chapter v how andrew make one enemy and be like to have another and now my happy time be over its story be all tell so far and i must write of darker day that come after the living of west fazeby left vacant because of mr truelocke 's sturdiness in he opinion do not wait long for a incumbent but be quickly bestow on a mr lambert a man not trouble with awkward scruple for he have be a strong presbyterian under the commonwealth and now be become as strong a churchman but a honest man as the world go now and not hard-hearted he have another better living where he reside so we parish be serve by he curate a mr poole a young man of shallow capacity and but little learning mr truelocke however go to hear he preach -- a strange sight it be to see so reverend saintly and able a minister sit humbly as a listener while that weak-headed lad speak from the pulpit -- and he say the youth preach true doctrine so he continue go to hear he and encourage we household to do the like which they all do except andrew that mr truelocke himself do not join in the new formal prayer be not notice he presence at sermon-time seem to give mighty satisfaction to mr poole who would often walk up to the grange of a lord 's day evening to ask mr truelocke 's opinion of he handling of a text and would even beg to hear he exposition of the same when several of we neighbor would also come in and listen thankfully to they old pastor 's word neither we nor they dream that such practice could be deem unlawful as they soon be be stigmatize as conventicle and heavily punish but this do not happen in mr poole 's time there be other thing much less agreeable to we under the new order of thing a monstrous new maypole be set up on the village green by command of a gentleman very powerful in the parish whom i shall soon have to name and we be tell the old heathen may-game would be observe at the right season -- as indeed they be when the time come meantime the one or two tavern in west fazeby begin to stand open on a Sunday and be much more frequented than they use to be man who have formerly be very careful to shun they now go to they boldly in open day which plainly discover they former decent carriage to have be a hollow show althea and i chance one day to be pass the royal oak as the chief inn of the village have be new christen just as there reel out of it a young gentleman whom every one have deem a most hopeful pious youth mr truelocke in particular have a great opinion of he though i never like he demure look for my part nor he stiff way of dress himself he be call ralph lacy and be son and heir to old mr lacy of lacy manor a worthy old gentleman though somewhat austere who be lately dead which i suppose partly account for the mighty change in he son who be now clothe in silk and velvet scarlet and gold and as i have say could not walk too straight at that moment he stand still leering foolishly on we just in we way i could not bear to look at he and would have slipt on one side but althea look sternly at he and say bitterly -- ` shame on you ralph lacy you mourn for you father in a very vile manner a swine could do no worse ' ` ah sweet mistress dacre ' say he ` do you think then the grim sour-visaged saint be reign still nay they day be over we have a right good fellow for a king now and this shall be merry england again i can tell thee ' -lrb- he be grow more familiar at every word -rrb- ' i will soon show thee what the way be at whitehall now ' and he be come much nearer to she than be pleasant when andrew who come up with we at that moment fling he out of we path with such goodwill that master lacy measure he length on the ground and there we leave he lie althea thank andrew warmly and cordially but andrew who have be all glowing with just wrath at first seem to shrink into himself at she praise ` it be a temptation ' he say ` and i have fall i could have take you out of yon fool 's way without lay a finger on he ' ` it be something of a disgrace indeed to have touch the beast -- a oaken staff have be fitter than you hand ' she reply ` merry england quotha drunken england i suppose he mean ' ` there be too much indeed of the unclean spirit of riot abroad now ' answer andrew ` but it be not with violent hand that we can cast it out i sinfully forget we lord 's word resist not evil ' and nothing could brighten he though althea do she best all the way home there come the day when i rue andrew 's angry action as much as he do though not for the same reason ralph lacy be not too drunk to be unaware who have fling he aside into the dust he never forgive it and he hand be plainly see afterwards in the trouble that come upon we another man also contribute something to they though more innocently mr poole now come very much about we and would often talk about the good family he belong to and he hope of speedy preferment and another favorite topic of he be the gay suit he have worn in he secular day he would dwell very fondly on the cut and trimming of these clothes i think nothing mislike he in he profession but the gravity of dress require from a clerical person and i be often tempt to ask have he father be a tailor he make the most of he sober apparel and love to show a white smooth fat hand with a fine diamond on one finger but he be unhappy in a insignificant person and a foolish face both of they something fatter than be graceful i do not know what first make I guess that all he boasting and parading be intend to advance he in althea 's good grace but she refuse to believe I when i say so ` poor harmless wretch ' say she ` he be but practise with I he would fain perfect himself in the air and grace of a thrive wooer before lay siege in earnest to some fair lady with the heavy purse that i lack at she girdle ' ` that be a far-fetched fancy indeed ' say i ` why should he single you out alone for such practising ' ` well ' quoth althea idly ` he may deem I the fittest person to rehearse with see i have at least the breeding of a gentlewoman and be contract to no one else he will think that if he way and word please I they may answer with richer woman of my sort as well ' ` but sure they do not please you ' i cry ` nor should you let he think they do ` tis not fair usage ' ` nay he divert I hugely ' say she ` and i need diversion for my heart be heavy as lead lucy ' -- all at once there be tear in she eye -- ` if i can forget my grief while i watch a mannikin bowing and grimace before I do not grudge I the poor pastime i assure thee child there be nothing more in it ' and with that she leave I hastily i be use to think althea much wiser than myself but the evening of the very day when we have this talk prove that in this matter she judgment be more at fault than mine for about sunset mr poole come up to the grange which be a rare thing for he to do see he do not love to be abroad when it be dark he seem mightily puff up about something and not be one of those who can keep they own counsel long he soon impart to althea and I whom he find sit by the parlor fire how he promotion now seem very near there be a living of which he have long have hope to get the reversion and the actual incumbent be fall sick of a strange fever with little prospect of recovery ` and you be trouble because of the poor man 's grievous case ' say althea demurely ' i guess something be disturbing you it be melancholy news indeed mr poole for one would guess by it that the place must be unhealthy so it may be you luck to sicken in like manner when it be you turn to live there ' i think althea cruel thus to tease the poor man impute to he a tender concern for the sufferer of which he have never dream besides he be chicken-hearted about contagious disorder and that she know i pity he then but find it hard to forbear laugh he aspect be so comical therefore i feign a errand out of the room and have stay away long enough to compose my countenance i return to the parlor where i find poor mr poole on he knee to althea urge he suit for she hand with a great deal more passion than one could have expect in he 'twa in vain she speak of she orphanhood and poverty and tell he he should look higher and at last she have to speak sharply and say however she might esteem the honor he would do she wife of he she would never be ` so quit that unbecome posture at my foot ' she add on which he rise indeed but say half-frantically -- ` give I at least madam the comfort of hearing you say you be heart-free that you love none other better than you do I ' on which first she eye flash angry fire and then change and soften she whole face and even she neck go rosy-red and she say almost kindly -- ' i will give you no such assurance sir to hold you in vain hope but i wish you a happier fate than marriage with I might prove ' with that she be go from the room like a shadow and mr poole and i be leave foolishly stare at each other presently he say hoarsely -- ` who be it that you sister love madam for whom do she disdain I sure ' he go on with grow heat ` it can not be you cousin -- he that be infect with the quaker heresy say it be not he madam ' well i be tempt to lie and say it be not we cousin for andrew be nothing akin to we but i resist the tempter and say i could say nothing but that i be heartily sorry -- ` and i be sure so be my sister ' i say ` that you should have fix you affection so unluckily ' then i tell he andrew have no thought of marriage with althea or any one and i remind he of the many rich and fair woman who would be sure to look kindly on he at which he smile again and presently go away in no unfriendly mood so i acquit he of mean the harm which he afterwards do we poor youth with he prattle tongue he do not wait long for he promotion the poor man whom he hope to succeed die indeed of the fever that have seize he so we lose we curate but it seem he prate to he patron about the fair young lady he have hope should share he preferment lament she silliness in prefer a moonstruck quaker youth also he complain of mr gold for not discourage such folly and he even deplore mr truelocke 's obstinate heresy as to church discipline i think even he have hold he peace if he have know into how greedy a ear he pour these tale this patron of he one sir edward fane have much land and not a little power in we parish though he reside in another neighborhood he be a bitter hater of all nonconformist and in especial of the quaker man say this be because of some encounter he have have with fox himself by whose sharp tongue and ready wit we gentleman be put to open shame where he have hope to make himself sport out of quaker enthusiasm however that might be it be commonly say this sir edward love quaker-baiting as it be call beyond all other of the cruel inhuman sport the bull-baiting and bear-baiting in which too many man of condition now take pleasure and it be not long before we find a powerful enemy be raise up against we harmless friend 'twa a wonder to I that any would lift a hand against they mr truelocke be so venerable and so peaceable a man and andrew of life so irreproachable also since the youth have cast in he lot with the friend he have show a singular zeal in good work he seek out those who be in distress or necessity and labor to make they hard lot easy not merely give they alms but comforting they as a loving brother might do and such as have fall into want through folly or sin he toil hard to lift up again and to put they into a honest way of living by this mean some few be lead to embrace he way of religion it be true and what wonder my wonder be that so many be vilely ungrateful to he at which _ he _ never show any vexation ` we be bid ' he say ` to do good to the unthankful and the evil ' which seem enough for he but it be contrary to he conscience to attend the church i suppose all he other grace do but lay he more open to injury and we be soon warn of mischief hatching against we and he and that by one from whom we never expect it chapter vi how mr truelocke and mr gold leave we mr poole be go there come in he place as curate a oldish man grey-haired and meager a great adorer of archbishop laud and of king charle the first ` the royal martyr ' as he would say but for all he half popish notion he be blameless nay austere in he life and he have thrive so ill in the gay new world of london that he deem it great good luck to have the curate 's place at west fazeby we have half fear that this poor mr stoke would feel bind in conscience to torment and harass mr truelocke into conformity so when he come to the grange one day very earnest to see aunt golding and the former vicar and that in private we be on thorn while he stay and when we hear the door shut after he we hurry to we aunt ask what he errand have be she answer we not directly but gaze after mr stoke whom mr truelocke be conduct out through the garden ` well my girl ' say she ` if the tree may be know by its fruit yon be a right honest man and a true christian ' and she go on to say how he have only come to warn she and hers of evil that be design against they ' i fear ' she say smile ` the good man 's conscience pull he two way yet he heart have prove wiser than he head i be right glad now that andrew be away though i be vex before yet i know he be a charitable journey ' then she tell we of new crueller device intend against the friend and indeed against all nonconforming folk ` and there be some ' she say ` who have speak very evil thing of we here at the grange i warrant you it will not be long that we shall be suffer to have family worship if we labor man share in it as they be use to do nor can mr truelocke so much as expound a psalm to we and they but it shall straight be say we hold a conventicle here ' ` surely ' say althea very pale ` the gentleman who now rule the country be too proud-spirited too noble to intermeddle with such matter what be it to they how we say we prayer in we own house abroad there may be need of a decent face of uniformity and some open outrageous folly may require to be put down strongly ' -- she stop and aunt golding say -- ` ah child thou little knowest i have not yet hear of any outrageous folly that we poor andrew have run into yet i be tell and i fear it be true that if he be to show he face openly in west fazeby to-morrow he next lodging might be in york castle where he should lie in the foulest den they could find for he and have the worst company to boot nor will it be very safe here for we good mr truelocke who now talk of take he journey to certain worthy kinsfolk of he that be farmer in the dale country there he may live in a peaceful obscurity but he chief aim be to avoid bring trouble on we house ' it strike I cruelly to think of harry 's father leave we but i have no time to dwell on the thought for now althea sink down at my foot helpless and senseless like one who be dead indeed and much ado we have to bring she out of she swoon which be very long and she very feeble when she be recover from it we get she to she room and persuade she to lie down and sleep and when we come away aunt golding turn to I with a puzzle look say -- ` what mean this lucy i never think you sister one of those fine lady who swoon for every trifle -- what be it think you ' ` andrew ' say i ` and the image of he danger you make a frightful picture of it dear madam do you know ' ` ah set a thief to catch a thief ' say aunt golding and i feel glad to hear she laugh once more ` my love-passage be of too ancient a date to serve I it seem but yours be fresh and new my lucy but what of andrew be althea dear to he ' ` more dear than he know or she guess ' quoth i at which we good aunt laugh again but then say -- ` it be a thing that would have please I well have i be tell that it would happen a year ago but now i see nothing but trouble in it there would be no equal yoke there my lucy whatever extravagance andrew have fall into the love of christ run through all he do and think and canst thou say the like of thy sister ' ` not yet ' i murmured but aunt golding hear I and say -- ` ay well speak lucy we will remember that when we pray ' after this aunt golding have a long conference with matthew standfast whom she despatch in pursuit of andrew that he might furnish he with money and warn he to keep away from the grange for a season and after much trouble matthew find he somewhere on the road to york when it cost he still more pain to lead he young master into compliance with the prudent course enjoin on he ` he talk much ' say matthew ` of the honor of suffer for the truth and how he must not be the vile coward to refuse it and i have never be able to beat he away from that but for the excellent counsel of one that be ride with he i think he be a quaker also for he could talk with master andrew in he own dialect ' ` what manner of man be he ' say we aunt ' i can hardly tell ' say matthew ` he have a piercing eye i wot and a voice as clear as a bell very neat and seemly he be in he attire and yet he might have be a ruffle cavalier if one judge by he hair which he wear long and curl ' ` that be much how george fox himself have be describe to I ' say aunt golding ` nay i can not think it be any such man ' say matthew ` for he talk very reasonably plain sense and plain word such as a simple man like I could not choose but understand and one tell I how george fox should be in lancashire about this time ' ` well what say he to persuade my poor lad ' ask aunt ` why he bid he remember certain work of mercy he have already in hand which should not be neglect to gratify a mad fancy of thrust he head in the lion 's mouth whenever it be open against he so master andrew be ashamed of he rashness and be persuade to take himself away for a time and we part very lovingly he say it shall not be long ere you hear from he mistress ' i believe in spite of matthew 's contrary opinion that andrew 's counsellor be no other than the famous man whom we aunt have name but i have no proof of this only mine own strong persuasion not many day hereafter we have proof that mr stoke have be very honest in he warn to we there come constable to the grange who show a warrant to seize the body of andrew golding charge with many strange misdemeanor but especially with refuse the oath of supremacy and allegiance i do not believe the poor youth ever have refuse they but this be the common trap set for the friend who be know to decline all oath-taking because of that say of we lord 's ` swear not at all ' -- a harmless scruple at the worst which never ought to be use as i think against honest and peaceable subject we be now heartily glad that andrew be absent and that we could truly say we know not where he be nor be the constable much grieve at it one of they find a occasion of whisper to aunt golding ` if you can get word to the young man let he know this air be unwholesome for he just now ' after which they go hastily away and now we begin to be haunt with spy we step seem to be dog even in we own garden where we be aware of people move about behind tree and bush as if hearken after we talk or we catch sight of face peer in at the window when we be at evening prayer also we friend and neighbor begin to shun we as if we have the plague and no one more than mr bonithorne who have be a great worshipper of mr truelocke but now as we hear blame he openly for he lack of true obedience to the power that be ` which be ordain of god ' she would often add it be she husband who tell we this as a good jest but it hurt mr truelocke and he become more set on he design of leave the grange and betake himself to he kinsfolk in cumberland where among the waste and lonely mountain he might linger out he day without offence to any i could not hear he talk of this plan without tear which he perceive try to stop ` seest thou dear child ' he would say ` all these discomfort come upon this house because of my abode in it for as for poor andrew he be know to be elsewhere and however peaceably i may behave myself you will be allow no peace till i be either go out of sight like he or lodge in gaol for some fancied offence which be best thinkest thou lucy ' and when i have no answer but weep he would leave that point and begin to talk of harry 's ship the _ good hope _ of which we have get some news and would speak hopefully of the joyful meeting we should have when that ship come home alas i fear he be no prophet but he be not to be turn from he intention and presently he be go indeed in the company of mr bonithorne who have business in the north country and who undertake with a great deal of satisfaction to let no one and especially not he wife into the mystery of he have this reverend travel companion and now the grange seem a sad lonely house indeed for every day and all day long we miss that noble white head that kindly presence that voice still musical and tender in spite of seventy year of service those spying and watching of we which have help to drive away we fatherly friend be a little intermitted when he be go but the poor benefit be counterpoise with a heavy trouble for now we aunt golding begin to decline fall into a strange linger kind of fever which the doctor could not understand i think it be nothing but trouble of heart which cause it for she be mightily disquiet about andrew there be reason to think it would be as unsafe as ever for he to return home and letter from he be very rare he could not often find a messenger whom he would trust and this difficulty be increase by he wander about the country as he do which yet be deem the best way for he to live so be often a prey to anxious thought the poor lady pine and fade away and presently catch a cold she begin to be trouble with difficulty in breathing and she sleep go from she it be now that we learn the worth of grace standfast who fairly take we poor silly girl in hand as she pupil set we task to do both in the house and the sick chamber and keep we in heart with cheerful word and look but for all she skill and she cheerfulness we patient visibly grow worse and worse and as the year wear into winter we see that we should lose she and now there befall a strange thing which i will tell just as it happen and i think there can be no superstition in dwelling on it so far aunt golding 's sickness have now become so sore that it be needful for one of we always to watch with she and on the night i speak of it be my turn to do so she be very uneasy the first part of my watch but about midnight she fall into a deep sleep and continue so for a hour when hear no sound i go to look on she and see such heavenly peace on she sleeping countenance that i could have think a light shone from it like the glory about a saint 's head in a picture i do not know how long i have stand gaze on she when all at once she wake and smile at I -- ` be it thou lucy ' say she ` that be well i have good news for thee ' at which i begin to fear she be light-headed for how should she have news that i know not but presently she go on with many pause because of she difficult breathing ` thou hast grieve much lucy think thy sailor would never come home to thee again be at peace he shall come home a better man -- and find thee a holier woman for all the trouble thou shalt have see ' ` how do you know how can you tell ' i cry ' i can not tell thee now ' she say ` but i do know and thou hast see dear heart how i have grieve over my andrew -- my heart 's child the comfort of my old age i have think he be clean go out of the right way for all he sincerity it have be show I in my sleep that i have no need thus to grieve he rashness may bring he sharp trial but even through those shall he enter in the light that lead he be the true light and though he and he fellow be but err man -- like all other -- yet even they trivial error shall have they use in day to come man shall say that these despise and persecute believer have do nobly -- for they country and for the world ' ` then do you think ' i say in some trouble ` that we be all wrong and only andrew and those like-minded in the right ' ` nay dear heart ' say she ' i think not so the path be many -- but the guide be one let we only follow he voice -- and he will bring we to he father 's house in safety i have comfort about thy sister too ' she add presently ` though i fear it be not such as she can value yet do not forget dear child to have mr stoke send for to-morrow i wish to receive the most comfortable sacrament of the lord 's supper once more -- with you all before i go hence ' as she say the last word she voice sink away and i see that she be sleep once more the next day we do as she have bid in send for mr stoke who accordingly come and give the communion to all we household as well as to we poor aunt i never like he better than on that day but a sad day it prove to we for we all see plainly how we second mother be now a die woman i think she hardly say twenty word to one of we thereafter but quietly sleep and dream she life away and on the third day she be go this be last winter the winter of 1664 and i remember how all that melancholy time the people be greatly disturb about the comet that be to be see wonder what mischief it should betoken i see it myself but so full be my mind of my private grief i care not much about ill omen to the state indeed one thing that soon happen be very distressing to we and i shall shortly relate what it be chapter vii how andrew come to the grange by night it be about a ten day after mr golding 's death and we be begin to feel as if we desolation be a thing that have always be and always would be for so i think it often seem when a grief be new however desolate we be we be not destitute she who be go have care for that and we find a modest dower secure to each of we without injury to andrew 's rightful inheritance of the grange and the land belong thereto also we be to continue dwelling in the grange till its new master should come home and make such disposition as pleased he but for all this we be greatly perplex we have be long without news of andrew and could not tell how to get word to he of mr golding 's death on the day i speak of we have be tease by a visit from mrs bonithorne who profess great sorrow for we loss and she own loss of one whom she call she oldest friend soon fall to talk of andrew and how he unlucky doings be all owe to we good aunt 's foolishness in entertaining so pestilent a heretic as jame westrop under she roof ' i warn she of it ' quoth she ' i say to she you will rue it yet margaret with such a one you should have no dealings no not so much as to eat and now see what have come of she perverseness ' and such-like stuff she say which move grace standfast to say disdainfully when we visitor be go ` yon woman surely owe we a little grudge that 'twa we house and not hers which entertain so rare a monster as a wander quaker she ask I twenty question about he the day after i remember it well but we hardly have heart to laugh though we be sure enough she have give no such warning as she speak of althea only sigh and say '' twa a evil day for she when she first see that man ' and as she tell I he two appearance to we haunt she as she go to rest and mingled themselves with she dream she wake at last sharply and suddenly think she hear the hail rattle against the window as it do when mr truelocke preach he last sermon in we church but it be not hail that rattle it be some one throw sand and pebble up at she window to wake she and then a voice call on she name she spring up and hurry on some clothes she run down-stair for as she tell I she have no more doubt of its be andrew who call than if it have be broad daylight and she could see he stand below the window and be too impatient to unlock any door she undo the hasp of the nearest casement and climb out and at the same moment hear a voice again call softly ` althea ' she run in the direction of the sound and come upon a man whom in the starlight she see to be andrew indeed she speak he name hold out both she hand and he turn at once grasp they in both he and so they stand gaze at each other awhile then she say half sobbing -- ` you come strangely andrew -- but you come to you own house and i be glad that it fall to I to welcome you to it it lack a master sadly ' and she try to draw he towards the door tell he she would set it open if he would tarry a few minute while she herself climb in to do it ` alas ' he say resist she effort ` what do you mean by call this my house be we aunt indeed go i have hope that part of the message might be a delusion ' ` what message i send none for i know not where to send nor do any of we ' she reply ` but it be too true that mr golding be dead these ten day and all thing be at a stand for lack of you presence come in do not keep I here in the darkness and the cold ' ' i will not keep thee long ' he say sadly ` fear it not althea but i may not come under this roof which thou sayest be mine i see the dim light in you window ' he go on like one talk in a dream ` and i could not bear to pass by and make no sign as i ought to have do for i love thee too well althea dacre as thou knowest ' ` how can it be too well ' she answer boldly ` if you do not love I better than i do you and therefore come in to you own home or i will not believe there be any love in you at all ' ` that be a foolish jest ' say he half angrily ' i may not cross the doorstone of this house to-day althea i be forbid so hear I say what i come to say there be a heavy burden lay on I for seven night together i saw in vision a dark terrible angel have he wing outspread and holding in he hand a half-drawn glittering sword he be hover over this land of england and it be show I that he be a messenger of wrath bidden to smite the land with a pestilence now there be those far holier than i who have see the like vision but to I come the word that i must go up to london where this year the plague shall be very sore and as i go i must warn all man that they may repent and amend before this judgment fall on they ' there be that in he voice and word that make althea tremble like a leaf she do not disbelieve in he vision while she hear he but she strive against the impression and cry out when she could find she voice that this be indeed madness ` you have no right ' she say ` to desert you natural and lawful duty and you poor kinswoman too who be desolate you will break we heart you will ruin yourself and all for a delusion ' ` it be no delusion ' say he ` you own word althea have confirm to I the truth of my mission for it be say to I this shall be a sign to thee that margaret the widow of thy father 's brother lie sick even to death and thou shalt see she face no more nor come under she roof and be it not so for she face be bury out of we sight ' -- he voice shake -- ` so dost not see althea i may not come in as thou wouldst have I furthermore i believe my earthly pilgrimage shall come to its end in london i can not be sure but i think i return no more alive that be why i hunger so for one last look at thee althea also i wish as a die man to entreat thee not to despise the lord 's poor people any more now i must go farewell dear heart for ever ' and with these word he assay to go but as she tell I afterwards she clutch at he coat passionately protest he should never go and when he unlock she hand and besought she not to hinder he she dropt on the ground at he foot clasp he round the knee and call on I with all she might ` help lucia help sister ' be the word that wake I and send I fly with breathless speed to the place whence the call come i climb through the window which i find open and run to the spot where i could discern that a struggle be go on but as i come up andrew have get himself loose and say low and thickly to I -- ` look to you sister take she in instantly ' he turn and flee as a man might flee for he life while althea throw herself on the cold ground moan and sob like a creature mortally hurt i take she in my arm and raise she up ask she all amaze be that indeed andrew but she do nothing but wring she hand and implore I to follow he and fetch he back and i have much trouble to persuade she that be useless and hopeless for we at that hour of the night at last she be win to rise and return to the house and we both find it a difficult matter to get in where we have get out easily enough which mr truelocke i doubt not would have moralize in he pleasant way into a sort of holy parable but i have not that gift and i suppose 'twa the hope in althea 's breast and the fear in mine which have raise we power for a moment and make a hard thing easy -lrb- illustration : ` look to you sister take she in instantly ' -rrb- when we have recover a little and have get safely to my room althea recollect herself and tell I every word that have pass and we both agree that andrew be run himself into new and strange danger in pursuance of what he hold as a divine call i note it as a new thing in althea that she could no longer scoff at this belief of he in the inward heavenly voice that must be obey but this matter be very terrible to we and we talk of it till daylight without come to any conclusion as to what we be best to do about it chapter viii how a strange messenger bring we news of andrew and now we have a time of unceasing disquiet it be soon noised abroad that the heir to the grange be miss and he house and land leave masterless and there presently appear first one and then another of the golding far-off kinsman of andrew these person come to the house to examine it and talk much with the standfast also they try to find out what my sister and i know of andrew 's doings some of they go to york to talk with aunt golding 's lawyer and it be not hard to see that they would have be glad to get certain news of andrew 's death this make they coming hateful to we but the house not be we own we could not shut they out we do what we could to get news of andrew but there be small comfort in the scanty intelligence we could glean since it all point to he have indeed go up to london and have preach woe and judgment on he way thither and have it not be that we sometimes get comfortable letter from mr truelocke tell of he quiet untroubled life in the dale country i have now be unhappy enough for we be ever hear tale of the evil handling of all kind of dissenter even young maiden and little child be pelt whip and chained for the crime of be of quaker parentage and belief while hundred of nonconformist of that sort and other sort be throw into prison and leave there i suppose it be the mad doings of the fifth monarchy man as folk call they which stir up such a persecute spirit so at least say the people of we village who now begin to come about we again with some show of former kindness but they prove very job 's comforter to we by reason of the frightful story they love to retail there be one good soul whom i love well to see who yet give I many a heart-quake it be a mrs ashford wife to a small farmer near we a lad of hers have sail with my harry and thus she would often come to talk over the hope and fear we have in common and to exchange with I whatever scrap of sea-news we could pick up so one day as we sit talk -- ` it may be ' say she ` we shall see thing as terrible here in england as any that can befall we darling at sea ' and i ask what she mean she tell I she have learn from certain poor seaman that the plague be assuredly on its way to we have be creep nearer and nearer for a year and a half ' a dutch ship from argier in africa ' say she ` bring it first to amsterdam where it grow more and more and ` tis certain in another dutch ship a great one all hand die of the plague the ship drive ashore and be find full of dead corpse to the great horror and destruction of the people there which make we people tremble because of we nearness to holland and we traffic with it ' ' i hear something of this ' i say ` last summer but it seem a idle tale only that die away of itself ' ` it be no idle tale ' answer she ` see you not sweet lady the infection itself die away somewhat in the cold winter but now that spring come on so fast the sickness and people 's fear of it revive together you will see ' well this news be frightful to I for harry 's sake i begin to tremble lest perchance the _ good hope _ should be visit like that dutch ship but i do not breathe such a fear to mr ashford and as the spring draw on and war with the dutch be in every mouth we have a new terror for now if we sailor come safe home they could scarce escape be impress for the king 's service so we know not what to wish for the spring be more than ordinarily hot double the apprehension of the plague and some time in April as i think news come down that it have break out indeed in london 'twas say it come in a bale of silk bring from some infected city and the fear of it increase mightily and we remember andrew 's strange vision be not less in terror than we neighbor about that time i be busy one morning in the front garden when a gentleman in black come in at the gate and be make up to the hall door when espy I he stop beckon with he hand and seem to want speech with I he be muffle in a cloak and he hat pull over he brow so i could not tell who he be yet i go to meet he and when i be near enough -- ' i think madam ' say he in a odd husky voice ` you have a kinsman who take he way up to town some week ago i bring news of he ' on which i begged he would come in and tell it to my sister also but he say -- ` there be much sickness in town i be newly come from it it be more prudent for I to speak with you here ' on which i run and fetch althea out and the man say ' i do not pretend madam that my news be good news you kinsman demean himself strangely on he come up denounce wrath and woe against the poor citizen speak much evil of both court and city i be tell he civillest name for one be sodom and for the other gomorrah ' here althea say scornfully if all tale be true those name be fit enough and the stranger reply that might be but civil speech be best ` people take you kinsman 's preaching very unkindly ' he continue ` the more so when the plague he prophesy of begin to show itself then he be call a sorcerer and to make a long story short he be take up for a pestilent mad quaker and clapt into gaol i look on he there and in gaol he lie still and may lie for I ' with that he pluck he cloak away from he face and lift he hat make we a deep mock bow and we see it be ralph lacy but such a ghastly change i never see on any man he face be livid he eye deep sink in he head glare like coal of fire and when he begin to laugh he look be altogether devilish ` you do not know I pretty one ' he say to althea ` do you when i have see golding lay in gaol i swear none but i should bring you the joyful news and i can tell you he be worse lodge than even he great prophet fox himself at whose lodging in lancaster castle i look this year with great pleasure -- very smoky and wet and foul it be ' ` wretch ' say althea ` do you exult over the suffering of harmless peaceable man ' ` harmless and peaceable quotha ' say he ` it be one of these peaceable creature fling I into the dust like a worm but the worm turn you know i take much pain to requite that kindness and now i cry quit with master andrew ' ` you wickedness shall return on you own head i pray god it may ' cry althea tremble with indignation ` past pray for madam ' say the reckless wretch ` for i have the plague upon I i stay too long up in town out of love to you friend and mine i shall be a dead corpse to-morrow and why should not you have the sickness as well as i ' with that he come towards she as if to embrace she when we both shriek aloud and turn to fly and matthew standfast come suddenly between we with a spade uplift in he hand bid the miserable man keep he distance and ask what he want on which lacy say wildly -- ' a grave man -- i want nothing but a grave and any ditch will furnish I that ' with which he go away matthew good man be trouble when we tell he lacy 's word ` if the wretched fellow have the sickness indeed ' he say ` he might die in a ditch for all he own people care ' and that same night he go to lacy manor inquire after its master it prove that on leave the grange the man go straight home and up-stair to bed say he be weary and must not be disturb for a hour or two and there he now lay dead none of the servant have guess what ail he and they be take with such a fear they would not stay to see he bury but flee and lay that charge on poor good mr stoke who discharge it with true christian courage after which the manor be shut up for many a day till the next heir 's covetousness get the better of he fear this matter cause great terror but the plague spread no further in we parish and so the people forget it somewhat after a time but althea could not forget lacy 's word about andrew nor could i persuade she they be false tale speak in pure despite she brood over they remember all the tale we have hear of good man 's suffering in poisonous infected dungeon and at last she say to I -- ' i wish lacy have but say in what prison he see we andrew however it be in london lucy sure he say london ' ` ay ' say i ` that be what he say if you can pin any faith on the rave talk of a plague-stricken man ' ` he speak truth ' say she ' i be too sure of it now there will not be so many gaol in london town lucy but i can find out where andrew lie and if i can not have he out i can supply he want at least ' ` althea althea you do not dream of go up ' i cry ` it be sinful madness by all account the sickness increase there from day to day the poor people die like fly ' ' i care not ' say she and i find she immoveably set on take this journey speedily she be get together all the money she could and she jewel too intend to turn they into money if needful and she be pack some clothes in very small compass so as to carry they herself as she journey ` it be not likely ' she say ` that i shall find companion on such a journey i must learn to be my own servant ' but i have soon resolve that one companion she should have and that should be myself so after a few more vain effort to shake she resolution i acquaint she with mine and with incredible trouble i get she to agree to it for i say at last that the road be as free to I as to she if she so dislike my company as she say she might take the right side of the way and i would take the left ` but where thou goest ' say i ` there will i go althea ' ` take heed ' she reply instantly ` that it be not where thou diest i will die and there will i be bury ' ` so let it be ' i say ` if it be heaven 's will but you go not up alone ' upon which she yield say she have not think i have so much sturdiness i can not deny i think it a mad expedition though i dream not of the strait into which we have since be drive but i have pray again and again for guidance and always it grow clearer to I that i must cleave to my sister so i make haste to get ready for we wild journey and after althea 's example i sew certain money and jewel into the clothes i wear and put a competent sum in my purse then come the tell the standfast of we intent they oppose it at first with all they might and no wonder then they anxiety about andrew make they yield a little matthew take he stand on this that we must have some protector ' a man-servant you have at least or you do not stir ' quoth he ` but you can not be spare from this place ' we urge ` and who else be there faithful and bold enough for such a service ' ` leave I alone for that ' say he and the evening before we departure he bring to we a strange attendant indeed but one who prove most trusty it be a poor fellow of the village who have once be in service at lacy manor but the young squire hate he and get he turn away in disgrace after which no man would employ he and he fall into great wretchedness but andrew come across he and not only relieved he distress for he be almost dead for hunger but put he in a way of live on he own land so partly for love of andrew and partly from true conviction poor will simpson so he be call turn to the quaker way of think i do not know if he be acknowledge as a proved friend he have some odd notion of he own but he show himself a peaceable industrious fellow and he love andrew as a dog might love a kind master that have save it from drown indeed there be something very dog-like about honest will without have any pierce wit he have a strange sagacity at the service of those he love and he dull heavy face sometimes show a great warmth of affection make it seem almost noble when matthew tell he wherefore he be want he be all on fire to go he leave he hut and work and woodman 's garb matthew have get he a plain serving-man 's suit in which he look still a little uncouth and thus he come eagerly to we and beg to be take with we then with no escort but this poor fellow who however know the road well and be strong and sturdy we set forth on we way up to london bidding adieu to none in west fazeby as the standfast have advise i believe it be suppose in the village that we be go to mr truelocke chapter ix how we go up to london and find no friend there i hope little from the first plan on which althea rely for obtain andrew 's release she trust be in mr dacre since he be a great courtier and she think he influence might avail to get one poor quaker set free ' i shall not get he help for nothing ' say she ` that be a idle hope but i know he expense to be very great out of proportion to he means so if i bring a heavy purse in my hand to interpret between he and I i be sure of a kind and favourable hearing ' she be almost gay while she dwell on this plan and it furnish the most of we talk on the first day or two of we journey it be very hot summer weather a little sultry yet travel would have be pleasant enough have we mind be easy which they could not be it be hard to go fast enough for althea will have to make she understand it be small wisdom to hurry we horse beyond they strength then she go sigh out -- ` oh for a horse with wing or could one only ride on the speed of fire it will be a week i dare swear before we see st paul 's ' and she grudge herself time to eat and sleep there be nothing very noticeable on the way but the vast amazement express by all who find that we be go up to london and as we get nearer we journey 's end we begin to find that the inn-keeper distrust we not a little suspect we of escape out of the town and make only a false pretence of journey up to it will however be so plainly a blunt simple fellow that he word be take where ours be doubt now and then we hear news of the war : first there be talk of a great victory at sea over the dutch win the third day of June at which the court and city be rejoice mightily half forget they home peril then come contrary news how this victory be no victory but rather a disgrace to we and that we ship be shamefully command which i believe be the truer tale so my thought fly at once to my harry and he father i have writ to mr truelocke about we journey but there have be no time for a answer and i fall to muse what those two would think of we wild adventure and wonder if harry have be seize for the king 's service like many other but all be vain conjecture and i have to resign they and myself up to god 's guidance the safest and most bless way as i be fast learning for since aunt golding 's death i think a change have come over I i have learn a true hate of mine own sin and have find one in whose sufficiency i could trust to save I from they and to guide I in all thing i will not enlarge on this now however so with hope and fear despair and trust the day of travel wear away and late in a sultry summer evening we come into london we put up for the night at a decent inn keep by some people name bell which we father have sometimes use when we be with he the people remember he and be civil to we my poor sister could scarce sleep all that night and the landlady come herself to wait on we at breakfast althea take occasion to ask she do she know mr john dacre and finding she do she get from she particular information about he house and the way to it and the hour when he be to be find there all which the good woman impart cheerfully but could not help pity we rashness in come up to town ' i live a die life ' she say ` for terror of the contagion i would never have run into it ' which word we pass over at that time but have to call they to mind after accord to she information mr dacre rarely stir from home before noon so we set off betime to find he will walk behind we look about in amaze at the half empty street the many close shop and house uninhabited and at last fetch a great sigh he say -- ` methink mistress this whole town look like a gaol and the folk go about like condemn prisoner ' ` ay ' say althea ` but there be worse gaol within this gaol will here the sun shine and the wind blow on we not so where you master lie ' and she hasten she step which be swift before mr dacre 's house prove to be a very stately and fair one towards the west end of the town it stand in a broad very quiet street too quiet i think althea bade will knock boldly at the door ` we will not be too humble ' say she and he knock loudly enough once twice thrice but no one come to open to we and we knock seem to echo and re-echo strangely through the house ` sure ' say althea ` all the folk can not be asleep ` tis past ten o'clock ' and she knock once more there be a gentleman come out of a neighbouring house who have look curiously at we he now draw near and stand a little way off call out ` it be little use to knock at that door lady -- the master be dead a week since and the house stand empty ' at which althea turn a deadly pale face to he say -- ` do not mock we -- sure it can not be so ' the man look compassionately at she now come up to we and say ` nay my word be too true madam have you any interest in this mr dacre ' ' i be he cousin ' say althea ` and i be come up from the north on great occasion to see my kinsman and claim he help ' ` alas ' say the gentleman ` he be past render help to any it be mightily suspect ' say he whisperingly ` that he die of the plague but you great rich folk can smother these matter up this be certain that he have secret and hasty burial and all he family be flee and go without so much as lock the door behind they as it be say but i think none have be so bold as to try that man love they life too well to venture within nor would i advise you to do it ' ` no no ' say althea a little wildly ' i will not take the plague and die -- not yet i have work to do ' at which the man smile pityingly and add -- ` you would not find mr dacre here now be he in life -- he design to follow the court which be remove to salisbury for safety but he linger about some money matter which have cost he very dear as i think ' and bow to we he walk hastily away well we know not what to do now and so return to we inn where we sit the rest of the day in the room we have hire talk over we few acquaintance in town but unable to hit on one who would have will and power to help we much we good hostess serve we again at supper and ask how we speed in we search for mr dacre so unthinkingly we tell she the whole tale at which she color change and she leave the room without say a word in answer that night we sleep heavily for very trouble so we be not aware of a great stir there be in the night for mr bell the poor landlady be take very ill about midnight the maid be call up and a physician send for they have some trouble to find one but when he come he tell they plainly that she disorder which they and she too have fear be the plague be nothing but pure terror we careless word about mr dacre 's death have strike such a fear in she as to throw she into a kind of fever will tell we this news in the morning and we be grieve at we foolishness and wonder at hers but we have little time for lament as we be set forth to visit a distant kinswoman of we father 's who be rich and well repute we think might be able to help we but here we fare no better -- not that the lady be dead but she have go out of town on the first alarm of the sickness leave she house lock up and empty as the neighbor tell we so we go back to we inn yet more cast down but there we stay not long for we be scarce get to we room when the landlord come to we very angry and say have he know we have be visit a infected house we have never come into he and he bid we to pack up and be go within the hour that he might have every place purify where we have come we horse he say might stand in he stable but we say we would remove they he speak more plainly and say he should keep they as security for what we owe ' i will take no money from you ' he say ` you may have the plague in you purse for all i know ' and he leave we say if we go not quickly we should be put out by force this brutal usage dismay I but althea say ` poor wretch he be half craze with fear that make mean man cruel care not for he ' and when we be ready give we package to will she lead the way out with a determine aspect have as i soon find embrace a strange -- nay a desperate resolution for will ask she ` which way will ye turn now mistress in _ this _ street no inn will open to we for sure ' she reply -- ` we will not seek any inn we will betake ourselves to we cousin 's empty house ' ` you mean not mr dacre 's ' i cry ` but i do ' say she ` we have a right to shelter there and the door be open ' i exclaimed against this as a tempting of providence persuade she first to try some other house of entertainment and at last she agree now whether we great distraction of mind give we a haggard and sickly aspect or whether 'twa merely the suspicion and hardness of heart breed in all people by terror i can not tell but no one would take we in some say flatly they would receive no lodger they do not know and know to be sound the day wear fast away in these vain application althea say to I -- ` you see we must try my plan at last i bid you think scorn my lucy of yield to such base fear as make folk turn we from they door ' ` it be not that i fear infection as they do ' say i ` but i shrink from dwelling in a house not we own and lie open to any thief ' ` baby fear lucy ' she say smile ` we will do we cousin a better turn than they merit we will keep they door fast against thief and they household stuff from moth and mould and rust for the infection we run as little risk in that house as out of it ' so she bear I down with she will the more easily since we have no choice but either to lodge in that house or in the open street but will say sturdily ` mistress you may do as you will i will neither eat nor sleep in that evil house there be a scent of death and sin breathing from it i perceive it as we stand at the door ' ` and will you desert we then will ' say althea ` have you come so far to forsake we now ' ` who speak of forsake ' growl will ' i can find some balk some cobbler 's stall without the house to sleep on if you will lodge within the watch-dog lie not in the house i trow but if you must lodge there enter not openly nor let it be know you be within you may be suspect for thief or worse ' ` yours be no fool 's advice ' say althea shortly so we linger out the time till nightfall in buy some needful thing -- bread and meat and candle -- have to walk far before we find shop open then as night thicken we steal into the desolate house and grope we way to a room at the back where we light we candle and look about we 'twa a richly furnished withdrawing-room with window open on a garden ` there will i sleep ' say will ' i have rather have the free sky over I than this roof so give I but a hunch of bread to sup on and let I go ' there be little use in cross he so we give he some meat and bread but we pray he help first to make all the door fast which he willingly do then he show we how to secure the window after he and so slipt out into the night now we look at one another and feel desolate and dismayed for a moment then i say ` let we commend we cause to god sister he will hear we ' and we kneel down together and implore the divine protection after which we feel at peace and so take courage to sup on the food we have bring then we make fast we door on the inside and lay down to sleep on the floor with we mantle for coverlet and we bundle for pillow i never sleep in such rude fashion nor ever more sweetly and soundly early in the morning there come a tap at the window that waken I so i rise and draw back the curtain and see that will be move about in the garden we let he in shortly and give he some food which he carry with he out of door then come back he excuse he incivility of the night before ` but i can not eat nor sleep here ' say he ` in all other matter i be you servant ' he have lodge for the night in a empty dog-kennel which he show we close against a side-door that lead out to the street ` there ' say he ' i can do you better watchman 's service than if i lay within and by that door you may come and go unespied of any gossip ' althea smile and commend he thoughtfulness then she say -- ` you will come with we now will we must examine this house ' so he step in shudder and look round almost with horror however rich the room it be in great disorder and when we go up-stair we find matter no better -- bed half stript chest and cabinet leave open floor strew with thing pull forth in haste and leave there we pitch on one sleeping-room to the back to use ourselves and have satisfy ourselves that no evil-disposed person lay hide in any room we shut they all up -lrb- the key be leave in the lock -rrb- except that sleeping-room the parlor we have first enter the kitchen and one great room look to the front agree to use no other apartment and to this rule we keep except when as i have tell i go a-hunting for means to write this history that work of examine the house be terrible to I especially when we look into mr dacre 's own chamber there we find a mighty rich bed with hanging of silk and silver and all the toilet furniture in silver also with couch and cushion richly work and certain splendid garment with a jewelled sword leave fling upon they as if the owner have just put they off but all be disorder wildly as if by the die struggle of a madman and the gorgeousness seem to add to the horror of it i tremble as i look at the glimmer mirror and thought of what it might have reflect we cousin 's image seem to rise up in all he pride and bravery as i last see he but with the ghastly face of death so i hurry out and fling the door to behind we and althea turn the key in the lock after which we avoid pass that way for the place be not less dreadful to she than to I she acknowledge it make she remember what we have hear of the great burying-pit in aldgate and the dishonoured corpse that be fling into it heap upon heap ` he may have go to that grave from this splendid chamber -- it be a hideous mockery ' she say chapter x how we dwell in a house that be not we own and now althea begin she search after andrew with none to help she but poor I and honest will we chief care be not to be see go out or come in she choose to steal forth of the back door early in the morning sometimes i with she sometimes will but one of we always stay in the house to watch it and to open at nightfall to the other althea go to such shop as she could find open and buy thing sometimes mere trifle sometimes food and other necessaries but always spend much time over it and both listen to the talk of other folk and draw the shop-people into talk herself when she contrived to work round to the prison and the poor soul in they and how they fare in these bad time once or twice she take a boat and go up the river and then be wondrous affable to the waterman set they talk also on the same matter and thus she do with every one whom she could draw to speak with she not disdain even beggar nor fear the watchman who guard house suppose to be infected and therefore shut up i confess that these last be people i would gladly have shun there be something so awful to I in the lock door -lrb- mark with a great red cross and ` lord have mercy on we ' writ large upon they -rrb- by which the poor fellow sit but althea seem to have say a long good-bye to fear and with question and listen and piece thing together by little and little she assure herself that andrew must be in newgate if he lay in any london prison she have try to find out by artful inquiry if any man have show himself in london announce a coming judgment and warn people to avoid it as andrew have propose to do on which people inform she of several such person but they description answer not to we poor friend one man have cry up and down the street ` yet forty day and london shall be destroy ' after the fashion of the prophet jonah and another have run about by day and by night naked to the waist and cry ` oh the great and dreadful god ' and no other word which strike a great terror into all who see and hear he and yet a third who be say to be a quaker act more strangely but he be know by name to those who tell about he also in all these tale there be something frantic and unreasonable not like andrew nor like the way he have design to act i think i myself see one of these strange creature it be my turn to be housekeeper althea want will 's help to carry she purchase home that day such a solitary day be very dismal and heart-sinking to I and have it not be for my plan of write this history i know not how i could have bear it when it grow dusk i venture to look out at a front window to see if my friend be come but what i saw be the light of torch come up the street which be the sign of a funeral it be order that people should only bury at night and presently come by a coffin bear of four and a great many people follow for it be wonderful how people crowd to funeral at this time as if desperate of they life they stopt suddenly to my terror right in front of my window but it be because of another crowd meet they and in its midst a tall man move very swiftly and go straight before he he be stript to the waist and i think at first that the hair of he head be all in a flame of fire but it be a chafing-dish of burn brimstone that he have set upon he head and which glare through the darkness as he meet the coffin he make a stand and look upon it -lrb- illustration : ' i think i myself see one of these strange creature ' -rrb- ` yet one more ' he say in a deep hoarse voice -- ` one more have fall in he sin but ye do not repent woe woe woe to this unfaithful city ' and he go on again directly but continue to cry ` woe woe ' as long as i could hear he the people run after and around he could scarce keep up with he swift pace those who be bear and follow the coffin have seem strike with horror but now they get into order again and i hear one near the window bidding they sneeringly never to heed a mad quaker while another say aloud ' i marvel such a evil-boding fool be leave at large when far quieter folk of he sort lie rot in prison ' word which make I fain to hear more but the man all move off and i have scarce see they torch go twinkle away into darkness when i hear the signal at the back door and hurry joyfully to let in my friend who have be delay by meet the funeral but they have miss the other strange spectacle as i remember this be the second Saturday we spend in town and here i may say that almost every lord 's day which find we in we dismal abode we two make we way to some church at a good distance and there join in worship i never see church more crowded worshipper more devout minister more fervent we understand by what we hear that not a few clergyman be dead of the plague and other flee for terror because of which certain of the silence minister be call on to fill those vacant pulpit and they do so while the plague last with great zeal and boldness no man say they nay but neither the courage of these man nor the fervency with which they preach and visit among the sick and die could so far recommend they to will that he would set foot in what he call the steeple-house so on the lord 's day we have to dispense with he attendance and this trouble I but on the other hand there be comfort in see how my poor sister rejoice in the ministering of these faithful man a great change show itself in she she be full of a new tenderness to I and be most mild and patient with poor will and he odd way and as for he i believe he would have die for she or do anything that she desire except lodging in mr dacre 's house or worship in a church now when althea have assure herself she must look for andrew in newgate and in no other prison she set herself to get admission there ` no lock so hard ' she say to I ` but will go with a golden key ' so she put money enough in she purse she take will with she clad in a suit fit for a plain country gentleman for she wish it to be think he be one who have power to protect she and have find out the keeper of newgate she buy from he at a great price leave to visit he gloomy wicked kingdom and to relieve poor creature lie in it for conscience sake now have she relieve all who profess that they be such as she seek she might have spend the wealth of both indy for it be shocking how many utter reprobate press up to she and to will claim that they be imprison for matter of religion but they brazen countenance that bear the deep impress of they wickedness witness against they with great trouble she find out at last a few of the sort she want and then begin to ask for andrew by name but no one seem to know aught of he the keeper too profess ignorance of any such person but she belief be strong that he lay within those wall and she go again and again on the same errand now i could never get she leave to go with she to newgate she say at first that will be a man be more useful to she than i could be but afterwards she own that the prison be so vile and hideous a place she could not endure i should see it ` there be no need ' she say ` for more than one of we to behold such monstrous evil ` tis a society of fiend lucy a training-school for all vice and the keeper be worthy of it i think it be not less than act blasphemy to throw good man into it as well send they alive into hell the lord look upon it and require it ' ` be there any of the friend shut up there ' i ask ` there have be hundred i be tell ' she say ` even now there be too many but they die daily of fever and misery ' and she stop short presently say ` if i find he not i will not repent of my search i have feed some starve saint already ' so she continue she visit and she inquiry but i begin to find it a almost unbearable penance to stay within door alone in she absence i prayed and struggle for composure but could not attain it and at last i say i must go out sometimes to breathe the air she warn I of peril await I if i walk abroad by myself but i get some poor coarse black clothes that i put on and a hood to hide my face and i sometimes add to these a cloth tie about my neck such as i have see on poor creature who have sore it be a artifice but i hope not a sinful one for in this disguise and contrive to behave like a sick languish person i be more terrible to disorderly people than they to I and they keep at a good distance from I thus i take many a walk about the street but my chief comfort be only to see a variety of dismal object the street where we dwell be quite grass-grown and empty i do not think there be above two inhabit house in it nor would you see above half a dozen people go through it in all the length of the summer 's day of the passenger that i meet elsewhere i think two out of every three be poor sickly object with sore and plaster upon they and sometimes it be my luck to meet coffin of those dead of the sickness for now there could be no strict observe of the rule to bury they by night the number of such funeral increase at a frightful rate chapter xi how there come new guest into the house the last day that i venture out in this foolhardy manner i have a terrible fright which even now it be distasteful to remember i be hurry to get home be warn by the darkening light that it be draw near althea 's time to return and chance to look behind I as i turn a corner i be aware that not many pace from I be a man tall and sturdy who seem to be follow I he eye be fix on I and when i turn it seem to give he a kind of start for he look away and make as if he would cross to the other side this alarmed I and i quicken my pace from a walk almost into a run resolve meanwhile not to look round again yet i could not resist the fancy that i hear step come after I and glance over my shoulder i be aware of some one at no great distance off on which i dare look no more and be now very near home i dart round to the back entrance and have get in and make the door fast i sit down tremble to get my breath i be still much disquiet when i hear the joyful sound of althea 's signal at the back door i fly to open to she my hand tremble so i could hardly withdraw the bolt but when i get the door open it be not althea who stand without but that very man whom i have try to escape he stand with he back to the sky which be red and glowing for it be just past sunset and i see he to be tall and powerful and roughly clothe so sunburnt that he might have be a moor and a long scar that run from he eyebrow half across he cheek give a strange fierceness to he look this be all i could see he back be to the light such as it be i give a smother shriek and would have shut the door on he but he say -- ` not so hasty mistress -- look at I again and you will not turn I away i think ' but i still hold the door in my hand and say hastily ' i can admit no stranger -- you should know this house be infect -- what do you seek ' at which the man 's eye which i see to be blue and bright begin to twinkle and he say -- ` you will think it odd madam but i be come seek my true love -- lucium dacre be she name do you know aught of she ' with which word he smile and all he face change in that smile into the face of my own harry my heart spring up in sudden rapture i think as the play say it ` leap to be go into he bosom ' for there i find myself the next moment clasp tight in he arm and hold he tight enough too while i laugh and sob cry out ` be you indeed my harry be i so bless beyond all other woman have you come back to I alive from the dead ' ` you may say indeed sweetheart that i be alive from the dead ' he say seriously ` in a double sense i be dead and be alive again but my tale must wait for a better time i be send before dear love to tell you you sister be come and not come alone ' ` who be come with she any one beside will have you come to say she have find andrew have she indeed ' i cry ` ay ' say harry ` he be find but i fear we may lose he again have you here a place lucy here a die man may lie softly and easily the little time he have leave if not make one ready quickly -- but no stair for he remember i would help you dear heart ' he say tenderly ` be it not that i must keep watch here for they come ' i turn my lip to he hand as i unclasped my arm from he then i fly to do as he have bid i drag the covering off we own bed and hastily spread a couch in that room where we commonly sit i set light food cordial in readiness on the table then i run back to the door half afraid my harry would have vanish like a dream but there he be watch yet so i take my place beside he and load he with question about the finding of andrew i learn he have a large share in it ' a poor seaman who love I ' he say ` meet I this morning when i land at woolwich and he testify such extravagant joy on see I that i own i half think he mad ' ` then what can you think of I ' i put in at which harry say -- ` nay lucy you be ice compare to this poor fellow he be one that have taste andrew 's bounty and that not long since for he wife sicken of the plague and we andrew at he own cost provide a physician for she and many other comfort and ` tis owe to that the man think that she be now sound and well ' ` where be this ' i say wonder ` here in london ' say harry ` now close on this woman 's recovery come the seize of andrew and ` tis but lately that the poor grateful sailor discover how he benefactor have be lie long in newgate where he be throw by one ralph lacy 's procurement ' ` ah ' i say ` that wretch but he have pay for it harry but why could althea never find andrew before ' ' i can not tell by what devilish prompt it be ' he say ` that lacy bear andrew and every one else down that he true name be not golding but dewsbury -- william dewsbury as i think and that he have shift he name to avoid prosecution have be once imprison already and what we poor friend say to the contrary be slight as a lie he true name have never be give he so inquiry after he have be cripple and not by this mean only ' ` but if this sailor be so grateful why do he not come to we poor friend 's help ' i say indignantly but harry say sighing -- ' a destitute seaman why there be throng of they and they wife starve in the street and cursing the navy officer because they can not get they own hard wages and this be why my poor fellow show such frantic joy on see I -- 'twa for love of andrew he hurry he tiding on I and bid I hasten to the gaol and relieve my friend himself go there with I else i have not speed so well ' now how harry speed at the prison i learn afterwards for at this point he tale be cut short but i will put the story here where it seem fittest by great good fortune althea encounter with harry and the seaman ned gile at the very gate of the prison and she soon buy leave to visit the prisoner call william dewsbury who lay under lock and key in a very filthy cell and have latterly be deny even bread and water because he money be spend he could not satisfy he gaoler 's demand they find he lie on a heap of mouldy straw he be miserably waste and to all seem lifeless yet they know he at once for andrew and harry perceive there be life yet in he althea however see he lie as if dead rise into fiery indignation she turn to the gaoler say in a terrible voice -- ` see there murderer that be you work -- the blood of this man shall lie on you soul for ever -- it shall drown you in perdition ' at which he cower and shrink -lrb- ` and well he might ' say harry -rrb- stammer out 'twa a oversight a pure accident and she go on to threaten he with law and vengeance he ask hurriedly would not the lady like to remove the poor man and give he honorable burial at which harry whisper she ` take he offer quickly say not a word more of revenge ' and althea guess he meaning soften she tone a little and consent to the man 's proposal ` get I only a coach ' say she ` and i will have this poor lifeless body to mine own home and i will not charge you with the murder ' so they fetch a coach but the driver see as he think a dead man bring out and lay in it fling down the rein and refuse to drive they ' i be well use to drive sick folk ' he say -lrb- indeed that be now the chief use of hackney coach -rrb- ` but a corpse i never drive and never will ' althea however step in herself and bid will get on the box and take the rein then whisper to harry she tell he where to find I and beg he would prepare I for she come ' i shall soon master this knave 's scruple ' she say ` he be but bring they to market and i be ready to buy they ' and as i suppose she pay a heavy price for the use of that coach for a hour say she man should drive it to she house and then return it empty to the coachman for while harry and i stand talk at the door he tale be break by the rumble of wheel and the coach come lumber up we perceive will to be the driver ` that be well ' say harry ` it will not be know where you dwell ' as he speak the coach stop and althea put aside the close-drawn curtain she call harry to she and say softly -- ` now help I to lift he good friend -- but be very gentle he live he speak but he be deadly weak ' and with infinite care she and harry lift out a poor shrunken figure that seem light as a infant in they arm and i lead the way they bring it in and lay it on the couch i have get ready there althea sit down draw andrew 's head on to she bosom support he with she arm and murmur tender word in he ear harry stay to speak a word to will before he drive off and then return he stand by I a moment and gaze with I at those two 'twa a sight to chain one 's eye fast to see althea 's face still heavenly fair in spite of she anguish bend over andrew 's which be livid in color all but fleshless and the eye deep sink in they socket yet he smile a smile full of a strange radiance and he move he colourless lip say something which althea bent she head very low to hear then look up wildly and see harry -- ` have you bring a physician ' she cry ` there be no time to lose -- he be die for lack of help ' ` that he shall not ' say harry who be now kneel beside andrew and offer a cordial to he lip ` here be no disease but hunger dear lady -- i have learn by sharp experience how to minister to that ' and in two hasty word he bid I go and warm some broth of which luckily i have tell he so i go quickly now when i come back i see there be more company in the room for will have come in and with he a man and woman but i do not note they much for it seem to I that andrew be swoon he eye be close but harry take the broth from I and begin to feed andrew with it and at the warm scent of the food he revive a little it charm I to see the tender skill which my harry show in he ministering as i stand look on the woman come up to I and with a sort of simple grace let I know who she be 'twas mary the wife of ned gile the seaman and the man with she be gile himself ` you will forgive we madam ' she say ` for thrust we company on you unbidden it be for love of this you kinsman we come mr truelocke have send we word we could be useful about he ' ` kay ' i say ` never ask forgiveness for such goodness do you know this house be repute to be infect ' but she say smile -- ` madam i who be all but dead of the plague not long since have little fear of it leave ' while she speak i see that harry be urge something on althea who be still sit at andrew 's head she answer at last ` as you will i may not gainsay you ' and yield up she place to that good woman who come eagerly to take it when harry call she ` now go and rest awhile till we call you -- you have need ' harry say to we but althea as if she hear he not stand look down on andrew and he nurse ` do god forget he own ' she mutter ` be this the reward of he servant chain cruelty starvation ' andrew must have catch she word for he half raise he head and he languid eye brighten ` dear heart ' he say feebly ` thou knowest little yet thou hast see my prison thou didst not see the heavenly guest who make it a heaven to I thou hast see I lack bread thou knowest nought of the angel ' food with which he feed I ' as he say this he sink down again but mary gile catch he in she arm and harry say imperiously to althea and I -- ` leave he to we it be best he should not speak get you to you own rest you need to renew you strength so we go meekly enough althea say when we be in we sleeping-room -- ` harry have get the trick of command very perfect that be certain and i may say lucy i be weary at last of rule over you and will it be not amiss there be one here who have a mind to rule I instead ' then we kneel down together and give thanks for the great mercy of the day and we implore passionately that the life of andrew should be give back to we althea at the end of we prayer still remain kneel then begin to weep she sob out ' i think i hope i can say he will be do but oh ` tis hard lucy ' and she be so torn and shake with she passion that i think she would take no rest that night but in five minute after we head touch the pillow we be both sleep soundly : and we wake not till there come a knock at we door very early in the morning and will 's voice pray we to descend and take some food chapter xii how we sail for france in the ` marie-royale ' we find we friend where we have leave they the gray dawn glimmer in at the window show we andrew lie in a quiet slumber and he look nothing so death-like as the night before but the other appear haggard and weary as well they might for none of they have sleep a wink the night through yet joy speak from the poor wan face of mary gile and she husband they have help in the tend of andrew with wonderful skill and care and now they be rejoice in a good hope that he would yet recover there be a meal spread of which they have already partake and we be now bid to sit and eat also as quickly as we might it be harry who give we these order with a stern anxious look which daunt I a little when we have eat -- ` now leave we with we friend lady ' he say ` and gather all together in readiness to depart this house shall not hold we another hour ' and althea hesitating and say andrew be hardly in case to depart ` that knave gaoler ' he say ` who have hide andrew from you so long have strong reason for do it be there no fear think you that he may suspect there be life in the dead man whom we remove would you have we practice detect and the prisoner seize again ' it do not need more to set wing to althea 's foot so we make haste and gather up all we belongings and come down again with we bundle pack and we travel suit don long ere the hour be pass yet for all we haste we find they have make better speed than we there stand a coach wait into which they have already lift andrew he be muffle in a long cloak that i have fling off the night before the two gilese have he in they care and will be again act as driver -lrb- i believe 'twa the very coach of the previous night -rrb- he be take harry 's order as to drive at a very soft pace to the nearest stair ` where ' say harry ` we will meet you these lady will walk with I ' we see they drive off then i make fast the outer door and harry take the key from I and fling it over the wall into the garden ` let any find it who list ' say he ' i thank god we be quit of the hideous place how you have endure to dwell there day and night pass my comprehension ' ` why ' say i ` be it not a glorious rich house ' ' a house of sin and pride and death ' say he ' i grant you ' ` you be of will 's mind ' say althea ` he never would eat or sleep in it ' ` if that be will 's mind ' say he ' i approve he wisdom and now hey for father thame and he silver stream and the sweet salt air of the sea here take my arm fair lady ' he say to althea as we go along ' i have my doubt of you obedience -- lucy i can trust to come with I of free will ' so she take he arm and say smile faintly -- ` at least indulge I so far as to tell we whither we be bind ' ` you hear I say ' he answer step on briskly ` to the nearest stair i have a boat ready there and we will slip down the river to a ship i wot of that lie near woolwich i own ' he go on ` it be a mighty risk to run with andrew in such a feeble case yet i see no better way ' and in hasty word he tell we how poor be we chance of get clear away from the plague-stricken city by land ` london be something of a mouse-trap now ' say he ` or a lion 's den if you like a statelier image the way in be easy enough but the way out be more difficult than the steep and thorny path to heaven every town and village we should come to would rise against we with hue and cry and drive we back to the city to perish there so cruel be man become through fear of the contagion ' althea 's pale cheek grow paler as she listen and she say ` alas my lucy into what a snare have i bring you and all through pride and self-will ' ` nay sweet sister ' say i ` do not miscall you compassion and the daring of you spirit which lead you here ' ` there be pride and wilfulness in it too ' say she ` and look what a rebuke heaven give I it be not i that rescue andrew it be harry and poor gile ' ` tut tut ' say harry ` do not abuse yourself overmuch you have find andrew long since but for the evil mind of ralph lacy who have buy yon keeper with a mighty bribe and command that andrew should be keep out of sight if ever you make inquiry after he ' this piece of intelligence strike we silent till we get to the stair go down which we find a roomy boat await we in which be already the rest of we little company except will and he appear before we be well settle in we place spring in after we and say joyfully as he take a oar -- ` that coachman have fain learn from I who it be i have carry down to the river but i can be deaf upon occasion ' from which i gather that he have be commission to restore the coach to its owner the sun come up as we begin to glide down the stream and a million little sparkling wave flash back he reflection as we row on which be the only cheerful part of the scene i think for all we company be grave and silent and andrew though the calmest of we look so like death that i could find no pleasure in he peaceful aspect and the river itself which i have formerly see so gay with all kind of craft waterman ply up and down constantly and great sea-going ship come and go and lesser vessel crowd the noble stream now seem as desolate as the town that lay on its bank only as we go on we come to many ship lie at anchor by two and two sometimes two or three line of these ship lay in the breadth of the river and as we thread we way between they man woman and child come and look over the side at we i be glad to break the silence that have settle on we and i ask what be the reason of these long row of ship be thus moor idly near the shore on which the good mary gile who have again the office of support andrew speaking softly tell I how they be the refuge of many hundred of family flee out of london who hope in this way to escape the contagion ' i do not know ' she say however ` that they do always escape as they hope many a device do i practice myself to keep myself whole and sound and some mighty foolish one but it please the lord to drive I from all those refuge of lie and to show I that he only can kill and make alive to my think a fearless believe heart be the best charm against the plague ' ` ay ' say harry ` that be the best charm doubtless but we shall find it not amiss to keep we dwelling cleaner and sweeter here in england with faith and courage and cleanliness we might defy the foul fiend pestilence you shall not find that it make so great ravages even among the dutch ' with that he bite he lip as though a secret have escape he however no one but myself note he and the other now begin to talk more freely and mr gile from time to time bestir herself about nourishment for andrew which harry have be careful to provide he say a man so nigh dead of hunger must have food often but in small quantity so we party grow cheerfuller ever as the stream grow broader and we begin to breathe the salt breeze that blow inland we venture to question harry about the ship that would receive we and he say she be a french merchant-ship and the captain a great friend of he a good protestant who be willing to take on board any company he should bring ' i hope ' say i ` it might have be the _ good hope _ ' ` alas for my poor _ good hope _ ' say he ` she go to piece in a mighty storm on the hard-hearted coast of africa and such of my brave fellow as be not drown be seize for slave by the barbarous people of algier ' ` and you harry what be you lot ' i cry ` the lot of a slave for many a day ' say he briefly ` it be thanks to my good friend captain maret who will soon receive we that i have ever see my country again ' i would gladly have ask more but i see he be little inclined to talk and after he have say ` the ship we be go to board be call the _ marie-royale _ ' he fall again into a silence but the rest of we continue to keep up some sort of talk till we get down by woolwich and this seem to help we courage a little -- i mean althea 's and mine especially when andrew would say a few word as he begin to do in a way that show revive strength now i have never go by sea anywhere and all my sailing have be in wherry on the thame so i be not free from some childish fear when we come beside the _ marie-royale _ and see she black side rise high and steep above we but joy sit on every other face in we little company and harry 's voice be gay once more as he shout a answer to captain maret who come and hail we from above 'twa a matter of some difficulty to get andrew safely hoist on deck yet they do it without give too rude a shock to he enfeebled frame i confess when it come to my turn to mount i shut my eye for fear and never open they till i find harry 's arm about I and a firm footing under I and i hear he voice merrily mock I for a poor little fool who be ready to swoon at fancied peril and be reckless of real one so then i look abroad again and see myself encircle with all we company who be smile at my terror while the dark kindly face of the captain beam a welcome on I -- i laugh first and then weep and then clasp my hand begin to thank and praise god for we good deliverance as if i be in a ecstasy but now no one laugh at I but head be uncovered and eye cast down in thankful prayer also all around I the french sailor who have help we to come aboard show themselves not less reverent than we handful of english and indeed appear to be much move then andrew who stand support by the arm of ned and mary gile look smile at I and say in he feeble voice -- ` thou shamest I much my sister lucy i who be deepest in peril ought to have be foremost in praise ' and harry reply bluntly -- 'till you know something of the danger these lady have run you need not be more grateful than they but you further thanks must be render in you cabin where i long to have you lodge before we get under weigh ' ` that shall be soon ' say the captain ` we have but stay for you come and see the wind have shift since we sight you and blow fair for we depart ' he move away as he speak and begin give he order while harry marshal we down to we cabin say gaily ` ay the merry wind blow from the land now 'twa against we as we row and i have my fear but all 's well that end well -- the lord be praise therefor ' ` tell we whither this kind wind be to blow we ' i ask and he say ` so it be not enough for you to be with I where i go ' i answer boldly ` by no means ' on which laughing he say ' i will talk with you soon sweetheart on that point and many other but now let we look to andrew ' so i and my curiosity have to wait awhile for when andrew and he faithful nurse be settle below harry go on deck and i sit by althea something sick at heart for all my joy while with many strange noise of rattle and creak and trample overhead we ship shake out she great wing and spread they for flight but at last the water slip past we cabin window show we be stand out to sea and then come harry and sit down beside we andrew have fall asleep and gile and he wife sit watch he a little way off so there be nothing to break in on harry 's story ` now first of all my lucy ' say he ` you must know whither we be bind ` tis to calai for there be captain maret due and over-due have come to woolwich only for my sake and yours as it have proved then at calais i have intelligence that we shall find a ship bind for hull by which we may go thither and so home to we father in the dale ' ` do you know ' i say ' i suspect you design to be for holland ' ` well ' say he ' i have such a thought for andrew there be friend in that country with whom he might be sheltered till england should be safe for he once more but it dislike I to have dealings with any country at war with mine own -- mad and wicked though the war be on we part ' ` all england be go mad and wicked i think ' say althea ` for my share i care not much if i never see it more ' ` you will change that think i hope ' say he ` but now my lucy i have a request and a petition to you captain maret will bring we at calai to a clergyman of the english church whom he know there will you consent for the good man to join we hand ` tis long since we heart be knit i trow ' ` what be you ask of she ' say althea ` should not such a marriage be celebrate on english ground ' ` so it shall ' say he ` for we will be wed on board the ship that shall take we to hull and she plank be those of a english vessel be reckon english ground now what say my dear heart ' and as i blushed and stammer ' i warrant you ' say he ` lucy be strike dumb at my presumption in talking of wedlock my good ship be go to wreck and i myself newly loose from slavery ' ` harry ' i cry ` how dare you think so meanly of I i who have be delight in the thought of pour all my little wealth at you foot and bidding you freight a new ship with it but perhaps you be too proud -- you will refuse it ' ` nay i refuse neither it nor thee my lucy ' he say ` the less because i can counterpoise my darling 's little purse with something weightier ' and he tell we briefly how in he captivity he have rise very high in he moorish master 's favor have have the good fortune to save the man 's life at the risk of he own ` there be two rascal set on my master to murder he for certain precious jewel that he wear ' say he ` and i have the luck to lay they both low though i get this little remembrance first from the fiercest of they ' touch as he speak the scar upon he cheek ` and with that stroke ' he go on ' i purchase my freedom and something more for the moor confer on I freely those gem that the thief have covet they be worth a little fortune after this my only care be to find a ship to bring I home of which i be almost in despair when the good maret come to my rescue which he effect with great skill and boldness nor do i know how i could have get you clear of london but for he readiness to help I once again ' this be harry 's history which he make very dry and short for he hate to dwell on he own doings or suffering i have get from he since many particulars of the story and i think it be more worthy of pen and ink than this poor tale of we homely joy and sorrow but he think not so and it be at he bidding i have write all this last part tell how he bring we safely out of london conclusion how lucium dwell in england and althea otherwhere there be little more to write now i do not care to cross harry 's wish in the matter of we wedding to which both the good mary gile and althea herself urge I to consent only i have always hope that my father truelocke himself should join we hand and when i whisper this to harry he say ` if you can not be content without it sweetheart my father shall marry we over again when we get to dent-dale but i will not go back to england till i can call you wife ' so my last defense fall and wed we be on board the _ diamond _ a good english ship that we find lie at calai accord to harry 's intelligence i do not forget that promise of he and in due time i hold he to it but before i wind up mine own story i will relate that of my sister for we life that have run so long in one channel be divide now since althea sail not with we to england and i will show the reason presently that imagination which harry have once entertain of andrew 's pass into holland and be safe there as a exile prove to be no impossible device in spite of the war between the english and the dutch for while we still lay at calai in the _ marie-royale _ -lrb- i must ever admire she captain 's courage in take we poor fugitive on board even though harry be warrant for we soundness -rrb- there come letter from certain friend call derrick of the dutch nation they have hear of andrew 's strange escape from prison i wot not by what mean for the friend have they own way of learn news of one another these good people will he to go make he home under they roof in amsterdam and he be very fain to seek that shelter be exceedingly weary in spirit as one half spend with toil and grief only two thing hold he back the one be he love for we dear and cruel country england which make he shrink from dwelling in a land at enmity with she and the other be my sister now the first scruple harry overcome thus ` you need must dwell in some foreign land ' he say ` for england be altogether unsafe for you should you choose france as captain maret would have you you choose a land chiefly papist and now full of oppression and my life on it there will be war between france and england this very winter ' a say which prove too true ` so the balance must dip in favor of holland a protestant country where you shall live under just law and among faithful friend who believe as you do be not this worth weigh brother ' and andrew say ` it be ' but yet he hesitate and i need not the sight of he question look at althea nor of she dropt eyelid and whitening cheek to guess the reason of he hesitation the next morning after we have this talk harry althea and i be sit idly on deck basking in the sunshine and drink the sweet air while we watch the sailor at work when we see andrew come feebly towards we at which we spring up surprised for he have not heretofore rise so early because of he great weakness althea would have have he rest on the cushion from which we have rise but say ' i would rather stand awhile ' he lean on harry 's shoulder for support and indeed he look deathly when he white and waste face be see beside harry 's countenance all bronze with sun and wind and glowing with health and life ` althea dacre ' he say look steadily at she ' i have seek all night long for a light on the path i must now take and a word be ever in my ear speak to the maiden thou lovest she word shall lead thee thou knowest i be loth to part from thee who hast seek I and spend thyself for I -- and more loth to think that we be part in spirit yet if thy heart be not as my heart towards god we must be part now and ever i implore thee speak the perfect truth to I and do not color or change it ' ` and i will speak truth ' she say proudly ` as if i stand before a angel of god and it shall not grieve you andrew golding thy people shall be my people and thy god my god the church that i dream of the church i would have die for be not a church stain with innocent blood i will cast in my lot now and for ever with the only christian people that have never persecute another -- the only one i verily believe that follow whithersoever the master lead ' at this andrew 's pallid face glow as if a clear flame shone through it he stretch out he hand to althea and she give he both hers continue to say -- ` and what be my native land to I it be fill with violence and madness i fear ` tis accurse of god i be willing to find my fatherland wherever you find a home ' she turn with a defy look towards we at which harry begin to laugh and say ` how about the rose i have one night from mistress althea dacre it be a rose yet -- dry and fade truly but it have not turn into a nettle ' ` be generous ' she say blush ` do not remind I of that i speak of it in the day of my folly i have be teach the plague of my own heart since by many a sharp lesson ' ` well ' say harry ' i may truly say the same of myself it have pleased god ' he say reverently ` to bring I to himself through suffer i trust overmuch to my own heart and not till i be stript of all a beggar and a slave do i learn mine own vileness and weakness and christ 's all-sufficiency i thank he for the teaching and i think my lucy have go through the same school be it not so sweetheart ' and i murmur a assent ` not one of you ' say andrew ` have be so poor a pupil at that learn as i but i think my many stripe have surely beat it into my hard heart at last and that i have master my task once and for ever ' ` then ' quoth harry ` we be all on one footing so far and we may thank heaven for it but i can not fall in with you in you condemn of other church and the church of england chiefly she be not disown of god not quite go astray from he there be in she i must think a seed of life and holiness ' ` you father go out from she notwithstanding ' say althea ` and in my mind he do well though i be fool enough to condemn he at the time ' ` with you leave ' say harry ' i think he be drive out because of those nice and subtle point of doctrine that we ruler cruelly enforce and he could not honestly assent to but i have hear he say ` tis he firm persuasion that out of this misgovern english church there shall yet rise great good and marvellous blessing to the land and the world and in that hope i shall cleave to it with all its fault and so i trust will my wife ' to which i have nothing to say but blush andrew however be trouble ' i fear thou art in perilous error kind and good harry ' say he ` but let every one be fully persuade in he own mind ' ` that be i ' say althea promptly on which he smile again and the two fall into talk about they own concern we charitably leave they to it for now it be well understand among we that they would wed at the earliest opportunity it be a pretty sight to see the new humility they practice towards each other andrew be now fully acquaint with my sister 's effort on he behalf seem to look on she as a protect angel but she regard he as a saint and a martyr know not how to show enough reverence to he also she high courage fail she sometimes and she would cling to the good mary gile like a timid child to its mother mary on she part show the same tenderness for she that she husband display to andrew these good people with will keep they company when they depart for amsterdam which thing be a marvellous comfort to harry and I and shortly we have news how the lover be marry after the quaker fashion and be in a happy way to be settle in that city they dwell there still the good honest standfast have power from andrew to manage he land for he which they do faithfully and the money due to he therefrom be privily convey to he maintain he and he wife in comfort nor they alone but many poor and pious soul who be they pensioner and now we companion be go it might have be think that i should feel a great lack of they especially when the _ diamond _ loose from port and bear we away with she but i could feel nothing save joy and gratitude more especially when i thought of the heavy and dreadful summer that lay behind I and i be possess with a great longing to see my father truelocke once more harry have get word convey to he of he safety and of we approach journey and sure i be he thought fly to meet we thought on the way as we draw nearer and nearer but i want word to express the tenderness of we meeting together when at last my harry and i beheld that venerable face again there be some joy that can not be tell we have make we home with he in dent-dale for there harry have buy a little farm with a pretty odd farmhouse belong thereto and we father live with we well content and in great peace for no squabbling about ecclesiastical matter ever trouble the quiet of we sweet mountain solitude there be a little lonely church in the dale where a good simple-hearted pastor minister and there can we worship in a homely and hearty fashion nor do the pastor take it ill that mr truelocke keep aloof from the prayer but respect he scruple and revere he character for proof thereof i do not cease urge on harry he careless promise that we union should have we father 's blessing on it and the good pastor fall in with my whim prevail on mr truelocke to remarry we very privately in the little church i speak of he himself assist 'twa a foolish fancy i wot but i be not easy till i have it gratified and it be now my constant hope that harry will never put to sea again but will be content to plough the kindly earth and gather in she fruit instead of furrow the barren cruel wave sure he have have enough of strange adventure yet i fear he sometimes when little work be stir then he be so restless that even in he dream he will talk of seafaring i think however he will wander no more so long as we father live we get letter from althea and she husband at rare interval indeed but then they be long and ample and it be a marvel how stiffly althea now stand for all the point of the quaker doctrine which formerly she so abhor and contemn not many day since there reach I a long letter from she in which she tell I indeed a great deal of news and also express a wonderful sisterly affection but the burden of it be she disquietude because of my religious error she be very earnest with I upon the sin and danger of conform to the world in dress and speech and deportment there be thing in this letter which really trouble I so i carry it to mr truelocke and when he have read it i ask he opinion whether christian folk be bind to observe such strictness as althea now advocate and practise at which softly smile he say -- ` pure religion and undefile before god and the father be this to visit the fatherless and widow in they affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world i think thou art not far from exemplify that pure religion in thine own life daughter so i trust do thy sister but i think she not more free from world-spot than thee because she perchance go clad in gray and thou in scarlet ' for i have a new red cloak and hood upon I ` this ' he say touch the cloak lightly ` be no stain of scarlet sin ` tis honest dye-stuff lucy ' ` it might make I vain and proud to go gaily might it not ' i say ` when it have that effect child renounce it as a snare ' he reply ' i think thou art not over gay as yet for a young wife with a true-love husband to please ' ` but besides these thing ' i say ` there be other more serious see how my sister cry out against all set form of worship even to the singing of hymn and how she account even the outward visible form of the two great sacrament as have something of the nature of a idol that we sinfully adore all should be spiritual and inward accord to she and to other friend and i do not myself understand how that can be ' '' tis a great truth that they uphold ' say he musingly ` yet i can not see that it include all truth for my own share i still hold fast to my opinion they commend themselves to my reason as strongly as ever i should lie do i deny they and yet from my very heart i agree with the friend in prize the spirit above the letter and i hope my daughter ' he go on while a smile tremble on he lip ` that a day will yet dawn when all christian man shall agree so heartily as touch the deep and vital truth of they faith that they may be content to differ as to the visible ceremonial garment that they faith may wear but that will not be in my day lucy nor i fear much in thine let we hope and pray for its come and let we rejoice meanwhile and give thanks for we safety here from the strife of tongue for the peace and rest we be allow to share in this corner of the earth so far be we happy above many ' and i be only too glad to obey he word and to fare like a bird of the air that be feed by god 's daily bounty without care for the morrow nor will i trouble myself any more about this nice point of doctrine and that lay on myself a burden that god never give I have he not give I he own peace and with it more of earthly bliss than ever my heart dare hope for and be i even less happy in my lot i ought all my life to praise he for he hand over we for good while we dwell in that city of the plague i have hear with infinite satisfaction how since this cold winter weather come on the sickness be mightily abate and man hope it be pass away but it have sweep off say they not less than a hundred thousand soul in one fatal year and what be we that we should escape it be all of the lord 's goodness and he pity to we rashness end of the project gutenberg ebook of andrew golding by annie e keel
