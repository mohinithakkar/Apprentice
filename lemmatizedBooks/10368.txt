two-horned alexander and these experience furnish the motive for those subsequent adventure which be now relate in this book some writer have confound the two-horned alexander with alexander the great but this be a inexcusable error reference in ancient history to the two-horned alexander describe he as a great and powerful potentate and place he in the time of abraham mr s baring-gould in he legend of the patriarch and prophet state that after a careful examination he have come to the conclusion that some of the most generally know legend which have come down to we through the age be base on incident which occur in the reign of this monarch the hero of this story now deem it safe to speak out plainly without fear of evil consequence to himself and he confidence in we high civilization be a compliment to the age list of illustration i lend large sum to the noble knight do not you do it he wife be a slender lady time of abraham i exclaimed mose ask embarrassing question a encounter with charle lamb i cut that picture from its frame when we leave cordova i have be a broker in pompeius solomon and the jinn go tell the queen she give I she hand and i shake it heartily ask all sort of question and roughly tell I she turn she head how like i proceed to dig a hole why be you not in the army nebuchadnezzar and the gardener petrarch and laura the crouch african fix she eye upon he the vizier of the two-horned alexander i i be on a french steamer bind from havre to new york when i have a peculiar experience in the way of a shipwreck on a dark and foggy night when we be about three day out we vessel collide with a derelict -- a great heavy helpless mass as dull and colorless as the darkness in which she be envelop we strike she almost head on and she stump of a bowsprit be drive into we port bow with such tremendous violence that a great hole -- nobody know of what dimension -- be make in we vessel the collision occur about two hour before daylight and the frightened passenger who crowd the upper deck be soon inform by the officer that it would be necessary to take to the boat for the vessel be rapidly settle by the head now of course all be hurry and confusion the captain endeavor to assure he passenger that there be boat enough to carry every soul on board and that there be time enough for they to embark quietly and in order but as the french people do not understand he when he speak in english and as the american do not readily comprehend what he say in french he exhortation be of little avail with such of they possession as they could carry the people crowd into the boat as soon as they be ready and sometimes before they be ready and while there be not exactly a panic on board each man seem to be inspire with the idea that he safety and that of he family if he have one depend upon precipitate individual action i be a young man travel alone and while i be as anxious as any one to be save from the sink vessel i be not a coward and i could not thrust myself into a boat when there be woman and child behind I who have not yet be provide with place there be man who do this and several time i feel inclined to knock one of the poltroon overboard the deck be well light the steamer be settle slowly and there be no excuse for the dastardly proceedings which be go on about I it be not long however before almost all of the passenger be safely embark and i be prepare to get into a boat which be nearly fill with the officer and crew when i be touch on the shoulder and turn i see a gentleman whose acquaintance i have make soon after the steamer have leave havre he name be crowder he be a middle-aged man a new-yorker intelligent and of a social disposition and i have find he a very pleasant companion to my amazement i perceive that he be smoke a cigar if i be you say he i would not go in that boat it be horribly crowd and the captain and second officer have yet to find place in it that be all the more reason say i why we should hurry i be not go to push myself ahead of woman and child but i have just as much right to be save as the captain have and if there be any vacant place let we get they as soon as possible crowder now put he hand on my shoulder as if to restrain I safety say he you need not trouble yourself about safety you be just as safe where you be as you could possibly be in one of those boat if they be not pick up soon -- and they may float about for day -- they suffering and discomfort will be very great there be a shameful want of accommodation in the way of boat but my dear sir say i i can not stop here to talk about that they be call for the captain now oh he be in no hurry say my companion he be collect he papers i suppose and he know he vessel will not sink under he while he be do it i be not go in that boat i have not the least idea of such a thing it will be odiously crowd and i assure you sir that if the sea should be rough that boat will be dangerous even now she be overloaded i look at the man in amazement he have speak earnestly but he be as calm as if we be stand on a sidewalk and he endeavor to dissuade I from board a overcrowded street-car before i could say anything he speak again : i be go to remain on this ship she be a hundred time safer than any of those boat i have have a great deal of experience in regard to vessel and ocean navigation and it will be a long time before this vessel sink if she ever sink of she own accord she be just as likely to float as that derelict we run into the steam be nearly out of she boiler by this time and nothing be likely to happen to she i wish you would stay with I here we will be safe with plenty of room and plenty to eat and drink when it be daylight we will hoist a flag of distress which will be much more likely to be see than anything that can flutter from those little boat if you have notice sir the inclination of this deck be not greater now than it be half a hour ago that prove that we bow have settle down about as far as it be go i think it likely that the water have enter only a few of the forward compartment the man speak so confidently that he word make a impression upon I i know that it very often happen that a wreck float for a long time and the boat from which the man be now frantically shout for the captain would certainly be dangerously crowd stay with I say mr crowder and i assure you with as much reason as any man can assure any other man of anything in this world that you will be perfectly safe this steamer be not go to sink there be rapid footstep and i see the captain and he second officer approach step back here say mr crowder pull I by the coat do not let they see we they may drag we on board that confound boat keep quiet sir and let they get off they think they be the last on board involuntarily i obey he and we stand in the shadow of the great funnel the captain have reach the rail be every one in the boat he shout in french and in english be every one in the boat i be go to leave the vessel i make a start as if to rush toward he but crowder hold I by the arm do not you do it he whisper very earnestly i have the greatest possible desire to save you stay where you be and you will be all right that overloaded boat may capsize in half a hour -lrb- illustration : ` do not you do it ' -rrb- i could not help it i believe he my own judgment seem suddenly to rise up and ask I why i should leave the solid deck of the steamer for that perilous little boat i need say but little more in regard to this shipwreck when the fog lift about ten o'clock in the morning we could see no sign of any of the boat a mile or so away lay the dull black line of the derelict as if she be some savage beast who have bite and tear we and be now sullenly wait to see we die of the wound we hoist a flag union down and then we go below to get some breakfast mr crowder know all about the ship and where to find everything he tell I he have make so many voyage that he feel almost as much at home on sea as on land we make ourselves comfortable all day and at night we go to we room and i sleep fairly well although there be a very disagreeable slant to my berth the next day early in the afternoon we signal of distress be see by a tramp steamer on she way to new york and we be take off we cruise about for many hour in the direction the boat have probably take and the next day we pick up two of they in a sorry condition the occupant have suffer many hardship and privation we never have news of the captain 's boat but the other be rescue by a sailing-vessel go eastward before we reach new york mr crowder have make I promise that i would spend a few day with he at he home in that city he family be small he tell I -- a wife and a daughter about six -- and he want I to know they naturally we have become great friend very likely the man have save my life and he have do it without any act of heroism or daring but simply by impress I with the fact that he judgment be better than mine i be apt to object to people of superior judgment but mr crowder be a exception to the ordinary superior person from the way he talk it be plain that he ` have much experience of various sort and that he have greatly advantaged thereby but he give himself no air on this account and there be nothing patronize about he if i be able to tell he anything he do not know -- and i frequently be -- he be very glad to hear it moreover mr crowder be a very good man to look at he be certainly over fifty and he closely trim hair be white but he have a fresh and florid complexion he be tall and well make fashionably dress and have a erect and somewhat military carriage he be fond of talk and seem fond of I and these point in he disposition attract I very much my relative be few they live in the west and i never have have a friend whose company be so agreeable to I as that of mr crowder mr crowder 's residence be a handsome house in the upper part of the city he wife be a slender lady scarcely half he age with a sweet and interesting face and be attire plainly but tastefully in general appearance she seem to be the opposite of she husband in every way she have suffer a week of anxiety and be so rejoice at have she husband again that when i meet she some hour after crowder have reach the house she glorified face seem like that of a angel but there be nothing demonstrative about she even in she great joy she be as quiet as a dive and i be not surprise when she husband afterward tell I that she be a quaker -lrb- illustration : he wife be a slender lady -rrb- i be entertain very handsomely by the crowder i spend several day with they and although they be so happy to see each other they make it very plain that they be also happy to have I with they he because he like I she because he like I on the day before my intended departure mr crowder and i be smoking after dinner in he study he have be speak of people and thing that he have see in various part of the world but after a time he become a little abstracted and allow I to do most of the talk you must excuse I he say suddenly when i have repeat a question you must not think I willingly inattentive but i be consider something important -- very important ever since you have be here -- almost ever since i have know you i might say -- the desire have be grow upon I to tell you something know to no living be but myself this offer do not altogether please I i have grow very fond of crowder but the confidence of friend be often very embarrassing at this moment the study door be gently open and mr crowder come in no say she address she husband with a smile thee need not let thy conscience trouble thee i have not come to say anything about gentleman be too long over they smoking i only want to say that mr norri and two other lady have just call and i be go down to see they they be a committee and will not care for the society of gentleman i be sorry to lose any of you company mr randolph especially as you insist that this be to be you last evening with we but i do not think you would care anything about we ward organization now be not that a wife to have exclaim my host as we resume we cigar she think of everybody 's happiness and even wish we to feel free to take another cigar if we desire it although in she heart she disapprove of smoking we settle ourselves again to talk and as there really could be no objection to my listen to crowder 's confidence i make none what i have to tell you he say presently concern my life present past and future pretty comprehensive be not it i have long be look for some one to whom i should be so draw by bond of sympathy that i should wish to tell he my story now i feel that i be so draw to you the reason for this in some degree at least be because you believe in I you be not weak and it be my opinion that on important occasion you be very apt to judge for yourself and not to care very much for the opinion of other people and yet on a most important occasion you allow I to judge for you you be not only able to rely on yourself but you know when it be right to rely on other i believe you to be possess of a fine and healthy sense of appreciation i laugh and beg he not to bestow too many compliment upon I for i be not use to they i be not think of compliment you he say i be simply tell you what i think of you in order that you may understand why i tell you my story i must first assure you however that i do not wish to place any embarrassing responsibility upon you by take you into my confidence all that i say to you you may say to other when the time come but first i must tell the tale to you he sit up straight in he chair and put down he cigar i will begin he say by state that i be the vizier of the two-horned alexander i sit up even straighter than my companion and gaze steadfastly at he no say he i be not crazy i expect you to think that and be entirely prepare for you look of amazement and incipient horror i will ask you however to set aside for a time the dictate of you own sense and hear what i have to say then you can take the whole matter into consideration and draw you own conclusion he now lean back in he chair and go on with he story : it would be more correct perhaps for I to say that i be the vizier of the two-horned alexander for that great personage die long ago now i do not believe you ever hear anything about the two-horned alexander i have recover sufficiently from my surprise to assure he that he be right my host nod i think so say he very few people do know anything about that powerful potentate he live in the time of abraham he be a man of considerable culture even of travel and of a adventurous disposition i enter into the service of he court when i be a very young man and gradually i rise in position until i become he chief officer or vizier -lrb- illustration : ` time of abraham ' i exclaimed -rrb- i spring from my chair time of abraham i exclaimed this be simply -- no it be not he interrupt and speak in perfect good humor i beg you will sit down and listen to I what i have to say to you be not nearly so wonderful as the nature and power of electricity i obeyed he have touch I on a tender spot for i be a electrician and can appreciate the wonderful there have be a great deal of discussion he continue in regard to the peculiar title give to alexander but the appellation ` two-horned ' have frequently be use in ancient time you know michelangelo give two horn to mose but he misunderstand the tradition he have hear and furnish the prophet with real horn alexander wear he hair arrange over he forehead in the shape of two protrude horn this be simply a symbol of high authority as the bull be monarch of the herd so be he monarch among man he be the first to use this symbol although it be imitate afterward by various eastern potentate as i have say alexander be a man of enterprise and it have come to he knowledge that there exist somewhere a certain spring the water of which would confer immortality upon any descendant of shem who should drink of they and he start out to find this spring i travel with he for more than a year it be on this journey that he visit abraham when the latter be build the great edifice which the mohammedan claim as they holy temple the kaaba it be more than a month after we have part from abraham that i be in advance of the rest of the company notice a little pool in the shade of a rock and be very warm and thirsty i get down on my hand and knee and put my face to the water drink of it i drink heartily and when i raise my head i see to my amazement that there be not a drop of water leave in the spring now it so happen that when alexander come to this spot he stop and have regard the little hollow under the rock together with its surroundings he dismount and stand by it he call I and say : ` accord to all the description i have read this might have be the spring of immortality for which i have be search but it can not be such now for there be no water in it ' then he stoop down and look carefully at the hollow ` there have be water here ' say he ` and that not long ago for the ground be wet ' a horrible suspicion now seize upon I could i have drain the contents of the spring of inestimable value could i without know it have deprive my king of the great prize for which he have search so long with such labor and pain of course i be certain of nothing but i bow before alexander and tell he that i have find a insignificant little puddle at the place that i have taste it and find it be nothing but common water and in quantity so small that it scarcely suffice to quench my thirst if he would consent to camp in the shade and wait a few hour water would trickle again into the little basin and fill it and he could see for himself that this could not be the spring of which he be in search we wait at that place for the rest of the day and the whole of the night and the next morning the little basin be empty and entirely dry alexander do not reproach I he be accustom to rule all man even himself and he forbid himself to think that i have interfere with the great object of he search but he send I home to he capital city and continue he journey without I ` such a thirsty man must not travel with I ' he say ` if we should really come to the immortal spring he would be sure to drink it all ' nine year afterward alexander return to he palace and when i present myself before he he regard I steadfastly i know why he be look at I and i tremble at length he speak : ` thou art not one day older than when i dismiss thee from my company it be indeed the fountain of immortality which thou didst discover and of which thou didst drink every drop i have search over the whole habitable world and there be no other thou too art a aristocrat thou too art of the family of shem it be for this reason that i place thee near I that i give thee great power and now thou hast destroy all my hope my aspiration thou hast put a end to my ambition i have believe that i should rule the world and rule it forever ' he face grow black he voice be terrible ` retire ' he say ' i will attend to thy future ' i retire but my furious sovereign never see I again i be fifty-three year old when i drink the water in the little pool under the rock and i be well aware that at the time of my sovereign 's return i feel no older and look no older but still i hope that this be merely the result of my general good health and that when alexander come back he would inform I that he have discover the veritable spring of immortality so i retain my high office and wait but i have make my plan for escape in case my hope should not be realize in two minute from the time i leave he presence i have begin my flight and there be no horse in all he dominion which could equal the speed of mine now begin a long long period of danger and terror of concealment and deprivation i flee into other land and these be conquer in order that i might be find but at last alexander die and he son die and the son of he son die and the whole story be forget or disbelieve and i be no longer in danger of live forever as a example of the ingenious cruelty of a exasperated monarch i do not intend to recount my life and adventure since that time in fact i shall scarcely touch upon they you can see for yourself that that would be impossible one might as well attempt to read a history of the world in a single evening i merely want to say enough to make you understand the situation a hundred year after i have flee from alexander i be still fifty-three year old and know that that would be my age forever i stay so long in the place where i first establish myself that people begin to look upon I with suspicion see I grow no older they think i be a wizard and i be oblige to seek a new habitation ever since my fate have be the necessity of move from place to place i would go somewhere as a man begin to show sign of age and i would remain as long as a man could reasonably be suppose to live without become truly old and decrepit sometimes i remain in a place far longer than my prudence should have permit and many be the peril i escape on account of this rashness but i have gradually learn wisdom the man speak so quietly and calmly and make he statement in such a matter-of-fact way that i listen to he with the same fascinate attention i have give to the theory of telegraphy without wire when it be first propound to I in fact i have be so influence by he own conviction of the truth of what he say that i have be on the point of ask he if abraham have really have anything to do with the building of the islam temple but have be check by the thought of the utter absurdity of suppose that this man sit in front of I could possibly know anything about it but now i speak i do not want he to suppose that i believe anything he say nor do i really intend to humor he in he insane retrospection but what he have say suggest to I the very apropos remark that one might suppose he have be give a new version of the story of the wander jew at this he sit up very straight on the extreme edge of he chair he eye sparkle you must excuse I he say but for twenty seconds i be go to be angry i can not help it it be not you fault but that remark always enrage I i expect it of course but it make my blood boil all the same then you have tell you story before i say yes he answer i have tell it to certain person to whom i think it should be know some of these have believe it some have not but believer or disbeliever all have die and disappear they opinion be nothing to I you be now the only living be who know my story i be go to ask a question here but he do not give I a chance he be very much move i hate that wander jew say he or i should say i despise the thin film of a tradition from which he be construct there never be a wander jew there could not have be it be impossible to conceive of a human be send forth to wander in wretchedness forever moreover suppose there have be such a man what a poor modern creature he would be compare with I even now he would be less than two thousand year old you must excuse my perturbation but i be sure that during the whole of the christian era i have never tell my story to any one who do not in some way or other make a absurd or irritating reference to the wander jew i have often think and i have no doubt i be right that the ancient story of my adventure as kroudhr the vizier of the two-horned alexander combine with what i have relate in one century or another of my subsequent experience have give rise to the tradition of that very unpleasant jew of whom eugène sue and many other have make good use it be very natural that there should be legend about people who in some way or other be enable to live forever if ponce de leon and he companion have mysteriously disappear when in search of the fountain of youth there would be story now about rejuvenate spaniard wander about the earth and who would always continue to wander but the fountain of youth be not a desirable water-supply and a young person who should find such a pool would do well to wait until he have arrive at maturity before enter upon a existence of indefinite continuance but i must go on with my story at one time i make for myself a home and remain in it for many many year without make any change i become a sort of hermit and live in a rocky cave i allow my hair and beard to grow so that people really think i be get older and older at last i acquire the reputation of a prophet and be hold in veneration by a great many religious people of course i could not prophesy but as i have such a vast deal of experience i be able to predicate intelligently something about the future from my knowledge of the past i become famed as a wonderful seer and there be a great many curious story tell about I among my visitor at that time be mose he have hear of I and come to see what manner of man i be we become very well acquaint he be a man anxious to obtain information and he ask I question which embarrass I very much but i do not know that he suspect i have live beyond the ordinary span of life there be a good many tradition about this visit of mose some of which be extant at the present day but these of course be the result of what might be call cumulative imagination many of they be of moslem origin and the great arabian historian tabarus have relate some of they -lrb- illustration : mose ask embarrassing question -rrb- i learn a great deal while i live in this cave both from scholar and from nature but at last new generation arise who do not honor or even respect I and by some i be look upon as a fraudulent successor to the old prophet of whom they ancestor have tell they and so i think it prudent to leave my interest in this man 's extraordinary tissue of retrospection be increase and i feel that i must not doubt nor deny to do so would be to break the spell to close the book do it not sometimes fill you with horror to think that you must live forever i ask yes he answer that have happen to I but such feeling have long long pass away if you could have live as i have and have see the world change from what it be when i be young to what it be now you would understand how a man of my disposition a man of my overpowering love of knowledge love of discovery love of improvement love of progress of all kind would love to live in fact if i be now to be tell that at the end of five thousand year i must expire and cease it would fill I with gloom have see so much i expect more than most man be capable of comprehend and i shall see it all -- see the century unfold behold the wonderful thing of the future arise the very think of it fill I with inexpressible joy for a few moment he remain silent i could understand the state of he mind no matter how those mental condition have be bring about but you must not suppose he continue that this earthly immortality be without its pain its fear i may say its horror it be precisely on account of all these that i be now talk to you the knowledge that my life be always safe no matter in what peril i may be do not relieve I from anxiety and apprehension of evil it would be a curse to live if i be not in sound physical condition it would be a curse to live as a slave it would be a curse to live in a dungeon i have know vicissitude and hardship of every kind but i have be fortunate enough to preserve myself whole and unscathed in spite of the danger i have incur i often think from what a terrible fate i save my master alexander of the two horn if he have find the fountain he might have enjoy he power and dominion for a few generation then he would have be throw down cast out and even if he have escape misery which i can not bear to mention he never could have regain he high throne he would have be condemn to live forever in a station for which he be not fit it be very different with I my nature allow I to adapt myself to various condition and my habit of prudence prevent I from seek to occupy any position which may be dangerous to I by make I conspicuous and from which i could not easily retire when i believe the time have come to do so i have be almost everything i have even be a soldier but i have never take up arm except when oblige to do so and i have know as little of war as possible no weapon or missile could kill I but i have a great regard for my arm and leg i have be a ruler of man but i have tremble in my high estate for i fear the populace they could do everything except take my life therefore i make it a point to abdicate when the sky be clear in such case i set out on journey from which i never return i have also live the life of the lowly i have draw water and i have hew wood by the way that remind I of a little incident which may interest you i be employ in the east indium house at the time charle lamb be a clerk there it be not long after he have begin to contribute he elium essay to the ` london magazine ' i have read some of they and be interested in the man i meet he several time in the corridor or on the stairway and one day i be go up-stair carry a hod of coal as he be come down look up at he i make a misstep and come near drop a portion of my burden ` my good man ' say he with a queer smile ` if you would learn to carry you coal as well as you carry you age you would do well ' i do not remember what i say in reply but i know i think if charle lamb could be make aware of my real age he would abandon he elium work and devote himself to I it be a pity you do not tell he i suggest no reply my host he might have be interested but he could not have appreciate the situation even if i have tell he everything he would not really have know my age for he would not have believe I i might have find myself in a lunatic asylum i never see lamb again and very soon after that meeting i come to america -lrb- illustration : a encounter with charle lamb -rrb- ii there be two point about you story that i do not comprehend say i -lrb- and as i speak i could not help the thought that in reality i do not comprehend any of it -rrb- in the first place i do not see how you could live for a generation or two in one place and then go off to a entirely new locality i should think there be not enough inhabit spot in the world to accommodate you in such extensive change mr crowder smile i do not wonder you ask that question he say but in fact it be not always necessary for I to seek new place there be town in which i have take up my residence many time but as i arrive each time as a stranger from afar and as these sojourn be separate by many year there be no one to suppose I to be a person who have live in that place a century or two before then you never have you portrait paint i remark oh yes i have he reply toward the close of the thirteenth century i be live in florence be at that time marry to a lady of wealthy family and she insist upon my have my portrait paint by cimabue who as you know be the master of giotto after my wife 's death i depart from florence leave behind I the impression that i intend soon to return and i would have be glad to take the portrait with I but i have no opportunity it be in 1503 that i go back to florence and as soon as i could i visit the stately mansion where i have once live and there in the gallery still hang the portrait this be a unsatisfactory discovery for i might wish at some future time to settle again in florence and i have hope that the portrait have fade or that it have be destroy but cimabue paint too well and he work be then hold in high value without regard to he subject finding myself entirely alone in the gallery i cut that picture from its frame i conceal it under my cloak and when i reach my lodging i utterly destroy it i do not feel that i be commit any crime in do this i have order and pay for the painting and i feel that i have a right to do what i please with it i do not see how you can help have you picture take in these day i say even if you refuse to go to a photographer 's you can not escape the kodak people you have a striking presence oh i can not get away from photographer he answer i have have a number of picture take at the request of my wife and other people it be impossible to avoid it and that be one of the reason why i be now tell you my story what be the other point about which you wish to ask I i can not comprehend i answer how you should ever have find yourself poor and oblige to work i should say that a man who have live so long would have accumulate in one way or another immense wealth inexhaustible treasure -lrb- illustration : ' i cut that picture from its frame ' -rrb- oh yes say he with a smile monte cristo and all that sort of thing you notion be a perfectly natural one but i assure you mr randolph that it be found upon a mistake over and over and over again i have amass wealth but i have not be able to retain it permanently and often i have suffer for the very necessaries of life i have be hungry know that i could never starve the explanation of this state of thing be simple enough : i would trade i would speculate i would marry a heiress i would become rich for many year i would enjoy my possession then the time would come when people say : ` who own these house ' ` to whom belong this money in the bank ' ` these property be purchase in we great-grandfather ' time the account in the bank be open long before we oldest citizen be bear who be it who be make out lease and draw check ' i have employ all sort of subterfuge in order to retain my property but i have always find that to prove my continued identity i should have to acknowledge my immortality and in that case of course i should have be adjudge a lunatic and everything would have be take from I so i generally manage before the time arrive when it be actually necessary for I to do so to turn my property as far as possible into money and establish myself in some other place as a stranger but there be time when i be oblige to hurry from my home and take nothing with I then i know misery it be during the period of one of my greatest depression that i meet with a monk who be afterward st bruno and i join the carthusian monastery which he found in calabrium in the midst of they asceticism they seclusion and they silence i hope that i might be ask no question and need tell no lie i hope that i might be allow to live as long as i pleased without disturbance but i find no such immunity when bruno die and he successor have follow he into the grave it be propose that i should be the next prior but this would not have suit I at all i have employ all my time in engrossing book but the duty of a prior be not for I so i escape and go out into the world again as i sit and listen to mr crowder he story seem equally wonderful to I whether it be a plain statement of fact or the relation of a insane dream it be not a wild tale utter in the enthusiastic excitement of a disorder mind but it be a series of reminiscence tell quietly and calmly here a little there a little without chronological order each one touch upon as it happen to suggest itself from wonder i find myself every now and then believe : but whenever i realize the folly in which i be indulge myself i shake off my credulity and endeavor to listen with interest but without judgment for in this way only could i most thoroughly enjoy the strange narrative but my lapse into unconscious belief be frequent you have speak of marriage say i have you have many wife my host lean back in he chair and look up at the ceiling that be a subject he say of which i think as little as i can and yet i must speak to you of it it be right that i should do so i have be marry so often that i can scarcely count the wife i have have beautiful woman good woman some of they woman to whom i would have give immortality have i be able but they die and die and die and here be one of the great drawback of live forever yet it be not always the death of my wife which sadden I the most it be they power of grow old i would marry a young woman beautiful charming you need not be surprise that i be able to do this for in all age woman have be in the habit of disregard the year of man and i have always have a youthful spirit i think it be daudet who say that the most dangerous lover be the man of fifty-three i would live happily with a wife she would gradually grow to be the same age as myself and then she would become older and older and i do not as i have say there be woman to whom i would have give immortality if i could but i will add that there have be time when i would have give up my own immortality to be able to pass gently into old age with a beloved wife you will want to know if i have have descendant they exist by the thousand but if you ask I where they be i must tell you that i do not know i now have but one child a little girl who be asleep up-stair i have gather around I family of son and daughter they have grow up married and my grandchild have sit upon my knee sometimes at long interval i have know great-grandchild but when my son and daughter have grow gray and go to they grave i have withdraw myself from the younger people -- some of whom be not acquaint with I other even have never hear of I -- and then by the next generation the old ancestor if remember at all be connect only with the distant past and so family after family have melt into the great mass of human being and be as completely lose as though they be water throw into the sea i have always be fond of beautiful woman and as you have meet mr crowder you know that my disposition have not change sarah the wife of abraham be consider a woman of great beauty in she day and the fame of she charm continue but i assure you that if she live now she attraction would not have give she husband so much trouble i see a good deal of sarah when i visit abraham with my master alexander and i have see many more beautiful woman since that time hagar be a fine woman but she be too dark and she face have a anxious expression which interfere with she beauty be hagar really the wife of abraham i ask as the mussulman say and be ishmael consider he heir when i see they my host continue the two woman seem as friendly as sister and isaac be not yet bear at that time it be consider of course that ishmael be abraham 's heir certainly he be a much finer man than isaac with whom i become acquaint a long time afterward there be some very beautiful woman at the court of solomon one of these be balkis the famous queen of sheba do you ever meet cleopatra i interrupted i never see she be the answer but from what i have hear i do not think i should have care for she if i have see she asleep what might have happen have i see she awake be quite another matter i have notice that woman grow more beautiful as the world grow older and man grow taller and better develop you would consider I i think a man of average size but i tell you that in my early life i be exceptionally tall and i have no doubt it be my stature and presence to which i largely owe my preferment at the court of alexander i be live in spain toward the close of the tenth century when i marry the daughter of a arabian physician who be a wonderfully beautiful woman she be not dark like the ordinary moorish woman in feature and form she surpass any creation of the greek sculptor and i have be in many of they workshop and have see they model this lady live longer than any other wife i have she live so long in fact that when we leave cordova we both think it well that she should pass as my mother she be one of the few wife to whom i tell my story it do not shock she for she believe she father to be a miracle-worker and she have faith in many strange thing she great desire be to live as long as i should and i think she believe that this might happen she die at the age of one hundred and fifteen and be lively and animated to the very last my first american wife be a fine woman too she be a french creole and die fifteen year ago we have no child -lrb- illustration : ` when we leave cordova ' -rrb- it strike I i say suddenly that you must understand a great many language -- you speak so much of live with people of different nation it would be impossible he answer unless i be void of ordinary intelligence to live as long as i have and not become a general linguist of course i have to learn the language of the country i visit and as i be always a student it delight I to do so in fact i not only study but i write when the alexandrian library be destroy fourteen of my book be burn when i be in italy with my first american wife i visit the museum at naple and in the room where the expert be unroll the papyrus find in pompeius i look over the shoulder of one of they and to my amazement find that one of the roll be a account-book of my own i have be a broker in pompeius and these be the record of money i have loan on interest to various merchant and tradespeople i be always fond of deal in money and at present i be a broker in wall street during the first crusade i be a banker in genoa and lend large sum to the noble knight who be set forth for jerusalem -lrb- illustration : ' i have be a broker in pompeius ' -rrb- -lrb- illustration : ' i lend large sum to the noble knight ' -rrb- be much of it repay i ask most of it the loan be almost always secure by good property as i look back upon the vast panorama of my life my host continue after a pause i most pleasantly recall my various intimacy with learn man and my own study and research but in the great company of man of knowledge whom i have know there be not one in whom i be so much interested as in king solomon i visit he court because i greatly wish to know a man who know so much it be not difficult to obtain access to he for i come as a stranger from ethiopium to the east of ethiopium to the east of the red sea and the king be always anxious to see intelligent people from foreign part i be able to tell he a good deal which he do not know and he become fond of my society i find solomon a very well-informed man he have not read and study book as much as i have and he have not have my advantage of direct intercourse with learn man but he be a most earnest and indefatigable student of nature i believe he know more about natural history than any human be then live or who have precede he whenever it be possible for he to do so he study animal nature from the living model and all the beast bird and fish which it be possible for he to obtain alive be quarter in the grounds of he palace in a certain way he be a animal-tamer you may well imagine that this great king 's wonderful possession as well as the man himself be the source of continual delight to I the time-honored story of solomon 's carpet on which he mount and be waft away to any place with he retinue have a good deal of foundation in fact for solomon be a exceedingly ingenious man and not only construct parachute by which people could safely descend from great height but he make some attempt in the direction of ballooning i have see small bag of thin silk cover with a fine varnish make of gum to render they air-tight which be inflate with hot air and properly ballast rise high above the earth and be waft out of sight by the wind many people suppose that in the course of time solomon would be able to travel through the air and from this idea be derive the tradition that he really do so another of the interesting legend regard king solomon concern he dominion over the jinn these people of whom so much have be write and hand down by word of mouth and who be suppose by subsequent generation to be a race of servile demon be in reality savage native of surround country who be force by the king to work on he great building and other enterprise and who occupy very much the position of the coolie of the present day but that story of the dead solomon and the jinn who be at work on the temple give a good idea of one of the most important characteristic of this great ruler he be a man who give personal attention to all he affair and be in the habit of oversee the laborer on he public work do you remember the story to which i refer i be oblige to say that i do not think i have ever hear it the story run thus say my host : the jinn be at work build the temple and solomon accord to he custom overlook they daily at the time when the temple be nearly complete solomon feel that he strength be pass from he and that he would not have much longer to live this greatly troubled he for he know that when the jinn should find that he watchful eye would be no more upon they they would rebel and refuse to work and the temple would not be finish during he reign therefore as the story run he come one day into the temple and hope that he might be enable to remain there until the great edifice should be finish he stand lean on he staff and the jinn when they behold they master continue to work and work and work when night come solomon still remain standing in he accustomed place and the jinn work on afraid to cease they toil for a moment -lrb- illustration : solomon and the jinn -rrb- stand thus solomon die but the jinn do not know it and they toil and labor continue by night and by day now accord to the tradition a little white ant one of the kind which devour wood come up out of the earth on the very day on which solomon die and begin to gnaw the inside of he staff she gnaw a little every day until at last the staff become hollow from one end to the other and on the day when she finish she work the work of the jinn be also finish then the staff crumble and the dead solomon fall face foremost to the earth the jinn perceive that they have be slave day and night for a master who be dead flee away with yell of rage and vexation but the glorious temple be finish and king solomon 's work be do tabarus tell this story and it be also find in the koran but the origin of it be nothing more than the well-known custom of solomon to exercise personal supervision over those who be work for he i be the person from whom solomon first hear of the queen of sheba i have live in she capital city for several year and she have summon I before she and have inquire about the place i have visit and the thing i have see what i say about this wonderful woman and the admirable administration of she empire interested solomon very much and he be never tire of hearing I talk about she at one time i believe he think of send I as a ambassador to she but afterward give up this notion as i do not possess the rank or position which would have qualify I to represent he and he court so he send a suitable delegation and after a great deal of negotiation and diplomatic by-play the queen actually determine to come to see solomon soon after she arrival with she great retinue she see I and immediately recognize I and the first thing she say to I be that she perceive i have grow a good deal older than when i have be live in she domain this delighted I for before come to jerusalem i have allow my hair and beard to grow and have dispense with as much as possible of my ordinary erect mien and lightness of step for i be very much afraid if i be not careful that the wise king would find out that there be something irregular in my longevity and a old man may continue to look old much longer than a middle-aged man can continue to appear middle-aged it be a great advantage to I to find myself admit to a certain intimacy with both the king and he visitor the queen as i be a subject of neither of they they seem to think this circumstance allow a little more familiarity than otherwise they would have show besides my age have a great deal to do with the freedom with which they speak to I each of they seem anxious to know everything i could tell about the other and i would sometimes be subject to embarrassing question there be a great deal of extravagance and perversion in the historical and traditional account of the trick which these two royal personage play upon each other most of these old story be too silly to repeat but some of they have foundation in fact they tell a tale of how the queen set five hundred boy and five hundred girl before the king all the girl dress as boy and all the boy dress as girl and then she ask he as he be such a wise man immediately to distinguish those of one sex from those of the other solomon do not hesitate a moment but order basin of water to be bring he command the young people to wash they hand thereupon he watch they closely and as the boy wash only they hand while the girl roll up they sleeve and wash they arm as well as they hand solomon be able without any trouble to pick out the one from the other now something of this kind really happen but there be only ten boy and ten girl but in the course of age the story grow and the whole thing be make absurd for there never be a king in the world nor would there be likely to be one who could have a thousand basin ready immediately to put before a company who wish to wash they hand but the result of this scheme convince the queen that solomon be a man of the deepest insight into the manners and custom of human being as well as those of animal bird and fish but there be a incident with which i be personally connect which be know at the time to very few people and be never publicly related the beautiful queen desire above all other thing to know whether solomon hold she in such high esteem because she be a mighty queen or on account of she personal attraction and in order to discover the truth in regard to this question she devise a little scheme to which she make I a party there be a young woman in she train of surpass beauty whose name be liridi and the queen be sure that solomon have never see she for it be she custom to keep she most beautiful attendant in the background this maiden the queen cause to be dress in the richest and most become robe and adorn she besides with jewel and golden ornament which set off she beauty in a amazing manner then have make many inquiry of I in regard to the habit of solomon she order liridus to walk alone in one of the broad path of the royal garden at the time when the king be wont to stroll there by himself the queen wish to find out whether this charming apparition would cause the king to forget she for a time and she order I to be in the garden and so arrange my ramble that i could without be observe notice what happen when the king should meet liridus i be on hand before the appoint time and when i see the girl walk slowly up the shaded avenue i feel oblige to go to she and tell she that she be too soon and that she must not meet solomon near the palace as i speak to she i be amaze at she wonderful beauty and i do not believe it possible that the king could gaze upon she without such emotion as would make he forget for the moment every other woman in the world the queen have purposely make a appointment with he for the same hour so that if he do not come she would know what be detain he at length solomon appear at the far end of the avenue and liridus begin again she pensive stroll when the king reach she she retire to one side she head bow as if she have not expect to meet royalty in this secluded spot king solomon be deep in think as he walk but when he come near the maiden he raise he eye and suddenly stop i be near by behind some shrubbery and it be plain enough to I that he be dazzle by this lovely apparition he ask she who she be and when she have tell he he gaze at she with still greater attention then suddenly he laugh aloud ` go tell the queen ' say he ` that she have miss she mark the arrow which be adorn with golden trappings and precious stone can not fly aright ' then he go on still laugh to himself in the evening he tell I about this incident and say that if the maiden have be array in the simple robe which become she station he would have suspect nothing and would probably have stop to converse with she so long that he would have fail to keep he appointment with he royal guest -lrb- illustration : ` go tell the queen ' -rrb- the queen be very much annoyed at the ill success of she little artifice but it be not long after this that she and the king discover they true feeling for each other and they be soon marry the wedding be a grand one -- grander than tradition relate grander than the modern mind can easily comprehend when they go to the palace to sit for the first time in state before the vast assembly of dignitary and courtier the queen find beside the throne of solomon she own throne which he have cause to be bring from sheba in time for this occasion this incident i think affect she more agreeably than anything else that happen great be the festivity honor and dignity be bestow on every hand and i might have come in for some substantial benefit have it not be that i commit a great blunder i have fall in love with the beautiful liridus and as the queen seem so gracious and kind to everybody i make bold to go to she and ask that she would allow I to marry she charming handmaiden but to my surprise this request anger the queen she tell I that such a old man as myself ought to be ashamed to take a young girl to wife that she be oppose to such marriage and that in fact i ought to be punish for even mention the subject i retire in disgrace and very soon afterward i leave jerusalem for i have find by varied experience that the displeasure of ruler be a unhealthful atmosphere in which to live however the queen of sheba do not get altogether the better of I as you know king solomon and he royal wife do not reign together very long they rule over two great kingdom each of which require the presence of its sovereign so queen balkis soon go back to sheba with more wealth more soldier more camel horse and grand surroundings of every kind than she have bring with she she carry in she baggage-train she royal throne but she do not take with she the beautiful liridus that lady have be give in marriage to a officer in solomon 's army and thirty year afterward in the land of asshur where she father be station i marry the youngest daughter of liridus the latter be then dead but my wife with whom i live happily for many year in phoenicium be quite as beautiful i be greatly incline at the time to send a courier with a letter to the queen of sheba inform she of what have happen but i be afraid she be then a elderly woman and i be inform that age have actually sharpen she wit so that if i have incense she and give she reason to suspect the truth about my unnatural age i believe there be no known country in which i could have conceal myself from she emissary there be many many incident which crowd upon my memory continue my host but -- and as he speak he pull out he watch my conscience he exclaim it be twenty minute past three i should be ashamed of myself mr randolph for have keep you up so long we both rise to we foot and i be about to say something polite suit to the occasion but he give I no chance i feel i must talk to you he say speak very rapidly i have discover you to be a man of appreciation -- a man who should hear my story i have feel for some year that it would soon become impossible for I to conceal my experience from my fellow-men i believe mankind have now reach a stage of enlightenment -- at least in this country -- when the person who make strange discovery which can not be explain and the person who announce fact which can not be comprehend by the human mind need not fear to be punish as a sorcerer or thrust into a cell as a lunatic i may be mistake in regard to this latter point but i think i be right in any case i do not wish to live much longer as i have be live as i must live on with generation after generation rise up about I i want those generation to know before they depart from this earth that i be a person who do not die i be tire of deception i be tire of leave the place where i have live long and be know and arrive in other place where i be a stranger and where i must begin my life again i do not wish to be in a hurry to make my revelation to the world at large i do not wish to startle people without be able to show they proof of what i say i wish to speak only to person who be worthy to hear my story and i have begin with you i do not want you to believe I until you be quite ready to do so think over what i have say consider it carefully and make up you mind slowly you be a young man in good health and you will in all probability live long enough to assure yourself of the truth or falsity of what i have tell you about my indefinite longevity i should be glad to relate my story to scientific man to physician to student but as i have say we shall wait for that in the meantime you may if you choose write down what i have tell you or as much of it as you remember i have no write record of my past life long long ago i make such but i destroy they for i know not what evil they might bring upon I be they discover but you may write the little i have tell you and when you feel that the time have come you may give it to the world and now we must retire it be wicked to keep you out of you bed any longer one word say i do you intend now to tell you wife yes he answer i shall tell she tomorrow have repose confidence in you it would be treat she shamefully if i should withhold that confidence from she she have often say to I that i do not look a day older than when i marry she i want she now to know that i need never look a day older i shall counterfeit old age no more i do not sleep well during what be leave of the night for my mind go travel backward and forward through the age the next morning at breakfast mr crowder appear in he ordinary good spirit but he wife be very quiet she be pale and occasionally i think i saw sign of trouble on she usually placid brow i feel sure that he have tell she he story as i look at she i could not prevent myself from seriously wonder that a man who have see abraham and sarah and have be personally acquaint with the queen of sheba should now be marry to a quaker lady from north sixteenth street philadelphium after breakfast she find a opportunity of speak to I privately do you believe she ask very hurriedly what my husband tell you last night -- the story of he earthly immortality i really do not know i answer whether i believe it or not my reason assure I that it be impossible and yet there be in mr crowder 's manner so much sincerity so much -- contrary to she usual habit i be sure she interrupt I excuse I she say but i must speak while i have the chance you must believe what my husband have say to you he have tell I everything and i know that it be impossible for he to tell a lie i have not yet arrange my idea in regard to this wonderful revelation but i believe if the time should ever come when i shall know i should not believe that will be another matter but he be my husband i know he i trust he will you not do the same i will do it i exclaimed until the time come when i shall know that i can not possibly do so she give I she hand and i shake it heartily -lrb- illustration : she give I she hand and i shake it heartily -rrb- iii about four month after my first acquaintance with mr and mr crowder i find myself again in new york and when i call at the house of my friend i receive from they a most earnest invitation to take up my abode with they during my stay in the city of course this invitation be eagerly accept for not only be the crowder house a home of the most charming hospitality but my interest in the extraordinary man who be evidently so glad to be my host be such that not one day have pass since i last see he in which i do not think of he and consider he marvelous statement from every point of view which my judgment be capable of command i find mr crowder unchanged in appearance and manner and he wife be the same charming young woman i have know but there be nothing surprising in this people generally do not change very much in four month and yet in talk to mr crowder i could not prevent myself from earnestly scan he feature to see if he have grow any older he notice this and laugh heartily it be natural enough he say that you should wish to assure yourself that there be a good foundation to you belief in what i have tell you but you be in too great a hurry : you must wait some year for that sort of proof one way or the other but i believe that you do believe in I and i be not in the least disturb by the way you look at I after dinner on the first day of my visit when we be smoke together i ask mr crowder if he would not continue the recital of he experience which be of such absorb interest to I that sometimes i find they occupy my mind to a extent which exclude the consideration of everything relate to myself and the present time from one point of view he say that would be a bad thing for you : but i do not look at it in that way in fact i hope you may become my biographer i will furnish you with material enough and you can arrange it and put it in shape that be if in the course of a few year you consider that in do what i ask of you you will be write the true life of a man and not a collection of fanciful story so i hope you may find that you have not lose you time when think so much of a man of the past now there be no doubt that i do most thoroughly believe in crowder i have argue with myself against this belief to the utmost extent of my ability and i have now give up the effort if i should disbelieve he i would deprive myself of one of the most precious privilege of my existence and i do not intend to do so until i find myself absolutely force to admit that i be mistaken time would settle all this and all that i have to do now be to listen enjoy and be thankful for the opportunity i be not go to tell any story now he say for my wife have not overcome she dislike to tobacco smoke and she have insist that she shall be one of my hearer when i tell story of my past life to you but i can tell you this my friend : she will believe every word i say there can be no possible doubt of that i have tell she a good many thing since i see you last and she faith in I be a joy unspeakable of course i be delighted to hear that this charming lady be to be my fellow-auditor and say so i often think of you two say mr crowder contemplatively lean back in he arm-chair i think of you together but i be bind to say that the thought be not altogether pleasant i show my amazement at this remark it can not be help he say it can not be help it be one of the thing i have to suffer i have suffer it over and over again thousand of time but i never get use to it here you be two young people young enough to be my child : one be my wife the other i be proud to say my best friend you be the only person in the world who know my story you have faith in I and the thought of that faith be the greatest pleasure of my life year by year you two will grow older year by year you will more nearly approach my own age and become accord to the ordinary opinion of the world more suitable companion for I then you will reach my age we shall be three gray-haired friend then will come the saddening time the mournful day you two will grow older and older and i shall remain where i be -- always fifty-three then you will grow to be elderly -- elderly people at last aged people if you live long enough i shall look up to you as i would to my parent this be a state of thing i have never contemplate i could scarcely appreciate it of course he continue i wish you both to live long but do not you see how it affect I but enough of that here come mr crowder and with she all subject must be pleasant one i think thee must buy some short cigar she say just put she head inside the door to smoke after dinner if large one be necessary they can be smoke after i go to bed i be get very impatient for now that mr randolph be here i believe that thee be go to be unusually interesting we arise immediately and join mr crowder in the library this lady 's use of the plain speech customary with quaker be very pleasant to I i have have but little acquaintance with it and at first its independence of grammatical rule strike upon I unpleasantly but i soon begin to enjoy mr crowder 's speech when she be address she husband much more than i do the remark she make to I the latter be always couch in the most correct english there be a sweetness about she thee which have the quality of gentle music and when she use the word thy it be pronounce so much like thee that i could scarcely perceive the difference to she husband and child she always use the quaker speech of the present day and as i do not like be set aside in this way i say to she that i hope there be no rule of the society of friend which would compel she to make a change in she form of speech when she address I if thee like she say with a smile thee be welcome to all the plain speech thee want and after that when she speak to I she do not turn I out among the world 's people now you know say mr crowder that i be not go to play the part of a historian that sort of discourse would bear I and it would bear you if there be any kind of thing that you would like to hear about all you have to do be to ask I and if you do not care to do this i will tell you whatever come up in my memory without any regard to chronology or geography just as i talk to you before if i be to begin at the beginning and go straight along even if i skip ever so much the story would -- it would be a great deal too long i be sure that mr crowder and i both feel what he do not wish to say -- that we be not likely to live to hear it all there be a great many thing i should like to ask thee say mr crowder speak quickly as if to change the subject of she thought but i believe i have forget most of they but here be something i should like to know -- that be she say turn to I if thee have not anything in thy mind which thee wish to ask about i notice that she pronounce thy very distinctly a little bit of grammatical conscience probably obtrude itself of course i have nothing to ask and she put she question : what _ do _ thee do in the dark age crowder laugh that be a big question say he and the only answer i can give you in a general way be that there be so many thing that i be not able to do or do not dare to do that i look upon those century as the most disagreeable part of my whole life but you must not suppose that everybody feel as i do a great many of the people by whom i be surround at that doleful period appear to be happier and better satisfied with they circumstance than any i have know before or after there be little ambition less responsibility and if the poor and weak suffer from the rapacity and violence of the rich and strong they accept they misfortune as if they be something they be bind to expect such as bad weather i be not go to talk history and there be one thing that you question remind I of during that portion of the middle age which be designate as dark i employ myself in a great many different way : i be laborer sailor teacher and i can not tell you what besides but more frequently than anything else i be a teacher thee must have be a angel of light mr crowder remark no say he a angel of light would have be very conspicuous in those day i do not pose for such a part in fact if i have not succeed in appear like a partial ignoramus i should have be oblige to go into a monastery for in those day the monk be the only people who know anything they expect to do all the teaching that be do but for all that a few scholar crop up now and then and here and there who do not care to have monk for master and by instruct these in a very modest quiet way i frequently manage to make a living i should think i say that at any time and in any period you would have be a person of importance with you experience and knowledge of man mr crowder shake he head no say he not so to make myself of importance in that time i must have be a soldier and the profession of arm you know be one i have always avoid a man who can not be kill should take care that he be not wound i be so glad that thee do take care ejaculate mr crowder but even i can not see how thee keep out of fight in those disorderly time i do not keep out of it altogether but in every possible way i try to do so and for the most part succeed whenever i be likely to be involve in military operation i let my hair and beard grow and the white-haired old man be usually exempt i have have far more experience in keep out of battle than any other human being have have in the art of win they but what you two want be a story and i will give you one during some of the earlier year of the seventh century i be live in ravenna and there i have three or four scholar whom i teach occasionally i do not dare to keep a regular school with fixed hour and all that but while i be not work at my trade which be then that of a mason i give lesson to some young people in the neighborhood sometimes i teach in the evening sometimes in bad weather when we do not work out of door no one of my scholar show any intelligence except a girl about eighteen year old she father i think be a professional robber for he family live very well and he be generally absent from home at the head of a little band of desperate fellow of whom there be a great many in that region this girl whose name be rina have a earnest desire for knowledge and show a great capacity for imbibe it and retain it in fact i believe she be the most intelligent person in that region be she pretty ask mrs crowder yes reply she husband she be very good-looking i be so interested in she desire for knowledge that i teach she a great deal more than i would have dare to teach anybody else and the more i teach the more she want to learn i soon become very much concerned about rina some man of the neighborhood old or young would be sure to marry she before very long and then there would be a end of the development of what i consider the brightest intellect of the day so to keep that from happen to she thee marry she thyself ask mrs crowder she husband smile yes that be what i do you know he say address I that i believe that mr crowder take more interest in my marriage than in anything else i have do in the course of my career certainly i do she say with a little flush of course thee have to be marry and it be natural enough that i should want to know whom thee marry and all about it well say mr crowder we must get on with this a priest with whom i be acquaint married we and we immediately flee from ravenna after a year or two of wander through benighted country where even king and ruler could not write they name and where reading seem to be a lost art except in the monastery we make up we mind if possible we would go from darkness into light and so we set out on a journey to china at this statement mr crowder and i look surprised i do not wonder you open you eye say he it must seem odd to you unless you be very familiar with the history of the period that we should go from europe to china in search of enlightenment and civilization but that be what we do and we find what we look for as the pope have send a envoy to china and as some nestorian missionary have go there i believe that we could go this journey to the chinese province of nan-hae occupy the greater part of five year but to I personally that be of no account for i have time enough although we pass through all sort of hardship and danger my wife be greatly interested in the strange thing and people she meet sometimes we travel by water sometimes on horse and ass and very often we walk during the last part of the journey we join a caravan which go through central asia at that time china be rule by a woman the empress woo for a long time back there have be a period of great intellectual activity in china literature and the art flourish and while the great personage of europe do not know how to write these people be print from wooden block the empress be a remarkable woman she have be one of the widow of a monarch and when he son succeed to the throne she marry he she have great ambition and great ability she put down she enemy and she put herself forward she take she husband 's place in all the imperial consultation and decision and very soon set he aside and for forty year be actual ruler of the empire she be a great woman this empress woo very little happen in she dominion that she do not know and when two wanderer arrive from the far and unknown west she send for I and my wife to appear before she at the palace we be receive with much favor for we could do she no possible harm and she be very eager for knowledge my wife be a object of great curiosity to she as she be so different from the chinese woman but as poor rina could never acquire a word of the language of the country the empress soon cease to take interest in she as i be always very good at pick up language she have I at the palace a great deal ask all sort of question about the western country and people i be also able to tell she much about bygone age which information she think of course i have acquire by reading -lrb- illustration : ` ask all sort of question ' -rrb- one day the empress ask I about the marriage custom in the west and want to know how many wife a man could have in we country she seem to be so much in earnest as she speak that i be frightened i do not know what to answer but fortunately one of she general be announce and she do not press the question as i be leave the palace one of the officer of the court take I aside and tell I that the empress be think of marry I and that i have better put on some fine clothes when i come again this be terrible news but i be bind to tell my wife and we sit up all night talk about it to escape from that region would have be impossible we be oblige to stay and face the inevitable whatever it might be the question which rina and i have to decide be a very simple one but terribly difficult for all that if i should tell the empress that man of my country believe that it be right to have but one wife rina would quickly be dispose of so she have to decide whether she would prefer to die so that i might marry the empress or to preserve she life and lose she undivided possession of a husband i know what i would have do say mr crowder she eye very bright i would have let she kill I i would never have consent for thee to marry the wretch that would have please she say mr crowder for she would have have I all the same and you would have be out of the way then i would not have die say the little quakeress almost fiercely i would not have do anything to please she but i do not know what do thee and thy wife do we talk and talk and talk say mr crowder and at last i persuade she to live that be to say not to make herself a obstacle to the wish of the empress it be a terrible trial but she consent the more insignificant she become i tell she the greater she chance of safety the next day the empress send for I as i be sure she would do ` you do not tell I ' she say ` how many wife you man have ' ` that all depend upon the will of we sovereign ' i reply ` in matrimonial affair we do as we be command when we have no command from the throne we circumstance regulate the matter ' thee do tell a dreadful lie while thee be about it say mr crowder but i suppose thee have to you be right there say she husband and my answer please the empress ` that be what i like ' she say ` the monarch should settle all these matter i hope some day to settle they in this country ' then without any hesitation or preface she announce she intention of marry I ' i greatly need ' she say ' a learn man for a imperial consort my present husband know nothing i never trust he with any affair of state but i have never ask you anything to which you do not give I a satisfactory answer ' now my dear say mr crowder you see the reward of vanity if i have pretend to be a fool instead of aspire to be a philosopher and a historian i should never have attract the interest of the queen and do thee marry she ask he wife i do so pity poor rina i 'll tell you how it turn out he continue after press I a good deal the empress say : ' i have intend to marry you in a few day or as soon as the preparation could be make but i have now postpone that ceremony i find that military affair must occupy I for some time and it would be better for I at present to marry one of my general a military man be what the country need but i shall want a counselor of you sort very soon so you must hold yourself ready to marry I whenever i shall notify you ' my instinct prompt I to ask she what the imperial general might be apt to think about the increase in she matrimonial force but i be wise enough to hold my tongue when the general should cease to be of use to she i know very well that he would not be likely to offer opposition to anything on earth how glad i be ejaculate mr crowder that thee do not ask any question and that thee consent to everything the wicked creature say so be i he reply and i be glad to get out of that palace which i never enter again from that day i begin to grow old as fast as i could my hair and beard become very long i eat but little i stoop more and more each day and walk with a staff i begin to be very forgetful when people ask I question about a year afterward the queen see I i be in the crowd near the palace where i have purposely go that i might be see she look at I but give no sign that she recognize I the next day a officer come to I and roughly tell I that the empress have no use for dotard in she dominion and that the sooner i go away the better for I i afterward hear that the execution of two stranger have be order but that a certain superstition in the mind of the empress have prevent this she have hear through person who have meet the nestorian that people of we country be protect in some strange manner which she do not understand -lrb- illustration : ` and roughly tell I ' -rrb- rina and i could not leave china for i have now no money but we go to a distant province where i live for more than ten year pass as a chinaman and rina -- poor rina ask mrs crowder she soon die say she husband she be in a state of fear nearly all the time she could not speak the language and it may be say that she give up she life in she pursuit of knowledge in this respect she be as wonderful a woman as be the empress woo and a thousand time better say mr crowder earnestly and then then say she husband i marry a chinese woman what exclaim mr crowder she eye almost round yes my dear it be a great deal safer for I to be marry and to become as nearly as possible like the people by whom i be surround but thee do not have several wife do thee ask mrs crowder oh no he answer i be too poor for anything of that kind to be expect of I when a opportunity come to join a caravan and get away i take my chinese wife with I and eventually reach arabia there we stay for a long time for i find it impossible to prosecute my journey eventually however we reach the island of malta where my wife live to be over seventy travel hardship and danger seem to agree with she she never speak any language but she own and as she be of a quiet disposition and take no interest in the thing she see she generally pass as a imbecile but she be the first chinese woman who ever visit europe i guess thee be very sorry thee bring she before thee get through with she i do not approve of that matrimonial alliance at all say mr crowder during this and succeed evening of narration it must not be suppose i sit silent make no remark upon what i hear but in fact what i say be of hardly any importance and certainly not worth introduce into this account of mr crowder 's experience but the effect of he word upon mr crowder as show both by the play of she feature and she frequent question and exclamation interested I almost as much as the statement of my host i have previously know she as the gentlest the sweetest and the most attractive of my female acquaintance but now i find she to be a woman of keen intellect and quick appreciation she remark which be very frequent and which i shall not always record be like seasoning and spice to the narrative of mr crowder never before have a wife hear such story from a husband and there never could have be a woman who would have hear they with such religious faith naturally she show I a most friendly confidence the fact that we be both the loyal disciple of one master be a bond between we he be so much older than either of we and he regard we sometimes with what look so much like parental affection that it would not have be surprising if person not believer as we be should have entertain the idea that in course of time he would pass away and that we two should be leave to comfort each other as well as we might but i who have hear my friend speak of the come year could not forget the picture he have draw of two aged and feeble people look up to in love and veneration by a fresh and hearty man of fifty-three thee never seem to have any trouble in get marry say mr crowder do thee ever stay a old bachelor any length of time crowder laugh such question from he wife amuse he very much i be think of change the subject say he and be about to tell you something which have not anything to do with wife and marriage i think you might be tire of that sort of thing not at all say she quickly that be just what i want to hear very well answer he i will give you a little instance of one of my failure in love-making it be long before my visit to empress woo in fact it be about eleven hundred year before christ and i be live in syrium where i be teach school in the little town of timnath i become very much interested in one of the girl of my class she be a good deal older than any of the other in fact she be a young woman she have a bright mind and be eager to learn and i naturally become interested in she and in the course of time she please I so much that i determine to marry she it seem thee be in the habit of marry thy scholar say mr crowder there be nothing very strange in that he reply a schoolmaster usually become very well acquaint with some of he scholar and if a girl please he very much it be not surprising that he should prefer to marry she or at least to try to than to go out among comparative stranger to look for a wife if i have be in thy place say mr crowder reflectively sometimes i would have enjoy a long rest of bachelordom it would have be a variety oh i have have variety of that kind say he for many succeed decade i have be widower or bachelor whichever you choose to call it as i be say this girl pleased I very much she be good-looking bright and witty and she dark flash eye win she a great deal of attention from the young man of the place but she would not have anything to do with they they could not boast much in regard to intelligence or education nor be any of they in very good circumstance and so in spite of my year she seem to take very kindly to I and i make up my mind i would marry she the approach autumn i have some money and there be a house with a piece of land for sale near the town this i plan to buy and to settle down as a agriculturist i be tire of school-teaching no wonder say mr crowder as thee intend to take out of it its principal attraction we be walk one evening over the field talk of astronomy in which she take a great interest when we see a man approach who be evidently a stranger he be a fellow of medium height but he give the impression of great size and vigor as he come nearer stride over the rough place and pay no attention to path i see that he be very broad-shouldered with a heavy body and thick neck he leg be probably of average size but they look somewhat small in comparison with he body and he long arm which swing by he side as he walk he be a young man bushy-beard with bright and observant eye as he pass we he look very hard at my companion and i be sorry to say she turn she head and gaze steadfastly at he -lrb- illustration : ` she turn she head ' -rrb- ` that be a fine figure of a man ' she say ` he look strong enough for anything ' i do not encourage she admiration ` he might be make useful on a farm ' i say ` if he leg be as big as the rest of he he could draw a plow as well as a ox ' she make no answer to this but she interest in astronomy seem to decrease and she soon propose that we should turn back to the town on the way we meet the stranger again and this time he stop and ask we some question about the country and the neighborhood all the time we be talk he and my scholar be look at each other and each of they seem entirely satisfy with the survey the next day the girl be very inattentive at school and in the afternoon when i hope to take a walk with she i could not find she and go out by myself before long i see she sit under a tree talk to the stranger of yesterday she be a regular flirt say mr crowder apparently she be reply she husband but although i might have excuse she consider how much better suit this stranger be to she in point of year at least i be not willing to withdraw and leave she to another especially as he might be a person entirely unworthy of she i do not disturb they but i go back to the town and make some inquiry about the stranger i find that he be a danite and live with he parent in zorah and that he name be samson i also learn that he family be possess of considerable means it soon become plain that it would not be easy for I to carry out my marriage plan and settle down among my vine and fig-tree samson go home tell he parent of he desire to marry this girl and in the course of time they all come down to timnath and make regular matrimonial proposition to she parent be this the great samson who tear lion apart and throw down temple ask mrs crowder in amazement the very man be the reply and he be the most formidable rival i ever have in that sort of affair the proper thing for I to do accord to the custom of the time would have be to take he aside as soon as i find that he be pay attention to my sweetheart and fight he but the more i look at he and he peculiar proportion the more i be convince that he be not a man with whom i want to fight i should think not say mr crowder how glad i be thee never touch he the result might not have be disastrous to I he say for although i have always avoid military matter as much as possible i be probably better verse in the use of a sword than he be but i do not care to kill he and from what i hear of he afterward i be sure that if he have ever get those long arm around I i should have be a mass of broken bone so take everything into consideration i give up my plan to marry this girl of timnath and i be afterward very glad i do so for she prove a tricky creature and enter into a conspiracy to deceive she husband actually weep before he seven day in order to worm out of he the secret of he strength i suppose thee never meet delilah ask mrs crowder oh no he answer before samson be marry i leave that part of the world and i do not make the acquaintance of the attractive young person who be so successful in the grand competition of discover the source of samson 's strength in fact it be nearly a hundred year after that before i hear of those great exploit of samson which have give he such widespread fame i be glad thee never meet delilah say mr crowder reflectively for thee too be possess of a great secret and she might have gain it from thee iv i think thee be in great danger continue mr crowder in that samson business it make I shudder to think even now of what might have happen to thee there be not much danger say he for all i have to do be to withdraw and there be a end to the matter i have often and often be in greater danger than that for instance i be in the army of xerx compel to enter it simply because i happen to be in persium my sympathy be entirely with the greek my age do not protect I at all everybody who in any way could be make useful be drag into that army it be know that i have a knowledge of engineering and survey and i be take into the army to help build bridge and lay out camp here it be that i see the curious method of count the soldier which be adopt by the officer of xerxes 's army as you may have read ten thousand man be collect on a plain and make to stand close together in a mass nearly circular in shape then a strong fence with a wide gate to the west and another to the east be build around they and i be engage in the construct and strengthen of this fence when the fence be finish the man be order to march out of the inclosure and other soldier march in until it be again entirely fill this process be repeat until the whole army have be in the inclosure thus they get rid of the labor of counting -- measure the army instead of enumerate it but the result be not accurate i be greatly interested in the matter and on three occasion i stand at the exit gate as the soldier be come out and count they and the number never amount to ten thousand one counting show less than seven thousand -- the man do not pack themselves together as closely as they be pack the first time -- so i be confident that xerxes 's army be not so large as it be report to be i become so much interested in the operation and constitution of this great horde of soldier attendant animal vehicle and ship that i go about look at everything and get all the information possible in these day i would have be a war correspondent and i do act somewhat in that capacity for i tell herodotus a great many of the fact which he put into he history of this great campaign thee know herodotus he wife ask oh yes i work with he a long time and give he information which help he very much in write he history but it would have be of greater advantage to the world if he have adhere more closely to my statement i tell he what i discover in regard to the enumeration of the army of xerx but he want to make that army as big as he could and he pay little attention to my remonstrance herodotus be only four year old when xerx invade greece and of course all he knowledge concern that expedition be second-hand and by the time he begin to write he history of the campaign there be very few people live who know anything personally about it if he have not be a man so entirely wrap up in he own work he would have wonder how any one of my apparent age could give he so much in the way of personal experience but he seem to have no suspicion and at any rate ask no question and as i have a great desire that this remarkable historical event should be fully record i help he as much as i could i have be assist in the construction of the canal behind mount atho which xerx make in order to afford a short cut for he vessel and as i have frequently climb into the various portion of the mountain in order to make survey of the country below i have obtain a pretty good knowledge of the neighborhood and when disaster after disaster begin to hurl themselves upon this unfortunate multitude of invader i take measure for my safety i do not want to go back to persia even if i could go there which look very doubtful after the battle of salami and as i have come into the country with the persian it might have be unsafe to show myself with the greek so remember what i have see of the wild region of mount atho i make my way there with the intention of dwelling in its rocky fastness until the country should become safe for the ordinary wayfarer as there be no opportunity of teaching school on that desolate mountain -- and marry one of thy scholar interpolate mr crowder -- i become a sort of hermit he continue but i do not spend my time after the usual fashion of the conventional hermit who live on water-cress and read great book with a skull to keep the page open i build myself a rude cabin under a great rock and live somewhat after the fashion of the other inhabitant of that wild region mostly robber and outlaw as i have nothing which any one would want to steal i be not afraid of they and i could occasionally be of a little service to they especially in the way of rude medical attendance for which they be willing to pay I by give I now and then some food i have lay in a stock of writing-material before i go up on the mountain and i now go to work with great enthusiasm to set down what i know of the expedition of xerx and here it be that i make the note which be afterward so useful to herodotus when the country become quieter i go down into the plain look over the battle-field and obtain a great deal of information from the villager and country people i stay here nearly two year and have a pretty hard time of it but when i go away i take with I a very valuable collection of note for many year i make no use of these note but be in halicarnassus i hear of herodotus who be describe as a great scholar and traveler and engage in write history to he i apply without loss of time and i make a regular engagement work several hour with he every day for this he pay I weekly a sum equal to about two dollar and seventy-five cent of we present money but it be enough to support I and i be very glad to have the opportunity of send some of my experience and observation down into history it be at this time that the love of literary work begin to arise within I and in the next three or four century after the death of herodotus i write a number of book on various subject and under various name and some of these as i mention before be destroy with the alexandrian library it be in this period that i make the acquaintance of a editor -- the first editor in fact of whom i know anything at all i be in rhode and there be a learn man there name andronicus who be engage in editing the work of aristotle all the manuscript and book which that great philosopher leave behind he have be give to a friend or trustee and have pass from this person into the possession of other so that for about a hundred year the world know nothing of they then they come into the hand of andronicus who undertake to edit they and get they into proper shape for publication i go to andronicus and as soon as he find i be a person qualify for such work he engage I as he assistant editor i hold this position for several year and two or three of the book of aristotle i transcribe entirely with my own hand properly shape sentence and paragraph and very often make the necessary division from my experience with andronicus i be sure that none of the work of aristotle be give to the world exactly as he write they for we often find he manuscript copy very rough and disjointed so far as literary construction be concerned but i will also say that we never interfere with he philosophical theory or he scientific statement and deduction in all that time thee never marry ask mrs crowder crowder and i could not help laugh i do not say so say he but i will say that with one exception i do not remember any interesting matrimonial alliance which occur during the period of my literary labor i marry a young woman of rhode and give she a very considerable establishment which i be able to do for andronicus pay I much better than herodotus have do but she do not prove a very suitable helpmeet and i believe she marry I simply because i be in fairly good circumstance she soon show that she prefer a young man to a elderly student the greater part of whose time be occupy with book and manuscript and we have not be marry a year when she run away with a young goldsmith and disappear from rhode as i discover on a vessel bind for rome i resign myself to my loss and do not even try to obtain news of she i be too much engross in my work to be interested in a runaway wife it be a little more than half a century after this that i be in rome and sit on the step of one of the public building in the forum i be wait to meet some one with whom i have business and while i sit there a old woman stop in front of I she be evidently poor and wretchedly dress she scanty hair be gray and she face be wrinkle and shrunken i thought of course she be a beggar and be about to give she something when she clasp she hand in front of she and exclaim ` how like how like how like ' ` like whom ' say i ` what be you talk about ' ` like you father ' she say ` like you father you be so like he you resemble he so much in form and feature in the way you sit in everything that you must be he son ' ' i have no doubt i be my father 's son ' say i ` and what do you know about he ' ' i marry he ' she say ` for nearly a year i be he wife and then i foolishly run away and leave he what become of he i know not nor how long he live but he be a great deal older than i be and must have pass away many year ago but thou art he image he have the same ruddy face the same short white hair the same broad shoulder the same way of cross he leg as he sit he must have marry soon after i leave he tell I whom do he marry what be thy mother 's name ' i give she the name of my real mother and she shake she head ' i never hear of she ' she say ` do thy father ever speak of I a wife who run away from he ' ` yes he have speak of you -- that be if you be zalia the daughter of a oil-merchant of rhode ' -lrb- illustration : ` how like ' -rrb- ' i be that woman ' she exclaim ' i be that woman and do he mourn my loss ' ` not much i think not much ' then i become a little nervous for if this old woman talk to I much longer i be afraid in spite of the fact that i be a elderly man when she be a girl that she would become convinced that i could not be the son of the man who have once be she husband but must be that man himself so i hastily excuse myself on the plea of business and after have give she some money i leave she and do thee never see she again he wife ask almost with tear in she eye no i never see she again say mr crowder i be careful not to do that : but i do not neglect she i cause good care to be take of she until she die there be a slight pause here and then mr crowder say : thee have know a great deal of poverty in nearly all thy story thee be a poor man there be good reason for that say mr crowder poor people frequently have more adventure at least more interesting one than those who be in easy circumstance possession of money be apt to make life smoother and more commonplace so in select the most interesting event of my career to tell you i naturally describe period of comparative poverty -- and there be some period in which i be in actual want of the necessaries of life but you must not suppose that i have always be poor i have have my period of wealth but as i explain to you before it be very difficult on account of the frequent necessity of change my place of residence as well as my identity to carry over my property from one set of condition to another however i have often be able to do this and at one time i be in comfortable circumstance for nearly two hundred year but generally when i find myself oblige to leave a place where i have be live for fear of suspicion concern my age i have to leave everything behind I i will tell you a little story about one of my attempt to provide for the future it be toward the end of the fifteenth century about the time that columbus set out on he first voyage of discovery -- and you would be surprised consider the important result of he voyage to know how little sensation it cause in europe -- that i devise a scheme by which i think i might establish for myself a permanent fortune i be then live in genoa and be carry on the same business in which i be now engage i be a broker a dealer in money and commercial paper i be prosperous and well able to carry out the plan i have form this plan be a simple one i would purchase jewel thing easily carry about or conceal and which would be valuable in any country or any age and with this idea in my mind i spend many year in collect valuable stone and jewel confine myself generally to ring for i wish to make the bulk of my treasure very small when compare with they value about the middle of the sixteenth century i go to rome and take my jewel with I they be then a wonderfully fine collection of gem some of they of great antiquity and value for in gradually gather they together the enthusiasm of the collector have possess I and i often travel far to possess myself of a valuable jewel of which i have hear i remain in rome as long as i dared do so and then prepare to set out for egypt which i have not visit for a long time and where i expect to find interesting though depressing change i conclude naturally enough that it would be dangerous for I to take my treasure with I and i could conceive of no place where it would be better to leave they than in the eternal city rome be central and comparatively easy of access from any part of the world and moreover be less liable to change than any other place so i determine to leave my treasure in rome and to put they somewhere where they be not likely to be disturb by the march of improvement by the desolation of war and conquest or to become lose to I by the action of nature i decide to bury they in the catacomb with these ancient excavation i be familiar and i believe that in they dark and mysterious recess i could conceal my jewel and that i could find they again when i want they i procure a small box make of thick bronze and in this i put all my ring and gem and with they i inclosed several sheet of parchment on which i have write with the fine ink the monk use in engross they manuscript a detailed description and frequently a history of every one of these valuable object have securely fasten up the box i conceal it in my clothing and then make my way to the catacomb it be a dark and rainy evening and as the entrance to the catacomb be not guard in those day it be not difficult for I to make my way unseen into they interior i have bring with I a tinder-box and several rushlight and as soon as i feel secure from observation from the outside i strike a light and begin my operation then accord to a plan i have previously make i slowly walk along the solemn passageway which i have enter my plan of procedure be a very simple one and i have purposely make it so in order that it might be more easily remembered i be well acquaint with the position of the opening by which i have enter for several day i have study carefully its relation to other point in the surrounding country start from this open my plan be to proceed inward through the long corridor until i come to a transverse passage to pass this until i reach another to pass this also and to go on until i come to a third then i would turn to my left and proceed until i have pass two other transverse passage and reach a third then i would again turn to my left and count the open tomb on my left hand when i reach the third tomb i would stop thus there would be a series of three three and it be scarcely possible that i could forget that at this period a great many of the tomb be open have be despoil even of the few bone they contain the opening at which i stop be quite a large one and when i put my light inside i find it be entirely empty lighting another rush-candle i stick it in the bottom of the tomb which be about four foot above the floor of the passage and draw my large dagger i proceed to dig a hole in the left-hand corner nearest the front the earth be dry and free from stone and i soon make a hole two foot deep at the bottom of which i place my box then i cover it up press the earth firmly down into the hole when this be entirely fill i smooth away the rest of the earth i have take out and after i finish my work the floor of the tomb do not look as if it have be disturb then i go away reach the passage three tomb from I turn to the right go on until i reach the third transverse passage then go on until i come to the entrance it be rain heavily but i be glad to get out into the storm -lrb- illustration : ' i proceed to dig a hole ' -rrb- now please hurry on say mr crowder when do thee get they again a great many thing happen in egypt say mr crowder some pleasant and some unpleasant and they keep I there a long time after that i go to constantinople and subsequently reside in greece and in venice i live very comfortably during the greater part of this period and therefore there be no particular reason why i should go after my jewel so it happen that for one cause or another i do not go back to rome until early in the nineteenth century and i need not assure you that almost the first place i visit be the catacomb after three hundred year of absence i find the entrance but if i have not so well note its position in relation to certain ruin and natural object i should not have recognize it it be not now a wide opening through which a man might walk it be a little hole scarcely big enough for a fox to crawl through in fact i do not believe there would have be any opening there at all if it have not be for the small animal live in the catacomb which have maintain this opening for the purpose of go in and out it be broad daylight when i find this entrance of course i do not attempt to do anything then but in the night when there be no moon i come with a spade i enlarged the hole crawl through and after a time find myself in a passageway which be unobstructed now hurry on say mr crowder i bring no rushlight with I this time say mr crowder i have a good lantern and i walk steadily on until i come to the third transverse passage i turn to the left count three more passage i turn to the left i walk on slowly i examine the left-hand wall and apparently there be no open tomb this startle I but i soon find that i have be mistaken i see some tomb which be not open but which have be open and be now nearly fill with the dust of age i stop before the first of these then i go on and clearly make out the position of another then i come to the third : that be really open although the aperture be much smaller than it have be it do not look as i remember it but without hesitation i take a trowel which i have bring with I and begin to dig in the nearest left-hand corner i dig and i dig until i have go down more than two foot then i dig on and on until standing in the passage as i be i could not reach down any deeper into the hole i have make so i crawl into the tomb crouch down on my breast and dig down and down as far as i could reach then say mr crowder look at we as he speak i find the box a great sigh of relief come from mr crowder i be so afraid say she -- i be so afraid it have sink out of reach no say he its weight have probably make it settle down and then the dust of age as i remark before have accumulate over it that sort of thing be go on in rome all the time but i find my box and after hour and hour of wander i get out of the catacomb how be that we both ask i be so excite at the recovery of my treasure after the lapse of three century that when i turn into the first passage i forget to count those which cross it and my mind become so thoroughly mix up in regard to this labyrinth that i do not know when i would have find my way out if i have not hear a little animal -- i do not know what it be -- scurry away in front of I i follow it and eventually see a little speck of light that prove to be the hole through which i have come in what do thee do with the jewel ask mrs crowder she husband look at he watch and then hold it with the face toward she she give a cry of surprise and we all go up-stair to bed v now my dear say mr crowder the moment we have finish dinner on the next evening i want thee to tell we immediately what thee do with the jewel i have be think about that all day and i believe if i have be with thee i could have give thee some good advice so that the money thee receive for these treasure would have last thee a long time i have think on that subject many time say mr crowder not only in regard to this case but other and have form hundred of plan for carry my possession into another set of social condition but the fact of be oblige to change my identity always make it impossible for I to avail myself of the advantage of commercial paper legal deed and all title to property thee might have put thy wealth into solid gold -- great bar and lump those would be available in any country and in any age and they would not have have anything to do with thy identity say he wife it be always difficult for I to carry about or even conceal such golden treasure but i have sometimes do it however as you be in such a hurry to hear about the jewel i will let all other subject drop when i reach my lodgings in rome i open the box and find everything perfect the write on the sheet of parchment be still black and perfectly legible and the jewel look just as they do when i put they into the box i can not imagine interrupted mr crowder how thee remember what they look like after the lapse of three hundred year mr crowder smile you forget he say that since i first reach the age of fifty-three there have be no radical change in I physical or mental my memory be just as good now as it be when i reach my fifty-third birthday in the day of abraham it be impossible for I to forget anything of importance and i remember perfectly the appearance of those gem but my knowledge of such thing have be greatly improve by time and experience and after i have spend a hour or two look over my treasure i feel sure that they be far more valuable than they be when they come into my possession in fact it be a remarkable collection of precious stone consider it in regard to its historic as well as its intrinsic value i shall not attempt to describe my various plan for dispose of my treasure but i soon find that it would not be wise for I to try to sell they in rome i have pick out one of the least valuable engraved stone and have take it to a lapidary who readily buy it at he own valuation and pay I with great promptness but after he have secure it he ask I so many question about it particularly how i have come into possession of it that i be very sure that he have make a wonderful bargain and be also convince that it would not do for I to take any more of my gem to he those roman expert know too much about antique jewel i go to naple where i have a similar experience then i find it would be well for I if i do not wish to be arrest as a thief who have rob a museum to endeavor to sell my collection as a whole in some other country as a professional dealer in gem from a foreign land i would be less liable to suspicion than if i endeavored to peddle my jewel one at a time so i determine to go to madrid and try to sell my collection there when i reach spain i find the country in a great turmoil this be in 1808 when napoleon be on the point of invade spain but as politician statesman and military man be not in the habit of buy ancient gem i still hope that i might be able to transact the business which have bring I to the country my collection would be as valuable to a museum then as at any time for it be not suppose that the french be come into the country to ravage and destroy the great institution of learning and art i make acquaintance in madrid and before long i have a opportunity of exhibit my collection to a well-known dealer and connoisseur who be well acquaint with the officer of the royal museum i think it would be well to sell they through he agency even though i pay he a high commission if i should say that this man be astounded as well as delighted when he see my collection i should be use very feeble expression for carry away by he enthusiasm he do not hesitate to say to I that it be the most valuable collection he have ever see even if the stone have be worthless in themselves they historic value be very great of course he want to know where i have obtain these treasure and i inform he truthfully that i have travel far and wide in order to gather they together i tell he the history of many of they but entirely omit mention anything which would give a clue to the time and period when i have come into possession of they this dealer undertake the sale of my jewel we arrange they in a handsome box line with velvet and divide into compartment and i make a catalogue of they copy from my ancient parchment -- which would have ruin I have i inadvertently allow they to be see he put himself into communication with the officer of the museum and i leave the matter entirely in he hand in less than a week i become aware that i be a object of suspicion i call on the dealer but he be not to be see i find that i be shadow by officer of the law i write to the dealer but receive no answer one evening when i return to my lodgings i find that they have be thoroughly search i become alarmed and the conviction force itself upon I that the sooner i should escape from madrid the better for I what exclaim mr crowder and leave thy jewel behind thee certainly do not do that ah my dear reply she husband you do not comprehend the situation it be very plain that the authority of the museum do not believe that a private individual a stranger be likely to be the legitimate owner of these treasure have my case be a ordinary one i should have court investigation but how could i prove that i have be a honest man three hundred year before a legal examination not so much on account of the jewel but because of the necessary assertion of my age would have be a terrible ordeal i hurry to the dealer 's shop but find it close inquire of a woman in a neighbor door-step i be inform that the dealer have be arrest i ask no more i do not return to my lodgings and that night i leave madrid i could not repress a exclamation of distress and mr crowder cry : do thee really go away and leave thy jewel such a thing be too dreadful to think of but perhaps thee get they again no say mr crowder i never see they again nor ever hear of they but now that it be impossible for any one to be live who might recognize I i hope to go to madrid and see those gem i have no doubt that they be in the museum and i exclaimed mrs crowder -- i shall go with thee i shall see they indeed you shall say she husband take she affectionately by the hand and then he turn to I you may think say he that i be too timid that i be too ready to run away from danger but it be hard for any one but myself readily to appreciate my horror of a sentence to imprisonment or convict labor for life oh horrible say he wife with tear in she eye then thee would have despair indeed no say he i should not even have have that consolation despair be a welcome to death a man who can not die can not truly despair but do not let we talk upon such a melancholy subject no no cry mr crowder i be glad thee leave those wretched jewel behind thee and thee get away safely oh yes i have some money leave i travel by night and conceal myself by day and so get out of spain soon after i cross the pyrenee i find myself penniless and be oblige to work my way poverty again exclaim mr crowder it be dreadful to hear so much of it if thee could only have carry away with thee one of thy diamond thee might have crack it up into little piece and thee might have sell these one at a time without suspicion i never think of be a vender of broken diamond and there be nothing suspicious about honest labor the object of my present endeavor be to reach england and i journey northward it be nearly a month after i have enter france that i be at a little village on the garonne repair a stone wall which divide a field from the road and i assure you i be very glad to get this job it be here that i hear of the near approach of napoleon 's army on its march into spain that the news be true be quickly prove for very soon after i have begin my work on the wall the country to the north seem to be fill with cavalry infantry artillery baggage-wagon and everything that pertain to a army about noon there be a general halt and in the field the wall of which i be repair a body of officer make a temporary encampment i pay as little apparent attention as possible to what be go on around I but proceed steadily with my work although i assure you i have my eye wide open all the time i be think of stop work in order to eat my dinner which i have with I when a party of officer approach I on they way to a little hill in the field one of they stop and speak to I and as he do so the other halt and stand together a little way off the moment i look at the person who address I i know he it be napoleon bonaparte then thee have see the great napoleon almost whisper mr crowder and very much disappointed i be when i beheld he remark she husband i have see portrait of he i have read and hear of he great achievement and i have picture to myself a hero perhaps my experience should have teach I that hero seldom look like hero but for all that i have have my ideal and in appearance this man fall below it he face be of a olive color which be unequally distribute over he feature he be incline to be pudgy and he clothes do not appear to fit he but for all that he have the air of a man who with pierce eye see he way before he and do not flinch from take it rough as it might be ` you seem a old man for such work ' say he ` but if you be strong enough to lift those stone why be you not in the army ' as he speak i notice that he have not the intonation of a true frenchman he have the accent of the foreigner that he be -lrb- illustration : ` why be you not in the army ' -rrb- ` sire ' say i ' i be too old for the army but in spite of my age i must earn my bread ' i may state here that my hair and beard have be grow since i leave madrid for a moment the emperor regard I in silence ` be you a frenchman ' say he ` you speak too well for a stone-mason and moreover you speech be that of a foreigner who have study french ' it be odd that each of we should have remark the accent of the other but i be not amuse at this i be become very nervous ` sire ' say i ' i come from italy ' ` be you bear there ' ask he my nervousness increase this man be too keen a questioner ` sire ' i reply ' i be bear in the country southeast of rome ' this be true enough but it be a long way southeast ` do you speak spanish ' he abruptly ask at this question my blood run cold i have have enough of speak spanish i be try to get away from spain and everything that belong to that country but i think it safest to speak the truth and i answer that i understand the language the emperor now beckon to one of he officer and order he to talk with I in spanish i have be in spain in the early part of the preceding century and i have there learn to speak the pure castilian tongue so that when the officer talk with I i could see that he be surprised and presently he tell the emperor that he have never hear any one who speak such excellent spanish the emperor fix he eye upon I ` you must have travel a great deal ' he say ` you should not be waste you time with stone and mortar ' then turn to the officer who have speak to I he say ` he understand spanish so well that we may make he useful ' he be about to address I again but be interrupt by the arrival of a orderly with a despatch this he read hastily and walk toward the officer who be wait for he but before he leave I he order I to report myself at he tent which be not far off in the field he then walk away evidently discuss the despatch which he still hold open in he hand now i be again plunge into the deepest apprehension and fear i do not want to go back to spain not know what might happen to I there every evil thing be possible i might be recognize and the emperor might not care to shield any one claim by the law as a escape thief in a instant i see all sort of dreadful possibility i determine to take no chance the moment the emperor 's back be turn upon I i get over the broken part of the wall and interfere with by no one pass quietly along the road to the house of the man who have employ I to do he mason-work and see no one there -- for every window and door be tightly close -- i walk into the yard and go to the well which be conceal from the road by some shrubbery i look quickly about and perceive that i be not in sight of any one i get into the well and go down to the bottom assist my descent by the well-rope the water be about five foot deep and when i first enter it it chill I but nothing could chill I so much as the thought that i might be take back into spain no matter by whom or for what i must admit that i be do then and often have do that which seem very much like cowardice but people who can die can not understand the fear which may come upon a person who have not that refuge from misfortune for the rest of the day i remain in the well and when people come to draw water -- and this happen many time in the course of the afternoon -- i crouch down as much as i could but at such time i would have be conceal by the descend bucket even if any one have choose to look down the well this bucket be a heavy one with iron hoop and i have a great deal of trouble sometimes to shield my head from it i should think thee would have take thy death of cold say mr crowder staying in that cold well the whole afternoon no say she husband with a smile i be not afraid of that if i should have take cold i know it would not be fatal and although the water chill I at first i become use to it a hour or two after nightfall i clamber up the well-rope -- and it be not a easy thing for although not stout i be a heavy man -- and i get away over the field with all the rapidity possible i do not look back to see if the army be still on the road nor do i ever know whether i have be search for or have be forget i shall not describe the rest of my journey there be nothing remarkable about it except that it be beset with many hardship i make my way into switzerland and so on down the rhine and it be nearly seven month after i leave madrid before i reach england i remain many year in great britain living here and there and be greatly interested in the change and improvement i see around I you can easily understand this when i tell you it be in 1512 twenty year after the discovery of america that i have last be in england i do not believe that in any other part of the world the change in three hundred year could have be more marked and impressive i have never visit ireland and as i have a great desire to see that country i make my way there as soon as possible and after visit the most note spot of the island i settle down to work as a gardener always poor ejaculate mr crowder with a sigh no not always answer she husband but wander sight-seer can not be expect to make much money at this time i be very glad indeed to cease from rove and enjoy the comfort of a home even though it be a humble one the family with whom i take service be that of marium edgeworth who live with she father in edgeworthstown what cry mrs crowder ` lazy lawrence ' ` simple susan ' and all the rest of they be it that miss edgeworth certainly say he there never be but one marium edgeworth and i do not think there ever will be another i soon become very well acquaint with miss edgeworth she father be a studious man and a magistrate he pay very little attention to the house and garden the latter of which be almost entirely under the charge of he daughter marium she use to come out among the flower-bed and talk to I and as my varied experience enable I to tell she a great deal about fruit flower and vegetable she become more and more interested in what i have to tell she she be a plain sensible woman anxious for information and she live in a very quiet neighborhood where she do not often have opportunity of meeting person of intelligence and information but when she find out that i could tell she so many thing not only about plant but about the country where i have know they she would sometimes spend a hour or two with I take note of what i say during the time that i be she gardener she write the story of ` the little merchant ' and as she do not know very much about italy and naple i give she most of the point for that highly moral story she tell I in fact that she do not believe she could have write it have it not be for my assistance she think well to begin the story by give some explanatory ` extract from a traveler 's journal ' relative to italian custom but afterward she depend entirely on I for all point concern distinctive national characteristic and the general italian atmosphere as she become aware that i be a educate man and have travel in many country she be curious about my antecedent but of course my remark in that direction be very guard one day as she be stand look at I as i be pruning a rose-bush she make a remark which startle I i perfectly remember she word ` it seem to I ' she say ` that one who be so constantly engage in observe and encourage the growth and development of plant should himself grow and develop rose of one year be generally better than those of the year before then why be not the gardener better ' to these word she immediately add be a woman of kind impulse ` but in the case of a good gardener such as you be i have no doubt he do grow better year by year ' what be there startling in that little speech ask mrs crowder i do not think she could have say anything less i will tell you why i be startle say she husband almost those very word -- mark I almost those very word -- have be say to I when i be work in the wonderful garden of nebuchadnezzar and he be stand by I watch I prune a rose-bush that marium edgeworth and the great nebuchadnezzar should have say the same thing to I be enough to startle I to this astounding statement mr crowder and i listen with wide-open eye yes say mr crowder you may think it amazing that a very ordinary remark should connect ` the parent ' assistant ' with the city of babylon but so it be in the course of my life i have notice coincidence quite as strange i spend many year in the city of babylon but the wonderful hanging garden interested I more than anything else the great city contain at the time of which i have just speak i be one of nebuchadnezzar 's gardener but not in the humble position which i afterward fill in ireland i have under my order fifteen slave and my principal duty be to direct the labor of these poor man these charming garden rest upon arch high above the surface of the ground water by means of pipe from the river euphrate and fill with the choicest flower shrub and plant know to the civilization of the time be a ceaseless source of delight to I often when i have finish the daily work assign to I and my man i would wander over other part of the garden and enjoy its rare beauty i frequently meet nebuchadnezzar who for the time enjoy he garden almost as much as i do when relieve from the care of state and he ambitious plan and while walk in the wind path among sparkling fountain and the fragrant flowerbed he seem like a very ordinary man quiet and reflective with very good idea concern nature and architecture the latter i learn from he frequent remark to I i suppose it be because i appear to be so much older and more experienced than most of those who compose he little army of gardener that he often address I ask question and make suggestion and it be one afternoon standing by I as i be at work in a rose-bed that he say the word which be speak to I about twenty-four century afterward by marium edgeworth now be not that enough to startle a man -lrb- illustration : nebuchadnezzar and the gardener -rrb- startle exclaim mr crowder i should have scream i should have think that some one have come from the dead to speak to I but i suppose there be nothing about marium edgeworth which remind thee of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon yes there be reply she husband : there be the same meditative expression of the eye the same reflective mood as each one begin to speak as if he and she be merely think aloud the same quick kind reference to I as if the speaker fear that my feeling might have be hurt by a presumption that i myself have not develop and improve i have good reason to remember those word of nebuchadnezzar for they be the last i ever hear he speak a few day afterward i be inform by the chief gardener that the king be about to make a journey across the mountain into media and that he intend to establish there what would now be call a experimental garden of horticulture which be to be devote to grow and improve certain ornamental tree which do not flourish in the hang garden of babylon he expedition be not to be undertake entirely for this purpose but he be a man who do a great many thing at once and the establishment of these experimental grounds be only one of the object of he journey the chief gardener then go on to say that the king have speak to he about I and have say that he would take I with he and perhaps put I in charge of the new garden this mark of royal favor do not please I at all i have hope that i might ultimately become the chief of the babylonian garden and this would have suit I admirably it be a position of profit and some honor and when i think that i have live long enough in that part of the world it would have be easy for I to make a journey into the surrounding country on some errand connect with the business of the garden and then quietly to disappear but if i be to be take into media it might not be easy for I to get away therefore i do not wait to see nebuchadnezzar again and receive embarrassing royal command but i go to my home that night and return no more to the wonderful hanging garden of babylon i think thee be a great deal better off in the garden of marium edgeworth say mr crowder for there thee could come and go as thee pleased and it almost make my flesh creep when i think of thee living in company with the bloody tyrant of the past and always in poverty and suffering as if thee have be one of the common people and not the superior of every man around thee i do not want to hear anything more about the wicked nebuchadnezzar how long do thee stay with marium edgeworth about four year he reply and i might have remain much longer for in that quiet life the advance of one 's year be not likely to be notice i be sure miss edgeworth look no older to I when i leave she than when i first see she but she be oblige to go into england to nurse she sick stepmother and after she departure the place have no attraction for I and i leave ireland i wonder say mr crowder a little maliciously that thee do not marry she she husband laugh englishwoman of she rank in society do not marry they gardener and besides in any case she would not have suit I for a wife for one reason she be too homely oh exclaim mr crowder and she might have say more but she husband do not give she a chance i know i have talk a great deal about my day of poverty and misery and now i will tell you something different for a time i be the ruler of all the russia ruler exclaim mr crowder and i almost in the same breath yes say he absolute ruler and this be the way of it : i be in russium in the latter part of the seventeenth century at a time when there be great excitement in royal and political circle the young czar feodor have recently die and he have name as he successor he half-brother peter a boy ten year of age who afterward become peter the great the late czar 's young brother ivan should have succeed he but he be almost a idiot in this complicated state of thing the half-sister of peter the princess sophium a young woman of wonderful ambition and really great ability rise to the occasion she foment a revolution there be fight with all sort of cruelty and horror and when affair have quiet down she be princess regent while the two boy ivan and peter be wait to see what would happen next she be really a woman admirably adapt to she position she be well educate write poetry and know how to play she part in public affair she preside in the council and she authority be without control but she be just as bloody-minded and cruel as anybody else in russium now it so happen when the princess sophium be at the height of she power that i be she secretary for five or six year i have be a teacher of language in moscow and at one time i have give lesson to the princess in this way she have become well acquaint with I and have frequently call upon I for information of one sort or another she conclude to make I she secretary thus i be establish at the court of russium i have charge of all sophium 's public papers and i often have a good deal to do with she private correspondence but she sign and seal all papers of importance the prince galitzin who have be she father 's minister and be now sophium 's main supporter in all she autocratic design and action find himself oblige to leave moscow to attend to he private affair on he great estate and to be absent for more than a month and after he departure the princess depend on I more than ever like many woman in high position it be absolutely necessary for she to have a man on whom she could lean with one hand while she direct she affair with the other i do not think that be always necessary say mr crowder at least in these day perhaps not say she husband with a smile but it be then but i must get on with my story one morning soon after galitzin 's departure the horse attach to the royal sledge run away just outside of moscow the princess be throw out upon the hard ground and badly dislocate she right wrist by the time she have be take back to the palace she arm and hand be dreadfully swollen and it be difficult for she surgeon to do anything for she i be call into the princess 's room just after the three surgeon have be send to prison i find she in great trouble mental as well as physical and she principal anxiety be that she be afraid it would be a long time before she would be able to use she hand and sign and seal the royal act and decree she have a certain superstition about this which greatly agitate she if she could not sign and seal she do not believe she would be able to rule any one who understand the nature of the political faction in russium well know that a uprising among the noble might occur upon any pretext and no pretext could be so powerful as the suspicion of incompetency in the sovereign the seat of a ruler who do not rule be extremely uncertain at that moment a paper of no great importance which have be send in to she before she go out in she sledge that morning be lie on the table near she couch and she be greatly worried because she could not sign it i assure she she need not trouble herself about it for i could attend to it i have often affix she initial and seal to unimportant papers the princess do not object to my proposition but this be not enough for she she have a deep mind and she quickly concoct a scheme by which she public business should be attend to while at the same time it should not be know that she do not attend to it she cause it to be give out that it be she ankle which have be injure and not she wrist she send for another surgeon and have he lock up in the palace when he be not attend to she so that he should tell no tale she lady be inform that it would be very well for they to keep silent and they understand she then she arrange with I that all public business should be bring to she that i should sign and seal in she place and should be she agent of communication with the court when this plan have be settle upon the princess regain something of she usual good spirit ` as i never sign my name with my toe ' she say to I ` there be no reason why a sprain ankle should interfere with my royal function and for the present you can be my right hand ' this be a very fine plan but it do not work as she expect it would she wrist become more and more painful and fever set in and on the second day when i call upon she i find she be in no condition to attend to business she be irritable and drowsy ` do not annoy I with that paper ' she say ` if the wool-dealer ought to have they tax increase increase they you should not bring these trifle to I but ' -- and now she regain for a moment she old acuteness -- ` remember this : do not let my administration stop ' i understand she very well and when i leave she i see my course plain before I it be absolutely necessary that the exercise of royal function by the princess sophium should appear to go on in its usual way any stoppage would be a signal for a revolution in order that this plan should be carry out i must act for the princess regent i must do what i think right and it must be do in she name exactly as if she have order it i assume the responsibility without hesitation while it be suppose i be merely the private secretary of the princess act as she agent and mouthpiece i be in fact the ruler of all the russia mr crowder open she mouth as if she would gasp for breath but she do not say anything you can scarcely imagine my dear say he the delight with which i assume the power so suddenly thrust upon I i set myself to work without delay and as i know all about the wool-dealer ' business i issue a royal decree decrease they tax poor creature they be suffer enough already good for thee exclaim mr crowder i can not tell you of all the reform i devise or even those which i carry out i know that the fever of the princess aggravate by the inflammation of she dislocate wrist would continue for some time and i bent all my energy to the work of do as much good as i could in the vast empire under my control while i have the opportunity and it be a great opportunity indeed i do not want to do anything so radical as to arouse the opposition of the court and therefore i direct my principal effort to the amelioration of the condition of the people in the province it would be a long time before word could get back to the capital of what i have do in those distant region by night and by day my courier be gallop in every direction carry good news to the peasant of russium it be remark by some of the councilor when they speak of the municipal reform i institute that the princess seem to be in a very humane state of mind but none of they care to interfere with what they suppose to be the sick-bed workings of she conscience so i rule with a high hand astonishing the provincial official and cause thousand of downtrodden subject to begin to believe that perhaps they be really human being with some claim on royal justice and kindness i fairly revel in my imperial power but i never forget to be prudent i lessen the duty and slightly increase the pay of the military regiment station in and about moscow and thus the princess sophium become very popular with the army and i feel safe i go in to see the princess every day and several time when she be in she right mind she ask I if everything be go on well and once when i assure she that all be progress quietly and satisfactorily she actually thank I this be a good deal for a russian princess if she have know how the people be thank _ she _ i do not know what would have happen for twenty-one day i reign over russium if i have be able to do it i should have make each day a year i feel that i be in my proper place and thee be right say mr crowder she eye sparkling i believe that at that time thee be the only monarch in the world who be worthy to reign and with a loyal pride as if he have just step from a throne she put she hand upon he arm yes say mr crowder i honestly believe that i be a good monarch and i will admit that in those day such personage be extremely scarce so my imperial sway proceed with no obstruction until i be inform that prince galitzin be hasten to moscow on he return from he estate and be then within three day ' journey of the capital now i prepare to lay down the tremendous power which i have wield with such immense satisfaction to myself and with such benefit i do not hesitate to say to the people of russium the effect of my rule be still to be perceive in some of the province of russium and decree i make more than two hundred year ago be in force in many village along the eastern side of the volga the day before prince galitzin be expect i visit sophium for the last time she be a great deal better and much please by the expect arrival of she minister she even give I some command but when i leave she i do not execute they i would not have my reign sully by any of she mandate that afternoon in a royal sledge with the royal permission give by myself to travel where and how i pleased i leave moscow frequent relay of horse carry I rapidly beyond danger of pursuit and so in course of time i pass the boundary of the empire of russium over which for three week i have rule a absolute autocrat do thee know say mr crowder that two or three time i expect thee to say that thee marry sophium mr crowder laugh that be truly a wild notion say he i do not think it be wild at all she reply in the course of thy life thee have marry a great many plain person in some way that princess would have suit thee as a wife and if thee have really marry she and have become she royal consort like prince albert thee might have make a great change in she but after all it would have be a pity to interfere with the reign of peter the great vi and what do thee do after thee get out of russium ask mrs crowder the next evening she husband shake he head no no my dear we can not go on with my autobiography in that fashion if i should take up my life step by step there would not be time enough -- there he stop but i be sure we both understand he meaning there would be plenty of time for he often and often say mr crowder after a few minute ' silence have i determine to adopt some particular profession and continue its practice wherever i might find myself but in this i do not succeed very well frequently i be a teacher but not for many consecutive year something or other be sure to happen to turn my energy into other channel such as fall in love with thy scholar say he wife you have a good memory he reply that sometimes happen but there be other reason which turn I away from the path of the pedagogue with my widely extended opportunity i naturally come to know a good deal of medicine and surgery frequently i have be a doctor in spite of myself and as far back as the day of the patriarch i be call upon to render aid to sick and ailing people in the day when i live in a cave and gain a reputation as a wise and holy hermit more people come to I to get relief from bodily ailment than to ask for spiritual counsel you will remember that i tell you that i be visit at that time by mose and joshua mose come i truly believe on account of he desire to become acquaint with the prophet el khoudr of whom he have hear so much but joshua want to see I for a entirely different reason the two remain with I for about a hour and although mose have no belief in I as a prophet he ask I a great many question and i be sure that i prove to he that i be a man of a great deal of information he have a keen mind with a quick perception of the motive of other and in every way be well adapt to be a leader of man when mose have go away to a tent about a mile distant where he intend to spend the night joshua remain and as soon as he uncle be out of sight he tell I why he wish to see I he uncle exclaim mr crowder certainly say she husband joshua be the son of nun and of miriam and miriam be the sister of mose and aaron what he now want from I be medical advice for some time he have be afflict with rheumatism in he left leg which come upon he after exposure to the damp and cold now this be a very important thing to joshua he be a great favorite with mose who intend he as we all know to be he successor as leader of the people and of the army joshua be essentially a soldier he be quiet brave and a good disciplinarian in fact he have all the quality need for the position he expect to fill : but he be not young and if he should become subject to frequent attack of rheumatism it be not likely that mose who have very rigid idea of he duty to he people would be willing to place at they head a man who might at any time be incapacitate from take he proper place on the field of battle so joshua have never mention he ailment to he uncle hope that he might be relieve of it and have hear that i be skilled in such matter now wish my advice i soon find that he ailment be a very ordinary one which might easily be keep under control if not cure and i proceed at once to apply remedy i will just mention that in those day remedy be generally heroic and i think you will agree with I when i tell you how i treat joshua i first rub he ache muscle with fine sand keep up a friction until he skin be in a beautiful glow then i bring out from the back part of my cave where i keep my medicine a jar contain a liniment which i have make for such purpose it be compose of oil in which have be steep the bruised fruit or pod of a plant very much resemble the tabasco pepper-plant whoop i exclaimed involuntarily yes say mr crowder and joshua ` whoop ' too but it be a grand liniment especially when apply upon skin already excite by rub with sand he jump at first but he be a soldier and he bear the application bravely i see he again the next day and he assure I with genuine pleasure that every trace of the rheumatism have disappear i give he some of my liniment and also show he some of the little pepper pod so that he might procure they at any time in the future when he should need they it be more than twenty year after this that i again meet joshua he be then a elderly man but still a vigorous soldier he assure I that he have use my remedy whenever he have feel the least twinge of rheumatism and that the disease have never interfere with the performance of he military duty he be much surprised to see that i look no older than when he have meet I before he be greatly impress by this and talk a good deal about it he tell I he consider himself under the greatest obligation to I for what i have do for he and as he speak i could see that a hope be grow within he that perhaps i might do something more he presently speak out boldly and say to I that as my knowledge of medicine have enable I to keep myself from grow old perhaps i could do the same thing for he few man have greater need of protect themselves against the advance of old age he work be not do and year of bodily strength be necessary to enable he to finish it but i could do nothing for joshua in this respect i assure he that my apparent exemption from the effect of pass year be perfectly natural and be not due to drug or medicament joshua live many year after that day and do a good deal of excellent military work but he life be not long enough to satisfy he he fall sick be oblige to give up he command to he relative caleb and finally die in he one hundred and twenty-eighth year which ought to satisfy he i should say say mr crowder i have never yet meet a thoroughbred worker say mr crowder who be satisfy to stop he work before he have finish it no matter how old he might happen to be but my last meeting with joshua teach I a lesson which in those day have not be sufficiently impressed upon my mind i become convinced that i must not allow people to think that i could live along for twenty year or more without grow older and after that i give this matter a great deal more attention than i have yet bestow upon it it be a pity say mr crowder that thy life should have be mar by such constant anxiety yes say he but this be a suspicious world and it be dangerous for a man to set himself apart from he fellow-being especially if he do it in some unusual fashion which people can not understand but i hope now say he wife that those day of suspicion be entirely past now the conversation be get awkward it could not be pleasant for any one of we to talk about what the world of the future might think of mr crowder when it come to know all about he and appreciate this my host quickly change the subject there be a little story i have be want to tell you say he address he wife which i think would interest you it be a love-story in which i be concerned oh say mr crowder look up quickly a scholar no he answer not this time early in the fourteenth century i be live at avignon in the south of france at that time i be make my living by copying law papers you see i be down in the world again mr crowder sigh but say nothing one Sunday morning i be in the church of st claire and kneel a little in front of I i notice a lady who do not seem to be pay the proper attention to she devotions she fidget uneasily and every now and then she would turn she head a little to the right and then bring it back quickly and turn it so much in my direction that i could see the profile of she face she be a good-looking woman not very young and evidently nervous and disturbed follow the direction of she quick gaze when she again turn to the right i see a young man apparently not twenty-five year of age and dress in sober black he be also kneel but he eye be steadfastly fix upon the lady in front of I and i know of course that it be this continuous gaze which be disturbing she i feel very much disposed to call the attention of a priest to this young man who be make one of the congregation unpleasantly conspicuous by stare at she but the situation be bring to a end by the lady herself who suddenly rise and go out of the church she have no sooner pass the heavy leathern curtain of the door than the young man get up and go out after she interested in this affair i also leave the church and in the street i see the lady walk rapidly away with the young man at a respectful distance behind she -lrb- illustration : petrarch and laura -rrb- i follow on the other side of the street determine to interfere if the youth so evidently a stranger to the lady should accost she or annoy she she walk steadily on not look behind she and doubtless hope that she be not follow as soon as she reach another church she turn and enter it without hesitation the young man go in after she and then i follow as before the lady kneel on the pavement of the church and the young man place himself not very far from she immediately begin to stare at she i look around but there be no priest near and then i advanced and kneel not very far from the lady and between she and she persistent admirer it be plain enough that he do not like this and he move forward so that he might still get a view of she then i also move so as to obstruct he view he now fix he eye upon I and i return he gaze in such a way as to make he understand that while i be present he would not be allow to annoy a lady who evidently wish to have nothing to do with he presently he rise and go out it be evident that he see that it be no use for he to continue he reprehensible conduct while i be present i do not know how the lady discover that she unauthorized admirer have go away but she do discover it and she turn toward I for a instant and give I what i suppose be a look of gratitude i soon leave the church and i have scarcely reach the street when i find that the lady have follow I she look at I as if she would like to speak and i politely salute she ' i thank you kind sir ' she say ` for relieve I of the importunity of that young man for more than a week he have follow I whenever i go to church and although he have never speak to I he steady gaze throw I into such a agitation that i can not think of my prayer do you know who he be sir ' i assure she that i have never see the youth before that morning but that doubtless i could find out all about he i tell she that i be acquaint with several officer of the law and that there would be no difficulty in prevent he from give she any further annoyance ` oh do not do that ' she say quickly ' i would not wish to attract attention to myself in that way you seem to be a kind and fatherly gentleman can you not speak to the young man himself and tell he who i be and impress upon he mind how much he be trouble I by he inconsiderate action ' as i do not wish to keep she standing in the street we now walk on together and she briefly give I the fact of the case she name be mme de sade : she have be happily marry for two year and never before have she be annoy by impertinent attention from any one but in some manner unaccountable to she this young student have be attract by she and have make she the object of he attention whenever he have have the opportunity not only have he annoy she at church but twice he have follow she when she have leave she house on business thus show that he have be loitering about in the vicinity she have not yet speak to she husband in the matter because she be afraid that some quarrel might arise but now that the good angel have cause she to meet with such a kind-hearted old gentleman as myself she hope that i might be able to rid she of the young man without make any trouble surely this student who seem to be a respectable person would not think of such a thing as fight I thee must have have a very long white beard at that time interpolated mr crowder yes say she husband i be in one of my period of venerable age i leave mme de sade promise to do what i could for she and as she thank I i could not help wonder why the handsome young student have make she the object of he attention she be a well-shaped fairly good-looking woman with fair skin and large eye but she be of a grave and sober cast of countenance and there be nothing about she which indicate the least of that piquancy which would be likely to attract the eye of a youth she seem to I to be exactly what she say she be -- the quiet and respectable lady of a quiet and respectable household in the course of the afternoon i discover the name and residence of the young man with whom i have determine to have a interview he name be francesco petrarca a italian by birth and now engage in pursue he study in this place i call upon he at he lodgings and fortunately find he at home as i have expect he recognize I at once as the elderly person who have interfere with he at the church but as i do not expect he greet I politely without the least show of resentment i take the seat he offer I and proceed to deliver a lecture i lay before he the fact of the case which i suppose he might not know and urge he for he own sake as well as for that of the lady to cease he annoying and i do not hesitate to state ungentlemanly pursuit of she he listen to I with respectful attention and when i have finish he assure I that he know even more about mme de sade than i do he be perfectly aware that she be a religious and highly estimable lady and he do not desire to do anything which would give she a moment 's sorrow ` then stop follow she ' say i ` and give up that habit of stare at she in such a way as to make she the object of attention to everybody around she ' ` that be ask too much ' answer master petrarca ` that lady have make a impression upon my soul which can not be remove my will would have no power to efface she image from my constant thought if she do not wish I to do so i shall never speak a word to she but i must look upon she even when i sleep she face be present in my dream she have arouse within I the spirit of poetry my soul will sing in praise of she loveliness and i can not prevent it let I read to you some line ' he say pick up a piece of manuscript which be lie on the table ` it be in italian but i will translate it for you ' ` no ' say i ` read it as it be write i understand italian ' then he read the opening line of a sonnet which be write to laura in the shadow he read about six line and then stop ` it be not finish ' he say ` and what i have write do not altogether satisfy I but you can judge from what you have hear how it be that i think of that lady and how impossible it be that i can in any way banish she from my mind or willingly from my vision ' ` how do you come to know that she name be laura ' i ask ' i find it out from the record of she marriage ' he answer i talk for some time to this young man but fail to impress he with the conviction that he conduct be improper and unworthy of he i find means to inform mme de sade of the result of my conversation with petrarch -- as we call he name in english -- and she appear to be satisfy that the young student would soon cease he attention although i myself see no reason for such belief i visit the love-lorn young man several time for i have become interested in he and endeavor to make he see how foolish it be -- even if he look upon it in no other light -- to direct he ardent affection upon a lady who would never care anything about he and who even if unmarried be not the sort of woman who be adapt to satisfy the lofty affection which he word and he verse show he to possess ` there be so many beautiful woman ' say i ` any one of whom you might love of whom you might sing and to whom you could indite you verse she would return you love she would appreciate you poetry you would marry she and be happy all you life ' he shake he head ` no no no ' he say ` you do not understand my nature ` marriage would mean the care of a house -- food fuel the mending of clothes a family -- all the hard material condition of life no sir my love soar far above all that if it be possible that laura should ever be mine i could not love she as i do she be apart from I she be above I i worship she and for she i pour out my soul in song listen to this ' and he read I some line of a unfinished sonnet to laura in the sunlight ` she be just come from a shaded street into a open place i see she and this poem come into my heart ' about a week after this i be very much surprised to see petrarch walk with he laura who be accompany by she husband the three be very amicably converse i join the party and be make acquaint with m de sade and after that from time to time i meet they together sometimes take a meal with they in the evening i discover that laura 's husband look upon petrarch very much as any ordinary husband would look upon a artist who wish to paint portrait of he wife i live for more than a year in avignon with these good people and i be not ashamed to say that i never cease my endeavor to persuade petrarch to give up he strange and abnormal attention to a woman who would never be anything to he but a vision in the distance and who would prevent he from live a true and natural life with one who would be all he own but it be of no use he go on in he own way and everybody know the result now just think of it continue mr crowder suppose i have succeed in my honest effort to do good think of what the world would have lose suppose i have induce petrarch not to come back to avignon after he travels suppose he have not settle down at vaucluse and have not spend three long year write sonnet to laura while she be occupy with the care of she large family of child suppose in a word that i have be successful in my good work and that petrarch have shut he eye and he heart to laura suppose -- i do not choose to suppose anything of the kind say mrs crowder thee try to do right but i be glad thee do not deprive the world of any of petrarch 's poetry but now i want thee to tell we something about ancient egypt and those wonderfully cultivate people who build pyramid and carve hieroglyphic perhaps thee see they build the temple of the sun at heliopolis mr crowder shake he head that be before my time say he this be like a electric shock to both of we if we have be more conversant with ancient chronology we might have understand but we be not so conversant abraham isaac mose ejaculate mr crowder thee know they all and yet egypt be civilized before thy time do thee mean that oh yes say mr crowder i be of the time of abraham and when he be bear the glory of egypt be at they height it be difficult to get these thing straight in one 's mind say mr crowder as thee have live so long it seem a pity that thee be not bear sooner i have often think that say she husband but we should all try to be content with what we have and now let we skip out of those region of the dusky past i feel in the humor of tell a love-story and one have just come into my mind thee be so fond of that sort of thing say he wife with a smile that we will not interfere with thee in the summer of the year 950 say mr crowder i be travel and have just come over from france into the province of piedmont in northern italy i be then in fairly easy circumstance and be engage in make some botanical research for a little book which i have plan to write on a medical subject i will explain to you later how i come to do a great deal of that sort of thing late upon a warm afternoon i be enter the town of ivrea and pass a large stone building i stop to examine some leaf on a bush which grow by the roadside while i be do this and compare the shape and size of the leaf with some drawing i have in a book which i take from my pocket i hear a voice behind I and apparently above I some one be speak to I and speak in latin i look around and up but could see no one but above I about ten or twelve foot from the ground there be a long narrow slit of a window such as be see in prison again i hear the voice and it say to I distinctly in latin ` be you free to go where you choose ' it be the voice of a woman as i wish to understand the situation better before i answer i go over to the other side of the road where i could get a better view of the window there i see behind this narrow open a part of the face of a woman this stone edifice be evidently a prison i approach the window and standing under it first look from side to side to see that no one be come along the road i say in latin ' i be free to go where i choose ' then the voice above say ` wait ' but it speak in italian this time you may be sure i wait and in a few minute a little package drop from the window and fall almost at my foot i stoop and pick it up it be a piece of paper in which be wrap a bit of mortar to give it weight i open the paper and read write in a clear and scholarly hand these word : ' i be a most unfortunate prisoner i believe you be a honest and true man because i see you study plant and read from a book which you carry if you wish to do more good than you ever do before come to this prison again after dark ' i look up and say quickly in italian ' i shall be here ' i be about to speak again and ask for some more definite direction but i hear the sound of voice around a turn in the road and i think it better to continue my walk into the town that night as soon as it be really dark i be again at the prison i easily find the window for i have note that it be so many pace from a corner of the building but there be no light in the narrow slit and although i wait some time i hear no voice i do not dare to call for the prisoner might not be alone and i might do great mischief my eye be accustom to the darkness and it be starlight i walk along the side of the building examine it carefully and i soon find a little door in the wall as i stand for a few moment before this door it suddenly open and in front of I stand a big soldier he wear a wide hat and a little sword and evidently be not surprise to see I i think it well however to speak and i say : ` could you give a mouthful of supper to a -- ' he do not allow I to finish my sentence but put he hand upon my shoulder say gruffly : ` come in do not you waste you breath talk about supper ' i enter and the door be close behind I i follow this man through a stone passageway and he take I to a little stone room '' wait here ' he say and he shut I in i be in pitch-darkness and have no idea what be go to happen next after a little time i see a streak of light come through a keyhole then a inner door open and a young woman with a lamp come into the room now do the love-story begin ask he wife not yet say mr crowder the young woman look at I and i look at she she be a pretty girl with black eye i do not express my opinion of she but she be not so reticent ` you look like a good old man ' she say ' i think you may be trust come ' she speech be provincial and she be plainly a servant i follow she ` now for the mistress ' say i to myself thee may have look like a old man remark mr crowder but thee do not think like one she husband laugh i mount some stone step and be soon show into a room where stand a lady wait for I as the light of the lamp carry by the maid fall upon she face i think i have never see a more beautiful woman she dress she carriage and she speech show she to be a lady of rank she be very young scarcely twenty i think this lady immediately begin to ask I question she have perceive that i be a stranger and she want to know where i come from what be my business and as much as i could tell she of myself ' i know you be a scholar ' she say ` because of you book and i believe in scholar ' then briefly she tell I she story and what she want of I she be the young queen adelheid the widow of king lothar who have recently die and she be then suffer a series of harsh persecution from the present king berengar ii who in this way be endeavor to force she to marry he son adalbert she hate this young man and positively refuse to have anything to do with he this charming and royal young widow be bright intelligent and have a mind of she own it be easy to see that she have form a scheme for she deliverance and she have be wait to find some one to help she carry it out now she think i be the man she have be look for i be elderly apparently respectable and she have to trust somebody this be she scheme she be well aware that unless some powerful friend interfere in she behalf she would be oblige to marry adalbert or remain in prison for the rest of she life which would probably be unduly shorten therefore she have make up she mind to appeal to the court of the emperor otto i of germany and she want I to carry a letter to he i stand silent earnestly consider this proposition and as i do so she gaze at I as if she whole happiness in this world depend upon my decision i be not long in make up my mind on the subject i tell she that i be willing to help she and would undertake to carry a letter to the emperor and i do not doubt from what i have hear of this noble prince that he would come to she deliverance but i furthermore assure she that the moment it become know that the emperor be about to interfere in she behalf she would be in a position of great danger and would probably disappear from human sight before relief could reach she in that prison she be utterly helpless and to appeal for help would be to bring down vengeance upon herself the first thing to do therefore be to escape from this prison and get to some place where for a time at least she could defend herself against berengar while wait for otto to take she under he protection she see the force of my remark and we discuss the matter for half a hour and when i leave -- be warn by the soldier on guard who be in love with the queen 's black-eyed maid that it be time for I to depart -- it be arrange that i should return the next night and confer with the fair adelheid there be several conference and the unfaithful sentinel grumble a good deal i can not speak of all the plan and project which we discuss but at last one of they be carry out one dark rainy night adelheid change clothes with she maid actually deceive the guard -- not the fellow who have admit I -- with a story that she have be send in great haste to get some medicine for she royal mistress and join I outside the prison there we mount horse i have in readiness and ride away from ivrea we be bind for the castle of canossa a strong-hold of considerable importance where my royal companion believe she could find refuge at least for a time i can not tell you of all the adventure we have upon that difficult journey we be pursue we be almost capture we meet with obstacle of various kind which sometimes seem insurmountable but at last we see the wall of canossa rise before we and we be safe adelheid be very grateful for what i have do and as she have now learn to place full reliance upon I she insist that i should be the bearer of a letter from she to the emperor otto i should not travel alone but be accompany by a sufficient retinue of soldier and attendant and should go as she ambassador the journey be a long and a slow one but i be rather glad of it for it give I a opportunity to ponder over the most ambitious scheme i have ever form in the whole course of my life greater than to be autocrat of all the russia exclaim mr crowder yes he reply that opportunity come to I suddenly and i accept it i do not plan it out and work for it besides it could be only a transitory thing but what now occupy I be a grand idea the good effect of which if it should be carry out might endure for century it be simply this : i have become greatly attach to the young queen widow whose cause i have espouse i have spend more than a month with she in the castle at canossa and there i learn to know she well and to love she she be indeed a most admirable woman and charming in every way she appear to place the most implicit trust in I tell I of all she affair and ask my opinion about almost everything she propose to do in a word i be in love with she and want to marry she thee certainly have lofty notion but do not think i object say mr crowder it be chinese and tartar i do not like it might seem at first sight he continue that i be aim above I but the more i reflect the more firmly i believe that it would be very good for the lady as well as for I in the first place she have no reason to expect a matrimonial union worthy of she adalbert she have every reason to despise and there be no one else belong to the riotous aristocratic faction of italy who could make she happy or give she a suitable position in all she native land there be not a prince to whom she would not have to stoop in order to marry he but to I she need not stoop no man on earth possess a more noble lineage i be of the house of shem a royal priest after the order of melchizedek and king of salem no line of imperial ancestry could claim precedence of that mr crowder look with almost reverent awe into the face of she husband and that be the blood she say which flow in the vein of we child yes say he that be the blood after a slight pause mr crowder continue : i will now go on with my tale of ambition a grand career would open before I i would lay all my plan and hope before the emperor otto who would naturally be incline to assist the unfortunate widow but he would be still more willing to do so when i tell he of the future which might await she if my plan should be carry out as he be then engage in work with a noble ambition for the benefit of he own dominion he would doubtless be willing to do something for the good of land beyond he boundary it ought not to be difficult to convince he that there could be no wiser no nobler way of champion the cause of adelheid than by enable I to perform the work i have plan all that would be necessary for he to do would be to furnish I with a moderate military force with this i would march to canossa there i would espouse adelheid then i would proceed to ivrea would dethrone the wicked berengar would proclaim adelheid queen in he place with myself as king consort then with the assistance and backing of the imperial german i would no doubt soon be able to maintain my royal pretension once self-supporting and rely upon we italian subject for we army and finances i would boldly re-establish the great kingdom of lombardy to which charlemagne have put a end nearly two hundred year before then would begin a grand system of reform and national progress pavium should be my capital but the beneficent influence of my rule should move southward i would make a alliance with the pope i would crush and destroy the faction which be shake the foundation of church and state i would still further extend my power -- i would become the imperial ruler of italy with adelheid as my queen over and over again i work out and arrange this grand scheme and when i reach the court of the emperor otto it be all as plain in my mind as if it have be copy on parchment i be very well receive by the emperor and he read with great interest and concern the letter i have bring he he give I several private audience and ask I many question about the fair young widow who have meet with so many persecution and misfortune this interest greatly pleased I but i do not immediately submit to he my plan for the relief of adelheid and the great good of the italian nation i would wait a little i must make he better acquaint with myself but the imperial otto do not wait on the third day after my arrival i be call into he cabinet and inform that he intend to set out himself at the head of a army that he should relieve the unfortunate lady from she persecution and establish she in she rights whatever they might prove to be he enthusiastic manner in speaking of he intention assure I that i need not trouble myself to say one word about my plan now -- would you believe it -- that intermeddle monarch take out of my hand the whole grand ambitious scheme i have so carefully devise he go to canossa he marry adelheid he march upon berengar he subjugate he and make he he vassal he form a alliance with pope john xii he be proclaimed king of the lombard he be crown with he queen in st peter 's he eventually acquire the southern portion of italy all this be exactly what i have intend to do mr crowder laugh in one way thee be serve quite right for thee make all thy plan without ever ask the beautiful young ex-queen whether she would have thee or not in the tone of this fair lady 's voice there be evident indication of mental relief and what do thee do then she ask i hope thee get some reward for all thy faithful exertion i receive nothing at the time mr crowder reply and as i do not care to accompany the emperor into italy for probably i would be recognize as the man who have assist adelheid to escape from the prison at ivrea and as i be not at all sure that the emperor would remember that i need protection i think it well to protect myself and so i journey back into france as well as i could this be not very well for in purchase the necessary fine clothes which i deem it proper to wear in the presence of the royal lady whose interest i have in charge in buy horse and in many incidental expense i have spend my money i be too proud to ask otto to reimburse I for that would have be nothing but charity on he part and of course i could not expect the fair adelheid to think of my possible financial need so away i go a poor wanderer on foot and the imperial otto ride forward to love honor and success a dreadful shame exclaim mr crowder it seem as if thee always carry a horn about with thee so that thee might creep out of the little end of it but my adventure with adelheid do not end here he say about fifty year after this she be queen regent in italy during the infancy of she grandchild otto iii be in rome and very poor i determine to go to she not to seek for charity but to recall myself to she notice and to boldly ask to be reimburse for my expense when assist she to escape from ivrea and in afterward go as she ambassador to otto i in other word i want to present my bill for enable she to take she seat upon the throne of the ` holy roman empire of the german nation ' as a proof that i be the man i assume to be i take with I a ring of no great value but set with she royal seal which she have give I when she send I to otto well i will not spend much time on this part of the story by means of the ring i be accord a interview with the regent she be then a old woman over seventy year of age when i introduce myself to she and tell she my errand she become very angry ' i remember very well ' she say ` the person you speak of and he be long since dead he be a old man when i take he into my service you may be he son or some one else who have hear how he be employ by I at any rate you be a impostor how do you come into possession of this ring the man to whom i give it have no right to keep it he should have return it to I when he have perform he duty ' i try to convince she that there be no reason to suppose that the man who have assist she could not be live at this day he need only be about one hundred year old and that age be not uncommon i affirm most earnestly that the ring have never be out of my possession and that i should not have come to she if i have not believe that she would remember my service and be at least willing to make good the considerable sum i have expend in she behalf now she arise in royal wrath ` how dare you speak to I in that way ' she say ` you be a younger man at this moment than that old stranger you represent yourself to be ' then she call she guard and have I send to prison as a cheat and a impostor i remain in prison for some time but as no definite charge be make against I i be not bring to trial and after a time be release to make room for somebody else i get away as soon as i could and thus end my most ambitious dream vii now my dear say mr crowder regard he wife with a tender kindness which i have frequently notice in he just for a change i know you would like to hear of a career of prosperity would not you indeed i would say mr crowder you will have notice say she husband that there have be a great deal of variety in my vocation in fact i have not mention a quarter of the different trade and calling in which i have be engage it be sometimes desirable and often absolutely necessary for I to change my method of make a living but during one epoch of my life i steadily devoted myself to a single profession for nearly four hundred year i be engage almost continuously in the practice of medicine i find it easier for I as a doctor to change my place of residence and to appear in a new country with as much property as i could carry about with I than if i have do so in any other way a prosperous and elderly man come as a stranger from a far country would under ordinary circumstance be regard with suspicion unless he be able to give some account of he previous career but a doctor from a far country be always welcome if he could cure people of they ailment they do not ask anything about the former circumstance of he life it be perfectly natural for a learn man to travel do thee regularly study and go to college ask mrs crowder or be thee a quack oh i study say she husband smile and under the best master i have always a fancy for that sort of thing and in the day of the patriarch when there be no regular doctor i be often call upon as i tell you oh yes say he wife thee rub joshua with gravel and pepper and cure he say he you ought not to have omit that but it be not until about the fifth century before christ that i thought of really study medicine i be in the island of cos where i have go for a very queer reason the great painter apelle live there and i go for the purpose of study art under he i be tire of most of the thing i have be do and i think it would be a good idea to become a painter apelle give I no encouragement when i apply to he he tell I i be entirely too old to become a pupil ` by the time you would really know how to paint ' say he ` suppose you have any talent for it you ought to be begin to arrange you affair to get ready to die ' of course this admonition have no effect upon I and i keep on with my draw lesson if i could not become a painter of eminence i think that at least i might be able if i understand draw to become a better schoolmaster -- if i should take up that profession again one day apelle say to I after glance at the drawing on which i be engage : ` if you be ten year younger you might do something in the field of art for you would make a excellent model for the picture i be about to begin but at you present age you would not be able to sustain the fatigue of remain in a constrain position for any length of time ' ` what be the subject ' i ask ' a centurion in battle ' say he the next day i appear before apelle with my hair crop short and my face without a vestige of a beard ` do i look young enough now to be you model ' say i the painter look at I in surprise ` yes ' say he ` you look young enough but of course you be the same age as you be yesterday however if you would like to try the model business i will make some sketch of you ' for more than a month nearly every day i stand as a model to apelle for he great picture of a centurion whose sword have be stricken from he hand and who in desperation be prepare to defend himself against he enemy with the arm which nature have give he be that picture extant i ask mr crowder smile none of apelle 's painting be in existence now he answer while i be act as model to apelle -- and i may remark that i never grow tired of stand in the position he desire -- i listen with great satisfaction to the conversation between he and the friend who call upon he while he be at work the chief of these be hippocrate the celebrated physician between whom and apelle a strong friendship exist hippocrate be a man of great common sense he do not believe that disease be cause by spirit and demon and all that sort of thing and in many way he make himself very interesting to I so in course of time after have visit he a good deal i make up my mind to quit the study of art and go into that of medicine i get on very well and after a time i practice with he in many case and he must have have a good deal of confidence in I for when the king of persium send for he to come to he court offer he all sort of munificent reward hippocrate decline but he suggest to I that i should go ` you look like a doctor ' say he ` the king would have confidence in you simply on account of you presence and besides you do know a great deal about medicine ' but i do not go to persium and shortly after that i leave the island of cos and give up the practice of medicine later in the second century before christ i make the acquaintance of a methodist doctor -- a what mr crowder and i exclaimed at the same moment he laugh i think that would surprise you but it be true of course it be true say he wife color a little do thee think i would doubt anything thee tell I if thee have say that abraham have a quaker cook i would have believe it and if i have tell you that say mr crowder it would have be so but to explain about this methodist doctor in those day the physician be divide into three school : empiric dogmatist and methodist this man i speak of -- asclepiade -- be the lead methodist physician depend as the name suggest upon regular method of treatment instead of experiment and theory adapt to the particular case in hand he also be a man of great good sense and be very witty besides he make a good deal of fun of other physician and use to call the system of hippocrate ` meditation on death ' i study with he for some time but it be not until the first century of the present era that i really begin the practice of my profession then i make the acquaintance of the great galen he be a man who be not only a physician but a accomplished surgeon and this could be say of very few people in that age of the world i study anatomy and surgery under he and afterward practice with he as i have do with hippocrate the study of anatomy be rather difficult in those day because the roman law forbid the dissection of citizen and the anatomist have to depend for they knowledge of the human frame upon they examination of the body of enemy kill in battle or those of slave in whom no one take a interest but most of all upon the body of ape great number of these beast be bring from africa solely for the use of the roman surgeon and in that connection i remember a incident which be rather curious i have not finish my study under galen when that great master one day inform I that a trader have bring he a ape which have be confine in a small building near he house he ask I to go out and kill it and have it bring into he dissecting-room where he be to deliver a lecture to some student i start for the building refer to on the way i be meet by the trader he be a vile-looking man with black matted hair and little eye who do not look much higher in intelligence than the brute he deal in he grin diabolically as he lead I to the little house and open the door i look in there be no ape there but in one corner sit a dark-brown african girl i look at the man in surprise ` the ape i be to bring get away from I ' he say ` but that thing will do a great deal better and i will not charge any more for it than for the ape kill it and we will put it into a bag and carry it to the doctor he will be glad to see what we have bring he instead of a ape ' i angrily order the man to leave the place and take the girl by the arm -- although i have a good deal of trouble in catch she -- i lead she to galen and tell he the story and what become of the poor thing ask mrs crowder galen buy she from the man at the price of a ape and try to have she educate as a servant but she be a wild creature and could not be teach much in some way or other the people in charge of the amphitheater get possession of she and i hear that she be to figure in the game at a approach great occasion i be shock and grieve to hear this for i have take a interest in the girl and i know what it mean for she to take part in the game in the arena i try to buy she but it be of no use : she be want for a particular purpose on the day she be to appear in the arena i be there i do not see how thee could do it say mr crowder she face quite pale people 's sensibility be different in those day say she husband i do not suppose i could do such a thing now after a time she be bring out and leave entirely alone in the middle of the great space she be nearly frighten to death by the people and the fear of some unknown terror tremble from head to foot she look from side to side and at last sink crouch on the ground everybody be quiet for it be not know what be to happen next then a grate sound be hear with the clank of a iron door and a large brown bear appear in the arena the crouch african fix she eye upon he but do not move -lrb- illustration : ` the crouch african fix she eye upon he ' -rrb- the idea of a combat between this tender girl and a savage bear could not be entertain what be about to occur seem simply a piece of brutal carnage with nothing to make it interesting a great many people express they dissatisfaction the hard-hearted populace even if they do not care about fair play in they game do desire some element of chance which would give flavor to the cruelty but here be nothing of the sort it would have be as well to feed the beast with a sheep the bear however seem to look upon the performance as one which would prove very satisfactory he be hungry not have have anything to eat for several day and here be a appetizing young person wait for he to devour she he have fix he eye upon she the moment he appear and have pay no attention whatever to the crowd by which he be surround he give a slight growl the hair on he neck stand up and he make a quick movement toward the girl but she do not wait for he spring to she foot she flee the bear after she now follow one of the most exciting chase ever know in the history of the roman amphitheater that frighten girl as swift as a deer run around and around the vast space follow closely by she savage pursuer but although he be active and powerful and unusually swift for a bear he could not catch she around and around she go and around go the red-eyed beast behind she but he could not gain upon she and she give no sign that she strength be give out now the audience begin to perceive that a contest be really go on : it be a contest of speed and endurance and the longer the girl run the more inclined the people be to take she part at last there be a great shout that she should be allow to escape a little door be open in the side of the amphitheater she shoot through it and it be close almost in the face of the panting and furious bear what become of the poor girl exclaim mr crowder a sculptor buy she say mr crowder he want to use she as a model for a statue of the swift diana but this never come to anything the girl could not be make to stand still for a moment she be in a chronic condition of be frighten to death after that i hear of she no more it be easy for people to disappear in rome but this incident in the arena be remembered and talk about for many year afterward the fact that a girl be possess of such extraordinary swiftness that she would have be able to escape from a wild beast by means of she speed alone have she be in a open plain be consider one of the most interesting natural wonder which have be bring to the notice of the roman people by the sport in the arena fortunately say mrs crowder thee do not -- no say she husband i do not i require more than speed in a case like that and now i think say he rise we must call this session conclude the next day i be oblige to bid farewell to the crowder and my business arrangement make it improbable that i should see they again for a long time -- i could not say how long as i bade mr crowder farewell and stand hold he hand in mine he smile and say : that be right look hard at I study every line in my face and then when you see I again you will be better able -- not a bit say mr crowder he be just as able to judge now as he will be if he stay away for twenty year i believe she as i warmly shake she hand and i believe that i shall always continue to believe she end of the project gutenberg ebook of the vizier of the two-horned alexander by frank r stockton
