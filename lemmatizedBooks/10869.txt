already the thing he have fear have overtake he she listen intently even then she seem to sense the soundless footstep of disaster stray in the decayed house and search too a morbid desire to satisfy herself that she uncle 's silence mean nothing evil drive she upstairs she stand in the square main hall at the head of the stair listen she uncle 's bedroom door lay straight ahead to she right and leave narrow corridor lead to the wing she room and bobby 's and a spare room be in the right-hand wing the opposite corridor be seldom use for the left-hand wing be the oldest portion of the house and in the march of year too many legend have gather about it the large bedroom be there with its private hall beyond and a narrow enclosed staircase descend to the library originally it have be the custom for the head of the family to use that room its ancient furniture still fade within stain wall for many year no one have sleep in it because it have sheltered too much suffering because it have witness the reluctant spiritual departure of too many blackburn katherine shrink a little from the black entrance of the corridor but she anxiety centre on the door ahead she be about to call when a stir beyond it momentarily reassure she the door open and she uncle step out he wear a untidy dressing-gown he hair be disorder he face appear grayer and more haggard than it have downstairs a light candle shake in he right hand what be you do up here katy he quaver she break down before the picture of he increase fear he shuffle closer what you cry for katy she control herself she beg he for a

worry about except bobby yes there be she cry yes there be he pay no attention to she fright he enter the corridor she hear he shuffling between its narrow wall she see he candle disappear in its gloomy reach she run to she own room and lock the door she hurry to the window and lean out she body shake she tooth chatter as if from a sudden chill the quiet assure tread of disaster come nearer the two wing stretch at right angle from the main building form a narrow court cloud harry the moon fail quite to destroy its power so that she could see across the court the facade of the old wing and the two window of the large room through whose curtain a spectral glow be diffuse she hear one of the window open with a grating noise the court be a sound board it carry to she even the shuffling of the old man 's foot as he must have approach the bed the glow of he candle vanish she hear a rustling as if he have stretch himself on the bed a sound like a long-drawn sigh she try to tell herself there be no danger -- that these peculiar action spring from the old man 's fancy -- but the house she surroundings she loneliness contradict she to she over-acute sens the thought of blackburn in that room so often consecrate to the formulum of death suggest a special and unaccountable menace under such a strain the supernatural assumed vague and singular shape she sleep for only a little while then she lay awake listen with a grow expectancy for some message to slip across the court the moon have cease struggle the wind cry the baying of a dog echo mournfully from a great distance it be like a remote alarm bell which vibrate too perfectly whose resonance be too prolonged she sit upright she spring from the bed and she heart beat insufferably feel she way to the window from the wing opposite the message have come -- a soft shroud sound another long-drawn sigh she try to call across the court at first no response come from she tight throat when it do at last she voice be unfamiliar in she own ear the voice of one who have to know a thing but shrink from ask uncle the wind mock she it be nothing she tell herself nothing but she vigil have be too long she loneliness too complete she earlier impression of the presence of death in the decaying house tighten its hold she have to assure herself that sila blackburn sleep untroubled the thing she have hear be peculiar and he have not answer across the court the dark empty corridor at first be a impassable barrier but while she put on she slipper and she dressing-gown she strengthen she courage there be a bell rope in the upper hall she might get jenkin when she stand in the main hall she hesitate it would probably be a long time provide he hear at all before jenkin could answer she she candle outline the entrance to the musty corridor just a few run step down there a quick rap at the door and perhaps in a instant she uncle 's voice and the bless power to return to she room and sleep while she fear grow she call on she pride to let she accomplish that brief abhorrent journey then for the first time a different doubt come to she as she wait alone in this disturbing nocturnal intimacy of a old house she shrink from no thought of human intrusion and she wonder if she uncle have be afraid of that too of the sort of thing that might lurk in the ancient wing with its recollection of birth and suffering and death but he have go there as a escape surely he have be afraid of man it shame she that in spite of that she fear define itself ever more clearly as something indefinable with a passionate determination to strangle such thought she hold she breath she try to close she mind she enter the corridor she run its length she knock at the lock door of the old bedroom she shrink as the echo rattle from the dingy wall where she candle cast strange reflection there be no other answer a sense of a intolerable companionship make she want to cry out for brilliant light for help she scream uncle sila uncle sila through the silence that crush she voice she become aware finally of the accomplishment of its mission by death in this house and she flee into the main hall she jerk at the bell rope the contact steady she stimulate she to reason one slender hope remain the oppressive bedroom might have drive sila blackburn through the private hall and down the enclosed staircase perhaps he sleep on the lounge in the library she stumble down hope to meet jenkin she cross the hall and the dining room and enter the library she bent over the lounge it be empty she candle be reflect in the face of the clock on the mantel its hand point to half-past two she pull at the bell cord by the fireplace why do not the butler come alone she could not climb the enclosed staircase to try the other door it seem impossible to she that she should wait another instant alone -- the butler as old and as gray as sila blackburn falter in he start back when he see she my god miss katherine what be the matter you look like death there be death she say she indicate the door of the enclosed staircase she lead the way with the candle the panelled narrow hall be empty that door too be lock and the key she know must be on the inside who -- who be it jenkin ask who would be in that room have mr bobby come back she descend to the library before answer she put the candle down and spread she hand it be happen jenkin -- whatever he fear not mr sila we have to break in she say with a shiver get a hammer a chisel whatever be necessary but if there be anything wrong the butler object if anybody 's be there the other door must be open she shake she head those two first of all face that extraordinary puzzle how have the murderer enter and leave the room with both door lock on the inside with the window too high for use they go to the upper story she urge the butler into the sombre corridor we have to know she whisper what be happen beyond those lock door she still vibrate to the feeling of unconformable force in the old house jenkin she see respond to the same superstitious misgiving he insert the chisel with maladroit hand he force the lock back and open the door dust arise from the long-disused room fleck the yellow candle flame they hesitate on the threshold they force themselves to enter then they look at each other and smile with relief for sila blackburn in he dressing-gown lay on the bed he placid unmarked face upturn as if sleep why miss jenkin gasp he be all right almost with confidence katherine walk to the bed uncle sila -- she begin and touch he hand she draw back until the wall support she jenkin must have read everything in she face for he whimper : but he look all right he can not be -- cold -- already if i have not touch -- the horror of the thing descend upon she stifle think automatically she leave the room and tell jenkin what to do after he have telephone police headquarters in the county seat and have summon doctor groom a country physician she

grow silent on enter the room for a long time he stare at the body in the candle light make as much of a examination as he could evidently without physical contact why do he ever come here to sleep he ask in he rumble bass voice nasty room unhealthy room ten to one you be a formality policeman coroner 's a formality he sneer a little i daresay he die what the hard-headed world will call a natural death wonder what the coroner 'll say the detective do not answer he shoot rapid uneasy glance about the room in which a single candle burn after a time he say with a accent of complete conviction : that man be murder perhaps the doctor 's significant word add to she earlier dread of the abnormal make katherine read in the detective 's manner a apprehension of condition unfamiliar to the brutal routine of he profession she glance be restless too she have a feeling that from the shadowed corner of the fade musty room invisible face mock the man 's stubbornness all this she recite to bobby when under extraordinary circumstance neither of they could have foresee he arrive at the cedar many hour later of the earlier portion of the night of he grandfather 's death bobby retain a minute recollection the remainder be like a dim appalling nightmare whose impulse remain hidden when he go to he apartment to dress for dinner he find the letter of which sila blackburn have speak to

recapture the earlier gayety of the evening by continue to drink the wine he determination to go later to the cedar in spite of graham 's doubt -- of all these thing no particular lack he remember pay the check as he usually do when he dine with parede he recall study the time-table and finding that he have just miss another train marium 's spirit rise then he be persuade to accompany she and parede to the music hall in she dressing-room while she be on the stage he play with the box of make-up splash the mirror with various color while parede sit silently watch the alteration he be sure

demand he time-table scanning the column of close figure there be one she have say at twelve-fifteen -- time for a little something in the cafe and who know if you be agreeable i might forgive everything and dance with you once bobby on the public floor so he sit for some time expectant with parede watch the boisterous dancer listen to the violent music sip absent-mindedly at he glass he wonder why parede have grow so quiet i must not miss that twelve-fifteen he say you know carlo you be not quite fair to hartley he be a splendid fellow room with I at college play on same team and all that only want I to do the right thing must say it be the right thing i will not miss that twelve-fifteen graham parede sneer be a wonderful type -- apollo in the flesh and billy Sunday in the conscience then as bobby start to protest marium enter more dazzling than at dinner and the dancer sway less boisterously the chatter at the table subside the orchestra seem to hesitate as a sort of obeisance a man bobby have never see before follow she to the table he middle-aged figure be loudly clothe he face be coarse and clean shaven he acknowledge the introduction sullenly i have only a minute bobby say to maria he continue however to raise he glass indifferently to he lip all at once he glass shake marium 's dark and sparkling face become blur he could no longer define the feature of the stranger he have never before experienced anything of the kind he try to account for it but he mind become confused marium he burst out why be you look at I like that she contralto laugh ripple bobby look so funny carlo leetle bobby look so queer what be the matter with he bobby 's anger be lose in the increase confusion of he sens but through that mental turmoil tear the thought of graham and he intention of go to the cedar with shake finger he drag out he watch he could not read the dial he brace he hand against the table thrust back he chair and arise the room tumble about he before he eye the dancer make long nebulous band of color in which nothing have form or coherence instinctively he feel he have not dine recklessly enough to account for these amazing symptom he be suddenly afraid carlo he whisper he hear marium 's voice dimly : take he home a hand touch he arm with a supreme effort of will he walk from the room guide by the hand on he arm and always he brain record fewer and fewer impression for he memory to struggle with later at the cloak room some one help he put on he coat he be walk down step he be in some kind of a conveyance he do not know what it be a automobile a carriage a train he do not know he only understand that it go swiftly sway from side to side through a sable pit whenever he mind move at all it come back to that sensation of a black pit in which he remain suspend swing from side to side try to struggle up against impossible odds once or twice word flash like fire through the pit : tyrant -- fool to go from a long immersion deeper in the pit he struggle frantically he must get out somehow he must find wing he realize that he eye be close he try to open they and fail so the pit persist and he surrender himself as one accept death to its hateful blackness abruptly he experience a momentary release there be no more sway no more movement of any kind he hear a strange melancholy voice whisper without word always whisper with a futile perseverance as if it wish he to understand something it could not express what be it try to tell I he ask himself then he understand it be the voice of the wind and it try to tell he to open he eye and he find that he could but in spite of he desire they close again almost immediately yet from that swift glimpse a picture outline itself later in he memory in the midst of wild rolling cloud the moon be a drown face stunt tree bent before the wind like puny man who strain impotently to advance over there be one more like a real man -- a figure bobby think with a black thing over its face -- a mask this be the forest near the cedar bobby say to himself i have come to face the old devil after all he hear he own voice harsh remote unnatural speaking to the dim figure with a black mask that wait half hide by the strain tree why be i here in the wood near the cedar and he think the thing answer : because you hate you grandfather bobby laugh think he understand the figure in the black mask that accompany he be he conscience he could understand why it go mask the wind resume its whisper the figure strain like puny man fight harder the drown face disappear wet and helpless bobby feel himself sink back back into the sable pit i do not want to go he moan a long time afterward he hear a whisper again and he wonder if it be the wind or he conscience he laugh through the blackness because the word seem so absurd take off you shoe and carry they in you hand always do that it be the only safe way he laugh again think : what a careful conscience he retain only one more impression he be dully aware that some time have pass he shiver he think the wind have grow angry with he for it no longer whisper it shriek and he could make nothing of its wrath he struggle frantically to emerge from the pit the quality of the blackness deepen he fright grow he feel himself slip slowly at first then faster faster down into impossible depths and there be nothing at all he could do to save himself \* \* \* \* \* go away for god 's sake go away bobby thought he be speak to the sombre figure in the mask he voice arouse he to one more effort at escape but he feel that there be no use he be too deep something hurt he eye he open they and for a time be blind by a narrow shaft of sunlight rest on he face with a effort he move he head to one side and close he eye again at first merely thankful that he have escape from the black hell try to control he sensation of physical evil subtle curiosity force its way into he sick brain and sting he wide awake this time he eye remain open stare about he dilate with a wilder fright than he have experience in the dark maze of he nightmare adventure he have never see this place before he lay on the floor of a empty room the shaft of sunlight that have arouse he enter through a crack in one of the tightly draw blind there be dust and grime on the wail and cobweb cluster in the corner in the silent desert room the beating of he heart become audible he struggle to a sit posture he gasp for breath he know it be very cold in here but perspiration moisten he face he could recall no such suffering as this since when a boy he have slip from the crisis of a destructive fever have he be drug but he have be with friend there be no motive what house be this be it like this room empty and desert how have he come here for the first time he go through that dreadful process of try to draw from the black pit useful memory he start recall the strange voice and its warning for he shoe lay near by as though he might have drop they carelessly when he have enter the room and stretch himself on the floor damp earth adhere to the sole the leather above be scratch then he think that much be right i be in the wood what be i do there that dim figure my imagination he suffer the agony of a man who realize that he have wander unawares in strange place and retain no recollection of he action of he intention he go back to that last unclouded moment in the cafe with marium parede and the stranger where have he go after he have leave they he have look at he watch he have tell himself he must catch the twelve-fifteen train he must have go from the restaurant proceeding automatically and catch the train that would account for the sensation of motion in a swift vehicle and perhaps there have be a taxicab to the station doubtless in the wood near the cedar he have decide it be too late to go in or that it be wiser not to he have answer to the necessity of sleep somewhere but why have he come here where indeed be he at least he could answer that he draw on he shoe -- a pair of patent leather pump he fumble for he handkerchief think he would brush the earth from they he search each of he pocket he handkerchief be go no matter he get to he foot lurch for a moment dizzily he glance with distaste at he rumpled evening clothing to hide it as far as possible he button he overcoat collar about he neck on tip-toe he approach the door and with the emotion of a thief open it quietly he sigh the rest of the house be as empty as this room the hall be thick with dust the rear door by which he must have enter stand half open the lock be break and rusty he commence to understand there be a desert farmhouse less than two mile from the cedar since he have always know about it it be not unusual he should have take shelter there after decide not to go in to he grandfather he step through the doorway to the unkempt yard about whose tumble fence the wood advance thickly he recognize the place for some time he stand ashamed yet fair enough to seek the cause of he experience in some mental unhealth deeper than any reaction from last night 's folly he glance at he watch it be after two o'clock the mournful neighborhood the grow chill in the air the sullen sky urge he away he walk down the road of course he could not go to the cedar in this condition he would return to he apartment in new york where he could bathe change he clothes recover from this feeling of physical ill and remember perhaps something more it be not far to the little village on the railroad and at this hour there be plenty of train he hope no one he know would see he at the station he smile wearily what difference do that make he might as well face old blackburn himself as he be by this time the thing be do the new will

night and this morning before he have awaken in the empty house near he grandfather 's home all that remain be he sensation of travel in a swift vehicle he impression of standing in the forest near the cedar he glimpse of the mask figure which he have call he conscience the echo in he brain of a dream-like voice say : take off you shoe and carry they in you hand always do that it be the only safe way these fact then alone be clear to he : he have wander unconscious in the neighborhood he grandfather have be strangely murder the detective who have meet he in the village practically accuse he of the murder and he could not remember he turn back to he last clear recollection when he have experience he first symptom of slip consciousness he have be in the cafe in new york with carlo parede maria the dancer and a strange man whom maria have bring to the table through they he might to a extent trace he movement unless they have put he in a cab think he would catch the train of which he have talk for the cedar already the forest crowd the narrow curve road the blackburn place be in the midst of a arid thicket of stunt pine oak and cedar old blackburn have never do anything to improve the estate or its surroundings steadily during he lifetime it have grow more gloomy less habitable with the silent forest thick about he bobby realize that he be no longer alone a crackling twig or a loose stone strike by a foot might have warn he he go slower glance restlessly over he shoulder he see no one but that idea of stealthy pursuit persist undoubtedly it be the detective howell who follow he hope perhaps that he would make some mad effort at escape that he mutter be probably the reason he do not arrest I at the station bobby however have no thought of escape he be impatient to reach the cedar where he might learn all that howell have not tell he about he grandfather 's death a high wooden fence straggle through the forest the driveway swing from the road through a broad gateway the gate stand open bobby remember that it have be old blackburn 's habit to keep it close he enter and hurry among the tree to the edge of the lawn in the center of which the house stand feeling as guilty as the detective think he he pause there and examine the house for some sign of life at first it seem as dead as the forest strip by autumn -- almost as gloomy and arid as the wilderness which straggle close about it he have no eye for the symmetry of its wing which form the court in the center of which a abandon fountain stand he study the window picture katherine alone surround by the complication of this unexpected tragedy he feeling of a inimical watchfulness persist a click sound swing he back to the house the front door have be open and in the black frame of the doorway as he look katherine and graham appear and he know the resolution of he last doubt be at hand katherine have throw a cloak over she graceful figure she sunny hair stray in the wind but she face while it have lose nothing of its beauty project even at this distance a sense of weariness of anxiety of utter fear bobby be grateful for graham 's presence it be like the man to assume he responsibility to sacrifice himself in he service he straighten he must meet these two through he own wretched appearance and position he must develop for katherine more clearly than ever graham 's superiority he step out call softly : katherine she start she turn in he direction and come swiftly toward he she spread she hand bobby bobby where have you be there be tear in she eye they be like

telephone he could not understand the man 's insistence on remain where clearly he be a intruder he enter he bedroom which he have occupy only once or twice during the last few month the place seem unfamiliar as he bath and dress he sense of strangeness grow and he understand why the last time he have be here he have stand in no personal danger there have be no black parenthesis in he life during the stretch of which he might have commit a unspeakable crime for he could not believe as firmly as katherine do since he could not remember he might have do anything come he call in response

parede be wander about the place i would give a lot to know what he be after at the cedar katherine be in she room try to rest after last night i fancy and bobby ask the detective -- howell if he be back from the station graham answer he be keep low i wonder if it be he or parede who follow you through the wood why should carlo have follow I bobby ask i have be think it over hartley it be not a

nuisance but i be only try to get you back on the straight path where you have always belong i can not believe you do this thing even unconsciously until i be show proof without a single flaw until the autopsy the only thing we have to work on be that party last night i have telephone to new york and put a trustworthy man on the heel of marium and the stranger meantime i think i would better watch development here please bobby agree stay with I hartley until this man take some definite action he pick at the fringe of the window curtain if the autopsy show that my grandfather be murder he say either i kill he or else some one have deliberately try to throw suspicion on I for with only a motive to go on this detective would not be so sure why in the name of heaven should any one kill the old man place all this money in my hand and at the same time send I to the electric chair do not you see how absurd it be that carlo marium or any one else should have have a hand in it there be nothing for they to gain from he death i have think and think in such circle until i be almost convince of the logic of my guilt he draw the curtain farther back and gaze across the court at the room where he grandfather lay dead one of the two window of the room be a little raise but the blind be closely draw i do hate he he muse there be that ever since i can remember he do thing to make I despise he have -- have you see he graham nod howell take I in he look perfectly normal -- not a mark i do not want to see he bobby say he draw back from the window point the detective howell have stroll into the court he hand hang at he side they do not swing as he walk he lip be stretch in that thin straight smile he pause by the fountain glance for a moment anxiously downward then he come on and enter the house he 'll be restless graham say until the coroner come and prove or disprove he theory of murder if he question you you would better say nothing for the present from he point of view what you remember of last night would be only damaging i want he to leave I alone bobby say if he do not arrest I i will not have he bully I jenkin knock and enter the old butler be as white-faced as bobby more tremulous the policeman sir he be ask for you tell he i do not wish to see he the detective himself step from the obscurity of the hall smile he queer smile ah you be here mr blackburn i would like a word with you he turn to graham and jenkin alone if you please bobby mutely agree and graham and the butler go out the detective close the door and lean against it study bobby with he narrow eye i do not suppose he begin that there be any use ask you about you movement last night none bobby answer jerkily unless you arrest I and take I before those who ask question with authority the detective 's smile widen no matter i do not come to argue with you about that i be curious to know if you would try to see you grandfather 's body bobby shake he head i take it for grant the room be lock yes the detective answer but some people it seem have skilful way of overcome lock he move to one side place he hand on the door knob i have come to open door for you to give you the opportunity a affectionate grandson must crave bobby hesitate fight back he feeling of repulsion he first instinct to refuse the detective might take it as a evidence against he on the other hand if he go the man would unquestionably try to tear from a meeting between the living and the dead some valuable confirmation of he theory well the detective say what be the matter think the least i could do be to give you a chance would not do it for everybody then everybody have not you affectionate nature bobby advance for god 's sake stop mock I i 'll go since you wish the detective open the door and stand aside to let bobby pass daresay you know the room -- the way to it bobby do not answer he go along the corridor and into the main hall where katherine have meet sila blackburn last night he fight back he aversion and enter the corridor of the old wing he hear the detective behind he he be aware of the man 's narrow eye watch he with a malicious assurance bobby with a feeling of discomfort spring in part from the gloomy passageway pause before the door he grandfather have have the unaccountable whim of enter last night the detective take a key from he pocket and insert it in the lock have some trouble repair the lock this morning he say that fellow jenkin enter with a heavy hand -- a good deal heavier than whoever be here before he he open the door queerest case i have ever see he mumble step in mr blackburn because of the draw blind the room be nearly as dark as the corridor bobby enter slowly he nerve taut against the farther wall the bed be like a enormous shadow without form stay where you be the detective warn until i give you more light you know i would not want you to touch anything because the room be exactly as it be when he be murder bobby experience a swift impulse to strangle the brutal word in the detective 's throat but he stand still while the man go to the bureau strike a match and apply it to a candle the wick burn reluctantly it flicker in the wind that slip past the curtain of the open window come here the detective command roughly bobby drag himself forward until he stand at the foot of the four-poster bed the detective lift the candle and hold it beneath the canopy you look all you want now mr robert blackburn he say grimly bobby conquer the desire to close he eye to refuse to obey he stare at he grandfather and a feeling of wonder grow upon he for sila blackburn rest peacefully in the great bed he eye be close the thick gray brow be no longer gather in the frown too familiar to bobby the face with its gray beard retain no fear no record of a great shock bobby glance at the detective who bent over the bed watch he out of he narrow eye why he ask simply do you say he be murder he be murder the detective answer murder in cold blood and look you here young fellow i know who do it i be go to strap that man in the electric chair he be get just one chance -- if he talk out if he make a clean breast of it across the body he bent closer he hold the candle so that its light search bobby 's face instead of the dead man 's and the uncertain flame be like a ambush for he eye in response to those intolerable word bobby 's sick nerve stretch too tight no masquerade remain before this huntsman who have he victim trap and calmly study he agony the horror of the accusation shot at he across the body of the man he could not be sure he have not murder rob he of he last control he cry out hysterically : why do not you do something for god 's sake why do not you arrest I a chuckle come from the man in ambush behind the yellow flame listen to the boy what be he talk about grief for he grandfather that be what it be -- grief stop bobby shout it be what you have be accuse I with ever since you stop I at the station he indicate the silent form of the old man you keep tell I i murder he why do not you arrest I then why do not you lock I up why do not you put the case on a reasonable basis he wait tremble the flame continue to flicker but the hand hold the candlestick fail to move and bobby know that the eye do not waver either he force he glance from the search flame he manage to lower and steady he voice you can not that be the trouble he be not murder the coroner will tell you so anybody who look at he will tell you so since you have not the nerve to arrest I i be go i be glad to have have this out with you understand i be my own master i do what i please i go where i please at last the candle move to one side the detective straighten and walk to bobby the multitude of small line in he face twitch he voice be too cold for the fury of he word that be just what i want you to do damn you -- anything you please i be accuse nobody but i be get somebody i have get somebody right now for this old man 's murder my man 's go to writhe and burn in the chair confession or no confession now get out of this room since you be so anxious and do not come near it again bobby go at the end of the corridor he hear the closing of the door the scrape of the key he be afraid the detective might follow he to he room to heckle he further to avoid that he hurry to the lower floor he want to be alone he must have time to accustom himself to this degrading fate which loom in the too-close future unless they could demolish the detective 's theory he bobby blackburn would go to the death house a fire blaze in the big hall fireplace parede stand with he back to it smoking and warm he hand a man sit in the shadow of a deep leather chair he rough unpolished boot stretch toward the flaming log as he come down the stair bobby hear the heavy rumble voice of the man in the chair : certainly it be a queer case but not the way howell mean i daresay the old fool die what the world will call a natural death if you smoke so much you will too before long bobby try to slip past but parede see he feel better bobby the boot be draw in from the depths of the chair arise a figure nearly gigantic in the firelight the man 's face at first glance appear to be cover with hair black and curl it straggle over he forehead it circle he mouth and fall in a unkempt beard down he waistcoat the huge man must have be as old as sila blackburn but he show no touch of gray he only concession to age be the sunken and bloodshot appearance of he eye bobby and katherine have always be afraid of this great grim country practitioner who have attend they childish illness that sense of a overpowering and incomprehensible personality have linger even through he graver fear bobby feel a sharp discomfort as he surrender he hand to the other 's absorb grasp i be afraid you come too late this time doctor groom the doctor look he up and down not for you i guess he grumble do not you know you be sick boy bobby shake he head i be very tired that be all i be on my way to the library to try to rest he free he hand the big man nod approvingly i 'll send you a dose he promise and do not you worry about you grandfather 's have be murder by any man i have see the body stuff and nonsense detective 's a ass wait for coroner although i know he be one too i pray bobby answer listlessly that you be right if there be any little thing i can do parede offer formally no no thanks bobby answer he go on to the library he glance with a unpleasant shrinking from the door of the enclosed staircase lead to the private hall just outside the room in which he grandfather lay dead there be no fire here but he wrap himself in a rug and lay on the broad high-backed lounge which be draw close to the fireplace face it he complete weariness conquer he premonition he feeling of helplessness the entrance of jenkin barely arouse he where be you mr robert here bobby answer sleepily the butler walk to the lounge and look over the back to be sure sir i do not see you here he hold out a glass doctor groom say you be to drink this it would make you sleep sir bobby close he eye again put it on the table where i can reach it when i want it yes sir mr robert the policeman do he say anything if i might make so bold as to ask go away bobby groan leave I in peace and peace for a little time come to he it be the sound of voice in the room that arouse he he lay for a time scarcely know where he be but little by little the sickening truth come back and he realize that it be graham and the detective howell who talk close to the window and graham have already fulfil he promise bobby do not want to eavesdrop but it be patent he would embarrass graham by disclose himself now and it be likely graham would be glad of a witness to anything the detective might say it be still light a ray from the low sun enter the window and rest on the door of the enclosed staircase graham 's anxious demand be the first thing bobby hear distinctly -- the thing that warn he to remain secreted i think now with the coroner on he way it be time you define you suspicion a trifle more clearly i be a lawyer in a sense i represent young mr blackburn please tell I why you be so sure he grandfather be murder all right the detective 's level voice come back half a hour ago i would have say no again but now i have get the evidence i want i appreciate mr graham that you be a friend of that young rascal and what i have to say be not pleasant for a friend to hear but first you want to know why i be so sure the case be murder in spite of the doctor who make he diagnosis without really look go on graham say softly bobby wait -- he nerve as tense as they have grow in the presence of the dead man two day ago the detective go on quietly old mr blackburn come to the court house in smithtown and ask for the best detective the district attorney could put he hand on i do not want to blow my own trumpet but i have get away with one or two pretty fair job i have have good offer from private firm in new york so they turn he over to I it be easy to see the old man be scare just as he niece say he be last night the funny part be he would not say definitely what he be afraid of i think he might be shield somebody until he be a little surer of he ground he tell I he be afraid of be murder and he want a good man he could call on to come out here to the cedar if thing get too hot for he i can hear he voice now as distinctly as if he be stand where you be ` my heart 's all right ' he say ` it will not stop awhile yet unless it be make to so if i be find cold some fine morning you can be sure i be put out of the way ' i try to pump he naturally but he would not say another word except that he would send for I if there be time he do not want any fuss make and he give I a handsome present to keep my mouth shut and not to bother he with any more question i figure -- you can not blame I mr graham -- that the old boy be a little crack so i take he money and let it go at that i do not think much more about it until they tell I early this morning he lay dead here under peculiar circumstance odd graham comment it do make it more like murder howell but he do not look like a murder man when you know as much about crime as i do mr graham you 'll realize that murder which be a long time planning be likely to take on one of two appearance -- suicide or natural death all right graham say for the purpose of argument let we agree it be murder even so why do you suspect young blackburn without a scrap of evidence it be plain as the nose on you face the detective answer if old blackburn have live until this morning we young man would have be a pauper as it be he be a millionaire but i do not think he 'll enjoy he money the two have be at sword 's point for a long time robert hate the old man -- never make any bone about it you could not ask for a more damaging motive you can not convict a man on motive graham say shortly you speak of evidence more the detective reply than any jury in the land would ask bobby hold he breath shrink from this information which however he realize it be better he should know when i get here the detective say i decide on the theory of murder to make a careful search as soon as day break i do not have to wait for day though to find one cry piece of evidence for a long time i be alone in the room with the body queer feeling about that room mr graham do not know how to describe it except to say it be uncomfortable too old maybe maybe it be just be there alone with the dead man before the dawn although i think i be harden to that sort of thing anyway i do not like it to keep my spirit up as well as to save time i commence search the place with a candle nothing about the bed nothing in the closet or the bureau he grin sheepishly you know i kind of be afraid to open the closet door then i get on my knee and look under the bed the light be bad and i do not see anything at first after a minute close against the wall i notice something white i reach in and pull it out it be a handkerchief and it have a monogram mr graham -- r b in purple and green he pause graham exclaim sharply bobby feel the net tighten if that evidence be conclusive to the other how much more so be it for he he recall how after awake in the empty house he have search unsuccessfully in all he pocket for he handkerchief intend to brush the dirt from he shoe i go to he room the detective hurry on and find a lot of he clothes and he stationery and he toilet article mark with the same cipher i know my man have make a big mistake -- the sort of mistake every criminal make no matter how clever he be -- and i have he but that be not by any means all do not look so distressed mr graham there be not the slightest chance for he you see i repair the lock and as soon as it be day close the room and go outside to look for sign since nightfall no one have come legitimately through the court except doctor groom and myself we footprint be all right -- make a straight line along the path to the front door in the soft earth by the fountain i find another and a smaller print make by a very neat shoe sir and i say to myself : ` there be almost certainly the footprint of the murderer ' there be plenty of other come across the grass he have evidently avoid the path and there be one directly under the open window where the body lie it be still there perhaps you can see it no matter that be the last one i find the print cease there there be not a one go back and i be fair up a stump then i see a little undefined sign of pressure on the grass and i get a idea ` suppose ' i say ` my man take he shoe off and go around in he stockinged foot ' i could not understand though why he have not think of that before i go back to robert blackburn 's room and get one of he shoe and run into a snag again the sole of the shoe be a trifle larger than the footprint every one of he shoe i try be the same way i argue that the handkerchief be enough but i want this other evidence i simply have to clear up these queer footprint i figure since the murder have be make to look so much like a natural death that

's laugh be disagreeable you try to make a fool of I that be not healthy as bobby hurry across the hall and up the stair he hear parede answer : you should speak to doctor groom he say this place be too crowd by the unpleasant past -- bobby climb out of hearing he enter he bedroom and lock the door he resent parede 's word and attitude which he define as study to draw humor out of a tragic and desperate situation he think of they in no other way he tired mind dismiss they he throw himself on the bed muttering : if i run away i be do for if i stay i be do for he take a fierce twisted joy in one phase of the situation if i be there last night he think howell will never find out how i get into the room because no matter what trap he set i can not tell he he leaden weariness close he eye for a few minute he sleep again once more it be a voice that awaken he -- this time a woman 's raise in a scream he spring up fling open the door and stumble into the corridor katherine stand there hold she dress gown about she with tremble hand the face she turn to bobby be white and panic-stricken she beckon and he follow she to the main hall the other come tear up the stair -- graham parede the detective and the black and gigantic doctor in answer to they quick question she whisper breathlessly : i hear it be just like last night it come across the court and steal in at my window she shake she stretch out she hand in a terrify appeal somebody -- something move in that room where he -- he be dead nonsense the detective say both door be lock and i have the key in my pocket parede fumble with a cigarette you be forget what i say about my sensitive apprehension of strange thing -- the detective interrupt he loudly confidently : i tell you the room be empty except for the murder man -- unless someone 's break down a door katherine cry out : no i hear that same stir something move in there the detective turn brusquely and enter the old corridor we 'll see the other follow katherine be close to bobby he touch she hand he be right katherine no one 's there no one could have be there you must not give way like this i be depend on you -- on you faith she press he hand but she assurance do not diminish the key scrape in the lock they crowd through the doorway after the detective he strike a match and light the candle he hold it over the bed he spring back with a sharp cry unlike he level quality he confident conceit he point they all approximate he helpless gesture he blank amazement for on the bed have occur a abominable change the body of sila blackburn no longer lay peacefully on its back it have be turn on its side and remain in a stark and awkward attitude for the first time the back of the head be disclose they glance focus there -- on the tiny round hole at the base of the brain on the pillow where the head have rest and which they see now be stain with a ugly and irregular splotch of blood bobby see the candle quiver at last in the detective 's hand the man stride to the door lead to the private hall and examine the lock both door he say be lock there be no way in -- he turn to the other spread he hand in justification the candle which he seem to have forget cast gross move shadow over he face and over the face of the dead man at least you 'll all grant I now that he be murder they continue to stare at the body of sila blackburn cold for many hour it be as if he have make this atrocious reveal movement to assure they that he have indeed be murder to expose to they startled eye the sly and deadly method chapter iii howell deliver himself to the abandon room for a long time no one speak the body of sila blackburn have be alone in a lock room yet before they eye it lay turn on its side as if to inform they of the fashion of this murder the tiny hole at the base of the brain the blood-stain on the pillow which the head have conceal offer they mute and ghastly testimony doctor groom be the first to relax he raise he great hairy hand to the bed-post and grasp it he rumble voice lack its usual authority it vibrate with a childish wonder : i be remind that it be not the first time there be be blood from a man 's head on that pillow katherine nod what do you mean the detective snarl there be only one answer to this there must have be a mechanical post-mortem reaction for a moment doctor groom 's laugh fill the old room it cease abruptly he shake he head do not be a fool mr policeman at the most conservative estimate this man have be dead more than thirteen hour even a few instant after death the human body be incapable of any such reaction what then the detective ask some one of we or one of the servant must have overcome the lock again and deliberately disturb the body that must be so but i do not get the motive it be not so doctor groom answer bluntly already the detective have to a large extent control he bewilderment i would like you theory then he say dryly you and mr parede have both be gossip about the supernatural when you first come you hint dark thing you say he would probably die what the world would call a natural death i mean the doctor answer only that mr blackburn 's heart might have fail under the impulse of a sudden fright in this room i also say you remember that the room be nasty and unhealthy plenty of people have remark it before I graham touch the detective 's arm a little while ago you admit yourself that the room be uncomfortable doctor groom smile the detective face he with a fierce belligerency you 'll agree he be murder certainly if you wish to call it that but i ask for the sharp instrument that cause death i want to know how while blackburn lay on he back it be insert through the bed the spring the mattress and the pillow what be you drive at doctor groom point to the dead man i merely repeat that it be not the first time that pillow 's be stain from unusual wound in the head be as you call it a trifle superstitious i merely ask if the coincidence be significant katherine cry out bobby in spite of he knowledge that sooner or later he would be arrest for he grandfather 's murder step forward nodding i know what you mean doctor anybody the doctor say who be ever hear of this house know what i mean we need not talk of that the detective however be insistent parede in he unemotional way express a equal curiosity bobby and katherine have be frighten as child by the story clustering about the old wing they nod from time to time while the doctor hold they in the desolate room with the dead man speaking of the other death it have sheltered sila blackburn 's great grandfather he tell the detective have be carry to that bed from a revolutionary skirmish with a bullet at the base of he brain for many hour he have rave deliriously fight unsuccessfully against the final silence it have be a legend in the family as these young people will tell you that blackburn die hard and there be those who believe that people who die hard leave something behind they -- something that cling to the physical surroundings of they suffering if it be only that one case but it go on and on sila blackburn 's father for instance kill himself here he have lose he money in silly speculation he stand where you stand detective and blow he brain out he fall over and lay where he son lie he head on that pillow sila blackburn be a money grubber he start with nothing but this property and he make a fortune but even he have enough imagination to lock this room up after one more death of that kind it be this girl 's father you be too young katherine to remember it but i take care of he i see it he be carry here after he have be strike at the back of the head in a polo match he die too fight hard god how the man suffer he loosen he bandage toward the end when i get here the pillow be redder than it be to-day it strike I as curious that the first time the room have be sleep in since then it should harbor a death behind lock door -- from a wound in the head parede 's finger be restless as if he miss he customary cigarette the detective stroll to the window very interesting he say extremely interesting for old woman and young child you may classify yourself doctor thanks the doctor rumble i 'll wait until you have tell I how these door be enter how that wound be make how this body turn on its side in a empty room the detective glance at bobby he voice lack confidence i 'll do my best i 'll even try to tell you why the murderer come back this afternoon to disturb he victim bobby go curiously convince that the doctor have have the better of the argument for a moment katherine graham parede and he be alone in the main hall god know what it be graham say but it may mean something to you bobby tell we carefully katherine about the sound that come to you across the court it be just what i hear last night when he die she answer it be like something fall softly then a long-drawn sigh i try to pay no attention i fight it i do not call at first but i could not keep quiet i know we have to go to that room it never occur to I that the detective or the coroner might be there move around you be alone up here graham say i think so no bobby say i be in my room what be you do graham ask i be asleep katherine 's call wake I up asleep parede echo and she do not call at once -- he break off bobby grasp he arm what be you try to do i be sorry parede say now really you must not think of that i should not have speak i be more inclined to agree with the doctor 's theory impossible as it seem yesterday katherine say i would have think it impossible after last night and just now i be not so sure i -- i wish the doctor be right it would clear you bobby he smile do you think any jury would listen to such a theory katherine put she finger to she lip howell and the doctor come from the corridor of the old wing at the head of the stair the detective turn you will find it very warm and comfortable by the fire in the lower hall mr blackburn he wait until katherine have slip to she room until graham parede the doctor and bobby be on the stair then he walk slowly into the new corridor bobby know what he be after the detective have make no effort to disguise he intention he want bobby out of the way while he search he room again this time for a sharp slender instrument capable of penetrate between the bone at the base of a man 's brain parede light a cigarette and warm he back at the fire the doctor settle himself in he chair he pay no attention to the other he would not answer parede 's slow remark interesting doctor i be a little psychic always in this house i have respond to strange unfriendly influence always as now the approach of night depress I bobby could not sit still he nod at graham arise get he coat and hat and step into the court the dusk be already thick there dampness and melancholy seem to exude from the wall of the old house he pause and gaze at one of the foot-print in the soft earth by the fountain shred of plaster adhere to the edge testimony that the detective have make he cast from this print he try to realize that that mute familiar impression have the power to send he to he execution graham who have come silently from the house startle he what be you look at no use hartley i be on the library lounge i hear every word howell say perhaps it be just as well graham say you know what you face but i hate to see you suffer we have get to find a way around that evidence bobby point to the window of the room of death there be no way around except the doctor 's theory he laugh shortly much as i have fear that room i be afraid the psychic explanation will not hold water parede put he finger on it i would have have time to get back to my room before katherine call -- stop bobby hartley i be afraid to go to sleep it be dreadful not to know whether you be active in you sleep whether you be evil and ingenious to the point of the miraculous in you sleep i be so tired hartley why should you have go to that room this afternoon graham ask you must get this idea out of you head you must have sleep and perhaps when you be thoroughly rest you will remember i be not so sure bobby say that i want to remember he point to the footprint there be no question i be here last night unless graham say you handkerchief and you shoe be steal nonsense bobby cry the only motive would be to commit a murder in order to kill I by send I to the chair and who would know he way around that dark house like I who would have find out so easily that my grandfather have change he room it be logical graham admit slowly but we can not give in by the way have parede ever borrow any large sum bobby hesitate after all parede and he have be good friend a little here and there he answer reluctantly have he ever pay you back i do not recall bobby answer flush you know i have never be exactly calculate about money whenever he want it i be always glad to help carlo out why do you ask if any one graham answer look on you as a certain source of money there would be a motive in conserve that source in increase it probably lot of people know mr blackburn be out of patience with you would make a new will to-day do you think bobby ask that carlo be clever enough to have get through those door and what about this afternoon -- that ghastly disturbing of the body he smile wanly it look like I or the ghost of my ancestor if parede graham insist try to borrow any money from you now tell I about it another thing bobby we can not afford to keep you experience of last night a secret any longer he step to the door and ask doctor groom to come out he will not be likely to pass you confidence on to howell he say those man be natural antagonist after a moment the doctor appear a slouch hat draw low over he shaggy forehead what you want he grumble this court 's a first-class place to catch cold dampest hole in the neighborhood often wonder why i want to ask you graham begin something about the effect of such drug as could be give in wine tell he will you bobby what happen last night bobby vanquish the discomfort with which the gruff opinionated physician have always fill he he recite the story of last night 's dinner of he experience in the cafe of he few blur impression of the sway vehicle and the wood hartley think something may have be put in my wine what for the doctor ask what have these people to gain by drug you suppose for some far-fetched reason they want to have sila blackburn put out of the way they could not make you do it by drug you at any rate they could not have have a hand in this afternoon mind i be not say you have a thing to do with it yourself but i do not believe you be drug any drug likely to be use in wine would probably have send you into a deep sleep and you symptom on wake up be scarcely sharp enough sorry boy sound more like aphasia the path you have be tread sometimes lead to that black country and it be there that hate sharpen unknown i remember a case where a tramp return and kill a farmer who have refuse he food retain no recollection of the crime -- hour drop out of he life they execute he while he still try to remember i read something about the case bobby mutter be better if you have not the doctor grumble suggestion work in a man 's brain without he know it he think for a moment he heavy black brow come closer together he glance at the window of the old room he sunken infuse eye nearly close i know how you feel and that be a little punishment maybe you deserve i 'll say this for you comfort you probably follow the plan that have be impress on you brain by mr graham you come here no doubt and stand around with a automatic appreciation of you condition you may have take that old precaution of convivial man return home and remove you shoe then you automatic judgment may have warn you that you be not fit to go in at all and you probably wander off to the empty house then bobby ask you do not think i do it god know who do it god know what do it the longer i live the surer i become that we scientist can not probe everything whenever i go near sila blackburn 's body i receive a very powerful impression that he death in that room from such a wound go deeper than ordinary murder deeper than a case of recurrent aphasia he eye widen he turn with graham and bobby at the sound of a automobile come through the wood probably the coroner at last he say the automobile a small runabout draw up at the entrance to the court a little wizened man with yellowish skin stretch across high cheek bone step out and walk up the path well he say shrilly what you do doctor groom wait to witness another reason why coroner should be abolish the doctor rumble this be the dead man 's grandson coroner and mr graham a friend of the family 's bobby accept the coroner 's hand with distaste howell the coroner say in he squeaky voice seem to think it be a queer case inconvenient i call it wish people would not die queerly whenever i go on a little holiday i have get five duck gentleman when they come to I with that damned telegram bad business mine 'cause people will die when you least expect they to let 's go see what howell have get on he mind bright sleuth howell ought to be in new york he start up the path side by side with doctor groom be you come graham ask bobby bobby shake he head i do not want to i would rather stay outside you would better be there hartley graham follow the other while bobby wander from the court and start down a path that enter the wood from the rear of the house immediately the forest close greedily about he here and there where the tree be particularly stunt branch cut against a pallid greenish glow in the west -- the last light bobby want if he could to find that portion of the wood where he have stand last night fancy the tree strain in the wind like puny man visualize a dim figure in a black mask which he have call he conscience the forest be all of a pattern -- ugly unfriendly melancholy he go on however hope to glimpse that particular picture he remember he leave the path walk at haphazard among the undergrowth ahead he see a placid flat and faintly luminous stretch he push through the bush and pause on the shore of a lake small and stagnant dead strip trunk of tree protrude from the water at the end a bird arise with a sudden flap of wing it cry angrily as it soar above the tree and disappear to the south the morbid loneliness of the place touch bobby 's spirit with chill hand as a child he have never care to play about the stagnant lake nor he recall have the boy of the village fish or bath there certainly he have not glimpse it last night he be about to walk away when a movement on the farther bank hold he make he gaze with eager eye across the sleepy water he think there be something black in the black shadow of the tree -- a thing that stir through the heavy dusk without sound he receive moreover a impression of anger and haste as distinct as the bird have project but he could see nothing clearly in this bad light he could not be sure that there be any one over there he start around the end of the lake and for a moment he think that the shape of a woman clothe in black detach itself from the shadow the image dissolve he wonder if it have be more substantial than fancy who be that he call the wood muffle he voice there be no answer nor be there he notice any crackling of twig or rustling of dead leaf if there have be a woman there she have flee noiselessly yet as he go on around the lake he own progress be distinctly audible through the decay of autumn it be too dark on the other side to detect any trace of a recent human presence in the thicket he could not quiet however the feeling that he have have a glimpse of a woman clothe in black who have study he secretly across the stagnant stretch of the lake on the other hand there be no logic in a woman 's presence here at such a hour no logic in a stranger 's run away from he while he ponder the night invade the forest completely make it impossible for he to search farther it have grow so dark indeed that he find he way out with difficulty the branch catch at he clothing the underbrush tangled itself about he foot it be as if the thicket be try to hold he away from the house as he enter the court he notice a discolor glow diffuse itself through the curtain of the room of death he open the front door parede and graham alone sit by the fire then they be not through yet bobby say graham arise he commence to pace the length of the hall they have have katherine in that room one would think she would be through enough now they have send for the servant parede laugh lightly after this he say i be afraid bobby you 'll need the power of the police to keep servant in you house mutter frightened voice come from the dining-room jenkin enter and shake he head go up the stair the two woman who follow he be in tear they pause as if seek a excuse to linger on the lower floor to postpone as long as possible they entrance of the room of death ellum a pretty girl whose dark hair and eye suggest a normal vivacity speak to bobby it be outrageous mr robert he find out all we know this morning what be he after now you might think we would murder mr blackburn jane be older a ugly scar cross she cheek it be red and like a open wound as she demand that bobby put a stop to these inquisition i can do nothing he say go on up and answer or they can make trouble for you mutter again to each other they follow jenkin and in the lower hall the three man wait jenkin come down first he face be white it twitch the body he mouth it be move i see it before he stretch out he hand to bobby that be why they want we to find out where we be this afternoon and everything we have do as if we might have go there and disturb -- angry voice in the upper hall interrupt he the two woman run down as white as jenkin at a impatient nod from bobby the three servant go on to the kitchen howell the coroner and doctor groom descend what ail you doctor the coroner be squeak i agree it be a unpleasant room lot of old room be i follow you when you say no post-mortem contraction would have cause such a alteration in the position of the body there be no question about the rest of it the man be clearly murder with a sharp tool of some sort and the murderer be in the room again this afternoon and disturb the corpse howell say he know who it be up to he to find out how he say he have plenty of evidence and that the guilty person 's in this house so i be not fret myself i be cross with you howell for break up my holiday one of my assistant would have do as well howell apparently pay no attention to the coroner he narrow eye follow the doctor with a grow curiosity he level smile seem to have draw he lip into a line inflexible a little cruel the doctor grunt : instead of abolish coroner we ought to double they salary the coroner make a long squeak as a indication of mirth you think unfriendly spook do it i have always believe you be a old fogy hang if that do not sound modern the doctor run he finger through he thick untidy hair i merely ask for the implement that cause death i only ask to know how it be insert through the bed while blackburn lay on he back and if you have time you might tell I how the murderer enter the room last night and to-day the coroner repeat he squeak he glance at the little group by the fire out in the kitchen upstairs or right here under we nose be almost certainly the person who could tell we interesting case howell howell who still watch the doctor answer dryly : unusually interesting the coroner struggle into he coat permit be all available he squeak have you undertaker out when you like graham answer he brusquely everything 's arrange i have only to telephone the coroner nod at doctor groom he voice point its humor with a thinner tone if i be you howell i would take this hairy old theorist up as a suspicious character the doctor make a movement in he direction while howell continue to stare the doctor check himself he go to the closet and get he hat and coat want I to drop you old sawbones the coroner ask savagely the doctor shake he head my buggy 's in the stable the coroner 's squeak be thinner more irritating than ever then do not let the spook get you drive through the wood old folk say there be a-plenty there bobby arise he could not face the prospect of the man 's squeak again we find nothing to laugh at in this situation he say you be quite through the coroner 's eye blaze i be through if that be the way you feel goodnight he add with a sharp maliciousness : i leave my sympathy for whoever howell have he eagle eye on howell when the doctor and the coroner have go excused himself with a humility that mock the other : with you permission i shall write in the library until dinner he bow and leave he want to work on he report graham suggest a exceptional man parede murmur have he question you graham ask i would scarcely call it that parede reply we have both question and we have both be clam i fancy he do not think much of I since i believe in ghost yet the doctor seem to interest he where be you graham ask when miss perrine 's scream call we parede stifle a yawn doze here by the fire i be very tired after last night you do not look particularly tired custom i be ashamed to say construct a certain armor to-morrow with a fresh mind i hope to be able to dissect all i have see and hear all that have happen here to-day the thing that count be what happen to I last night carlo bobby say it be the only way you can help I as parede stroll to the foot of the stair bobby wait for a defensive reply for a sign perhaps that the panamanian be offend and propose to depart parede however go upstairs yawn he call back : i must make myself a trifle more presentable for dinner graham face bobby with the old question : what can he want hang around here unless it be money and after a moment : he be clever -- hard to sound i have to leave you bobby i must telephone -- the ugly formality it be good of you to take they off my mind bobby answer he remain in he chair gaze drowsily at the fire try always try to remember yet find no new light among the shadow of he memory just before dinner katherine join he she wear a sombre gown that make she face seem too white that heighten the grope curiosity of she eye without speak she sit down beside he and stare too at the smouldering fire from she presence from she tactful silence he draw comfort -- to a extent rest you make I ashamed he whisper once i have be a beast leave you here alone these week you do not understand quite why that be she would not let he go on she shake she head they remain silently by the fire until graham and parede join they when dinner be announce the detective come from the library and uninvited sit at the table with they he report evidently still fill he mind for he speak only when it be unavoidable and then in monosyllable parede alone eat with a show of enjoyment alone attempt to talk eventually even he fall silent before the lack of response afterward he arrange a small card table by the fire in the hall he find card and with a package of cigarette and a box of match convenient to he hand commence to play solitaire the detective bobby gather have bring he report up to date for he lounge near by watch the panamanian 's slender finger as they handle the card deftly bobby graham and katherine be glad to withdraw beyond the range of those narrow search eye they enter the library and close the door graham expectant of a report from he man in new york as to the movement of marium and the identity of the stranger be restless if we could only get one fact he say one reasonable clue that do not involve bobby i have never feel so at sea i wonder if in spite of howell 's evidence we be not all a little afraid since this afternoon of something such as katherine feel last night -- something we can not define howell alone be satisfied we must believe in the hand of another man doctor groom talk about indefinable hand uncle sila be so afraid last night katherine whisper that bobby cry be the fact we must have he pause what be that he ask sharply they sit for some time listen to the sound of wheel on the gravel to the banging of the front door and later to the pacing of man in the room of death overhead they try again to thread the maze of this problem whose only conceivable exit lead to bobby 's guilt the movement upstairs persist at last they become measure and drag like the footstep of man who carry some heavy burden they look at each other then katherine hide she eye it be like a tomb here bobby say he arrange kindling in the fireplace and touch a match to it it have not occur to he to ring for jenkin none of they wish to be disturbed eventually it be the detective who intrude he stroll in glance at they curiously for a moment then walk to the door of the enclosed staircase he grasp the knob to-night he announce i be try a small experiment on the chance of clear up the last detail of the mystery since it depend on the courage of whoever murder mr blackburn i have small hope of its success he indicate the ceiling you have hear i daresay what be be go on up there mr blackburn 's body have be remove to he own room the room where he be kill be empty i mean to go up and enter and lock the door as he do last night i shall leave the window up as it be last night i shall blow out the candle as he do he lower he voice he look directly at bobby he word carry a definite challenge i shall lie on the bed and await the murderer under the precise condition mr blackburn do what do you expect to gain by that graham ask probably nothing howell answer because as i have say success depend upon the courage of a man who kill in the dark while he victim sleep i simply give he the chance to attack I as he do mr blackburn of course he realize it would be a good deal to he advantage to have I out of the way i ask he to come therefore as stealthily as he do last night i beg he to match he skill with mine i want he to play he miracle with the window or one of the lock but i 'll wager he have not the nerve although i do not see why he should hesitate he be a doomed man i shall make my arrest in the morning i shall publish all my evidence bobby would not meet the narrow menacing eye for he know that howell challenge he to a duel of slyness with the whole truth at stake the detective 's manner increase the hatred which have blaze in bobby 's mind when he have stand in the bedroom over he grandfather 's body for a moment he wish with all he heart that he might accept the challenge he do the best he could i gather he say that you have not unearth the motive for disturb the body and have you find the sharp instrument that cause death the detective answer tolerantly : i have find a number of sharp instrument none of they however seem quite slender or round enough i 'll get all that out of my man when i lock he up i 'll get it to-night if he dare come why graham say do you announce you plan so accurately to we the detective 's level smile widen you should not ask that mr graham i have cause the servant to know my plan mr parede know they i wish every one in the house to know they that be in order that the murderer who be in the house may come if he wish katherine arise abruptly when you come down to it she say you be accuse one of we it be brutal unfair -- absurd i be a detective miss howell answer i have my own method bobby stare at the slight protuberance in the breast pocket of the detective 's coat the cast of he footprint must be secrete there and almost certainly the handkerchief which have be find beneath the bed he shrink from he own thought if he have consciously commit this murder he could understand a desire to get that evidence katherine have go closer to the detective in any case she urge he i wish you would not try to spend the night in that room it be not pleasant after what the doctor have say it -- well it be not safe howell burst out laugh never fear miss i be content to give doctor groom 's spirit as much chance to take a fall out of I as anybody i 'll be go up now he bow good-night to you all and pleasant dream he open the door and slip into the darkness of the private staircase they hear he after he have close the door climb upward katherine shiver he have plenty of courage hartley if nothing happen to he to-night he 'll finish bobby in the morning that must not happen he must not go to jail you understand thing would never be the same for he again graham spread he hand what be i to do i might go to new york and get after these people myself do not leave the cedar bobby beg until he do arrest I there 'll be plenty of time for the new york end then i have no faith in it watch carlo if you want but most important of all find out -- somehow you have get to find out -- what my grandfather be afraid of graham nod and if it do come to a arrest bobby you be not to say a word to anybody without my advice you ought to get to bed now you must have rest and katherine too do not listen to-night katherine for message from across the court i 'll try she say but hartley i wish that man be not there i wish no one be in that room she take bobby 's hand good-night bobby and do not give up hope we 'll do something somehow we 'll pull you through bobby wait hope that graham would offer to share he room with he for as he have say earlier the prospect of go to sleep of lose control of he thought and action appal he yet such a offer he realize must impress graham as delicate as a indication that he really doubt bobby 's innocence as a sort of spy he be not surprised therefore when graham only say : i 'll be in the next room bobby if you be restless or need I you have only to knock on the wall bobby do not leave the library with they the warmth with which katherine have just fill he fade as he watch she go out side by side with graham she hand be on graham 's arm there be he fancy in she eye a emotion deeper than gratitude or friendship he sigh as the door close behind they he be himself largely to blame for that situation he very revolt against its imminence have hasten its shaping he walk anxiously to the table he have remember the medicine doctor groom have prepare for he that afternoon to make he sleep he have not take it then if it remain where he have leave it which be likely enough in the disorder state of the household he would drink it now reinforce by he complete weariness it ought to send he into a sleep profound enough to drown any possible abnormal impulse of unconsciousness the glass be there he drain it and stand for a time look at the pinkish sediment in the bottom that be all right for to-night but afterward -- he could not shrink perpetually from sleep he shrug he shoulder remember it would make little difference what he do in he sleep when they have he behind prison bar perhaps this would be he last night of freedom he find parede still in the hall the panamanian with languid gesture continue to play he solitaire he box of cigarette be much reduce i think you be tired carlo parede glance up he eye be neither weary nor alert as usual he expression disclose nothing of he thought yet he must have read in bobby 's tone a reproach at this indifference the game intrigue I he murmur and you know he add dreamily i sometimes think better while i amuse myself bobby nod good-night and go on up to he room even while he undress the effect of the doctor 's narcotic be perceptible he eye have grow heavy he brain a trifle numb almost apathetically he assure himself that he could not accomplish these mad action in he sleep yet last night -- he murmur that finish I in the eye of the law the doctor will testify to aphasia accord to he i be two man -- two man he yawn recall snatch of book he have read and one or two scientific report of such case he climb into bed and blow out he candle he drowsiness thicken in he dull mind one recollection remain -- the picture of howell coldly challenge he with he level smile to make a secret entrance of the old bedroom in a murderous effort to escape the penalty of the earlier crime and howell have be right he death would give bobby a chance the destruction of the evidence the bring into the case of a broader-minded man a man without a carefully construct theory -- all that would help bobby might save he howell moreover have indicate that he have so far withhold he evidence but that be probably a bait in he drowsy way bobby hate more powerfully than before this detective who with a serene malevolence make he writhe in he net thought cease he drift into a trance-like sleep he swing in the black pit again fight out against crush odds the darkness thunder as though inform he that graver force than any he have ever imagine have definitely grasp he then he understand he be in a black cell and the thunder be the steady advance of man along a iron floor to take he -- bobby bobby he fling out he hand he sit upright open he eye the blackness assume the familiar yield quality of the night the thunder the footfall become a hurry knock at he door bobby you be there -- it be katherine she tone make the night as frightening as the blackness of the pit what be the matter you be there i do not know get up hartley 's put some clothes on hurry the house be so dark -- so strange tell I what be happen she do not answer at first he strike a match light he candle throw on a dress gown and step to the door katherine shrink against the wall hide she eye from the light of he candle he think it odd she should wear the dress in which she have appear at dinner but it seem indifferently fasten and she hair be in disorder graham step from he room what be it bobby demand you would not wake up bobby you be so hard to wake the idea seem to fill she mind she repeat it several time it be nothing graham say go back to you room katherine she be fanciful -- she lower she hand she eye be full of terror no we have to go to that room as i go last night as we go to-day graham try to quiet she we 'll go to satisfy you she voice harden i know i be asleep it wake I up steal in across the court again bobby grasp she arm you come out and arouse up at once she shake she head i -- i could not find my dress gown this dress be by the bed i put it on but i could not seem to fasten it bobby step back remember he last thought before drift into the trance-like sleep she seem to know what be in he mind but when i knock you be sleep so soundly too soundly perhaps come we be grow imaginative graham say howell would take care of himself he 'll probably give we the deuce for disturbing he but to satisfy you katherine we 'll wake he up if you can she whisper they enter the main hall light come through the stair well from the lower floor graham walk to the rail and glance down bobby follow he on the table by the fireplace the card be arrange in neat pile a strong draft blow cigarette smoke up to they parede graham say amaze be still downstair the front door 's open he be probably in the court it must be very late bobby say katherine shiver half-past two i look at my watch the same time as last night with a gesture of resolution she lead the way into the corridor bobby shrink from the damp and musty atmosphere of the narrow passage why do you come katherine he ask i have to know as i have to know last night graham raise he hand and knock at the door which again be lock on the inside the echo chatter back at they graham knock again with a passionate revolt katherine raise she hand too and pound at the panel suddenly she give up she let she hand fall listlessly it be no use howell howell graham call why do not you answer when he boast to-night katherine whisper the murderer hear he suppose he be go down to the library graham say bobby give katherine the candle no he would have stay we have get to break in here we have get to find out graham place he powerful shoulder against the door the lock strain bobby add he weight with a splintering of wood the door fly open precipitate they across the threshold through the darkness graham spring for the opposite door it be lock he call and the key 's on this side bobby take the candle from katherine and force himself to approach the bed the flame flicker a little in the breeze which steal past the curtain of the open window it shake across the body of howell fully clothe with he head on the stain pillow he face intricately line be as peaceful as sila blackburn 's have be its level smile persist bobby catch he breath howell -- he set the candle on the bureau it be no use we must look at the back of he head the back of he head katherine echo it be illegal graham say look bobby cry we have get to look graham tiptoe forward he stretch out he hand with a motion of abhorrence he draw it back bobby watch he hypnotically think : i want this i hate he i thought of it just before i go to sleep graham reach out again this time he touch howell 's head it roll over on the pillow good god he say they stare at the red hole near the base of the brain at a fresh crimson splotch stray beyond the edge of the darker one they have see that afternoon graham turn away he hand still outstretch as if it have touch some poisonous thing and might retain a contamination he be prepare against it he whisper expect it yet it get he he glance rapidly around the room whose shadow seem crowd about the candle to stifle it unless we be all mad he cry the murderer must be hide in this room now do not you see he be get to be or groom 's right and we be fight the dead go out katherine stand by that broken door bobby i be go to look chapter iv a strange light appear at the desert house graham 's intention logical as it be impressed bobby as quite futile sila blackburn have die in this ancient melancholy room behind lock door this afternoon with a repetition of the sound that have probably accompany he death they have be draw to find that behind lock door again the position of the body have change incredibly as if to expose to they the tiny fatal wound at the base of the brain now for the third time those stealthy movement have arouse katherine and they have find once more behind lock door the determine and malicious detective murder precisely as old blackburn have be of course graham be logical by every rational argument the murderer must still be in the room yet bobby foresaw that as always no one would be find that nothing would be unearth to explain the succession of tragic mystery while graham commence he search indeed he continue to stare at the little round hole in howell 's head at the fresh irregular stain on the pillow and he become absorb in he own predicament again and again he ask himself if he could be responsible for these murder which have be commit with a inhuman ingenuity he know only that he have wander unconscious in the vicinity of the cedar last night that he have be asleep when he grandfather 's body have alter its position that he have go to sleep a little while ago too profoundly brooding over howell 's challenge to the murderer to invade the room of death and kill he if he could howell have be confident that he could handle a man and so solve the riddle of how the room have be enter certainly howell 's challenge have be accept and bobby know that he have fall into that deep sleep hate the detective tell himself that the man 's death might save he from arrest from conviction from a intolerable walk to a little room with a single chair recurrent aphasia the doctor 's expression come back to he in such a state a man could overcome lock door could accomplish apparent miracle and retain no recollection and bobby have hate and fear howell more than he have he grandfather dully he see katherine go out at graham 's direction as one in a dream he move toward the door they have have to break down on enter stand close to it graham say we 'll cover everything you 'll find no one bobby answer with a perfect assurance he see graham take the candle and explore the large closet he watch he examine the space behind the window curtain he could smile a little as graham stoop peer beneath the bed as he move each piece of furniture large enough to secrete a man you see hartley it be no use graham 's lack of success however stimulate he anger then he say there must be some hiding place in the wall such device be common in house as old as this bobby indicate the silent form of the detective he believe i kill my grandfather the only reason he do not arrest I be he failure to find out how the room have be enter and leave do not you suppose he look for a hiding place or a secret entrance the first thing it be obvious but graham 's savage determination increase he sound each panel none give the slightest revealing response he get a tape from katherine and measure the dimension of the room the private hall and the corridor at last he turn to bobby he anger dead he face white and tired everything check he admit there be no secret room no way in or out logically groom 's right we be fight the dead who resent the intrusion of you grandfather and howell he laugh mirthlessly after all we can not surrender to that there must be another answer from the first howell be satisfy with I bobby say graham fling up he hand then tell I how you get in without disturb those lock i grant you bobby you have sufficient motive for both murder but i do not believe you have two personality one decent and lovable the other cruel and cunning to the point of magic i do not believe if a man have two such personality the action of one would be totally close to the memory of the other bobby smile wanly it be not pleasant to confess it hartley but i have read of such case fiction scientific fact i wish to the devil i have share you room with you to-night graham mutter i might have furnish you a alibi for this affair at least either that bobby answer frankly or you might have follow I and learn the whole secret honestly be not that what you be think of hartley and i do go to sleep tell myself it would help I if something of the sort happen to howell now i be not so sure that it will i -- i suppose you have get to notify the police graham hold up he hand what be that in the corridor there be quiet footstep in the corridor bobby turn quickly parede stroll slowly through the passage a cigarette hold in he slender listless finger bobby stare at he remember he surprise a few minute ago that the panamanian should have sit up so late should have be probably in the court when they have follow katherine to the discovery of this new crime parede pause in the doorway he take in the tragic picture frame by the sinister room without display the slightest interest he continue to hold he cigarette until it expire then he cross the threshold graham and bobby watch the expressionless face gracefully parede raise he finger and point to the bed when he speak he voice be low and pleasant : appalling i fear something of the kind when i hear you come to this room he glance at the broken door the same unbelievable circumstance he drawl i see you have to break in the color flash back to graham 's face you have take plenty of time to solve you misgiving it have not be so long i fancy everything be all right and i be immerse in my solitaire then i hear a stir upstairs as i have tell you the house frighten I it be not natural or healthy so i come up to investigate this stir and there be miss katherine in the hall she tell I graham face he with undisguised enmity immerse in you solitaire we be attract by a light in the lower hall at such a hour we look down you be not there the front door be open parede glance at he cold cigarette he yawn when howell die precisely as mr blackburn do graham hurry on you alone be awake about the house be not you at that moment in the court parede laugh tolerantly it be clear in spite of my apology that we be not friend graham but may i ask be you accuse I of this strange -- accident i should like to know what you be do in the court perhaps parede answer i be attract there by the sound that arouse miss katherine graham shake he head from she description i doubt if those sound would have be audible in the hall no matter parede say i merely suggest that it be a case for groom he hint of a spiritual enmity may be saner than you think katherine appear in the doorway she have evidently overhear parede 's comment for she nod the determination in she eye suggest that she have struggle with the situation during these last moment and have reach a definite conclusion that quality be in she voice at least hartley she say you must send for doctor groom before you notify the police graham wave he hand why he ask the man be dead with a movement hide from parede she indicate bobby last time there be a good deal of delay before the doctor come if we get he right away he may be able to do something for this poor fellow at least he advice would be useful bobby realize that she be fight for time for he any delay would be useful that would give they a chance to plan before the police with unimaginative efficiency should invade the house and limit they opportunity graham show that he catch she point maybe it be better he say then bobby telephone groom to be ready for you and take my runabout it be in the stable you 'll get he here much faster than he could come in he carriage while i be go bobby ask what will you do watch this room graham jerk out see that no one enter or leave it or touch the body i 'll hope for some clue you have plenty of courage parede drawl i should not care to watch alone in this room he follow katherine into the corridor bobby look at graham you 'll take no chance hartley graham 's smile be not pleasant accord to you and the dead detective there be no risk while you be out of the house still i shall be nervous but do not worry bobby join the other before they have reach the hall of course hartley find nothing katherine say to he nothing parede answer except a very bad temper katherine 's distaste for the man be no longer veil you do not like mr graham she say but he be we friend and he be in this house to help we parede bow i regret that the amusement mr graham cause I sometimes find expression he be so earnest so materialistic in he relation to the world that be why he will see nothing psychic in the situation parede 's easy contempt be like a tonic for katherine she fear seem to drop from she she turn purposefully to bobby ignore the panamanian i shall watch with hartley she say he be ashamed that jealousy should creep into such a moment but she resolve recall he amorous discontent the prospect of graham and she watching alone draw to each other by they fright and uncertainty by they surroundings by the hour become unbearable it place he to a extent on parede 's side it urge he when parede have go on downstairs to spring almost eagerly to he defense as hartley say katherine begin he make you think of a snake he must see we dislike and resent he you and hartley perhaps bobby say carlo say he be here to help I i have no reason to disbelieve he a little color come into katherine 's face she half stretch out she hand as if in a appeal but the color fade and she hand drop we be waste time she say you have better go i be sorry we disagree about carlo he commence she turn deliberately away from he you must hurry she say hurry he see she enter the corridor to join graham the obscurity of the narrow place seem to hold for he a new menace he walk downstairs slowly while he telephone instruct a servant to tell the doctor to be dress and ready in twenty minute he see parede go to the closet and get he hat and coat i shall keep you company the panamanian announce bobby be glad enough to have he he do not want to be alone he be aware by this time that no amount of thought would persuade useful memory to emerge from the black pit they walk to the stable half go to ruin like the rest of the estate bobby start graham 's car the servant ' quarter he see be dark then jenkin and the two woman have not be arouse be still ignorant of the new crime as they drive smoothly past the gloomy house they glimpse through the court the dimly light window of the old room that persistently guard its grim secret bobby picture the living as well as the dead there and he mind revolt and he shiver he open the throttle wider the car spring forward the divergent glare from the headlight force back the reluctant thicket parede drawl unexpectedly : there be nothing as lonely anywhere in the world he stoop behind the windshield and light a cigarette at least bobby he say between puff the cedar have take from you the fear of howell and after a time stare at the glow of he cigarette he go on softly : have you notice anything significant about the discovery of each mystery at the cedar many thing bobby muttered think parede urge he bobby answer angrily : you have suggest that to I once to-day carlo you mean that each time i have be asleep or unconscious i mean something quite different parede say he hesitate when he continue he drawl be more pronounced then you have not remark that each time it have be miss katherine who have make the discovery who have arouse the rest of the house the car swerve sharply bobby 's first impulse have be to take he hand from the wheel to force parede to retract he sly insinuation that be the rottenest thing i have ever know you to do carlo take it back parede shrug he shoulder there be nothing to take back i accuse no one i merely call attention to a chain of exceptional coincidence you make I wonder bobby say if hartley be not justify in he dislike of you you 'll kill such a ridiculous suspicion or parede drawl very well it seem my fate recently to offend those i like best i merely think that any theory lead away from you would be welcome any theory bobby answer involve katherine be unthinkable parede smile i do not understand exactly how you feel i rather take it for grant that graham -- never mind i take it back then drop it bobby answer sullenly sorry that there be nothing else he could say they continue in silence through the desert forest whose aggressive loneliness make word seem trivial bobby be ask himself again where he have stand last night when he have glimpse for a moment the strain tree and the figure in a mask which he have call he conscience if he could only prove that figure substantial then graham would have some ground for he suspicion of parede and the dancer marium he glance at parede could there have be a conspiracy against he in the new york cafe do parede in fact have some devious purpose in remain at the cedar the automobile take a sharp curve in the road bobby start gaze ahead with a interest nearly hypnotic the headlight have catch in they glare the desert farmhouse in which he have awaken just before howell have tell he of he grandfather 's death and practically place he under arrest in the white light the frame of the house from which the paint have flake appear ghastly unreal like a structure see in a nightmare from which one recoil with morbid horror the light leave the building as the car tear past bobby could barely make out the black mass in the midst of the thicket parede have observe it too i daresay he remark casually the cedar will become as desert as that it be just that it should for the entire neighborhood impress one as unfriendly to life as strive through death to drive life out have you ever see that house before bobby ask quickly i have never see it before i do not care ever to see it again it be a relief when the forest thin and field stretch flat and pleasant like barrier against the stunt growth bobby stop the car in front of one of a group of house at a crossroads he climb the step and ring doctor groom open the door himself he gigantic hairy figure be silhouette against the light from within what be the matter now he demand in he gruff voice fortunately i have not go to bed i be read some book on psychic manifestation who be sick or -- bobby 's face must have tell he a good deal for he break off get you thing on bobby say and i will tell you as we drive back for you must come howell have be kill precisely as my grandfather be for a moment doctor groom 's bulky frame remain motionless in the doorway instead of the surprise and horror bobby have foresee the old man express only a mute wonder he get he hat and coat and enter the runabout parede make room for he sit on the floor he foot on the run board bobby have tell all he know before they have reach the forest the doctor grunt then : the wound at the back of the head be the same as in you grandfather 's case exactly then what good be i why be i route out a formality bobby answer katherine thought if we get you quickly you might do something anyway she want you advice the wood close about they again the light seem to push back a palpable barrier i can not work miracle the doctor be murmur i can not bring man back to life such a wound leave no ground for hope you would better have send for the police at once hello he strain forward peer around the windshield funny parede call bobby 's eye be on the road what do you see the house bobby parede cry no one to my certain knowledge the doctor say have live in that house for ten year you say it be empty and fall to piece when you wake up there this morning bobby know what they mean then and he reduce the speed of the car and look ahead to the right a pallid glow sift through the tree from the direction of the desert house bobby guide the car to the side of the road stop it and shut off the engine at first no one move the three man stare as if in the presence of a unaccountable phenomenon even when bobby have extinguish the headlight the glow fail to brighten its pallid quality persist it seem to radiate from a point close to the ground it come from the front of the house bobby murmur he step from the automobile what be you go to do parede want to know find out who be in that house for bobby have experience a quick hope if there be a man or a woman secrete in the build the truth as to he own remarkable presence there last night might not be so far to seek after all there be moreover something lawless about this light escape from the place at such a hour a little while ago when parede and he have drive past the house have be black they have remark its lonely abandon appearance it have lead parede to speak of the neighborhood as the domain of death yet the strange pallid quality of the light itself make he pause by the broken fence it do come from the lower part of the front of the house yet so faint be it it fail to outline the aperture through which it escape the doctor and parede join he when i be here he say all the shutter be close this glow be too white too diffused we must see as he start forward parede grasp he arm there be too many of we we would make a noise suppose i creep up and investigate there be one way in -- at the back bobby tell the doctor let we go there we 'll have whoever be inside trap meantime carlo if he wish will steal up to the front he 'll find out where the light come from he 'll look in if he can that be the best plan parede agree but they have scarcely turn the corner of the house beyond reach of the glow when parede rejoin they he foot be no longer careful in the underbrush he come up run for the first time in they acquaintance bobby detect a lessen of the man 's suave unemotional habit the light the panamanian gasp it be go before i could get close it fade out bobby call to the doctor and run toward the door at the rear it be unhinge and half open as it have be when he have awaken to he painful and inexplicable predicament he go through fumble in he pocket for match the damp chill of the hall nauseate he as it have do before seem to place about he throat a intangible band that make breathing difficult before he could get he match safe out the doctor have strike a wax vesta its strong flame play across the dingy streak wall there be a flashlight carlo bobby say in the door flap of the automobile parede start across the yard with a haste it seem to bobby almost eager striking match as they go the doctor and bobby hurry to the front of the house the room appear undisturbed in they decay the shutter be close the front door be bar the broken wall from which the plaster hang in shred leer at they suddenly bobby turn grasp the doctor 's arm do you hear anything the doctor shake he head or feel anything no i think bobby say excitedly that there be some one in the hall i -- i simply get that impression for i see nothing myself my back be turn parede stroll silently in it may have be mr parede the doctor say but bobby be not convince do you see or hear anything come through the hall carlo no parede say he have bring the light with its help they explore the tiny cellar and the upper floor there be no sign of a recent occupancy everything be as bobby have find it on awaken a vagrant wind sigh about the place they look at each other with startled eye they file out with a incongruous stealth then there be ghost here too paredes whisper who know doctor groom muse it be as puzzling as anything that have happen at the cedar unless the light we see be some phosphorescent effect of decaying wood or vegetation then why should it go out all at once bobby ask be there any connection between this light and what have happen at the cedar the house at least parede put in be connect with what have happen at the cedar through you experience here at doctor groom 's suggestion they sit in the automobile for some time watch the house for a repetition of the pallid light after several minute when it fail to come bobby set he gear graham and katherine will be worry they drive quickly away from the black uncommunicative mass of the abandon build the wood be lonelier than before they impress bobby as guard something he drive straight to the stable as they walk into the court they see the uncertain candlelight diffuse from the room of death in the hall bobby respond to a quick alarm the cedar be too quiet what have happen since he and parede have leave katherine hartley he call he hear run step upstairs katherine lean over the banister she quiet voice reassure he be the doctor with you he nod parede yawn and light a cigarette he settle himself in a easy chair bobby and doctor groom hurry up katherine lead they down the old corridor two chair have be place in the broken doorway graham sit there he arise and greet the doctor nothing have happen since i leave bobby ask graham shake he head katherine and i have watch every minute doctor groom walk to the bed and for a long time look down at howell once he put out he hand quickly withdraw it it be simply a repetition he say at last and he voice be softer than its custom it may be a warning for all we know that no one may sleep in this room without attract death yet why should that be i miss this poor fellow 's materialistic viewpoint there be nothing i can do for he nothing i can say except that death must have be instantaneous the police must seek again for a man to place in the electric chair graham touch he arm with a odd reluctance sit here for so long i have be think i have always be materialistic too tell I seriously doctor do you believe there be any psychic force capable of kill two man in this incisive fashion no one the doctor answer can say what psychic force be capable of do some scientist have start to explore but it be still uncharted country from certain place -- i daresay you have notice it -- one get a impression of peace and content from other a depression a sense of suffer i think we have all experienced psychic force to that extent remember that this room have a history of intense and rebellious suffer some of it i have see with my own eye you father 's fight for life katherine be horrible for those of we who know he have no chance as i watch beside he i use to wonder if such violent agony could ever drift wholly into silence and when we have to tell he finally that the fight be lose it be beyond bear if these man have be find dead without mark of violence graham say i might consider such a possibility irrational as it seem irrational doctor groom answer must not be confuse with impossible the mark of a physical violence far from prove that the attack be physical strengthen the case of the supernatural certainly you have hear and read of picture be dash from wall by invisible hand of object move about empty room of case where human being have be attack by inanimate thing -- heavy thing -- hurtle through the air some scientist recognize such irrational possibility policeman do not very well graham say stubbornly i 'll follow you that far but you must show I in this room the sharp object with which these man be attack no matter what the force behind it the doctor spread he hand he infuse eye nearly close that i can not do at any rate robert this be not wholly tragic to you i do not see how any one could accuse you of aphasia to-night you have not forget bobby say slowly that you speak of a recurrent aphasia that be the trouble graham put in under he breath he have no more alibi now than he have when he grandfather be murder bobby tell of he heavy sleep of the delay in katherine 's arouse he the doctor 's gruff voice be disapprove you should not have drunk that medicine it have stand too long it would only have approximate its intended effect you mean bobby ask that i be not sleep as soundly as i think probably not but you be by no mean a satisfactory victim man do unaccountable thing in a somnambulistic state but asleep they have not wing any more than they have awake you have get to show we how you enter this room without disturb the lock now mr graham we must comply with the law call in the police there be nothing else to do bobby agree so they go along the dingy corridor and downstairs from the depths of the easy chair in which parede lounged smoke curl with a lazy indifference the panamanian do not move while graham and the doctor walk to the back of the hall to telephone katherine a anxious figure a secretive one beckon bobby to the library he go with she wonder what she could want it be quite dark in the library as bobby fumble with the lamp and prepare to strike a match he be aware of the girl 's provocatively near presence he resist a warm impulse to reach out and touch she hand he desire to tell she all that be in he heart of the division that have increase between they the last few month yet to follow that impulse would he realize place a portion of he burden on she shoulder would also in a sense be disloyal to graham for he no longer question that the two have reach a definite sentimental understanding so he sigh and strike the match even before the lamp be light katherine be speak with a feverish haste : before the police come -- you have a chance bobby -- the last chance you must do before the police arrive whatever be to be do he replace the shade and glance at she astonished by she intensity by the forceful gesture with which she grasp he arm for the first time since sila blackburn 's murder all of she vitality have come back to she what do you mean she point to the door of the private staircase just what howell tell you before he go up there to he death bobby understand he react excitedly to she attitude of conspirator he say she go on that the criminal have nothing to lose that it would be to he advantage to have he out of the way to destroy that evidence i thought of it bobby answer just before i go to sleep do not you see she say if you have kill he you would have take the cast and the handkerchief and destroy they hartley have tell I everything and i could see he coat for myself the cast and the handkerchief be still in howell 's pocket why should i have kill he if not to destroy those bobby take she up with a quick hope you do not she cry nothing would ever make I believe that you kill he but you will be charge with it unless the evidence -- disappear you 'll have no defense bobby draw back a little you want I to go there -- and -- and take from he pocket those thing she nod you remember he suggest that he have not send he report that may be there too bobby shake he head he must have say that as a bait at the worst she urge a report without evidence could only turn suspicion against you it would not convict you as those other thing may you must get they you must destroy they graham slip quietly in and close the door the district attorney be come himself with another detective he say i can guess what katherine have be talk about she be right i be a lawyer a i know the penalty of tamper with evidence but i do not believe you be a murderer and i tell you as long as that evidence exist they can convict you they can send you to the chair they may arrest you and try you anyway on he report but i do not believe they can convict you on it alone you be justified in protect yourself bobby in the only way you can no one will see you go in the room we 'll arrange it so that no one can testify against you bobby feel himself at a cross road during the commission of those crime he have be unconscious if he have in fact have anything to do with they he personality he real self have know nothing have do no wrong he body have merely react to hideous prompting whose source lurk at the bottom of the black pit to tamper with evidence would be a conscious crime all the more because of he doubt of himself he shrink from that katherine see he hesitation it be a matter of you life or death but although katherine decide he it be not with that she come closer she look straight at he and she eye be full of a affection that stir he profoundly : for my sake bobby -- he study the dead ash of the fire which a little while ago have play on howell vital and antagonistic by the door of the private staircase the man have challenge he to do just the thing from which he shrink but howell be no longer vital or antagonistic and it occur to he that a little of he shrink arise from the thought of approach and rob the still thing upstairs all that be leave of the man who have not be afraid of the mystery of the lock room for my sake katherine repeat bobby square he shoulder he fight back he momentary cowardice the affection in katherine 's eye be stronger than that all right he say howell never give I a chance while he be alive he 'll have to now he be dead katherine relax graham 's face be quite white but he give he instruction in a cold even tone : we 'll go to the hall now katherine will go on upstairs she must not see you enter the room but she will watch in the corridor while you be there to be sure you be not disturb you and i will chat for awhile with the other bobby then you will go up you understand parede must not even guess what you be do i 'll keep he and groom downstairs if he spy if he know what you be at he would have a weapon in he hand i would hate to think about he may be all right but we can not risk any more than we have to we must go on tiptoe he open the door katherine give bobby 's hand a quick encouraging pressure take the stuff to my room graham whisper the first chance we 'll destroy it so that no trace will be leave they go to the hall without speak katherine climb the stair graham draw a chair between parede and the doctor bobby lounge against the mantel try to find in the panamanian 's face some clue as to he real feeling but parede 's eye be close he hand droop across the chair arm he slender pointed finger hold as if from mere habit a lifeless cigarette asleep graham whisper without open he eye parede speak : no i feel curiously awake he yawn doctor groom glance at he watch the power of prosecution he grumble ought to be here within the next fifteen or twenty minute bobby glance at graham then it be not safe to delay too long more and more as he wait he shrink from the invasion of the room of death the prospect of reach out and touch the still cold thing on the bed revolt he be there anything in that room capable of forbid he intention be there in short a surer more malicious force for evil than he unconscious self at work in the house he be about to make some formal comment to the other to embark on he distasteful adventure when parede as if he have read bobby 's mind open he eye languidly leave he chair and walk to the foot of the stair where you go graham ask sharply parede wave he hand indifferently and walk on up there be something of stealth in he failure to reply in he cat-like tread on the stair graham and bobby stare after he unable to meet this new situation audibly because of groom yet five minute have go there be no time to be lose parede must not rob bobby of he chance with a sort of desperation he start for the stair graham hold out he hand as if to restrain he then nod bobby have he foot on the first step when katherine 's cry reach they shape the moment to they use for there be no fright in she cry it be rather angry and bobby and graham run up while doctor groom remain in he chair a expression of blank amazement on he face a candle burn on the table in the upper hall katherine and parede stand near the entrance of the old corridor parede as usual be quite unruffled katherine 's attitude be defensive she seem to hold the corridor against he the anger of she cry be active in she eye parede laugh lightly sorry to have give the household one more shock fortunately no harm do what be it katherine graham demand i do not know she answer he startle I he enter the corridor parede nod quite right she be there i be on my way to my room if you house have electricity bobby this incident would have be avoid i see something dark in the corridor you may not know graham say that ever since we find howell one of we have try more or less to keep the entrance of that room under observation yet you be all downstairs a little while ago parede yawn it be too bad i might have take my turn then at any rate since i be exclude from you confidence i overcome my natural fear and for bobby 's sake slip in and i be afraid startled miss katherine yes she say he explanation be reasonable there be nothing more to be say but bobby 's doubt of he friend sow by graham and stimulate by the incident of the last hour be materially strengthened he feel a sharp fear of parede such reserve such concealment of emotion be scarcely human if graham be say you really want to help bobby there be something you can do will you come downstairs with I for a moment i would like to suggest one or two thing before the police arrive without hesitation parede follow graham down the stair katherine turn immediately to bobby she eye eager full of the tense determination that have dictate she plan in the library now bobby she whisper and there be no time to waste they may be here any minute i will not see you go but i 'll be back at once to guard you against parede if he slip up again she walk across the hall and disappear in the newer corridor without witness he face the old corridor and with the attempt directly ahead he repugnance achieve a new power the black entrance with its scarcely dare memory remind he that what he be about to do be direct against more than human law be a outrage against the dead man he have to remind himself of the steely purpose with which howell have mark he as the murderer and the man 's power persist after death in such a contest he be justified he take the candle from the table through the stair-well the murmur of graham 's voice occasionally interrupt by groom 's heavy tone or the languid accent of parede drift encouragingly try to crush he premonition bobby enter the corridor instead of illuminate the narrow passage the candle seem half smother by its blackness for the first time in he memory bobby face the entrance of the sinister room alone he push open the broken door he pause on the threshold it impress he as not unnatural that he should experience such misgiving they spring not alone from the fact that within twenty-four hour two man have die unaccountably within these fade wall nor do the evidence point to he own unconscious guilt wholly account for they at the bottom of everything be the fact that from he earliest childhood he have look upon the room as consecrate to death have consequently fear it have he recall always hurry past the disused corridor lead in its direction through its wide space the light of the candle scarcely penetrate no more than a indefinite radiance thrust back the obscurity and outline the bed he could barely see the stark black form outstretch there the dim vast room as he advance impose upon he a sense of isolation katherine in the upper hall the other downstairs whose voice no longer reach he seem all at once far away he stand in a place lonelier and more remote than the piece of wood where he have momentarily open he eye last night and instead of the strain tree and the figure in the black mask which he have call he conscience he have for motion and companionship only the swaying of the curtain in the breeze from the open window and the dark prostrate thing whose face as he go closer be like a white mask -- a mask with a fix and malevolent sneer the wind catch the flame of the candle make it flicker tenuous shadow commence to dance across the wall he pause with a tighten throat for the form on the bed seem move too with sly and scarcely perceptible gesture then he understand it be the effect of the shake candle and he force himself to go on but a sense of a multiple companionship accompany he -- a sense of a shapeless soundless companionship that project a idea of a steady regard there sweep through he mind a procession of figure in quaint dress and with face not unlike he own remembered from portrait and family legend man and woman to whom this room have be familiar within whose limit they have suffer cry out a too-powerful agony and die it seem to he that he wait for voice to guide he to urge he on as katherine have urge he or to drive he back because he be a intruder in a company whose habit be strange and terrifying he force he glance from the shadow which seem more active along the wall he raise he candle and stare at the dead man the cast be undoubtedly there the coat stretch tightly across the breast outline it he stand at the side of the bed he have only to bend and place he hand in the pocket which the cast fill awkwardly the wind alone he see be not responsible for the shake of the candle he hand shake as the shadow shake as the thing on the bed shake the sense of loneliness grow upon he until it become complete appalling for the first time he understand that loneliness can possess a ponderable quality it be he feel potent and active in the room -- a thing he could not understand or challenge or overcome he hand tighten he think of katherine guard the corridor of parede and doctor groom hold downstairs by graham of the county authority hurry to seize this evidence that would convict he and he realize that he duty and he excuse be clear he understand that just now he have be capture by a force undefinable in term of the world he know for a moment he elude the stealthy fleshless hand of its impalpable skirmisher he reach impulsively out to the dead man he be about to place he finger in the pocket which after all be say and do hold he life in the light of the candle the face seem alive and more menacing than it have ever do in life about the straight smile be a wider more triumphant quality the candle flicker sharply it expire the conquer blackness take he breath he tell himself it be the draft from the window which be strong but the companionship of the night be closer and more numerous the darkness wreathe itself into mock and tortuous body whose face be hide in a agony of revolt against these incorporeal these fanciful horror he reach in the pocket he spring back with a choke inaudible cry for the dead thing beneath he hand be stir the dead cold thing with a languid and impossible rebuke move beneath he touch and the pocket he have feel be empty the coat a moment ago bulge and awkward be flat there spring to he mind the mad thought that the detective malevolent in life have long after death snatch from he hand the evidence carefully gather on which everything for he depend chapter v the cry through the wood bobby 's inability to cry out alone prevent he alarming the other and announce to parede and doctor groom he unlawful presence in the room during the moment that the shock hold he silent motionless bent in the darkness above the bed he understand there could have be no ambiguity about he ghastly and loathsome experience the dead detective have alter he position as sila blackburn have do and this time someone have be in the room and suffer the appalling change bobby 's finger still respond to the charnel feeling of cold inactive flesh suddenly become alive and potent beneath he touch and a reason for the apparent miracle offer itself between the extinction of he candle and the commencement of that movement -- only a second or so -- the evidence have disappear from the detective 's pocket bobby relax he stumble across the room and into the corridor he go with hand outstretch through the blackness for no candle burn in the upper hall but he know that katherine be on guard there when he leave the passage he see she a unnatural figure herself in the yellowish unhealthy twilight which sift through the stair well from the lamp in the hall below she must have sense something out of the way immediately for she hurry to meet he and she whisper hold no assurance you get the cast and the handkerchief bobby and when he do not answer at once she ask with a sharp rush of fear : what be the matter what be happen he shudder at last he manage to speak katherine i have feel death cease to be death later he be to recall that phrase with a sicker horror than he experience now you see something she say but you candle be out there be no light in the room he take she hand he press it you be real he say with a nervous laugh something i can understand everything be unreal this light -- he stride to the table find a match and light he candle katherine as she see he face draw back bobby my candle go out he say dully and he move through the darkness i tell you he move beneath my hand she draw farther away stare at he you be frighten -- no if we go there with a light now he say with the same dull conviction we will find he as we find my grandfather this afternoon the monotonous voice of the three man in the lower hall weave a background for they whisper the normal familiar sound be like a tonic bobby straighten katherine throw off the spell of he announcement but the evidence you get -- she stare at he empty hand he fancy that he see contempt in she eye in spite of everything you must go back you must get that even if i have the courage he say wearily it would be no use for the evidence be go but i see it at least i see he pocket -- it be there he answer when my light go out i do put my hand in he pocket in that second it have go there be no one there she say no one but you because i watch he lean heavily against the wall good god katherine it be too big whatever it be we can not fight it she look for some time down the corridor at the black entrance of the sinister room at last she turn and walk to the banister she call : hartley will you come up bobby wonder at the steadiness of she voice the murmuring below cease graham run up the stair she summons have be warn enough they attitude as graham reach the upper hall be eloquent of bobby 's failure you do not get the cast and the handkerchief he say bobby tell briefly what have happen what be one to do he end even the dead be against I it be beyond belief graham say roughly he snatch up the candle and enter the corridor uncertainly katherine and bobby follow he he go straight to the bed and thrust the candle beneath the canopy the other could see from the door the change that have take place the body of howell be turn awkwardly on its side the coat pocket be as bobby have describe it flat and empty katherine turn and go back to the hall graham 's hand shake as bobby 's have shake no trick bobby bobby could not resent the suspicion which appear to offer the only explanation of what have happen the candle flicker in the draft look out bobby warn the misshapen shadow dance with a multiple vivacity across the wall graham shaded the candle flame and the shadow become like morbid decoration gargantuan and motionless it be madness graham say there be no explanation of this that we can understand howell 's straight smile mock they as if in answer to graham a voice sigh through the room its quality be one with the shadow unsubstantial and shapeless bobby grasp one of the bed post and brace himself listen the candle in graham 's hand commence to flicker again and bobby know that it have not be he fancy for graham listen too it shake again through the heavy oppressive night merely accentuate by the candle -- a faint ululation barely detach itself from silence stray after a time into the silence again at first it be like the grief of a woman hear at a great distance but the sound while it gain no strength force on they more and more a abhorrent sense of intimacy this cry from a infinite distance fill the room seem finally to have its source in the room itself after it have sob thinly into nothing its pulsation continue to sigh in bobby 's ear they seem time to the renew and eccentric dancing of the amorphous shadow graham straighten and place the candle on the bureau he seem more startled than he have be at the unbelievable secretiveness of a dead man you hear it bobby breathe graham nod what be it where do you think it come from bobby demand it be like someone mourning for this -- this poor devil graham could not disguise he effort to elude the sombre spell of the room to drive from he brain the illusion of that unearthly moan it must have come from outside the house he answer there be no use give way to fancy where there be a possible explanation it must have come from outside -- from some woman in great agony of mind bobby recall he perception of a woman move with a curious absence of sound about the edge of the stagnant lake he speak of it to graham i could not be sure it be a woman but there be no house within two mile what would a woman be do wander around the cedar at any rate there be three woman in the house graham say katherine and the two servant ellum and jane the maid be badly frightened it may have come from the servant ' quarter it must have be one of they but bobby see that graham do not believe either of the maid have release that poignant suffer it do not sound like a living voice he say simply then how be we to take it graham persist angrily i shall question katherine and the two maid he take up the candle with a stubborn effort to recapture he old forcefulness but as they leave the room the shadow throng thickly after they in ominous pursuit and it be not necessary to question katherine she stand in the corridor she lip part she face white and shocked what be it she say that nearly silent grief she put she hand to she ear lower they helplessly after a moment where do you think it come from graham ask from a long way off she answer then i -- i think it must be in the room with you and i wonder if you see -- graham shake he head we see nothing it be probably ellum or jane they have be badly frightened perhaps a nightmare or they have hear we move around the front part of the house i be go to see katherine and bobby follow he downstairs doctor groom and parede stand in front of the fireplace questioningly look upward parede do not speak at first but doctor groom burst out in he grumble bass voice : what be be go on up there do you hear just now a queer cry graham ask no you parede i have hear nothing parede answer except doctor groom 's disquieting theory it be a uncanny hour for such talk what kind of a cry -- may i ask like a woman moan bobby say and doctor howell have change he position what be you talk about the doctor cry he have turn on he side as mr blackburn do graham tell he parede glance at bobby and how be this new mystery discover bobby catch the implication then the panamanian clung to he slyly express doubt of katherine which might after all have have its impulse in a instinct of self-preservation bobby know that graham and katherine would guard the fashion in which the startling discovery have be make before he could speak for himself indeed graham be answer parede : this cry seem after a time to come from the room we enter but miss katherine call you up parede say i suppose she have hear again movement in the room bobby manage a smile you see carlo nothing be consistent in this case parede bow gravely it be very curious a woman should cry about the house the servant may make it seem natural enough graham say will you come bobby as they cross the dining room they hear a stir in the kitchen graham throw open the door jenkin stand at the foot of the servant ' stair the old butler have light a candle and place it on the mantel the disorder of he clothing suggest the haste with which he have leave he bed and come downstairs he wrinkled sunken face have age perceptibly he advance with a expression of obvious relief i be just come to find you mr robert what be up bobby ask a little while ago i think you be all asleep back here one of the woman awaken he graham say it be just as i thought be that it the old butler ask with a quick relief but immediately he shake he head it could not have be that mr graham for i stop at ellum 's and jane 's door and there be no sound they seem to be asleep and it be not like that you mean bobby say that you hear a woman cry jenkin nod it wake I up if you do not think it be one of the maid graham ask what do you make of it i think it come from outside i think it be a woman prowl around the house then i say to myself why should a woman prowl around the cedar and it be too unearthly sir and i remember the way mr sila be murder and the awful thing that happen to he body this afternoon and i -- you will not think I foolish sir -- i doubt if it be a human voice i have hear no graham say dryly we will not think you foolish so i think i would better wake you up and tell you graham turn to bobby katherine and you and i he say fancy the cry be in the room with we jenkin be sure it come from outside the house that be significant wherever it come from bobby say softly it be like some one mourning for howell jenkin start the policeman bobby remember that jenkin have not be arouse by the discovery of howell 's murder you would know in a few minute anyway he say howell have be kill as my grandfather be jenkin move back a look of unbelief and awe in he wrinkled face he boast he be go to sleep in that room he whisper bobby study jenkin not know what to make of the old man for into the awe of the wrinkled face have steal a positive relief a emotion that border on the triumphant it be terrible jenkin whisper graham grasp he shoulder what be the matter with you jenkin one would say you be glad no oh no sir it be terrible i be only wonder about the policeman 's report what do you know about he report bobby cry only that -- that he give it to I to mail just before he go up to the old room you mail it graham snap jenkin hesitate when he answer he voice be self-accusing i be a old coward mr robert the policeman tell I the letter be very important and if anything happen to it i would get in trouble he could not afford to leave the house himself he say but as i say i be a coward and i do not want to walk through the wood to the box by the gate i figure it all out it would not be take up until early in the morning and if i wait until daylight it would only be delay one collection so i make up my mind i would sleep on it because i know he have it in for you mr robert i suppose i would mail it in the morning but i decide i would think it over anyway and not harrow myself walk through the wood you have do a good job graham say excitedly where be the report now in my room shall i fetch it sir graham nod and jenkin shuffle up the stair what luck graham say howell must have telephone he suspicion to the district attorney he must have mention the evidence but what do that amount to since it be disappear along with the duplicate of the report if howell make one i can fight with a clear conscience bobby cry i be not asleep when howell 's body alter its position do you realize what that mean to I for once i be wide awake when the old room be at its trick if howell be alive graham answer shortly he would look on the fact that you be awake and alone with the body as the worst possible evidence against you bobby 's elation die there be always something to tangle I in the eye of the law with these mystery but i know and i 'll fight can you find any trace of a conspiracy against I in this last ghastly adventure it complicate everything graham admit it be beyond sound bobby say for my grandfather 's death last night and the disturbance of he body this afternoon seem calculate to condemn I absolutely yet howell 's murder and the movement of he body with the disappearance of the cast and the handkerchief seem design to save I be there two influence at work in this house -- one for I one against I let 's think of the human element graham answer with a frown i have no faith in parede my man have fail to report on marium that be queer you fancy a woman in black slip through the wood and we hear a woman cry i want to account for those thing before i give in to groom 's spirit i confess at time they seem the only logical explanation here 's jenkin if trouble come of he withhold the report i 'll take the blame bobby say graham snatch the long envelope from jenkin ' hand it be address in a firm hand to the district attorney at the county seat there be no question graham say that be it we must not open it we would better not destroy it put it where it will not be easily find jenkin if you be question you have no recollection of howell have give it to you mr blackburn promise he will see you get in no trouble the old man smile trouble he scoff mr blackburn need not fret himself about I he be the last of this family -- that be miss katherine and he i be old and about do for i do not mind trouble not a bit sir bobby press he hand he voice be a little husky : i do not think you would go that far in my service jenkin the old butler smile slyly : i would go a lot further than that sir we have better get back graham say the blood hound ought to be here and they 'll sniff at the case harder than ever because it be do for howell they watch jenkin go upstairs with the report we be take long chance graham say desperately long chance but you be in a desperately dangerous position it be the only way you 'll be accuse of steal the evidence but remember when they question you they can prove nothing unless the cast and the handkerchief turn up if they have be take by a enemy in some magical fashion to be produce at the proper moment there be no hope meantime play the game and katherine and i will help you all we can the doctor too be friendly there be no doubt of he come now let 's face the music bobby follow graham to the hall try to strengthen he nerve for the ordeal even now he be more appal by the apparently supernatural background of the case than he be by the material detail which point to he guilt more than the report and the cast and the handkerchief the remembrance of that impossible moment in the blackness of the old room fill he mind and the unearthly and remote cry still throb in he ear katherine graham and the doctor wait by the fireplace they have hear nothing from the authority but they must be here soon doctor groom say do you learn anything back there hartley katherine ask it be not the servant he say jenkin hear the cry he be certain it come from outside the house parede look up extraordinary he say i wish i have hear it doctor groom grumble parede laugh thank the good lord i do not perpetually bobby you house remind I that i have nerve sensitive to the unknown world i will go further than the doctor i will say that this house _ be _ crowd with the supernatural it shelter thing that we can not understand that we will never understand when i be a child in panama i have a nurse who unfortunately develop too strongly my native superstition how she frighten I with she bedtime story they be all of man murder or dead of fever cross the trail or build the railroad or digging insufficient ditch for de lesseps some of she best go farther back than that they be thick with the ghost of old spaniard and the crimson hand of morgan 's buccaneer really that tiny strip across the isthmus be crowd with soul snatch too quickly from tear and tortured body if you be sensitive you feel they be still there what have all this to do with the cedar doctor groom grumble it explain my ability to sense strange element in this old house there be in panama -- if you do not mind doctor -- improvise graveyard tangle by the jungle that give you a feeling of a active unseen population precisely as this house do he arise and stroll with a cat-like lack of sound about the hall when he speak again he voice be scarcely audible it be the voice of a man who think aloud and the doctor fail to interrupt he again i have feel less spiritually alarm in those place of grin skull which always seem try to recite agony beyond expression than i feel in this house for here the wood be more desolate than the jungle and the wall of house as old as this make a prison for suffer a vague discomfort steal through bobby 's surprise he have never hear parede speak so seriously in spite of the man 's unruffled manner there be nothing of mockery about he word what then be they intention parede say no more but for several minute he pace up and down the hall glancing often with languid eye toward the stair he have the appearance of one who expect and wait katherine graham and the doctor bobby could see have be make as uneasy as himself by the change in the panamanian the doctor clear he throat he voice break the silence tentatively : if this house make you so unhappy young man why do you stay parede pause in he walk he thin lip twitch he indicate bobby for the sake of my very good friend what be a man 's personal fear and desire if he can help he friend graham 's distaste be evident parede recognize it with a smile bobby watch he curiously realize more and more that graham be right to this extent : they must somehow learn the real purpose of the panamanian 's continued presence here parede resume he walk he still have that air of expectancy he seem to listen this feeling of imminence reach bobby increase he restlessness he think he hear a automobile horn outside he spring up go to the door open it and stand gaze through the damp and narrow court yet he confess he listen for a repetition of that unearthly cry through the thicket rather than for the approach of those who would try to condemn he for two murder parede be right the place be unhealthy its dark wall seem to draw closer they have a desolate and unfriendly secretiveness they might hide anything the whir of a motor reach he headlight fling gigantic distorted shadow of tree across the wall of the old wing bobby face the other they be come he say and he voice be sufficiently apprehensive now graham join he at the door yes he say there will be another inquisition you all know that howell for some absurd reason suspect bobby bobby it go without say know no more about the crime than any of we i dare say you 'll keep that in mind if they try to confuse you after all there be very little any of we can tell they except parede say with a yawn what go on upstairs when the woman cry and howell 's body move of course i know nothing about that graham glance at he sharply i do not know what you mean but you have tell we all that you be bobby 's friend quite so and i be not a spy he move he head in he grave and dignified bow the automobile stop at the entrance to the court three man step out and hurry up the path as they enter the hall bobby recognize the sallow wizened feature of the coroner one of the other be short and thick set he round and florid face one feel should have express friendliness and good-humour rather than the intolerant anger that mark it now the third be a lank bald-headed man whose sharp face release more determination than intelligence i be robinson the district attorney the stout one announce and this be jack rawlin the best detective i have get now that howell be go jack be a close friend of howell so he 'll make a good job of it but i think it be time i come myself to see what the devil 's go on in this house the lank man nod you be right mr robinson there 'll be no more nonsense about the case if howell have make a arrest he might be alive this minute bobby 's heart sink these man would act from a primary instinct of revenge they want the man who have kill sila blackburn principally because it be certain he have also kill they friend rawlin 's word moreover suggest that howell must have telephone a pretty clear outline of the case robinson stare at they insolently this be doctor groom i know which be young mr blackburn bobby step forward the sharp eye surround by puffy flesh study he aggressively bobby forced himself to meet that unfriendly gaze would robinson accuse he now before he have go into the case for himself at least he could prove nothing after a moment the man turn away who be this he ask indicate graham a very good friend -- my lawyer mr graham bobby answer robinson walk over to parede another lawyer he sneer another friend parede answer easily robinson glance at katherine of course you be miss perrine good coroner these be all that be in the front part of the house when you be here before the same lot the coroner squeak there be three servant a man and two woman robinson go on account for they rawlin and see what they have to say come upstairs when you be through all right coroner but he pause at the foot of the step for the present no one will leave the house without my permission if you care to come upstairs with I mr blackburn you might be useful bobby shrink from the thought of return to the old room even with this determine company he do not hesitate however for robinson 's purpose be clear he want bobby where he could watch he graham prepare to accompany they if you need I the doctor say i look at the body -- oh yes robinson sneer i would like to know exactly what time you find the body graham flush but katherine answer easily : about half-past two -- the hour at which mr blackburn be kill and i robinson sneer be arouse at three-thirty a hour during which the police be leave out of the case we think it wise to get a physician first of all graham say you know howell never have a chance you know he have be murder the moment you look at he robinson burst out we act for the best graham answer he manner impressed silence on katherine and bobby we 'll see about that later robinson say with a clear threat if it do not inconvenience you too much we 'll go up now in the upper hall he snatch the candle from the table which way katherine nod to the old corridor and slip to she room robinson step forward with the coroner at he heel bobby graham and the doctor follow inside the narrow choke passage bobby see the district attorney hesitate what be the matter the doctor rumble the district attorney go on without answer he glance at the broken lock so you have to smash you way in he walk to the bed and look down at howell poor devil he murmur howell be not the man to get catch unawares it be beyond I how any one could have come close enough to make that wound without put he on he guard it be beyond we as it be beyond he graham answer how any one get into the room at all in response to robinson 's question he tell in detail about the discovery of both murder robinson ponder for some time then you and mr blackburn be asleep he say miss perrine arouse you this foreigner parede be awake and dress and in the lower hall i think he be in the court as we go by the stair-well graham correct he i shall want to talk to you foreigner robinson say he shiver this room be like a charnel house why do howell want to sleep here i do not think he intend to sleep graham say from the start howell be bind to solve the mystery of the entrance of the room he come here hope that the criminal would make just such a attempt as he do he be confident he could take care of himself get he man and clear up the last detail of the case robinson look straight at bobby then howell know the criminal be in the house howell i daresay graham say telephone you something of he suspicion robinson nod he be on the wrong line graham argue or he would not have be so easily overcome you can see for yourself lock door a wound that suggest the assailant be close to he yet he must have be awake and watchful and if there have be a physical attack before the sharp instrument be drive into he brain he would have cry out yet miss perrine be arouse by nothing of the sort and the coroner i daresay will find no mark of a struggle about the body the coroner who have be busy at the bed glance up no mark at all if howell be not asleep he murderer must have be invisible as well as noiseless doctor groom smile the coroner glare at he i suggest mr district attorney he squeak that the ordinary layman would not know that this type of wound would cause immediate death nor would any man the doctor answer angrily be able to make such a wound with he victim lie on he back on he back robinson echo but he be not on he back the doctor tell of the amazing alteration in the position of both victim bobby regret with all he heart that he have make the attempt to get the evidence already complete frankness be impossible for he already a feeling of guilt spring from the necessity of withhold the first-hand testimony which he alone could give and a woman cry robinson say bewildered all this sound like a ghost story you have more sense than i think doctor groom say dryly i never could get howell to see it that way what be you drive at robinson snap these crime the doctor answer have all the element of a ghostly impulse robinson 's laugh be a little uncomfortable the cedar be a nice place for spook but it will not do i 'll be frank howell telephone I he have find plenty of evidence of human interference it be evident in both case that the murderer come back and disturb the body for some special purpose i do not know what it be the first time but it be simple to understand the last the murderer come for evidence howell have on he person bobby could not meet the sharp puffy eye he alone be capable of testify that the evidence have be remove as if to secrete it from he unlawful hand yet if he speak he would prove the district attorney 's point he would condemn himself curious graham say slowly that the murderer do not take the evidence when he kill he man i do not know about that robinson say but i know howell have evidence on he person you through coroner then we 'll have a look although it be little use he walk to the bed and search howell 's pocket just as i think nothing he tell I he be prepare a report if he do not mail it that be steal with the rest of the stuff rawlin 's right he wait too long to make he arrest again bobby wonder if the man would bring matter to a head now he could appreciate however that robinson with nothing to go on but howell 's telephone suspicion might spoil he chance of a solution by act too hastily rawlin stroll in the two woman be asleep he say the old man know nothing beyond the fact that he hear a woman cry outside a little while ago i do not think we need bother about the back part of the house for the present robinson say howell 's evidence have be steal it be you job to find it unless it be be destroy you other job be to discover the instrument that cause death in both case then maybe we worthy doctor will desert he ghost mr blackburn if you will come with I there be a slight possibility of check up some of the evidence of which howell speak we fine fellow may have make a slip in the court bobby understand and be afraid -- more afraid than he have be at any time since he have overhear howell catalogue he case to graham in the library why even in so much confusion have graham and he fail to think of those tell-tale mark in the court they have be intact when he have stand there just before dark it be unlikely any one have walk across the grass since he see graham 's elaborate precaution demolish the case against he stronger than it have be before howell 's murder graham 's face reveal the same helpless comprehension they follow robinson downstairs graham make a gesture of surrender bobby glance at parede who alone have remain below the panamanian smoked and lounge in the easy chair he eye seem restless i shall wish to ask you some question in a few minute mr parede the district attorney say at you service i be sure parede drawl he watch they until they have enter the court and close the door the chill dampness of the court infected bobby as it have always do it be a proper setting for he accusation and arrest for robinson he know would not wait as howell have do to solve the mystery of the lock door robinson while the other group themselves about he take a flashlight from he pocket and press the control the brilliant cylinder of light illuminate the grass make it seem unnaturally green bobby brace himself for the inevitable denouement then while robinson exclaim angrily he eye widen he heart beat rapidly with a vast and wonder relief for the mark he remember so clearly have be obliterate with painstaking thoroughness and at first the slate seem perfectly clean he be sure he unknown friend have avoid leave any trace of he own each step in the grass have be carefully scrape out in the confusion of the path there be nothing to be learn the genuine surprise of bobby 's exclamation turn robinson to he with a look of doubt you acknowledge these footmark be here mr blackburn certainly bobby answer i see they myself just before dark i know howell ridiculously connect they with the murderer you make a good job of it when you trample they out robinson hazard but it be clear bobby 's amazement have not be lose on he or he go on this foreigner who advertise himself as you friend he be in the court tonight we know that suddenly he stoop and bobby get on he knee beside he the cylinder of light hold in its center one mark clear and distinct in the trampled grass and with a warm gratitude a swift apprehension bobby thought of katherine for the mark in the grass have be make by the heel of a woman 's shoe not the foreigner then robinson muse not yourself blackburn but a woman a devoted woman that be something to get after and if she lie the impression of the heel will give she away the coroner suggest robinson grin you would make a rotten detective coroner woman 's heel be cut to a pattern there be thousand of shoe whose heel would fit this impression we need the sole for identification and that she have not leave we but she be do one favor she be advertise herself as a woman and there be just three woman in the house one of those commit this serious offence and the inference be obvious before bobby could protest the doctor break in with he throaty rumble : one of those or the woman who cry about the house bobby start the memory of that eerie grief be still uncomfortable in he brain could there have be actually a woman at the stagnant lake that afternoon and close to the house to-night -- some mysterious friend who assume grave risk in he service he recognize robinson 's logic unless there be something in that far-fetched theory katherine face a situation nearly as serious as he own robinson straighten at the same moment the scrape of a window reach they bobby glance at the newer wing katherine lean from she window the coincidence disturb he in robinson 's mind he know she anxiety would assume a color of guilt she voice moreover be too uncertain too full of misgiving : what be go on down there there have be no -- no more tragedy would you mind join we for a moment robinson ask she draw back the curtain fall over she light window the darkness of the court be disturb again only by the limited radiance of the flashlight she come hurriedly from the front door i saw you gather here i hear you talk i wonder you know there be footprint in this court robinson say harshly that howell connect they with the murderer of you uncle yes she answer simply why then he ask do you attempt to obliterate they she laugh what do you mean i do not i have not be out of the house since just after luncheon can you prove that it need no proof i tell you so the flashlight expose the ugly confidence of robinson 's smile i be sorry to suggest the need of corroboration you doubt my word she flash a woman he answer have obliterate valuable testimony i shall make it my business to punish she she laugh again without another word she turn and reenter the house robinson 's oath be audible to the other we can not put up with that sort of thing sir rawlin say i ought to place this entire household under arrest robinson mutter as a lawyer graham say easily i should think with you lack of evidence it might be ask for trouble there be parede who acknowledge he be in the court all right i 'll see what he be get to say he start for the house bobby linger for a moment with graham do you know anything about this hartley nothing graham whisper then you do not think katherine -- if she would do it she would have take good care not to be so curious i doubt if it be katherine they follow the other into the hall bobby scarcely appreciate why at first realize there have be a change there then he understand : robinson face a empty chair the hall be pungent with cigarette smoke but parede have go robinson point to the stair get he down he say to rawlin he would not have go to bed graham suggest suppose he be in the old room where howell lie but rawlin find he nowhere upstairs with a increase excitement robinson join the search they go through the entire house parede be no longer there he have to all appearance put a period to he unwelcome visit he have definitely disappear from the cedar he most likely exit be through the kitchen door which be unlock but jenkin who have return to he room have hear no one with they electric lamp robinson and rawlin ferret about the rear entrance for trace the path there be as trampled and useless as the one in front rawlin who have go some distance from the house straighten with a satisfied exclamation the other join he here be where he leave the path right enough he say and we foreigner be not make any more noise than he have to he flash he lamp on a fresh footprint in the soft soil at the side of the path the mark of the toe be deep and firm the impression of the heel be very light parede it be clear have walk from the house on tiptoe follow on robinson command i tell this fellow i want to question he i have scare he off keep he light on the ground rawlin lead the way across the clear the trail be simple enough to follow each of the panamanian 's footprint be distinct each have that peculiarity that suggest the stealth of he progress as they continue bobby respond to a excited premonition he sense the destination of the chase he could picture parede now in the loneliest portion of the wood for the trail unquestionably point to the path he have take that afternoon toward the stagnant lake hartley he say parede leave the house to go to the stagnant lake where i fancied i see a woman in black do you see and he do not hear the cry of a woman a little while ago and when we tell he he become restless he wander about the hall talking of ghost a rendezvous graham answer he may have be wait for just that the cry may have be a signal perhaps you 'll believe now bobby that the man have have a underhanded purpose in stay here i have make too many hasty judgment in my life hartley i 'll go slow on this i 'll wait until we see what we find at the lake rawlin snap off he light the little party pause at the black entrance of the path into the thicket he be bury himself in the wood rawlin say they crowd instinctively closer in the sudden darkness a brisk wind have spring up it rattle among the tree and set the dead leaf in gentle rustling motion it suggest to bobby the picture which have be force into he brain the night of he grandfather 's death the moon now possess less light but it remind he again of a drown face and through the darkness he could fancy the tree strain in the wind like puny man abruptly the thought of penetrate the forest become frightening the silent loneliness of the stagnant lake seem as unfriendly and threatening as the melancholy of the old room there be too many of we robinson be say you would better go on alone rawlin and do not take any chance i have get to have this man you understand i think he know thing worth while the rise wind laugh at he whisper the detective flash he lamp once shut it off again and step into the close embrace of the thicket suddenly bobby grasp graham 's arm the little group become tense breathless for across the wind with a diffused quality a lack of direction vibrate to they again the faint and mournful grief of a woman chapter vi the one who creep in the private staircase the odd mournful cry lose itself in the restless lament of the wind the thicket from which it have seem to issue assume in the pallid moonlight a new unfriendliness instinctively the six man move closer together the coroner 's thin tone express he alarm : what the devil be that i do not really believe there could be a woman around here a queer one the detective grunt the district attorney question bobby and graham that be the voice you hear from the house graham nod perhaps not so far away doctor groom hitherto more capture than any of they by the imminence of a spiritual responsibility for the mystery of the cedar be the first now to reach for a rational explanation of this new phase we must not let we fancy run away with we the coroner 's right for once no excuse for a woman hiding in that thicket a bird maybe or some animal -- sound more like a human be robinson object the detective reason in a steady unmoved voice : only a mad woman would wander through the wood cry like that without a special purpose this man parede have leave the house and come through here i would guess it be a signal graham and i have think of that bobby say howell be a sharp one robinson muse but he must have go wrong on this fellow he ` phone I the man know nothing speak of he as a foreigner who loll around smoking cigarette and try to make a fool of he with a lot of talk about ghost howell graham say misjudge the case from the start he be not to blame but he mistake cost he he life robinson do not answer bobby see that the man have discard he intolerant temper from that change he draw a new hope he accept it as the beginning of fulfilment of he prophecy last night that a accident to howell and the entrance of a new man into the case would give he a fight chance it be clearly parede at the moment who fill the district attorney 's mind go after he he say shortly to rawlin if you can get away with it bring he back and whoever you find with he rawlin hesitate i be no coward but i know what be happen to howell this be not a ordinary case i do not want to walk into a ambush it would be safer not to run he down alone all right robinson agree i do not care to leave the cedar for the present perhaps mr graham -- but graham be not enthusiastic it never occur to bobby that he be afraid graham he guess desire to remain near katherine i 'll go if you like doctor groom rumble it be probable that graham 's instinct to stay have spring from service rather than sentiment the man it be reasonable seek to protect katherine from the cedar itself and from robinson 's too direct method of examination as a antidote for he unwelcome jealousy bobby offer himself to rawlin would you mind if i come too i have know parede a long time robinson sneer what do you think of that rawlin but the detective step close and whisper in the district attorney 's ear all right robinson say go with 'em if you want mr blackburn and bobby know that he would go not to help but to be watch the other stray toward the house the three man face the entrance of the path alone no more loud talk now the detective warn if he go on tiptoe so can we even with this company bobby shrink from the dark and restless forest with a smooth skill the detective follow the unfamiliar path from time to time he stoop close to the ground shaded he lamp with he hand and press the control always the light verify the presence of parede ahead of they bobby know they be near the stagnant lake the underbrush be thicker they go with more care to limit the sound of they passage among the tree and each moment the physical surroundings of the pursuit increase bobby 's doubt of parede no ordinary impulse would bring a man to such a place in this black hour before the dawn -- particularly parede who speak constantly of he superstitious nature who advertise a thorough-paced fear of the cedar the panamanian 's decision to remain he lack of emotion before the tragic succession of event at the house he attempt to enter the corridor just before bobby have go himself to the old room for the evidence he desire to direct suspicion against katherine finally this excursion in response to the eerie cry all suggest a definite perhaps a dangerous purpose in the brain of the serene and inscrutable man they slip to the open space about the lake the moon barely distinguish for they the flat melancholy stretch of water they listen breathlessly there be no sound beyond the normal stirring of the forest bobby have a feeling similar to the afternoon 's that he be watch he try unsuccessfully to penetrate the darkness across the lake where he have fancy the woman skulk the detective 's keen sens be satisfied dollar to doughnut they be not here they have probably go on i 'll have to take a chance and show the light again fresh footprint be reveal in the narrow circle of illumination testify to parede 's continue stealth they make a straight line to the water 's edge rawlin exclaim : he step into the lake how deep be it the black surface of the water seem to bobby like a opaque glass hide sinister thing suppose parede instead of come to a rendezvous have be lead it be deep enough in the center he answer shallow around the edge quite then he know we be after he groom say rawlin nod and run he light along the shore a few yard to the right a ledge of smooth rock stretch from the water to a grove of pine tree the detective arise and turn off he light he be block we he say he know he would not leave he mark on the rock or the pine needle no way to guess he direction now doctor groom clear he throat with a hesitant manner he recite the discovery of the queer light in the desert house its unaccountable disappearance they failure to find its source i be think he explain that parede alone see the light give out it be he suggestion that he go to the front of the house to investigate this path might be use as a short cut to the desert house the rendezvous may have be there rawlin be interested again how far be it not much more than a mile groom answer then we 'll go the detective decide show the way groom in the lead they strike off through the wood bobby who walk last notice the faint messenger of dawn behind the tree in the east he be glad the night cloak too much in this neighborhood by daylight the empty house would guard its secret less easily suddenly he pause and stand quite still he want to call to the other to point out what he have see there be no question by chance he have accomplish the task that have seem so hopeless yesterday he have find the spot where he consciousness have come back momentarily to record a wet moon tree strain in the wind like puny man and a figure in a mask which he have call he conscience he gaze he hope retreat before a unforeseen disappointment for with the paling moon and the bent tree survive that very figure on the discovery of whose nature he have build so vital a hope and in this bad light it convey to he a appearance nearly human through the underbrush the trunk of a tree shatter by some violent storm mock he with its illusion the dead leaf at the top be like cloth across a face therefore he argue there have be no conspiracy against he parede be clean as far as that be concern he have wander about the cedar alone he have open he eye at a point between the court and the desert house rawlin turn back suspiciously ask why he loiter he continue almost indifferently he still want to know parede 's goal but he disappointment and its meaning obsess he when they creep up the grow light expose the scar of the desert house everything be as bobby remember it at the front there be no decayed wood or vegetation to strengthen the doctor 's half-hearted theory of a phosphorescent emanation the tangle of footstep near the rear door be confusing and it be some time before the three man straighten and glance at each other know that the doctor 's wisdom be prove for parede have be there recently for that matter might still be in the house moreover he have not hide he track as he could have do in the thick grass instead he have come in a straight line from the wood across a piece of sandy ground which contain the record of he direction and he continued stealth but inside they find nothing except burnt-out match strew across the floor testimony of they earlier search the fugitive have evidently leave more carefully than he have come the chill emptiness of the desert house have draw and release he ahead of the chase i guess he know what the light mean the detective say as well as he do that queer call it complicate matter that i can not find a woman 's footprint around here she may have keep to the grass and this marked-up path for since i do not believe in banshee i 'll swear there be be a woman around either a crazy woman wander at large who might be connect with the murder or else a sane one who signal the foreigner let 's get back and see what the district attorney make of it it might be wiser not to dismiss the banshee as you call they too hurriedly doctor groom rumble as they return along the road in the grow light bobby lose the feeling he have have of be spy upon the memory of such a adventure be bind to breed something like confidence among its actor rawlin bobby hope would be less unfriendly the detective in fact talk as much to he as to the doctor he assure they that robinson would get the panamanian unless he prove miraculously clever he be show we that he know something he go on i do not say how much because i can not get a motive to make it worth he while to commit such crime the man smile blandly at bobby while in you case there be a motive at least -- the money he chuckle that be the easiest motive to understand in the world it be stronger than love bobby wonder love have be the impulse for the last few month ' folly that have lead he into he present situation graham over he stern principle of right have already step outside the law in back katherine 's effort to save bobby so he wonder how much graham would risk how far he be capable of go himself at the inspiration of such a motive the sun be up when they reach the cedar katherine have go to she room the coroner have leave robinson and graham have build a fresh fire in the hall they sit there talk where you be robinson demand we would about decide the spook have do for you the detective outline they failure the district attorney listen with a frown at the end he arise and without say anything walk to the telephone when he return he appear better satisfied mr parede he say will have to be a slick article to make a clean getaway and i be bring another man to keep reporter out they 'll know from howell 's murder that mr blackburn do not die a natural death if reporter get in do not talk to they i do not want that damned foreigner reading in the papers what be go on here i would give my job to have he in that chair for five minute now graham clear he throat i scarcely know how to suggest this since it be sufficiently clear because of howell 's suspicion that you have mr blackburn under close observation but he have a fair idea of parede 's habit he haunt and he friend in new york he might be able to learn thing the police could not i have one or two matter to take I to town i would make myself personally responsible for he return -- the district attorney interrupted i see what you mean wait a minute he clasp he hand and roll he fat thumb one around the other the little eye surround by puffy flesh become enigmatic all at once he glance up with a genial smile why not i have not say anything about hold mr blackburn as more than a witness he tone chill bobby as thoroughly as a direct accusation would have do and robinson go on the sooner you go the better the sooner you get back the better graham be visibly puzzle by this prompt acquiescence he start for the stair but the district attorney wave he aside coat and hat be downstairs no need waste time graham turn to doctor groom you 'll tell miss perrine doctor the doctor show that he understand the warning graham wish to convey the district attorney make a point of walk to the stable to see they off graham gesture angrily as they drive away it be plain as the nose on you face i be too anxious to test they attitude toward you bobby he jump at the chance to run we out of the house he 'll have several hour during which to turn the place upside down to give katherine the third degree and we can not go back we 'll have to see it through why should he give I a chance to slip away bobby ask but before long he realize that robinson be take no chance at the junction of the road from smithtown a car pick they up and cling to they heel all the way to the city rawlin must have telephone graham say while we go to the stable they be still play howell 's game they 'll give you plenty of rope he drive straight to bobby 's apartment the elevator man verify they suspicion robinson have telephone the new york police for a search a familiar type of metropolitan detective meet they in the hall outside bobby 's door i be through gentleman he greet they impudently graham face he in a burst of temper the city may have to pay for this outrage the man grin i should get gray hair about that he go on downstairs they enter the apartment to find confusion in each room bureau drawer have be turn upside down the desk have be examine with a reckless thoroughness graham be frankly worried i wonder if he find anything if he do you will not get out of town what could he find bobby ask if the court be plant graham answer why should not these room have be after last night i do not believe the court be plant bobby say in the lower hall the elevator man hand bobby the mail that have come since the night of he grandfather 's murder in the car again he glance over the envelope he tear one open with a surprised haste this be marium 's handwriting he tell graham he read the hastily scrawl note aloud with a tone that fail toward the end dear bobby you must not as you say think I a bad sport you be very wicked last night maybe you be so because of too many of those naughty little cocktail why should you threaten poor marium and you boast you be go out to the cedar to kill you grandfather because you do not like he any more so i tell carlo to take you home i be afraid of a scene in public come around have tea with I tell I you forgive I tell I what be the matter with you she must have write that yesterday morning bobby mutter good lord hartley then it be in my mind unless that letter 's a plant too graham say yet how could she know there would be a search why should not she have address it to the cedar where there be a fair chance of its be open and read by the police why have not my man make any report on she we have a number of question to ask marium but word come down from the dancer 's apartment that marium be not at home when do she go out graham ask the hall man not since i come on duty at six o'clock graham slip a bill in the man 's hand we have a important message for she we would better leave it with the maid when they be alone in the upper hall he explain he purpose to bobby we must know whether she be actually here if she be not if she have not be back for the last twenty-four hour -- do not you see it be yesterday afternoon you think you see a woman at the lake and last night a woman cry about the cedar -- that be go pretty far hartley it be a chance a physical one a pretty maid open the door she face be trouble she study they with frank disappointment i think -- she begin that you mistress be come back graham flash there be no concealment in the girl 's manner it be certain that marium be not in the apartment you remember I bobby ask yes you have be here you be a friend of mademoiselle 's you can perhaps tell I where she be bobby shake he head the girl spread she hand she burst out excitedly : what be one to do i have telephone the theater there be no one there who know anything at all except that mademoiselle have not appear at the performance last night graham glance at bobby when he ask do you see she last it be before luncheon yesterday do she leave no instruction do not she say when she would be back the girl nod that be what worry I for she say she would be back after the performance last night she leave no instruction graham repeat only that if any one call or telephone i be to make no appointment what be i to do perhaps i should not be talk to you she would never forgive I for a indiscretion for the present i advise you to do nothing graham say you can safely leave all that to she manager i be go to see they now i will tell they what you have say the girl 's eye moisten thank you sir i have be at my wit ' end apparently she withhold nothing she play no part to confuse the dancer 's friend on the way to the manager ' office with the trail car behind they graham reason excitedly : for the first time we seem to be actually on the track here be a tangible clue that may lead to the heart of the case marium pull the wool over the maid 's eye too she do not want she to know she plan but she instruction show that she have no intention of return last night she probably make a bee line for the cedar it be probably she that you see at the lake probably she who cry last night if only she have not write that note i can not get the meaning of it it be up to she manager now if they have not hear from she it be a safe guess she be play a deep game connect with the cry and the light at the desert house and the disappearance of parede before dawn you must realize the connection between that and you condition the other evening after you have leave they bobby nod he begin to hope that at the manager ' office they would receive no explanation of marium 's absence destructive to graham 's theory early as it be they find a bald-headed man in he shirt sleeve pacing with a air of panic a blantantly furnished office well he burst out as they enter my secretary tell I you have come about this temperamental carman of mine tell I where she be quick graham smile at bobby the manager run he finger across he bald and shine forehead it be no laughing matter then she have definitely disappear graham say disappear why do i come down at this ungodly hour except on the chance of get some word she do not even telephone last night i have to show myself in front of the curtain and give they a spiel about a sudden indisposition and believe I gentleman audience be not what they use to be do these gink sit back and take the show for what it be worth not by a darn sight flock to the box office and howl for they money back if she do not appear to-night i might as well close the house i 'll be ruin unless graham suggest you get you press agent to make capital out of she absence the papers would publish she picture and thousand of people would look she up for you the manager cease he perplexed massage of he forehead he shake hand genially i would think of that with some frill ` have beautiful dancer meet foul play million in jewel on she person when last see ' old stuff but they rise to it that will help graham say to bobby when they be in the car again the reporter will find marium quicker than any detective i can put my hand on my man evidently fall down because she have go before i get he on the case at he office they learn that be the fact the private detective have be able to get no slightest clue as to marium 's whereabouts moreover bobby 's description of the stranger who have enter the cafe with she merely suggest a type familiar to the tenderloin for purpose of identification it be worthless always follow by the car from smithtown they go to the hotel where parede have live to a number of he haunt bobby talk with man who know he but he learn nothing parede 's friend have have no word since the man 's departure for the cedar the day before so they turn they back on the city elate by the significance of marium 's absence yet worry by the search and the watchful car which never lose sight of they when they be in the country graham sigh he relief you have not be stop therefore nothing be find at you apartment but if that be not plant why should maria have send a incriminate note there unless bobby answer she tell the truth unless she be sincere when she mail it unless she learn something important between the time she write it and she disappearance from she home frankly bobby graham say the note and the circumstance under which it come to you be as damaging as the footprint and the handkerchief but it do not tell we how any human being could have enter that room to commit the murder and disturb the body at least we have get one physical fact and i be go to work on that if it be marium prowl around the cedar bobby say she be amazingly slippery and with parede go what be you go to do with you physical fact and how do it explain the friendly influence that wipe out my footprint be it a friendly or a evil influence that snatch away the evidence and that keep it secrete we 'll see graham say i be go after a flesh-and-blood criminal who be not you i be go to try to find out what you grandfather be afraid of the night of he murder after a time he glance up you have know parede for a long time bobby but i do not think you have ever tell I how you meet he a couple of year ago i should think bobby answer somebody bring he to the club i have forget who carlo be work for a big panama import firm he be try to interest this chap in the new york end i see he off and on after that and get to like he for he quiet manner and a queer dry wit he have in those day two or three month ago he -- he seem to fit into my humor and we become pretty chummy as you know even after last night i hate to believe he be my enemy he be you enemy graham answer and last night 's the weak joint in he armor i wonder if robinson do not scare he away by threaten to question he parede be not connect with that company now be he i gather he have no regular position no he be pick up one or two temporary thing with the fruit company more than he run away the thing that worry I about carlo be he ridiculous suspicion of katherine he tell graham in detail of that conversation graham frown he open the throttle wider they anxiety increase to know what have happen at the cedar since they departure the outpost of the forest impose silence close eagerly about they seem to welcome they to its dead loneliness there be a man on guard at the gate they hurry past the house show no sign of life but when they enter the court bobby see katherine at she window doubtless attract by the sound of they arrival she face brighten but she raise she arm in a gesture suggestive of despair do she mean the evidence have be find bobby ask graham make no attempt to conceal he real interest the impulse at the back of all he effort in bobby 's behalf more likely robinson have worry the life out of she since we have be go i ought not to have leave she i set the trap myself when they be in the house they halting curiosity be lose in a vast surprise the hall be empty but they hear voice in the library they hurry across the dining room pause in the doorway stare with unbelieving eye at the accustomed picture they have least expect to see parede lounge on the divan smoking with easy indifference he clothing and he shoe be spotless he have shave and he beard have be freshly trim rawlin and the district attorney stand in front of the fireplace study he with perplexed eye the persistence of they regard even after bobby 's entrance suggest to he that the evidence remain secrete that the officer under the circumstance be scarcely interested in he return he be sweep himself into a explosive amazement : carlo what the deuce be you do here the panamanian expel a cloud of smoke he smile rest after a fatiguing walk in he unexpected presence bobby fancy a demolition of the hope graham and he have bring back from the city he could not imagine guilt lurk behind that serene manner where do you come from what be you up to last night there be no accounting for parede 's daring he tell himself no accounting for he easy gesture now as he draw again at he cigarette and toss it in the fireplace these gentleman he say have be ask just that question i be honor i have no idea my movement be of such interest i have tell they that i take a stroll the night be over there be no point in go to bed and all day i have be without exercise yet graham say harshly you have have practically no sleep since you come here parede nod very distressing be not it maybe rawlin sneer you 'll tell we why you go on tiptoe and i suppose you do not hear a woman cry in the wood that be just it parede answer i do hear something like that and it occur to I to follow such a curious sound so i go on tiptoe as you call it why robinson exclaim angrily you walk in the lake to hide you track parede smile it be very dark that be chance quite silly of I my foot get wet i gather rawlin say it be chance that take you to the desert house parede shake he head do not you think i be as much puzzle as the rest by that strange disappear light it be as good a place to walk as any where have you be since graham ask when i have get there i be tired parede answer since it be not far to the station i think i would go on into smithtown and have a bath and rest but i assure you i have trudge back from the station just now suddenly he repeat the apparently absurd formulum he have use with howell you know the court seem full of unfriendly thing -- what the ignorant would call ghost i be spanish and i know after a moment he add : the wood too i should not care to wander through they too much after dark robinson stare but rawlin brush the question aside what hotel do you go to in smithtown it be call the ` new ' nothing could be farther from the fact shall i see if that be straight sir the district attorney agree and rawlin leave the room parede laugh how interesting i be under suspicion it would be something would not it to commit crime with the devilish ingenuity of these no no mr district attorney look to the ghost they alone be sufficiently clever but i might say since you take this attitude that i do not care to answer any more question until you discover something that might give you the right to ask they he lay back on the divan languidly light another cigarette graham beckon robinson bobby follow they out suspect graham 's purpose unwilling that action should be take too hastily against the panamanian for even now guilty knowledge seem incompatible with parede 's polish reserve when he join the other indeed graham with a aggressive air be demand the district attorney 's intention if he could elude you so easily last night it be common sense to put he where you can find he in case of need he be give you excuse enough the man 's get I guess robinson muse but there be other element what be happen since we leave graham ask quickly have you get any trace of howell 's evidence robinson smile enigmatically but he failure be apparent i be like howell he say i would risk nearly anything myself to learn how the room be enter how the crime be commit how those poor devil be make to alter they position so bobby say you have my room in new york search you have I follow to-day it be ridiculous robinson ignore he he step to the front door open it and look around the court what do the sphinx mean about ghost in the court they walk out gaze helplessly at the trampled grass about the fountain at the melancholy wall at the partly open window of the room of mystery he know something robinson muse maybe you be right mr graham but i wonder if i ought not to go farther and take you all graham smile uncomfortably but bobby know why the official fail to follow that radical course like howell he hesitate to remove from the cedar the person most likely to solve its mystery as long as a chance remain that howell have be right about bobby he would give sila blackburn 's grandson he head merely make sure as he have do this morning that there should be no escape he glance up i wonder if we foreigner 's laughing at I now graham make a movement toward the door we might he say significantly find that out without disturbing he robinson nod and lead the way silently back to the house such a method be repugnant to bobby and he follow at a distance then he see from the movement of the two man ahead that the library have again offer the unexpected and he enter parede be no longer in the room bobby be about to speak but robinson shake he head angrily raise he hand in a gesture of warn all three strain forward listen and bobby catch the sound that have arrest the other -- a stealthy scrape that would have be inaudible

another systematic search of the hall to discover if they could the motive for parede 's stealthy presence there bobby accept greedily this opportunity to find katherine to learn from she undisturbed what have happen in the house that morning the meaning perhaps of she despairing gesture when in response to he knock she open she door and step into the corridor he guess she despair have be a expression of the increase strain of she helplessness in face of robinson 's harsh determination he question I for a hour she say principally about the heel mark in the court they cling to that because i do not think they have find anything new at the lake you do not know anything about it do you katherine you be not there you do not do that for I i be not there bobby i honestly do not know

bobby recall he last thought before lose himself last night he try to force from he mind now the threat in robinson 's eye he tell himself again and again that the man be not actually unfriendly then the blackness encircle he he sleep almost at once it seem to he he be fight away demand drowsily : what be the matter leave I alone he hear graham 's voice unnaturally subdue and anxious what be you do bobby then bobby know he be no longer in he bed that he stand instead in a cold place and the meaning of he position come with a rush of sick terror get hold of yourself graham say come back bobby open he eye he be in the upper hall at the head of the stair unconsciously he have be about to creep quietly down perhaps to the library graham have awaken he it seem to offer the answer to everything it seem to give outline to a monstrous familiar that drown he real self in the black pit while it conduct he body to the commission of unspeakable crime he lurch into the bedroom and sit shiver on the bed graham enter and quietly close the door what time be it bobby ask hoarsely half-past two i do not think robinson be arouse the damp moon give a ominous unreality to the room what do i do bobby whisper get softly out of bed and go to the hall it be uncanny you be like a automaton i do not wake you at once you see i -- i think you might go to the old room bobby shake again he draw a blanket about he shoulder and you believe i would show the way in and out but the room be empty so i be go downstairs -- he shudder good god then it be all true i do it for the money i put howell out to protect myself i be go after robinson it be true hartley tell I do you think it be true graham turn away do not ask I to say anything to help you just now he answer huskily for after this i do not

word there be nothing else any one can say i must decide what to do i must think it over but as always think bring no release it merely insist that the case against he be prove at last he have be see slip unconsciously from he room -- and at the same hour all that remain be to learn how he have accomplish the apparent miracle then no excuse would remain for not go to robinson and confess the woman at the lake and in the courtyard the movement of the body and the vanish of the evidence under he hand parede 's odd behavior all become in he mind puzzling detail that fail to obscure the chief fact after this something must be do about parede 's detention he have not dream that he weariness could placate even momentarily such reflection but at last he sleep again he be arouse by the tramp of man around the house and strange harsh voice he raise himself on he elbow and glance from the window it have long be daylight two burly fellow in overalls carry pick and spade across they shoulder push through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing he turn graham fully dress stand at the side of the bed those man bobby ask wearily the grave digger graham answer they be go to work in the old cemetery to prepare a place for sila blackburn with he father that be why i have come to wake you up the minister 's telephone katherine he will be here before noon do you know it be after ten o'clock for some time bobby stare through the window at the desolate ragged landscape it be abnormally cold even for the late fall dull cloud obscure the sun and furnish a illusion of crowd earthward a funereal day the word slip into he mind he repeat they when you grandfather 's bury graham answer softly we 'll all feel happier why bobby ask it will not lessen the fact of he murder time graham say lessen such fact -- even for the police bobby glance at he flush you mean you have decide to stand by I after what happen last night graham smile i have think it all over i sleep like a top last night i hear nothing i see nothing ought i to want you to stand by I bobby say ought not i to make a clean breast of it at least i must do something about parede graham frown it be hard to believe he have any connection with you sleep-walking last night yet it be as clear as ever that marium and he be up to some game in which you figure he should not be in jail bobby persist get up graham advise bathe and have some breakfast then we can decide there be no use talking of the other thing i have forget it as far as possible you must bobby spring upright how can i forget it if it be hard to face sleep before what do you think it be now have i any right -- do not graham say i 'll be with you again to-night if i be satisfy beyond the shadow of a doubt i would advise you to confess but i can not be until i know what marium and parede be do when bobby have bath and dress he find in spite of he mental turmoil that he sleep have do he good while he breakfast graham urge he to eat try to drive from he brain the morbid aftermath of last night 's revealing moment the manager take my advice but marium 's still miss she picture be in most of the papers there have be reporter here this morning about the murder he stroll over and hand bobby a number of newspaper where 's robinson bobby ask i see he in the court a while ago i daresay he be wander around -- perhaps watch the man at the grave he learn nothing new last night i be with he at breakfast i gather not bobby look up be not that a automobile come through the wood he ask maybe rawlin back from smithtown or the minister the car stop at the entrance of the court they hear the remote tinkling of the front door bell jenkin pass through the cold air invade the hall and the dining room tell they he have open the door he sharp exclamation recall howell 's report which at they direction he have fail to mail have he exclamation be draw by a accuser bobby start to rise graham move toward the door then jenkin enter and stand to one side bobby share he astonishment for parede walk in unbutton he overcoat the former easy-mannered uncommunicative foreigner he appear moreover to have sleep pleasantly he eye show no weariness he clothing no disarrangement he speak at once quite as if nothing disagreeable have shadow he departure good morning if i have dream of this change in the weather i would have bring a heavier overcoat i have nearly frozen drive from smithtown before either man could grope for a suitable greet he face bobby he feel in he pocket with whimsical discouragement fact be bobby i leave new york too suddenly i have not notice until a little while ago you see i spend a good deal in smithtown yesterday bobby speak with a obvious confusion : what do you mean carlo i think you be -- graham interrupted with a flat demand for a explanation how do you get away parede wave he hand later mr graham there be a hack driver outside who be even more suspicious than you he want to be pay i ask rawlin to drive I back but he rush from the courthouse probably to telephone he rotund superior fact be this fellow want five dollar -- a outrageous rate i have tell he so -- but it do not do any good so will you lend I bobby -- bobby hand he a banknote he do not miss graham 's meaning glance parede give the money to the butler pay he will you jenkin thanks he survey the remains of bobby 's breakfast he sit down may i my breakfast be early and prison food when you be not in the habit -- bobby try to account for parede 's friendly manner that he should have come back at all be sufficiently strange but it be harder to understand why he should express no resentment for he treatment yesterday why he should fail to refer to bobby 's question at the moment of he arrest or to the openly express enmity of graham only one theory promise to fit at all it be necessary for the panamanian to return to the cedar he purpose whatever it be compel he to remain for the present in the mournful tragic house therefore he would crush he justifiable anger he would make it practically impossible for bobby to refuse he hospitality and he have ask for money -- only a trifling sum yet graham would grasp at the fact to support he earlier suspicion parede 's arrival possess one virtue : it divert bobby 's thought temporarily from he own dilemma from he inability to chart a course graham on the other hand be ill at ease beyond a doubt he be disarm by parede 's good humor for he yesterday 's incident be not so lightly to be pass over eventually he curiosity conquer the word come nevertheless with some difficulty : we scarcely expect you back he laugh be short and embarrassed we take it for grant you would find it necessary to stay in smithtown for a while parede sip the coffee which jenkin have pour splendid coffee you should have taste what i have this morning simple enough mr graham i telephone as soon as rawlin get I to the bastille i communicate with the lawyer who represent the company for which i once work he be a prominent and brilliant man he plan it with some local fellow when i be arraign at the opening of court this morning the judge could hold I only as a material witness he fix a pretty stiff bail but the local lawyer be there with a bondsman and i come back my clothes be here you do not mind bobby that moment in the hall when graham have awaken he urge bobby to reply with a genuine warmth : i do not mind i be glad you be out of it i be sorry you go as you do i be tire at my wit ' end you presence in the private staircase be the last straw you will forgive we carlo parede smile he put down he coffee cup and light a cigarette he smoke with a vast contentment that be better nothing to forgive bobby let we call it a misunderstanding graham move closer perhaps you 'll tell we now what you be do in the private staircase parede blow a wreath of smoke he eye still smile but he voice be harder : bygones be bygones be not that so bobby since you wish it bobby say but more important than the knowledge graham desire loom the old question what be the man 's game what hold he here robinson enter the flesh around he eye be puffier than it have be yesterday worry have increase the incongruous discontent of he round face clearly he have sleep little i saw you arrive he say rawlin warn I but i must say i do not think you would use you freedom to come to we parede laugh since the law will not hold I at you convenience in smithtown i keep myself at you service here -- if bobby permit it could you ask more bobby shrink from the man with whom he have idle away so much time and money that fleeting satanic impression of yesterday come back sharper more alarming parede 's clear challenge to the district attorney be the measure of he strength he mind be subtler than theirs he reserve and easy daring master they all and always as now he laugh at the futility of they effort to sound he purpose to limit he freedom of action bobby do not care to meet the uncommunicative eye whose depths he have never be able to explore be there a special power there that could control the destiny of other people that might make man walk unconsciously to accomplish the end of a unscrupulous brain the district attorney appear as much at sea as the other thanks he say dryly to parede and glance at bobby he ask with a hollow scorn : you have no objection to the gentleman visit you for the present if he wish bobby answer a trifle amuse at robinson 's obvious fancy of a collusion between parede and himself robinson jerk he head toward the window i have be watch the preparation out there i guess when he be lay away you 'll be think about have the will read no hurry bobby answer with a quick intake of breath i suppose not robinson sneer since everybody know well enough what be in it bobby arise robinson still sneer you 'll be at the grave -- as chief mourner bobby walk from the room he have not care to reply he fear as it be that he have let slip he increase self-doubt he put on he coat and hat and leave the house the raw cold the year 's first omen of winter make he blood run quicker force into he mind a cleanse stimulation but almost immediately even that prophylactic be deny he with he direction a matter of indifference chance lead he into the thicket at the side of the house he have walk some distance the underbrush have long interpose a veil between he and the cedar above whose roof smoke wreathe in the still air like fantastic figure weave a shroud to lower over the time-stained melancholy wall for once he be grateful to the forest because it have forbid he to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture then he become aware of twig hastily lop off of bush bent and tear of the uncover through these careless means of a old path simultaneously there reach he ear the scrape of metal implement in the soft soil the dull thud of earth fall regularly he pause listen the labor of the man be give a uncouth rhythm by they grunt expulsion of breath otherwise the nature of they industry and its surroundings have impose upon they a silence in itself beast-like and unnatural at last a harsh voice come to bobby its brevity point the previous dumbness of the speaker : deep enough and bobby turn and hurry back along the roughly restore path as if flee from a immaterial thing suddenly quicken with the power of accusation he could picture the fresh oblong excavation in the soil of the family burial ground he could see where the man have have to tear bush from among the grave in order to insert they tool there be a ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery it have receive no interment since the death of katherine 's father like everything about the cedar sila blackburn have deliver it to the swift obliterate finger of time if the old man in he selfishness have pause to gaze beyond the inevitable fact of death bobby reflect he would have guard with a more precious interest the draping of he final sleep this necessary task on which bobby have stumble have make the thicket less congenial than the house as he walk back he forecast with a keen apprehension he approach ordeal it would doubtless be more difficult to endure than howell 's experiment over sila blackburn 's body in the old room could he witness the definite imprisonment of he grandfather in a narrow box could he watch the cover earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without display for robinson the guilt that impress he more and more a strange man appear walk from the direction of the house he black clothing relieve only by narrow edge of white cuff between the sleeve and the heavy mourning glove fit with solemn harmony into the landscape and bobby 's mood such a figure be appropriate to the cedar bobby step to one side place a screen of dead foliage between himself and the man whose profession it be to mourn he emerge from the forest and see again the leisurely weave of the smoke shroud above the house then he eye be draw by the restless movement of a pair of horse stand in the shaft of a black wagon at the court entrance and he ordeal become like a vast morass which offer no likely path yet whose cross be the price of salvation he be glad to see graham leave the court and hurry toward he i be come to hunt you up bobby the minister 's arrive so have doctor groom everything 's about ready doctor groom yes he use to see a good deal of you grandfather it be natural enough he should be here bobby agree indifferently they walk slowly back to the house graham make it plain that he mind be far from the sad business ahead what do you think of parede come back as if nothing be wrong he ask he ignore what happen yesterday he settle himself in the cedar again i do not know what to think of it bobby answer this morning carlo give I the creep graham glance at he curiously he speak with pronounced deliberation startling bobby for this friend express practically the thought that parede 's arrival have drive into he own mind give I the creep too make I surer than ever that he have a abominably deep purpose in use he wit to hang on here he suggest resource as hard to understand as anything that have happen in the old room you 'll confess bobby he be have a good deal of influence over you -- a influence for evil i have like to go around with he if that be what you mean be not he the cause of the last two or three month nonsense in new york i will not blame carlo for that bobby mutter he influence you against you better judgment graham persist to refuse to leave with I the night of you grandfather 's death marium do she share bobby say he break off look at graham what be you drive at i have be ask myself since he come back graham answer if there be any queer power behind he quiet manner maybe he _ be _ psychic maybe he can do thing we do not understand i have wonder if he have without you know it acquire sufficient influence to direct you body when you mind no longer control it it be a nasty thought but i have hear of such thing you mean carlo may have make I go to the hall last night perhaps send I to the old room those other time now that another have express the idea bobby fight it with all he might no i will not believe it i have be weak hartley but not that weak and i tell you i do feel howell 's body move under my hand do not misunderstand I graham say gently i must consider every possibility you be excite and imaginative when you go to the old room to take the evidence it be a shock to have you candle go out you own hand reach out to howell might have move spasmodically i mean you may have be responsible for the thing without realize it and the disappearance of the evidence bobby defend himself if it have be steal earlier the coat pocket might have retain its bulge shape we know now that parede be capable of sneak around the house no no bobby say hotly you be try to take away my one hope but i be there and you be not i know with my own sens what happen and you do not parede have no such influence over I i will not think of it if it be so far-fetched graham ask quietly why do you revolt from the idea bobby turn on he and why do you fill my mind with such thought if you think i be guilty say so go tell robinson so he glance away while the angry color leave he face he be a little dazed by the realization that he have speak to graham as he might have do to a enemy as he have speak to howell in the old bedroom he feel the touch of graham 's hand on he shoulder i be only work in you service graham say kindly i be sorry if i have trouble you by seek physical fact in order to escape the ghost for groom have bring the ghost back with he do not make any mistake about that you want the truth do not you yes bobby say even if it do for I but i want it quickly i can not go on this way indefinitely yet that flash of temper have give he courage to face the ordeal a linger resentment at graham 's suggestion lessen the difficulty of he position enter the court he scarcely glance at the black wagon there be more dark-clothed man in the hall rawlin have return from the rug in front of the fireplace he survey the group with a bland curiosity robinson sit near by glower at parede the panamanian have change he clothing he too be sombrely dress and instead of the vivid necktie he have wear from the courthouse a jet-black scarf be perfectly arrange beneath he collar he lounge opposite the district attorney he eye study the fire he finger on the chair arm be restless doctor groom stand at the foot of the stair talk with the clergyman a stout and unctuous figure bobby notice that the great stolid form of the doctor be ill at ease from he thickly beard face he reddish eye gleam forth with a fresh instability the clergyman shake hand with bobby we need not delay you cousin be upstairs he include the company in he circle turn of the head any one who care to go -- bobby force himself to walk up the staircase face the first phase of he ordeal he see that the district attorney realize that too for he spring from he chair and follow by rawlin start upward the entire company crowd the stair at the top bobby find parede at he side carlo why do you come i would like to be of some comfort parede answer gravely he finger on the banister make that restless grope movement graham summon katherine one of the black-clothed man open the door of sila blackburn 's room he step aside beckon he have a air of a showman craving approbation for the surprise he have arrange bobby go in with the other automatically through the dim light he catalogue remembered object all intimate to he grandfather each oddly entangled in he mind with he dislike of the old man the iron bed the chest of drawer scratch and with broken handle the closed colonial desk the miserly rag carpet -- all seem mutely ask as bobby do why they owner have desert they the other night and deliver himself to the ghostly mystery of the old bedroom reluctantly bobby 's glance go to the center of the floor where the casket rest on trestle from the chest of drawer two candle the only light play wanly over the still figure and the ashen face so for the second time the living meet the dead and the law watch hopefully robinson stand opposite but he do not look at sila blackburn who could no longer accuse he stare instead at bobby and bobby keep repeat to himself : i do not do this thing i do not do this thing and he search the face of the dead man for a confirmation a chill think not without excuse under the circumstance and in this vague light race along he nerve sila blackburn have move once since he death if the power to move and speak should miraculously return to he now in this house there appear to be no impossibility the cold control of death have be twice break katherine 's entrance swing he thought and release he for a moment from robinson 's watchfulness he find he could turn from the wrinkled face that have fascinate he that have seem to question he with a calm and complete knowledge to the lovely one that be active with a little smile of encouragement he be grateful for that it teach he that in the heavy presence of death and from the harsh trappings of mourn the magnetism of youth be unconquerable so in affection he find a antidote for fear even graham 's quick movement to she side could not make she presence less helpful to bobby he look at he grandfather again he glance at robinson as in a dream he hear the clergyman say : the service will be read at the grave almost indifferently he see the dark-clothed man sidle forward lift a grotesquely shaped plate of metal from the floor and fit it in place hiding from he eye the closed eye of the dead man he nod and step to the hall when robinson tap he arm and whisper : make way mr blackburn he watch the sombre man carry they heavy burden across the hall down the stair and into the dull autumn air he follow at the side of katherine across the clearing and into the overgrown path he be aware of the other drift behind katherine slip she hand in he it be dreadful we should not feel more sorrow more regret she say perhaps we never understand he that be dreadful too for no one understand he we be the only mourner bobby as they thread the path behind the stumbling bearer find a grim justice in that also because of he selfishness sila blackburn have live alone because of it he must go to he long rest with no other mourner than these and they eye be dry bobby cling to katherine 's hand if i could only know he whisper she press he hand she do not reply ahead the forest be scar by a yellow wound the bearer set they burden down beside it glance at each other with relief across the heap of earth bobby see the wait excavation in he ear vibrate the memory of the harsh voice : it be deep enough another voice drone it be soft and unctuous it seem to take a pleasure in the terrible word it loose to stray eternally through the decaying forest bobby glance at bent stone strangle by the underbrush at other slab crack and brown which lay prone half cover by creep vine the tone of the clergyman be no longer revolting in he ear he scarcely hear they he imagine a fantasy he picture the inhabitant of these forget narrow house stray to the great dwelling where they have live punish this one bring he to suffer with they the degradation of they neglect so robinson become less important in he mind through such fancy the ordeal be make bearable a wind spring up rattle through the tree and disturb the vine on the fall stone later he think it would snow and he shiver for those leave helpless to sleep in the sad forest the dark-clothed man strain at rope now they glance at katherine and bobby as at those most to be impress by they skill they lower sila blackburn 's grimly shaped case into the sorrel pit it pass from bobby 's sight the two roughly dress labourer come from the thicket where they have hide and with they spade approach the grave the sound from whose imminence bobby have shrink rattle in he ear the yellow earth cut across the stormy twilight of the cemetery and scatter in the trench after a time the response lose its metallic petulance katherine pull at bobby 's hand he start and glance up one of the black-clothed man be speak to he with a professional gentleness : you need not wait mr blackburn everything be finish he see now that robinson stand across the grave still stare at he the professional mourner smile sympathetically and move away katherine robinson the two grave digger and bobby alone be leave of the little company and bobby stare back at the district attorney take a sombre pride in face it out until even the man with the spade have go the ordeal he reflect have lose its poignancy he mind be intent on the empty trappings he have witness he wonder if there be after all no justice against he grandfather in this unkempt burial the place might have something to tell he if it could only make he believe that beyond the inevitable fact nothing matter if he be sure of that it would offer a way out at the worst perhaps the happiest exit for katherine 's sake then doctor groom return he huge hairy figure dominate the cemetery he infuse eye beneath the thick black brow be far-seeing they seem to penetrate bobby 's thought then they glance at the excavation appear to intimate that sila blackburn 's earthy blanket could hide nothing from the closed eye it sheltered at he age he face the near approach of that inevitable fact and he do not hesitate to look beyond bobby know what graham have mean when he have say that groom have bring the ghost back with he it be as if the cemetery have recall the old doctor to answer he presumptuous question there be no use you staying here the resonance of the deep voice jar through the wood the broad shoulder twitch one of the hairy hand make a half circle i hope you 'll clean this up my boy you ought to replace the stone and trim the grave you could not blame they could you if these old people be restless and try to go abroad for bobby in spite of himself the man on whose last shelter the earth continue to fall become once more a potent thing able to appraise the penalty of he own carelessness come katherine whisper but bobby linger oddly fascinate support the ordeal to its final moment the blow of the back of the spade on the complete mound beat into he brain the end the workman wander off through the wood from a distance the harsh voice of one of they come back : i do not want to dig again in such a place people do not seem dead there robinson try to laugh that man 's wise he say to the doctor if parede speak of this cemetery as be full of ghost i could understand he the doctor 's deep bass answer thoughtfully : parede be probably right the man have a special sense but i have feel it myself the cedar and the forest be full of thing that seem to whisper thing that one never see such thing might have a excuse for evil let 's get out of it robinson say gruffly katherine withdraw she hand bobby reach for it again but she seem not to notice she walk ahead of he along the path she shoulder a trifle bent bobby catch up with she katherine he say do not talk to I bobby he look closer he see that she be cry at last tear stain she cheek she lip be strange to he in the distortion of a grief that seek to control itself he slacken he pace and let she walk ahead he follow with a sort of awe that there should have be grief for sila blackburn after all he blame himself because he own eye be not moist back of he he hear the murmur conversation of the doctor and the district attorney strangely it make he sorry that robinson should have be more impressed than howell by the doctor 's belief they step into the clear the wind have dissipate the smoke shroud it be no longer low over the roof against the forest and the darker cloud the house have a stark appearance it be like a frame from which the flesh have fall the black wagon have go the cedar be leave alone to the solution of its mystery parede graham and rawlin wait for they in the hall there be nothing to say parede place with a delicate accuracy fresh log upon the fire he arise fleck the wood dust from he hand how cold it will be here he muse how impossible of entrance when the house be leave as empty as the wood to those who only go unseen bobby see katherine 's shoulder shake she have dry she eye but in she face be express a aversion for solitude a desire for any company even that of the man she dislike and fear robinson take rawlin to the library for another futile consultation bobby guess katherine sit on the arm of a chair thrust one foot toward the fresh blaze it will snow she say it be very early for that no one answer the strain tighten the flame leap throw evanescent pulsation of brilliancy about the dusky hall they welcome jenkin 's announcement that luncheon be ready but they scarcely disturb the hurriedly prepared dish and afterward they gather again in the hall silent and depressed appal by the long dreary afternoon which however possess the single virtue of divide they from another night for long period the district attorney and the detective be closet in the library now and then they pass upstairs and they could be hear move about but no one save graham seem to care already the officer have have every opportunity to search the house the old room no longer hold a inhabitant to set its fatal machinery in motion yet bobby realize in a dull way that at any moment the two man might come down to he say : we have find something you be guilty the heavy atmosphere of the house crush such forecast make they seem a little trivial bobby fancy it gather density to cradle new mystery the long minute loiter doctor groom make a movement to go why should i stay he grumble what be there to keep I yet he sit back in he chair again and appear to have forget he intention graham wander off bobby thought he have join rawlin and robinson in the library the only daylight enter the hall through narrow slit of window on either side of the front door bobby watch these be even with the problem night bring to he now glad when they grow paler parede who have be smoke cigarette after cigarette arise and bring he card table draw it close to he he arrange the card in neat pile the uncertain firelight make it barely possible to identify they number doctor groom gesture he disgust katherine stoop forward place she hand on the table be it kind she ask so soon after he have leave he house parede start wait he say softly puzzle she glance at he stay just as you be he direct there have be so much death in this house -- who know languidly he place he finger on the edge of the table opposite hers what be you do dr groom ask hoarsely wait parede say again then bobby scarcely aware of what be go on saw the card glide softly across the face of the table and flutter to the floor the table have lift slowly toward the panamanian it stand now on two leg what be it katherine say it be move i can feel it move beneath my finger she word recall to bobby unavoidably he experience in the old room do not do that the doctor cry parede smile if he answer the source of these crime be as you think spiritual why not ask the spirit for a solution you see how quickly the table respond it be as i think there be something in this hall have not you a feeling that the dead are in this dark hall with we they may wish to speak see the table settle softly down without any noise it commence to rise again katherine lift she hand with a visible effort as if the table have try to hold they against she will she cover she face and sit tremble i will not i -- parede shrug he shoulder appeal to the doctor the huge shaggy head shake determinedly i be not so sure i do not agree with you i be not so sure the dead be not in this hall that be why i 'll have nothing to do with such dangerous play it have show we at least that you be psychic mr parede i have a gift parede murmur it would be useful to speak with they they see so much more than we do he lift he hand he wave they dejectedly he stoop and commence pick up the card the doctor arise i shall go now he sigh i do not know why i have stay bobby get he coat and hat i 'll walk to the stable with you he be glad to escape from the dismal hall in which the firelight grow more eccentric the court be colder and damper and even beyond the chill be more penetrate than it have be at the grave that noon uneven flake of snow sift from the swollen sky herald of a white invasion no more sleep-walk the doctor ask when he have take the blanket from he horse and climb into the buggy bobby lean against the wall of the stable and tell how graham have bring he back the previous night from the stairhead to which he have go with a purpose he do not dare sound the doctor shake he head you should not tell I that you should not tell any one you place yourself too much in my hand as you be already in graham 's hand maybe that be all right but the district attorney you be sure he know nothing of this habit which seem to have commence the night of the first murder no and i think parede alone of those who know about that first night would be likely to tell he see that he do not the doctor say shortly i have be watch robinson if he do not make a arrest pretty soon with something back of it he 'll lose he mind he might not stop to ask as i do as howell do about the lock door and the nature of the wound how shall i find the courage to sleep to-night bobby ask the doctor think for a moment suppose i come back he say i have only one or two unimportant case to look after i ought to return before dinner i 'll take graham 's place for to-night it be time you reaction be better diagnose i 'll share you room and you can go to sleep assure that you 'll come to no harm that harm will come to no one through you i 'll bring some book on the subject i 'll read they while you sleep perhaps i can learn the impulse that make you body active while you mind 's a blank the idea of the influence of parede which graham have put into word slip back to bobby he be nevertheless strengthen by the doctor 's promise to a extent the dread of the night fall from he like a smother garment this old man who have always fill he with discomfort have become a capable support in he difficult hour he see he drive away he study he watch compute the time that must elapse before he could return he want he at the cedar even though the doctor believe more thoroughly than any one else in the spiritual survival of old passion and the power of the dead to project a physical evil he do not care to go back to the hall it would do he good to walk to force as far as he could from he mind the memory of the ordeal at the grave the grim impending atmosphere of the house and suppose he should accomplish something useful suppose he should succeed where graham have fail so he walk toward the stagnant lake the flake of snow fall thicker already they have gather in white patch on the floor of the forest if this weather continue the wood would cease to be habitable for that dark feminine figure through which they have account for the mournful cry after howell 's death which graham have try to identify with the dancer marium as he pass the neighborhood of the cemetery he walk faster many yard of underbrush separated he from the little time-devastated city of the dead but its mere proximity force on he as the old room have do a feeling of a stealthy and intangible companionship he step from the fringe of tree about the open space in the center of which the lake brood the water receive with a destructive indifference the flutter caress of the snowflake bobby pause with a quick expectancy he see nothing of the woman who have startle he that first evening but he hear from the thicket a sound like muffle sob and he respond again to the sense of a malevolent regard he hide himself among the tree and in they shelter skirt the lake the sobbing have fade into nothing for a long time he hear only the whisper of the snow and the grief of the wind when he have round the lake and be some distance beyond it however the moan reach he again and through the fast-deepening twilight he see as indistinctly as he have before a black feminine figure flitting among the tree in the direction of the lake graham 's theory lose its value it be impossible to fancy the brilliant colorful dancer in this black shadowy thing he commence to run in pursuit call out : stop who be you why do you cry through the wood but the dusk be too thick the forest too eager the black figure disappear in retrospect it be again as unsubstantial as a phantom the flake whisper mockingly the wind be ironical he find he pursuit have lead he back to the end of the lake nearest the cedar he pause he triumph be not unmixed with fear a black figure stand in the open quite close to he gaze over the stagnant water that be like a veil for sinister thing he know now that the woman be flesh and blood for she do not glide away and the snow make pallid scar on she black cloak he creep carefully forward until he be close behind the black figure now he say you 'll tell I who you be and why you cry about the cedar the woman swing around with a cry he step back abashed not know what to say for there be still enough light to disclose to he the troubled face of katherine and there be tear in she eye as if she might recently have express a audible grief you frighten I bobby without calculation he speak he swift thought : be it you i saw here before but surely you do not cry in the house the other night and afterward when we follow carlo the tranquil beauty of she face be disturb when she answer she voice have lose something of its music : what do you mean it be you who cry just now it be you i see run through the wood what do you mean she ask again i have not run i -- i be not you woman in black if that be what you think i happen to pick up this cloak you have see it often enough before and i have not cry she brush the tear angrily from she eye at least i have not cry so any one could hear I i want to walk i hope i would find you i think you have come this way so i come too why bobby you be suspect I of something but the problem of the fugitive figure recede before the more intimate one of he heart there be a thrill in she desire to find he in the solitude of the forest only the faintest gray survive in the sky above the tree the shadow be thick about they the whisper snow urge he to use this moment for he happiness it be not the thought of graham that hold he back last night under a equal temptation he might have speak to-night a new element silence he and bind he eager hand he awakening at the head of the stair raise a obstacle to self-revelation around which there seem to exist no path i be sorry let we go back he say she look at he inquiringly what be it bobby you be more afraid to-day than you have ever be before have something happen i know nothing of he shake he head he could not increase she own trouble by tell she of that the wood seem to receive a ashy illumination from the passage of the snowflake katherine walk a little faster do not be discourage bobby she beg he everything will come out straight you must keep tell yourself that you must fight until you believe it the nearness of she dusk-clothed slender figure fill he with a new courage obscure to a extent he real situation he burst out impulsively : do not worry i 'll fight i 'll make myself believe if necessary i 'll tell everything i know in order to find the guilty person she place she hand on he arm she voice fall to a whisper do not fight that way uncle sila be dead howell have be take away the police will find nothing by and by they will leave it will all be forget why should you keep it active and dangerous by try to find who be guilty katherine he cry surprised why do you say that she hand leave he arm she walk on without answer parede come back to he -- parede serenely call attention to the fact that katherine have alarm the household and have lead it to the discovery of the cedar 's successive mystery he shrink from ask she any more they leave the thicket in the open space about the house the snow have spread a white mantle from it the heavy wall rise black and forbid i do not want to go in katherine say they foot lag as they follow the driveway to the entrance of the court the curtain of the room of death they see have be raise a dim unhealthy light slip from the small-paned window across the court stain the snow robinson and rawlin be probably search again suddenly katherine stop she point what be that she ask sharply bobby follow the direction of she glance he see a black patch against the wall of the wing opposite the light window it be a shadow he say she relax and they walk on they enter the court there she turn and bobby stop too with a sudden fear for the thing he have call a shadow be move he stare at it with a hypnotic belief that the cedar be at last disclose its supernatural secret he know it could be no illusion since katherine sway half-fainting against he the move shadow assume the shape of a stout figure slightly bent at the shoulder a pipe protrude from the bearded mouth one hand wave a careless welcome bobby 's first instinct be to cry out to command this old man they have see bury that day to return to he grave for there be not the slightest doubt the unhealthy candlelight from the room of death shone full on the gray and wrinkled face of sila blackburn chapter viii what happen at the grave hello katy hello bobby you show you face at last i hope you have come sober the thin quarrelsome voice of sila blackburn echo in the mouldy court the stout bent figure in the candlelight study they suspiciously katherine clung to bobby tremble startle beyond speech by the apparition they both stare at the gray face at the thick figure which three day after death they have see bury that noon in the overgrown cemetery bobby recall how doctor groom have remind he that a activity like this might emerge from such place he have suggest that the condition of the family burial ground might be a inspiration to such straying yet why should the spirit of sila blackburn have escape why should it have return forthwith to the cedar unless to face he grandson as he murderer afterward bobby experience no shame for these reflection the encounter be a fitting sequel to the moment in the dark room when he have feel howell move beneath he hand he have a fleeting faith that the void between the living and the dead have indeed be bridge then he wonder that the familiar figure fail to disintegrate and he notice smoke curl from the blacken briar pipe he catch its pungent aroma in the damp air of the court moreover sila blackburn have speak challenge he as usual with a sneer let we go past katherine whisper but sila blackburn step out block they way he speak again he whine accent hold a reproach what be the matter with you two you might ` a ' see a ghost or maybe you be sorry to have I back do not you wonder where i be katy reckon you hope i be dead bobby bobby answer he have a fancy of address emptiness why have you come that be what you be to we -- dead sila blackburn chuckle he take the pipe from he mouth and tap the tobacco down with a knotted forefinger i 'll show you how dead i be try to be funny be not you i 'll make you laugh on the wrong side of you face it be cold here i be go in the same voice the same manner yet he presence deny that great fact which during three day have be impress upon they with a grow fear the old man jerk he thumb toward the dimly light window of the wing what you get the old room light up for what be go on there i try to sleep there the other night -- uncle katherine spring forward she stretch out she hand to he with a reluctance as pronounced as graham 's when he have touch howell 's body she finger brush he hand she shoulder droop she cling to he arm to bobby this resolution be more of a shock less to be explain than he first assurance of a immaterial visitor what do it mean to he be it a impossible assurance of safety the old man pat katherine 's shoulder why what you cry for katy always seem something to scare you lately he jerk he thumb again toward the light window you be not tell I yet what be go on in the old room bobby 's laugh be daze question they be try to account for you murder there he grandfather look at he with blank amazement you out of you head no katherine cry we see you lie there cold and still i -- i find you you have not forget katherine bobby say breathlessly that he move afterward silas blackburn take he hand from katherine 's shoulder try to scare I what be the matter with you some scheme to get my money you sleep in the old room the other night bobby ask helplessly no i do not sleep there he grandfather whine i go in and lay down but i do not sleep i defy anybody to sleep in that room what you talk about it be cold here this court be always damp i want to go in be there a fire in the hall we 'll light one while you tell I what be ailin ' you he turn and grasp the door knob they follow he into the hall shake the snow from they coat parede sit alone by the fire languidly engage in the solitaire which exert so potent a fascination for he he do not turn at they entrance it be not until bobby call out that he move carlo bobby 's tone must have suggest the abnormal for parede spring to he foot knock over the table the card fall lightly to the floor stray as far as the hearth he hand catch at the back of he chair he remain in a awkward position rigid white-faced stare at the newcomer i tell you all he whisper that the court be full of ghost sila blackburn walk to the fire and stand with he back to the smoulder log in this light he have the pallor of death -- the lack of color bobby remember beneath the glass of the coffin the old man always so intolerant and authoritative be no longer sure of himself why do you talk about ghost he whine i -- i wish i have not wake up parede sink back in he chair wake up he echo in a awe-struck voice bobby take a trivial interest as one will turn to small thing during the most vital moment in the reflection that twice within twenty-four hour the panamanian have be startle from he cold reserve wake up parede repeat he voice rise at what time do you remember the time not exactly sometime after noon bobby guess the object of parede 's question he know it have be about noon when they have see the coffin cover in the restless wind-swept cemetery parede hurry on how long have you be asleep what make you ask that the other whine i do not know it be a long time blackburn 's voice rise complainingly how do you guess that i never sleep so i doze nearly three day but i be tired now -- tired as if i have not sleep at all parede make a gesture of surrender bobby struggle against the purpose of the man 's question against the suggestion of he grandfather 's unexpected answer you idea be madness carlo he whisper this house be fill with it parede say i wish groom be here groom ought to be here he be come back bobby tell he he should not be long now he say before dinner time parede stir i wish he would hurry the panamanian say nothing more as if he realize the futility of press the matter before doctor groom should return necessary question surge in bobby 's brain the two that parede have put however disturb he logic katherine who have not speak since enter keep she eye fix on she uncle she lip be slightly part she have the appearance of one afraid to break a silence cover impossible doubt bobby call on he reason he grandfather stand before he in flesh with the old man in spite of parede 's ghastly hint probably lay the solution of the entire mystery and he own safety he be about to speak when he hear footstep in the upper hall he grandfather glance inquiringly through the stair-well asking : who be that up there the sharp tone confess that fear of the cedar be active in the warped brain the district attorney bobby answer a detective probably hartley graham what they do here he indicate parede what be this fellow do here i never like he katherine answer : they have all come because i think i see you dead lie in the old room we all see bobby cry angrily and parede nodded blackburn shrink away from they the three man descend the stair half way down they stop who be that robinson cry graham 's face whiten he brace himself against the banister next time mr district attorney parede say you 'll believe I when i say the court be full of ghost he walk in from the court i tell you they find he in the court sila blackburn 's voice rise shrill and angry : what be the matter with you all why do you talk of ghost and my be dead have not i a right to come in my own house you all act as if you be afraid of I parede 's question have clearly add to the uncertainty of he manner katherine speak softly : we be afraid the other come down robinson walk close to sila blackburn and for some time gaze at the gray face yes he say you be sila blackburn you come to my office in smithtown the other day and ask for a detective because you be afraid of something out here there be no question graham cry of course it be mr blackburn yet it could not be what you all talk about why be the police in my house why do you act like fool and say i be dead they gather in a group at some distance from he they unconsciously ignore this central figure as if he be in fact a ghost bobby and katherine tell how they have find the old man a black shadow against the wall of the wing parede repeat the question he have ask and they strange answer afterward robinson turn to sila blackburn who wait tremble then you do go to the old room to sleep you lay down on the bed but you say you do not stay you must tell we why not and how you get out and where you have be during this prolonged sleep i want everything that happen from the moment you enter the old bedroom until you waken that be simple sila blackburn mouth i go there along about ten o'clock be not it katy nearly half past she say and you frighten I he must tell we why he go why he be afraid to sleep in he own room graham begin robinson hold up he hand one question at a time mr graham the important thing now be to learn what happen in the room you be not forget howell be you sila blackburn glance at the floor he move he foot restlessly he fumble in he pocket for some loose tobacco with shake finger he refill he pipe except for bobby and katherine he quaver you do not know what that room mean to blackburn and they only know by hearsay because i have see it be keep close do not see how i be go to tell you -- you need not hesitate robinson encourage he we have all experienced something of the peculiarity of the cedar you return alone be enough to keep we from laughter all right the old man stumble on i be raise on story of that room -- even before my father shoot himself there later on i see katherine 's father die in the big bed and after that i never care to go near the place unless i have to the other night when i make up my mind to sleep there i try to tell myself all this talk be tommyrot i try to make myself believe i could sleep as comfortably in that bed as anywhere so i go in and lock the door and raise the window and lay down you be sure you lock the door robinson ask yes i remember turn the key in both door because i do not want anything bother I from outside they all look at each other unable to forecast anything of blackburn 's experience for both door have be lock when the body have be find grant life how would it have be possible for sila blackburn to have leave the room to commence he period of drowsiness a explanation of that should also unveil the criminal 's route in and out the tensity of the little group increase but no one interpose the obvious question robinson be right it would be quicker to let the protagonist of this unbelievable adventure recite its detail in he own fashion parede run he slender finger gropingly over the face of several of the card he have pick up when i get in bed sila blackburn continue i think i would let the candle burn for company 's sake but there be a wind and it come in the open window and it make the queerest black shadow dance all over the wall until i could not stand it a minute longer i blow the candle out and lay back in the dark he draw harshly on he cold pipe he look at it with a air of surprise and slip it in he pocket it be the funniest darkness i do not like it you put you hand out and close you finger as if you could feel it but it be not all black either some moonlight come in with the wind between the curtain it be not exactly yellow and it be not white after a little it seem alive and i would not look at it any more the only way i could stop myself be to shut my eye and that be worse for it make I recollect my father the way i see he lie there when i be a boy god grant none of you will ever have to see anything like that then i seem to see katy 's father too and i remember he scream the room get thick with thing like that -- with those two and with a lot of other come out of the picture and the story i have hear about my family he experience when he have go to the room to take the evidence from howell 's body become active in bobby 's memory there i lay with my eye shut sila blackburn go on in he strange inquire voice and yet i seem to see those dead people all around I and i think they be in pain again and be mad at I because i do not do anything i guess maybe i must ` a ' be doze a little for i think -- he break off he raise he hand slowly and point in the direction of the overgrown cemetery where they have see he coffin cover that noon he voice be lower and harsher when he continue : i -- i think i hear they say that thing be all break out there and -- and awful -- so awful they could not stay he voice become defiant i be not go to tell you what i dream it be too horrible but i make up my mind i would do what i could if i ever escape from that room i -- i be afraid they would take I back with they underneath those broken stone and you -- you stand there try to tell I that they do he pause again look around with a more defiant glare in he bloodshot eye he appear to be surprise not to find they laugh at he what be the matter with you all he cry why be not you make I out a fool you see something in that room too go on robinson urge what happen then what do you do blackburn 's voice resume its throaty monotone as he speak he glance about slyly suspect perhaps the watchfulness of the fancy that have intimidate he i realize i have to get out if they would let I so i leave the bed i go he cease intimate that he have tell everything i know robinson say but tell we how you get out of the room for when you -- when the murder be discover both door be lock on the inside and you know how impossible the window be i tell you katherine say hysterically it _ be _ he body in the bed bobby know she assurance be justified but he motion she to silence let he answer robinson say sila blackburn run he knotted finger through he hair he shake he head doubtfully that be what i do not understand myself that be what be be worry I while these young one have be talk as if i be dead and bury i recollect tell myself i must go i seem to remember leave the bed all right but i do not seem to remember walk on the floor or go through the door you be sure the door be lock no doubt about that rawlin say seem to I blackburn go on that i be in the private staircase but do i walk downstairs first thing i see clearly be the road through the wood not far from the station what do you wear robinson ask i would have my trousers and jacket on under my dressing-gown the old man answer because i know the bed be not make up that be what i wear except for the dressing-gown i reckon i must have leave that in the room i would not have go back there for anything my mind be full of those angry people i want to get as far away from the cedar as possible i know the last train from new york would be along about three o'clock so i think i would go on into smithtown and in the morning see this detective i would be talk to i go to robert water 's house i have know he for a long time i guess you know who he be he be such a book worm i figure he might be up and he would not ask a lot of silly question be selfish like most people that live all the time with book he come to the door and i tell he i want to spend the night he offer to shake hand that be funny too i do not feel like shake hand with anybody i recollect that because i would feel sort of queer ever since go in the old room and something tell I i would better not shake hand parede look up wide-eyed the card slip from he fragile pointed finger do you realize mr district attorney what this man be say but robinson motion he to silence let he go on what happen then that be all blackburn answer except this long sleep i can not make out old water do not get mad at my not shake hand he be too tie up in some book i guess i tell he i be sleepy and do not want to be bother and he nod to the spare room off the main hall and i tumble into bed and be off almost before i know it parede spring to he foot and commence to walk about the hall tell we he say when you first wake up i guess it be late the next afternoon sila blackburn quaver fumble with he pipe again but it be only for a minute parede stop in front of robinson when he turn you see it be water knock on the door blackburn go on i guess he want to know what be the matter and he talk about some food but i do not want to be bother so i call to he through the door to go away and turn over and go to sleep again he turn over and go to sleep again katherine say breathlessly and it be about that time that i hear the turn in the old bedroom katherine graham call what be you talk about what be you think about what else be there she ask she be think about the truth parede say tensely i have always hear of such thing so have you you have read of they if you read at all indium be full of it it go back to ancient egypt -- the same person simultaneously in two place -- the astral body -- whatever you choose to call it it be the projection of one 's self whether consciously or unconsciously perhaps the projection of something that retain reason after a apparent death you hear he he do not seem to walk he do not remember leave the room which be lock on the inside he descent of the stair be without motion as we know it he have go some distance before he mind consciously direct the movement of this active image of sila blackburn while the double from which it have spring lay apparently dead in the old room you notice he shrink from shake hand and he sleep until we hide away the shell what disintegration and come together again have take place since we bury that shell in the old graveyard if he friend have shake hand with he would he have grasp emptiness do he normal self come back to he when the shell be put from we sight and he awaken these be some of the question we must answer you have a fine imagination mr parede robinson say dryly he fat face nevertheless be bewildered and in the eye surround by puffy flesh smoulder a profound uncertainty i wish groom be here parede be say he would agree with I he would know more about it than i robinson throw back he shoulder he turn to rawlin with he old authority the unimaginative detective have stand throughout release no indication of he emotion but as he raise he hand now to a unnecessary adjustment of he scarf pin the finger be not quite steady telephone this man water robinson direct then get in communication with the office and put they on that end rawlin walk away robinson apologize to sila blackburn with a uneasy voice get to check up what i can can not get anywhere with these thing unless you make sure of you first fact i daresay water 's story will tally with yours blackburn nod graham clear he throat now perhaps we may ask that very important question the day mr blackburn call at you office in smithtown he tell howell he be afraid of be murder accord to howell he say : ` my heart 's all right it will not stop yet awhile unless it be make to so if i be find cold some fine morning you can be sure i be put out of the way ' i know robinson say and that night graham continue when he go to the old room he be terrify of something which he would not define for miss perrine he warn I not to mention he would go there katherine put in he tell I he be afraid -- afraid to sleep in he own room any longer robinson turn what about that mr blackburn for a moment bobby 's curiosity overcome the confusion arouse by he grandfather 's apparently occult return all along they have crave the knowledge he be about to give they the statement on which bobby 's life have seem to depend blackburn however be unwilling the question seem to have return to he something of he normal manner no use he mumble go into that a good deal of use robinson insist blackburn shift he foot he gaze at he pipe doubtfully i do not see why that do not come and seem it be not what i ought to have be afraid of after all all along i ought to have be afraid only of the cedar and the old room i have be accuse of be unjust i do not want to do a injustice now please answer robinson say impatiently you must answer graham urge i do not see that it make the slightest difference parede drawl what have it get to do with the case as it stand to-night robinson snap at he you keep out of it do not forget there be a lot you have not answer yet silas blackburn look straight at bobby slowly he raise he hand point a accuse finger at he grandson if you want to know i be afraid of that young rascal katherine start impulsively forward in a effort to stop he blackburn wave she away you try to scare I katy he ask suspiciously evidently robinson comment to graham howell be not as dull as we think he go on mr blackburn why be you afraid of you grandson maybe he can tell you better than i can the old man answer do not see any use rake up such thing anyway maybe i would be pretty harsh with he anyway i know he hate the ground i walk on and would be glad enough to see I drop in my track that be not so bobby say you keep quiet now you always talk too much so the old feeling survive go on robinson urge i would always be a hard worker blackburn whine and he be a waster naturally we do not get along i would decide to make a new will leave my money to the bedford foundation and i write he that think it would bring he hot foot to make it up with I i would be nervous about he before because i do not know what might come into he head when he be on these wild party so i would speak to howell think i would trip he if he try any funny business when he do not come that night i get scare he know i would not make the new will until morning and since i could not see any man throw all that money away i figure he would guess he could not turn I and would not waste any time talk when you get a lot of money and a grandson who hate you you have to think of such thing suppose i think he should come out here drunk when i be sound asleep i know he have a latch key and he might sneak up to my room before i could even get to the telephone or i be afraid he might hire somebody you can buy man for that sort of work in new york i tell you the more i thought of it the more i be sure he would do something you would understand if you live in this lonely place with all that money and nobody you want to will it to i nearly send for howell right then but if nothing have happen i would have look a fool i want you to send for a man katherine cry bobby lean against the wall repeat to himself the word of marium 's note which accuse he of have make the very threat he grandfather have fear so blackburn ramble on i decide i would not sleep in my room that night and i pick out the least likely place for anybody to find I i be more afraid of he than i be of the old room but as i have tell you the old room make I forget master robert robinson step to bobby 's side all along howell be right tell I what you do with that evidence bobby turn away katherine try to laugh graham beckon to robinson what be the use of bother with evidence against a suspect murderer when the murder man stand talk to you robinson frown helplessly parede spring to he foot you be take too much for grant graham there be a murder blackburn be kill we have as many witness to that fact as we have that he be come back this man who talk with we accuse bobby may not stay have you think of that i have notice something that make I think it possible i have be afraid to speak of it but it make I hesitate to say that this man be alive as we understand life we have to learn the nature of the force we be deal with exactly how dangerous they be they start at a sharp rap on the front door now who the old man whine i wish you would not look at I so it make I feel queer you be all crazy it be probably doctor groom bobby say and step to the door open it it be groom the huge man walk in struggle out of he coat at first the other screen sila blackburn from he but he acknowledge they strained attitude the excitement that still animated parede 's face what be the matter with you

off he recent numbness he realize the disturbing parallel in the action of he grandfather and himself he have come to the cedar unconsciously perhaps direct by a evil external influence on the night of the first murder now it appear the man he be accuse of killing have also wander under a unknown impulse that night be the same subtle control responsible in both case be there at the cedar a force that defy physical law move its inhabitant like puppet for special aim of its own yet he recall there be something here friendly to he after the movement of howell 's body and the disappearance of the evidence the return of sila blackburn strip robinson 's threat of power and seem to place the solution beyond the district attorney 's trivial reach the silence and the delay increase they weight upon the little group sila blackburn huddle in he chair be grayer more haggard than he have be at first he appear attentive to a expect summons he seem fight the idea of go back the proximity of graham to katherine quiet the turmoil of bobby 's thought if he could only have foresee this return he would have listen to the whisper encouragement of the forest robinson reappear anxiety have replace the anger in the round face which one feel should always have be no more than good-natured jenkin will have to help he say sila blackburn arise unsteadily i be come with you you be not go to leave I here i will not stay here alone he should come by all means parede say in case anything should happen -- the old man put he hand to he ear you keep quiet i be not go back i tell you bobby do not want to

reach the hall he see that the man 's terror have not diminish they go through the court and around the house to the stable where they find spade and shovel they grim purpose hold they silent they cross the clearing and enter the pathway that have be freshly blaze that day for the passage of the man in black the snow be quite deep it still drift down it fill the wood with a wan unnatural radiance without really illuminate the sooty mass of the tree it make the night white sila blackburn stumble in the van with parede and robinson the doctor and rawlin follow graham be with katherine behind they bobby walk last fight a instinct to linger to avoid whatever they might find beneath the white blanket of the little intimate burial ground groom turn and speak to graham katherine wait for bobby and the white night close swiftly about they whisper until the shuffling of the other become inaudible be she glad of this solitude have she seek it she extraordinary request in that earlier solitude come to he and he speak of it while he try to control he emotion while he seek to mould the next few minute reasonably and justly why do you tell I to make no attempt to find the guilty person because she answer you be too sure it be yourself why bobby do you think i be the -- the woman in black that have hurt I i do not mean to hurt you he say but there be something i must tell you now that may hurt you a little and he explain how graham have awaken he at the head of the stair you be right he say i be sure then it be myself in spite of howell 's movement it follow so neatly on the handkerchief and the footmark but now he have come back and it change everything so i can tell you he could not be sure whether it be the cold white loneliness through which they pace or what he have just say that make she tremble perhaps i should not have tell you that i be glad she answer you must never close you confidence to I again why have you do it these last few month i want to know calculation die then you shall know through the white night he hand reach for she find she draw she close the moment be too masterful for he to mould he become instead plastic in its white and stealthy grasp i could not stay he say and see you give yourself to hartley she raise she hand to he shoulder he barely catch she whisper because of the sly communicativeness of the snow i be glad but why do not you say so then the intoxication fade the enterprise ahead give to they joy a fugitive quality moreover with she very surrender come to he a great misgiving but you and hartley i have watch it be be force on I then you have misunderstand she answer you put I too completely out of you life after we quarrel that be about hartley you be too jealous but it be my fault hartley he ask speak to you about that time yes and i tell he he be a very dear friend and he be kind enough to accept that and not to go away he measure of the widening of the rift between they make she more precious because of its affectionate human quality she have be kinder to graham more mysterious about he to draw bobby back yet ever since he arrival at the cedar graham have assume toward katherine a attitude scarcely to be limit by friendship he have do what he have in bobby 's service clearly enough for she sake for a long time past indeed in speaking of she graham always seem to discuss the woman he expect to marry you be quite sure he ask puzzle that hartley understand why do you ask he have show how good a friend he be he have always make I think bobby say that he have you love you be sure he guess that you care for I in that place at that moment there be a tragic color to she coquetry i think every one must have guess it except you bobby he raise she head and touch she lip she lip be as cold as the caress of the drift snowflake we must go on she sigh in he memory the chill of she kiss be bitter in the forest they could speak no more of love but bobby hand in hand with she as they hurry after the other receive a new strength he see as a condition to they happiness the unveiling of the mystery at the cedar he gather he courage for that task he would not give way even before the memory of all that he have experience even before the return of he grandfather even before the revelation toward which they walk and side by side with he determination grow shame for he former weakness it be comforting to realize that the cause for he weakness and he strength be identical the subdue murmur of voice reach they they see among the indistinct mass of the tree restless patch of black katherine stumble against one of the fall stone they stand with the other in the burial ground close to the mound that have be make that day they have not begin bobby whisper she free she hand a white flame spring across the mound the tree from formless mass take on individual shape a row of cypress on which the light gleam be like sombre sentinel guard the dead the snow patch cluster on they branch be like funeral decoration point they morbid function the light give the overturn stone a illusion of strive to struggle from they white imprisonment robinson swing he lamp back to the mound the snow be not heavy he say and the ground be not freeze it ought not to take long sila blackburn commence to shake it be a desecration of the dead we have to know robinson say who be bury in that grave with a spade jenkin scrape the snow from the mound rawlin join he they commence to throw to one side stain the white carpet spadesful of moist yellow earth they labor be rapid sila blackburn watch with a unconquerable fascination he continue to shake i be too cold i 'll never be warm again he whine if anything happen to I bobby try to forget i have be hard and do not let they bury I suppose i should be bury alive suppose parede say you be bury alive to-day he turn to bobby and katherine that also be possible you remember the old theory that have never be disprove of the disintegration of matter into its atom of its passage through solid substance of its reform in a far place i would not have to ask a east indian that jenkin stand in the excavation break into torrential speech mr robinson i can not work with the light it make the stone seem to move it throw too many shadow i seem to see people behind you and i be afraid to look nothing aggressive survive in rawlin 's voice we can work well enough without it sir robinson snap off the light the darkness descend eagerly upon they above the noise of the spade in the soft earth bobby hear indefinite stirring in the graveyard at such a hour the supernatural legend of the cedar assume a inescapable probability bobby wish for some way to stop the task on which they be engage he feel instinctively it would be better not to tamper with the mystery of sila blackburn 's return bobby grow rigid there it be again graham breathe a low keen come from the thicket it increase in power a trifle then drift into silence it be not the wind it be like the moan bobby have hear at the stagnant lake that afternoon like the cry graham and he have suffer in the old room seem at first to come from a distance it achieve a sense of intimacy it be like a escape of sorrow from the dismantle tomb bobby turn to katherine he could not see she for the darkness he reach out she be not there katherine he call softly she hand steal into he he have be afraid that the forest have take she under the reassurance of she handclasp he try to make himself believe there be actually a woman near by if not maria some one who have a definite purpose there robinson flash on he light old blackburn whimper : the cedar be at its trick again and there be nothing we can do it be like a lose soul katherine sigh it seem to cry from this place it must be trace bobby say then tell I its direction certainly robinson challenge we would flounder in the thicket a waste of time let we get through here hurry rawlin the light show bobby that the detective and jenkin have nearly finish he shrink from the first hard sound of metal against metal it come after a moment the light shone on the dull face of the casket which be streak with dirt jenkin rest on he spade he groan it occur to bobby that the man could not have work hard enough in this cold air to have start the perspiration that stream down he wrinkled face it would be a tough job to lift it out rawlin say no need robinson answer get the soil away from the edge he bent over pass a screw driver to the detective take off the top plate that will let we see all we want jenkin climb out i sha not look i do not dare look sila blackburn touch bobby 's arm timidly i have be a hard man bobby -- he break off he bearded lip twitch the grate of the screw tear through the silence rawlin glance up lend a hand somebody groom speak hoarsely : it be not too late to let the dead rest robinson gesture he away graham parede and he kneel in the snow and help the detective raise the heavy lid they place it at the side of the grave they all force themselves to glance downward katherine scream sila blackburn lean on bobby 's arm shake with gross impossible sob parede shrug he shoulder the light waver in robinson 's hand they continue to stare there be nothing else to do the coffin be empty chapter ix bobby 's vigil in the abandon room for a long time the little group gather in the snow-swept cemetery remain silent the lamp shake in the district attorney 's hand illuminate each detail of the casket 's interior lining bobby try to realize that except for these meaningless embellishment the box be empty that be what hold they all -- the void the unoccupied silken couch in which they have see sila blackburn 's body imprison yet the screw which the detective have remove and the mass of earth pack down and cover with snow must have make escape a dreadful impossibility even if the spark of life have reanimate its occupant and that occupant stand there tremble and haggard sobbing from time to time in a utter abandonment to the terror of what he see to bobby in that moment the supernatural legend of the cedar seem more triumphantly fulfil than it would have be through the immaterial return of he grandfather for sila blackburn be a reincarnation more difficult to accept than any ghost have parede who all along have offer they a spectacle of veil activity and think grasp the truth at first glance indeed he gossip of oriental theory concern the disintegration of matter its passage through solid substance its reassembly in far place seem thoroughly justified yet grant that who in the semblance of sila blackburn have they bury to vanish completely who in the semblance of sila blackburn have drowse without food for three day in the house at smithtown the old man stretch he shake hand to bobby and katherine do not let they bury I again they never bury I i have not be dead i tell you i have not be dead he mouth horribly i be alive can not you see i be alive he break down and cover he face jenkin sink on the heap of earth i saw you mr sila in that box and i see you on the bed miss katherine and i find you we have to break the door you look so peaceful we think you be asleep but when we touch you you be cold no no no blackburn grimace i be not cold i could not have be there be no question bobby say hoarsely no question robinson repeat katherine shrink from she uncle as he have shrink from she in the library the night of the murder what do you make of it the district attorney ask rawlin the detective who have remain crouch at the side of the grave arise brushing the dirt from he hand shake he head what be one to make of it sir parede speak softly to graham the cedar want to be leave alone to the dead we would all be better away from it you will not go yet awhile robinson say gruffly do not forget you be still under bond the detail no longer seem of importance to bobby the mystery centreing in the empty grave be apparently inexplicable he experience a great pity for he grandfather and recall that strengthen moment with katherine he make up he mind that there be only one course for he it might be dangerous in itself yet on the other hand he could not go to katherine while he share in the mystery of the cedar remain so darkly shadow he have no right to withhold anything and he would not ask graham 's advice he have step all at once into the mastery of he own destiny he would tell robinson therefore everything he know from the party with marium and parede in new york through he unconscious wanderings around the house on the night of the first murder to the moment when graham have stop he somnambulistic excursion down the stair robinson turn he light away from the grave there be nothing more to do here let we go back the little party straggle through the snow to the house the hall fire smoulder as pleasantly as it have do before they have set forth yet a interminable period seem to have elapse sila blackburn go close to the fire he sink in a chair tremble i be so cold he whine i have never be so cold what be the matter with I for god 's sake tell I what be the matter katherine -- if -- if nothing happen we 'll close the cedar we 'll go to the city where there be lot of light if you would only listen to bobby and I and go long ago she say robinson stare at the fire i be about beat he mutter wearily rawlin with a air of stealth walk upstairs graham after a moment 's hesitation follow he bobby wonder why they go he catch robinson 's eye he indicate he would like to speak to he in the library as he leave the hall he see parede who have not remove he hat or coat start for the front door where be you go he hear robinson demand parede 's reply come glibly only to walk up and down in the court the house oppress I more than ever to-night i feel with mr blackburn that it be no place to stay and while he talk with robinson in the library bobby catch at time the crunching of parede 's foot in the court why do that court draw he robinson ask why do he keep repeat that it be full of ghost he can not be try to scare we with that now but bobby do not answer i have come to tell you the truth he burst out everything i know you may lock I up even that would be better than this uncertainty i must have a answer if it condemn I and how could i have have anything to do with what have happen to-night he withhold nothing robinson listen with a intent interest at the end he say not unkindly : if the evidence and howell 's report have not disappear i would have arrest you and consider the case close before this miracle be throw at I you have involve yourself so frankly that i do not believe you be lie about what go on in the old room when you enter to steal those exhibit can not say i blame you for try that either you be in a pretty bad position -- a unheard-of position you still be for that matter but the case be put on such a extraordinary basis by what have happen to-night that i would be a fool to lock you up on such a confession i believe there be a good deal more in what have go on in that room and in the return of you grandfather than you can account for thanks bobby say i hope you would take it this way for if you will let I help i have a plan he turn restlessly to the door of the private staircase in he memory howell 's bold figure be outline there but now the face with its slow smile seem sympathetic rather than challenge what be you plan robinson ask bobby force himself to speak deliberately steadily : to go for the night alone to the old room as howell do robinson whistle do not believe you have that much nerve two man have try that what good would it do if the answer 's anywhere bobby say it must be hide in that room howell feel it i be sure of it when i be prevent from take the evidence you have believe it i think there be something strange and unhealthy about the room robinson agree certainly the secret of the lock door lie there but we have have sufficient warn i be not ashamed to say i would not take such a chance i do not know that i ought to let you bobby smile i have be enough of a coward he say and robinson i have get to know i sha not go near the bed i 'll watch the bed from a corner if the danger 's at the bed as we suspect it probably will not be able to reach I but just the same it may expose itself and rawlin or you can be outside the broken door in the corridor wait to enter at the first alarm howell have no chance to give a alarm robinson mutter we 'll see later but bobby understand that he would agree and he force he new courage to face the prospect maybe something will turn up robinson muse the case can not grow more mysterious indefinitely but he tone hold no assurance he seem to foresee new and difficult complication when they return to the hall bobby shrink from the picture of he grandfather still crouch by the fire he shoulder twitch he finger about the black briar pipe shake groom alone have remain with he bobby open the front door there be no one in the court parede he say close the door have go out of the court where 's katherine doctor she go to the kitchen the doctor rumble i be sure i do not know what for this time of night after a little graham and rawlin come down the stair graham 's face be scar by fresh trouble rawlin draw the district attorney to one side what have you two be do up there bobby ask graham rawlin be hard-headed graham answer in a low worried tone he would not meet bobby 's eye he seem to seek a escape where 's katherine he ask doctor groom say she go to the back part of the house why will not you tell I what you be do only keep rawlin from try to make more mischief graham answer he would not explain be not there enough riddle in this house doctor groom ask with frank disapproval rawlin and robinson join they spare graham a further defense the district attorney have a air of fresh resolution he be about to speak when the front door open quietly frame the blackness of the court they start forward see no one sila blackburn make a slow shrink movement cry out : they have open the door do not let they in do not let they come near I again although they know parede have be in the court the spell of the cedar be so heavy upon they that for a moment they do not know what to expect they hesitate with a little of the abnormal apprehension sila blackburn expose then rawlin spring forward and bobby call : carlo parede step from one side he linger against the black background of the doorway it be plain enough something be wrong with he in the first place although he have open the door he have be unwilling to enter shut the door sila blackburn moan parede with a quick gesture of surrender step in and obey he face be white he have lose he immaculate appearance he clothing show stain of snow and mould he hold he left hand behind he back what be the matter with you robinson demand the panamanian 's laugh lack its usual indifference when i say the cedar be full of ghost i should have heed my own warning i might better have stay comfortably lock up in smithtown sila blackburn speak in a hoarse whisper : what do you see out there be they come i see very little parede answer it be too dark you see something doctor groom rumble parede nod he look at the floor a -- a woman in black by the lake bobby cry not as far as the lake it be near the empty grave sila blackburn commence to shake again the doctor 's little eye be wider it be a woman -- a flesh-and-blood woman robinson ask if it be a ghost parede answer it have the power of attack but that as you 'll recall be by no means unusual here that be why i have come in rather against my will it seem strange but i too have be strike by a sharp and slender object and i think perhaps the doctor have better look at the result with a motion of repugnance he move he left hand from behind he back and stretch it to the light the coat below the elbow be tear the slender hand be crimson he try to smile luckily it be not at the back of my head sit down doctor groom say wave robinson and rawlin away let I see how badly he be hurt there 'll be plenty of time for question afterward parede lay back in one of the chair and extend he arm he keep he eye close while the doctor stoop examine the wound all at once he nearly perpetual sleeplessness since come to the cedar have record itself in he face he nerve at last confess they vulnerability as he fumble for a cigarette with he good hand as he place it awkwardly between he lip would you mind give I a light bobby bobby strike a match and hold it to the cigarette thanks parede say be you nearly through doctor i daresay it be nothing doctor groom glance up nothing serious with a little luck it be only tear through a muscle it might have pierce the large vein he forehead beneath the shaggy black hair be deeply line he turn to robinson doubtfully maybe you 'll tell we robinson say what make the wound no use shirk fact the doctor rumble mr parede have be wound just as he say by something sharp and slender you mean robinson say by a instrument that could have cause death in the case of howell and -- and -- i will not have you look at I that way sila blackburn whine yes the doctor answer before we go any farther i want to bind this arm there must be a antiseptic in the house where be katherine see if you can find she bobby as bobby start to cross the dining room he hear the slight scrape of the door lead to the kitchen he know there be someone in the room with he he touch a cold hand bobby katherine breathe in he ear he understand why the little light from the hall have fail to disclose she when she have come from the kitchen she wear the black cloak against the darkness at the end of the room she have make no silhouette when he put he arm around she and touch she cheek he notice that that too be cold and the shoulder of the cloak be damp as if she have just come in from the fall snow where have you be he ask look outside she answer frankly i could not sit still i wonder if the woman in black would be around the house to-night then i be afraid so i come in doctor groom 's voice reach they have you find she be she in the dining room without any thought of disloyalty bobby recognize the menace of coincidence take you cloak off he whisper leave it here why while he draw the cloak from she shoulder he raise he voice carlo have be hurt the doctor ask I to find you he simple strategy be destroy by the appearance of rawlin the detective come directly to they nor be the coincidence lose on he and it be he business to advertise rather than to conceal it without ceremony he take the cloak from bobby he drape it over he arm the doctor he say to katherine want a basin of warm water some old linen carbolic acid if you have it she nod and go back to the kitchen while bobby return with the detective to the hall parede 's eye remain closed where do you get the cloak rawlin robinson ask the young lady rawlin answer with soft satisfaction just wear it in at least it be still wet from the snow parede open he eye he look for a moment at the black cloak he close he eye again you could recognize the woman who attack you rawlin say parede shake he head you have forget how dark it be please do not ask I even to swear that it be a woman you be try to say it be not flesh and blood blackburn quaver parede smile weakly i be try to say nothing at all tell we each detail of the attack robinson say but katherine 's footstep reach they from the dining room and parede would not answer under those condition robinson 's failure to press the question be as disturbing as the detective 's matter-of-fact capture of the cloak parede glance at katherine once there be no softness in she attitude as she kneel beside he chair neither bobby feel be there the slightest uneasiness with a facile grace she help the doctor bathe and bandage the slight wound a silk handkerchief for a sling -- the doctor suggest i will not have a sling parede say i would not know what to do without the use of both my hand you ought to congratulate yourself that you still keep it the doctor grumble bobby take the pan and the bottle from katherine and ring for jenkin it be clear that robinson have hope the girl would go out with they herself and so give parede a opportunity to speak this new development make he wonder about graham 's theory as to parede if it be marium who have strike the man there have either be a quarrel among thief or else no criminal connection have ever exist between the two parede however ape the gesture of a invalid be less to bobby 's taste than he satanic appearance when he have come from the private staircase rawlin still hold the cloak after jenkin have remove the doctor 's paraphernalia everyone seem to wait it be sila blackburn who finally release the strain katy where you be with that cloak what be he do with it without answer she take the cloak from rawlin and give the detective and the district attorney the opportunity they crave she walk up the stair turn at the landing she farewell seem pointed at the panamanian who look languidly up at she if i be wanted i shall be in my room who would want you katherine graham blurt out but it be clear he have catch the coincidence too and the trouble he have confess a little earlier be radically increase that remain to be see robinson sneer as soon as she have go now mr parede i have really tell you everything he say i walk toward the graveyard at a point very close to it i feel the presence of this creature in black i speak i take my courage in my hand i reach out i touch nothing he raise he injured hand i get this for my pain what make you go to the graveyard robinson ask suspiciously there be no mockery in the panamanian 's answer i have tell you the court for I have always be full of ghost he point to sila blackburn it frighten I that this man should come back through the court from he grave with all the evidence point to a astral magic i want to retrace he journey i think at the grave if i be alone something might expose itself that have naturally remain hide in the presence of so many materialistic human being a smile spread over rawlin 's cold unimaginative feature that sound well mr parede and there be a lot about this case that look like ghost but leave we a few flesh-and-blood clue this woman in black be one of they although she be be slippery as a eel it look to I as if you go to the grave to meet she alone exactly as you go to the desert house to talk quietly with she night before last maybe she mistake you for one of we snoop in the dark and let you have it if that be so parede say easily the nature of my wound would suggest that she be guilty of the crime in the old room why not go out and arrest she then she might explain everything except the return to life of mr blackburn i be afraid that be rather beyond you in any case but at least find she robinson join in rawlin 's laugh why go outside for that parede start you never mean -- you bet we do rawlin say if what i have dope out have not be so we would have catch she long before we be not blind and we have not miss the nerve with which she help the doctor fix you up we have not catch she before because she headquarters have be right in this house all the time you remember the other night mr robinson you would just question she in the court and have threaten to question he too when she come in here ahead of we and slip out the back way she must have tell he to follow because they have to talk undisturbed by we they go by different road to the desert house where a light have be see before we happen to hit he trail first and follow it i 'll guarantee you do not see she when you first come in robinson shake he head mr graham keep I busy and i rather wait for you report before push thing i do not see she or question she until after mr graham and mr blackburn have start for new york and she could have sneak in the back way any time before that rawlin say it be utter nonsense graham cry rawlin turn on he see here mr graham you have be try to fight I off this way all afternoon it will not do katy 's a good girl sila blackburn quaver with a grow discomfort bobby realize that when the woman have cry near the graveyard he have reach out for katherine and have fail to find she moreover the night graham and he have hear the cry in the old room she have stand alone in the corridor it be easily conceivable that the turn of event after robinson 's arrival should have make it necessary for conspirator to consult free from any danger of disturbance but katherine he tell himself be assuredly the victim of coincidence he could not picture she entangled in any of parede 's purpose she dislike of the man be complete and open but he see that rawlin out of the mass of apparently inexplicable clue have extract this material one and would follow it desperately no matter who be hurt and robinson be behind he that account for they frequent excursion upstairs during the afternoon for rawlin 's ascent as soon as they have return from the grave they have evidently find something to sharpen they suspicion and graham probably know what it be robinson take out he watch we can not put this off too late he muse the detective at he heel he walk to the library bobby start after they graham catch he and they cross the dining room together what do they mean to do bobby ask i have be afraid of it since this afternoon graham answer i have not care to talk about it i have hope to hold they off they intend to search katherine 's room i think they believe she have something important hide there i have be wonder if they have get track of howell 's report which we tell jenkin to hide why bobby ask should that involve katherine howell may have write something damage to she he know she be devote to you interest robinson call to they from the library will not you please come in mr blackburn bobby and graham continue to the library they find rawlin gaze through the door of the private staircase we could go up this way he be say and across the old room so that she need not suspect what be he talk about bobby ask robinson angrily you want to help robinson answer so rawlin and i be go to give you a chance we be about to search you cousin 's room we hope to find there a explanation of a part of the mystery -- the motive at least for howell 's death perhaps you own exoneration you would do anything to have that would not you you have say so at she expense bobby cry you have no right to go to she room she be incapable of a share in such crime do you seriously think she could plan a escape from the grave and bring back to life a man three day dead give I a human be that cause death robinson answer and i 'll tackle the ghost later you be wrong if you think i be go to quit cold because you grandfather look like a dead thing that move about and talk i sha not give up to that madness until i have do everything in my power i would be a criminal myself if i fail to do as rawlin wish if you cousin 's skirt be clear no harm will be do i be act on the assumption that you confession be honest i want you to get miss perrine out of she room i want you to see that she stay downstairs while we search you have already search she room not since rawlin -- robinson catch himself never mind that it be necessary it should be search to-night even you 'll acknowledge it be significant that all day when she have be downstairs she door have be lock it be only significant bobby flash in view of you treatment of she yesterday robinson grin that will hardly go down rawlin have hesitate to break in i have instruct he to do it now if necessary for the last time will you bring you cousin down will you go through and unlock the door lead from the old bedroom to the private hall so we can get up no bobby cry i would not do it if i believe you be right and i know you be wrong prove that we be wrong clear you cousin by help we robinson urge since you be so determine graham say quietly i 'll do it hartley what be you think of of show they how wrong they be graham say i 'll tell she doctor groom wish to speak to she about mr blackburn i 'll warn he to keep she downstairs for a quarter of a hour that should give you plenty of time robinson nod she 'll never forgive you bobby say it be spy he wonder that graham should choose such a course so soon after it have become clear that katherine have never really love he it be the best way to satisfy they graham say i have perhaps more faith than you in katherine he leave they to carry out robinson 's instruction they wait at the entrance of the private staircase i may witness this outrage bobby ask i would rather you do not speak of it in such harsh term robinson smile bobby do not know what to expect the whole thing might be a trick of parede in line with he hint the night of howell 's death to involve katharine the quiet confidence of the two official be disturb what have rawlin see after a long time graham descend the private staircase carry a light candle he beckon and they follow he back through the private hall into the wide and mournful bedroom it encourage bobby to see the district attorney and the detective hurry across it after all they be really without confidence of solve its ghostly riddle what they be about to do he argue be a last chance they would find nothing they would acknowledge themselves beat when they enter the farther wing he notice that katherine 's door stand wide you see he say when i call she graham explain she think something have happen to she grandfather she run out and forget all about the door robinson grin that be lucky now rawlin bobby could not bring himself to cross the threshold but from the corridor he could see the interior of the room and all that go on there during the next few moment a candle burn on the bureau expose the feminine neatness and delicacy of the furnishings the presence of the three man be a desecration what they be about to do a unforgivable act of vandalism rawlin go to a work table while robinson rummage in the closet graham meantime bent against the footboard of the bed watch with anxious eye bobby 's anger be increase by this picture he resist a impulse to run to the stair and call katherine up that would simply increase robinson 's suspicion there be nothing she could do nothing he could do rawlin have clearly be unsuccessful at the work table he glide to the bureau one after the other he open the drawer fumble within lift the contents out replace they with a rough haste while bobby 's futile rage increase suddenly he see graham 's attitude alter rawlin 's back stiffen he pull the bottom drawer altogether from the bureau and thrust it to one side he gaze in the opening come here mr robinson he say softly robinson leave the closet and stoop beside the detective he exclaim graham go closer look over they back you would better see bobby he say without turn yes robinson say let I show you how wrong you be mr blackburn let I ask if you know you be wrong bobby enter with a quicker pulse he too stoop and look in the opening abruptly everything alter for he he wonder that he physical surroundings should remain the same that the eager face beside he should retain they familiar line against the back-board of the bureau where it would fit neatly when the drawer be in place lay a plaster cast of a footmark near by be a rumpled handkerchief that bobby recognize as he own and the envelope contain howell 's report which they have tell jenkin to hide well robinson grin i swear i do not know they be there bobby answer you 'll never make I believe that katherine know it i have guess rawlin say that the stuff be hide here ever since this afternoon when i see a small bundle sneak in who bring it bobby take he up robinson 's grin expand leave we one or two surprise to spring in court then bobby say my cousin be not in the room when this evidence be bring here i 'll admit that rawlin answer but she be not far away and she get here before i could investigate and she be keep the door lock ever since until just now he lift the exhibit out the shape of the cast the monogram on the handkerchief cry out they testimony robinson grasp howell 's report and glance over the fine handwriting after a time he look up there be the case against you mr blackburn and at the least you cousin 's a accessory but why the devil do you come to I and make a clean breast of it because bobby cry i do not know anything about these thing be here can not you see that that be the trouble robinson answer uncertainly i think i do see it besides graham say you be still without the instrument that cause death i expect to land it in this room rawlin answer grimly he replace the drawer and continue to fumble among the clothing it contain all at once he call out and raise he hand on the forefinger a tiny red stain show how do you do that robinson ask something prick I the detective answer maybe it be only a pin but it might have be -- excitedly he resume he search he take the clothing from the drawer and throw it to one side nothing remain in the drawer i guess it must have be a pin robinson say disappointed but rawlin take up each article of clothing and examine it minutely he face brighten here 's something stiff by gad i believe i have get it conceal in a woollen sack with the slender shaft thrust through and through the fold be a peculiarly long stout and sharp hat pin rawlin draw it out he hold it up triumphantly now maybe we be not get somewhere that be the boy that do the trick in both case and it be what scratch mr parede maybe you notice how quickly she come upstairs to hide this when she get in good work rawlin robinson say he glance at bobby and graham have either of you see this deadly thing before bobby would not answer but after a moment 's hesitation graham speak : there be no point in lie bobby katherine know nothing of this i disagree with rawlin if she have be work with parede which be unthinkable she would never have make such a mistake she would not have strike he i have see she wear such a pin if she do not cut he with it rawlin reason who else could have get it out of here and put it back to-night when she keep she door lock there be no get around it robinson say take charge of these thing rawlin put they in a safe place what be you go to do bobby ask i be afraid there be only one thing to do robinson answer i 'll have to arrest you both one of you use this pin in the old room it do not make much difference which one you have be work together and we 'll find out about parede later you be make a terrible mistake bobby mutter you do not know katherine or you could not suspect she of any share in such crime give I until morning to prove how wrong you be what would be the use robinson ask if you 'll do that i will get the truth for you -- the whole truth how the room be enter everything i swear it robinson only a few hour let I carry out my plan let I offer myself to the danger of the old room as howell and my grandfather do you case be no good unless you can explain the miracle to-night give we this chance then in the morning if nothing happen and you still think i be guilty lock I up but for god 's sake robinson leave she out of it graham walk to the window and fling it open a violent gust of wind sweep in carry a multitude of icy flake the storm be worse he say no one be likely to try to escape from this house to-night bobby stretch out he hand you can not expose she to that rawlin have not forget the sense of fellowship spring from the pursuit of parede through the forest he be right mr robinson you could lock up a dozen people you might send they to the chair without uncover the real mystery of the cedar maybe he might find something and he would be as safe in that room as in any jail i know of i mean one of we would be in the library and the other in the corridor outside the broken door how could he reasonably get out if there be a attempt to repeat the trick we would be ready as for the girl it be simple enough to safeguard against she get away before morning as mr graham say no one 's likely to run far in this storm anyway robinson consider i do not want to be hard he say finally and i do not want to miss any chance of clean up where poor howell fail he glance at the extraordinary array of evidence the good nature which one feel should always have be in he face shone at last i do not believe you be guilty as far as you be concern it be likely enough a put-up job i do not know about the girl go ahead anyway and tell we if you can how the lock room be enter explain the mystery of that old man who look as if he be dead but who move around and talk with we the answer if it be anywhere bobby say be in the old room robinson nod under the condition it seem worth while go on then and clear you cousin and yourself if you can you have until daylight to-morrow bobby 's gratitude be sufficiently eloquent in he eye but he say nothing he hurry from the room to find katherine as soon as he have step in the corridor he see she figure against the wall katherine he breathe i have hear everything she say he lead she to the main hall where the greedy ear in she bedroom could not overhear they then you suspect what they be about he ask she uncle sila she answer seem just as he have be when i go upstairs so i wonder and i remember i have leave my door unlock then you know those thing be there she face be white she tremble she word come jerkily : of course i do not i only keep my door lock because they have search so thoroughly before it be a humiliation i could not bear to face again you do not know he ask who take that stuff from howell who hide it in you bureau the tremble of she slender body become more pronounced she speak through chatter tooth : bobby why do you ask such thing you believe i be guilty as you think i be the woman in black you think now because those thing be in my bureau -- stop katherine you will not answer I no she say back away from he but you be go to answer I we have come to that point already just a hour or two of trust and then this it be the cedar force we apart as it do when we have we quarrel only this time it be definite do you think i be guilty of these atrocious crime or do not you everything for we depend on you answer and i 'll know whether you be tell I the truth then he say why should i answer and he take she in he arm and hold she close she do not cry but for a moment she cease tremble and she tooth no longer chatter my dear he say even if you have hide that evidence i would have know it be to protect I then she cry a little and for a moment even in the unmerciful grasp of they trouble they be nearly happy the footstep of the other in the corridor recall they katherine lean against the table dry she eye graham robinson and rawlin walk into the hall hello robinson say i suppose that be not a unfair advantage mr blackburn still i would rather she have not be tell he be tell I nothing katherine answer i come back to the corridor i hear everything you say maybe it be as well robinson reflect it certainly be if what you hear have show you the wisdom of give up the whole thing she stare at he without reply come now he wheedle you might tell we at least why you steal and secrete the evidence i 'll answer nothing that be wiser katherine graham put in she turn on he with a complete and unexpected fury the color rush back to she face she eye blaze bobby have never guess she capable of such anger he wonder grow that she outburst should be direct against graham keep quiet she cry hysterically do not speak to I again i hate you do you understand graham draw back why katherine -- do not she say do not call I that the officer glance at graham with frank bewilderment rawlin 's materialistic mind do not hesitate to express its first thought : must say i always think you be sweet on the lady hartley bobby say you have be fair to we i do not know why she attack I graham mutter he face record a genuine pain he word bobby feel overcome a barrier of emotion they hear parede and doctor groom on the stair what be this the doctor rumble as he come up i -- i be sorry i forget myself katherine say through she chattering tooth she turn to robinson i be go to my room you need not be afraid i sha not leave it until you come to take I truly i hope it will not be necessary the district attorney answer she hurry away rawlin grin at parede i be wonder what the devil you know robinson make no secret of what have happen in reply to the question of parede and the doctor he tell of the discovery of the evidence and of the stout hat-pin that have unquestionably cause death the man make it clear enough however that he do not care to have parede know of bobby 's plan to spend the night in the old room and rawlin bobby and graham indicate that they understand it be quite absurd that any one should think katherine guilty the doctor say to robinson this evidence and its presence in she room be detail that do not approach the heart of the mystery that be to be find only in the old room and i do not think any one want to tempt it again in fact i be not sure one can learn the truth there and live you know what happen to howell when he try sila blackburn go there and none of we can understand the change that be take place i have be watch he closely so have mr parede we have see he become grayer we have see he eye alter he sit shake in he chair since we come back from the grave the man -- if we can call he a man -- seem to have -- shrink yes parede say perhaps we should not have leave he alone let we go back let we see if he be all right rawlin laugh skeptically you be not afraid he 'll melt away i be not so sure he will not parede answer they follow he downstairs because of the position of blackburn 's chair they could be sure of nothing until they have reach the lower floor and approach the fireplace then they see it be as if parede 's far-fetched fear have be realize blackburn be not in he chair nor be he to be find in the hall even then with the exception of parede they would not take the thing seriously since the old man be not in the hall since he could not have go upstairs unobserved by they he must be either in the library the dining room or the rear part of the house there be no one in the library or the dining room and jenkin who sit in the kitchen still shake by the discovery at the grave say he have not move for the last half hour be entirely sure no one have come through from the front part of the house they return to the hall and stand in a half circle about the empty chair where a little while ago silas blackburn have cower mouth snatch of he fear -- i be not dead i tell you i be not dead they can not make I go back -- the echo of that fear still shock they ear there be a hypnotic power about the vacancy as there have be about the emptiness in the burial ground parede speak gropingly what would we find he whisper if we go to the cemetery and look again in the coffin why should he have come back at all groom muse robinson open the front door you know he might have go this way but already the snow have obliterate the sign of they own passage in and out it show no fresh mark sila blackburn have not go that way in the body doctor groom rumble the storm be more violent it discourage the idea of examine the graveyard again before morning robinson glance at he watch he lead bobby and the detective to the library then try you scheme if you want he say but understand i assume no responsibility honestly i doubt if it amount to anything you 'll shout out if you be attack or the moment you suspect any real cause for fear rawlin will be in the corridor and i 'll be in the library or wander about the house -- always within call rawlin will guard the broken door but be sure and lock the other one the two officer go upstairs with bobby graham follow you understand robinson say i would rather parede and the doctor do not suspect what you be go to do change you mind before it be too late if you want bobby walk on without reply you can not dissuade he graham say because of what will happen to-morrow unless the truth be discover to-night in the upper hall they find katherine wait she endeavor be hard to face you sha not go there for I bobby she say be not it clear i must go in my own service he say try to smile he would not speak to she again he would not look at she she anxiety and the affection in she eye weaken he and he need all he strength for at the entrance of the dark narrow corridor the fear meet he rawlin bring a candle and guide he down the corridor graham come too the detective lock the door lead to the private hall and slip the key in he pocket nobody will get through there any more than they will through the other door which i 'll watch with graham 's help he make a quick inspection of the room search the closet and glance beneath the bed and behind the furniture there be no one he say prepare to depart i tell you there be no chance of a physical attack he unimaginative mind cry out i tell you you 'll find nothing learn nothing for there be nothing here to find nothing to learn just the same graham urge you 'll call out will not you bobby at the first sign of anything out of the way for god 's sake take no foolish chance i do not want the light bobby force himself to say my grandfather and howell both put they candle out i want everything as it be when they be attack rawlin nod and follow by graham carry the candle from the room and close the broken door the sudden solitude and the darkness crushed bobby take he breath yellow flame the response of he eye to the disappearance of the candle tear across the blackness confuse he he feel he way to the wall near the open window he sit down there face the bed at first he could not see the bed he see only the projection of he fancy stimulate by sila blackburn 's story against the black screen of the night he understand at last what the old man have mean the darkness do appear to possess a physical resistance and as the minute lengthen it seem to encase all the suffer the room have ever harbour but he would not close he eye as he grandfather have do it be a defense to keep they on the spot where the bed stand while he mind in spite of he will picture lie there still form with bandage head he would not close he eye even when those fancied shape commence to struggle in grotesque and impotent motion like ant whose hill have be demolish nor could he drive from he ear the echo of delirium that seem to have linger in the old room he continue to watch the darkness until the outline of the room and of its furniture dimly detach themselves from the black pall the snow apparently catch what feeble light the moon force through reflect it with a disconsolate inefficiency he could see after a time the pallid frame of the window the pillow on the bed and the wall above it he fancy the dark stain the depression in the mattress where the two body have rest those physical object force on he the probability of he guilt then he recall that both man dead for many hour have move apparently of they own volition and he grandfather have come back from the grave and then have disappear leave no trace and he comfort himself with the thought that the explanation if it come at all must arise from a force outside himself whether of the living or the dead because of that very assurance he fear of the room be incite could any subtle change overcome he here as it evidently have the other could there be repeat in he case a return and a disappearance like he grandfather 's there be as rawlin have say no way in or out for a attack therefore the danger must emerge from the dead and he be helpless before they incomprehensible campaign the whole illogical abominable course of event warn he to bring he vigil to a end before it should be too late urge he to escape from the restless revolt of the dead who have dwell in this room and he want to respond he want to go to the corridor and confess to rawlin and robinson that he be beat yet he have beg so hard for this chance that course moreover mean the arrest of katherine and himself in the morning for a few hour he could suffer here for she sake daylight if he could persist until then would bring release and surely it could not be long now he shrink back steadily it have grow colder in the old room he shiver he draw he coat closer about he what temerity to invade the domain of death as parede have call it to seek the secret of unquiet soul he cease shiver he wait tensely quiet without calculation he realize that the moment for which he have hope be at hand the old room be about to disclose its secret but would it permit he to depart with he knowledge he forget to call he wait helpless and terrify against the wall he hear a moaning cry faint and distant -- the voice they have hear in the forest and at the grave but it be more than that that hold he he know now what katherine have hear across the court herald each tragedy and mystery he catch a formless stir yet on the bed there be no one fortunately he have not go there he try to call out realize that the danger could find he if it choose but he throat be tight and it permit no response he glance have not waver from the wall above the stain pillow there be movement there then he see a hand protrude from the blackness of the panelling where they have sound and measure without success in the ashen unnatural light from the snow the long finger of the hand be like the feeler of a gigantic reptile they waver feebly and he become convinced that the hand be immaterial that it be unattached to any body if that be so it could not be the hand of katherine at least he have prove that robinson and rawlin have be wrong about she that sense of victory strip he of he paralyze fear it loose the tight band about he throat he call he could prove the immaterial nature of the repulsive hand waver from the wall cry out he spring to he foot he fling himself across the bed with both of he own hand he grasp the slender inquisitive finger which waver above the stain pillow and once more he throat tighten he could not cry out again chapter x the cedar be leave to its shadow straightway bobby repent the alarm he have perhaps too impulsively give for the hand protrude from the wall be indeed flesh and blood and with the knowledge come back he fear for katherine conquer he first relief a sick revulsion sweep he he remember the evidence find in katherine 's room and she refusal to answer question could parede and the officer have be right be it conceivably she hand struggle weakly in he grasp the door from the corridor crash open rawlin burst through graham run after he from the private stairway arise the sound of the district attorney 's hurry footstep what be it what have you get rawlin shout graham cry out : you be all right bobby the candle which the detective carry gleam on the slender finger show bobby that they have be insert through a opening in the wall he could not understand for time after time each one of the panel have be sound and examine beyond he could see dimly the dark clothing of the person who with a stealth in itself suggestive of abnormal crime have make use of such a device as rawlin hurry up he wonder if it would not be the better course to free he prisoner to cry out urge a escape already it be too late the detective and graham have see and clearly they have no doubt that he hold the one responsible for two brutal murder and for the confusing mystery that have cap they look like a lady 's hand rawlin call do not let go young fellow he unlock the door to the private hallway graham and he dash out in bobby 's uncertain grasp the hand twitch robinson 's voice reach he through the opening let go mr blackburn you have do you share the lord know you have catch the beast with the goods bobby release the slender finger he see they vanish through the opening he leave the bed and reluctantly approach the door to the private hall excite phrase roar in he ear he scarcely dare listen because of they possible confirmation of he doubt the finger he repeat to himself have be too slender the moment that have free he from fear of he own guilt have construct in its place a uncertainty harder to face yet there be nothing to be gain by wait sooner or later he must learn whether katherine have hide the evidence whether she have use the stout and deadly hatpin whether she struggle now in the grasp of vindictive man a voice from the corridor arrest he bobby with a glad cry he swing around katherine stand in the opposite doorway she presence there beyond a doubt be she exculpation he cross the sombre room he grasp she hand he smile happily after all the hand he have hold be not as slender as hers thank heaven you be here in a word he recite the result of he vigil it clear you she say quick we must see who it be but he linger for he want that ugly fear do with once for all you can tell I now how the evidence get in you room i can not she say i do not know the truth of she reply impress he he look at she and wonder that she should be fully dress why be you dress he ask she be puzzle why not i do not think any one have go to bed but it must be very late i suppose it be the same time -- half-past two she start to cross the room she laugh nervously it be not eleven he recall he interminable anticipation among the shadow of the old room i have watch there only a little more than a hour not much more than that bobby what a coward i would have swear it be nearly daylight she press he hand no very brave she whisper let we see if it be worth it they step through the doorway half way down the hall robinson graham and rawlin hold a fourth who have cease struggle bobby pause yet since see katherine step from the corridor he reason have teach he to expect just this the fourth man be parede nearly effeminate slender-fingered carlo bobby cry you can not have do these unspeakable thing the panamanian stare without answer evidently he have have time to control he chagrin to smother he revolt from the future for the thin face be bare of emotion the depths of the eye as usual turn back scrutiny the man disclose neither guilt nor the outrage of a assume innocence neither confession nor denial he simply stare strain a trifle against the eager hand of he captor rawlin grin joyously you ought to have a medal for get away with this young fellow thing do not look so happy for you a hour or so ago and i have half a mind robinson confess to refuse you the chance glad i do not glad as i can be you make good with the egotism any man be likely to draw from he effort in the detection of crime he add easily : of course i have suspect this spigotty all along i do not have to remind you of that sure rawlin say and do not i put it up to he strong enough to-night parede laugh lightly all credit where it be due you also put it up to miss perrine the detail will straighten all that out robinson say i do not pretend to have they yet i gather not parede muse with old blackburn 's ghost still in the offing that talk rawlin say will not go down from you any more i daresay you have get most of the detail in you head i daresay parede answer dryly he fight farther back against the detain hand be there any necessity for this exhibition of brute strength you must find it very exhausting you may think I dangerous and i thank you but i have no gun and i be no match for four man and a woman besides you hurt my arm bobby be none too tender with that i ought to have use my good arm you 'll get no detail from I unless you take you hand off robinson 's hesitation be easily comprehensible if parede be responsible for the abnormality they have experience at the cedar he might find it simple enough to trick they now but the man 's mock smile bring the anger to robinson 's face of course he can not get away see if there be anything on he clothes rawlin he ought to have the hatpin then let he go the detective however fail to find the hatpin or any other weapon you see parede smile that be something in my favor he step back brushing he clothing with he uninjured hand he light a cigarette he draw back the coat sleeve of he left arm and readjust the bandage he glance up as heavy footstep herald doctor groom hello doctor he call cheerily i be afraid you would nap through the show it seem the bloodhound of the law leave we out of they confidence what be all this the doctor rumble parede wave he hand i be a prisoner the doctor gape you mean you -- young blackburn catch he robinson explain he be in a position to finish he just as he do howell except that i have no hatpin parede yawn the doctor 's uneasy glance seek the opening in the wall i think you have examine all these wall he grumble how do you miss this robinson run he finger through he hair that be what i have be ask myself he say i go over that panelling a dozen time myself bobby and katherine go closer bobby have be from the first puzzle by parede 's easy manner he have a quick hope he see the man watch with a amuse tolerance while the district attorney bent over examine the face of the panel a entire section robinson say -- the thickness of the wall -- have be shift to one side no wonder we do not see any joint or get a hollow sound from this panel any more than from the other but why do not we stumble on the mechanism maybe you 'll tell we that parede the panamanian blow a wreath of smoke against the ancient wall gladly but you will find it humiliating i have experience humility in this hall myself the reason you do not find any mechanism be that there be not any you look for something most cautiously conceal not realize that the best concealment be no concealment at all it be fundamental i do not know how it slip my own mind no groove show because the door be a entire panel there be not even a latch you merely push hard against its face such arrangement be common enough in colonial house and there be more than the nature of the crime to tell you there be some such thing here i mean if you will examine the farther door closer than you have do you will find that it have fewer coat of paint than the one lead to the corridor that its frame be of newer wood in other word it be cut through after the wing be build this panel be the original door design with the private stairway and the hall for the exclusive use of the master of the house try it robinson brace himself and shove against the panel it move in its groove with a vibrant stir rusty he say katherine start that be what i hear each time she cry above he heavy black beard the doctor 's cheek whiten robinson make a gesture of revulsion that give the nasty game away naturally parede say and you must admit the game be as beautifully simple as the panel the instrument of death be not insert through the bedding as you think inevitable doctor suppose you be lie in that bed asleep or half asleep and you be arouse by such a sound as that in the wall behind you what would you do what would any man do first of all robinson nod i see what you mean i would get up on my elbow i would look around as quickly as i could to see what it be i would expose myself to a clean thrust i would drop back on the bed more thoroughly out of it than though i would be strike through the heart exactly parede say with the familiar shrug of he shoulder you be sensible to give up this way robinson say it be the best plan for you what about mr blackburn graham interfere after all he say thoughtfully i be a lawyer and it be not fair robinson it be only decent to tell he that anything he say may be use against he keep you mouth shut robinson shout but parede smile at graham it be very good of you but i agree with the district attorney there be no point in be a clam now can you account for sila blackburn 's return the doctor ask eagerly that be right doctor parede say stick to the ghost i fancy there be plenty in this house i be afraid we must look on sila blackburn as dead you do not mean we have be talk to a dead man katherine whisper before i answer parede say i want to have one or two thing straight these man bobby i really believe think I capable of the crime in this house i want to know if you accept such a theory do you think i have any idea of kill you bobby study the reserved face which even now be without emotion i can not think anything of the kind he say softly that be very nice parede say if you have answer differently i would have let these clever policeman lay they own ghost he turn to robinson even you must begin to see that i be not guilty you common sense will tell you so if i have be plan to kill bobby why do not i bring the weapon why do i put my hand through the opening before i be ready to strike why do i use my left hand -- my injured hand i be like howell i could not consider the case finish until i have solve the mystery of the lock door i suppose the room be empty when i find the secret to-night i reach through to see how far my hand would be from the pillow bobby 's assurance of parede 's innocence cloud he own situation make it in a sense more dangerous than it have ever be he wanderings about the cedar remain unexplained and they know now it have never be necessary for the murderer to enter the room katherine too evidently realize the menace do you think i -- she begin parede bow you dislike I miss katherine but do not be afraid for yourself or bobby i think i can tell you how the evidence get in you room i can answer nearly everything there be one point -- he break off glance at he watch extraordinary courage he muse enigmatically i scarcely understand it rawlin look at he suspiciously all this explain may be a trick mr robinson the man 's slippery i have have to be slippery to work under you nose parede laugh by the way bobby do you hear a woman cry about the time i

parede muse we should have have a visit from she long before this do you know who she be robinson ask and as rawlin say no trick we have not let you go yet i think parede mock that you have identify

through parede answer for bobby 's sake with a warm gratitude bobby know that parede have tell the truth then he have tell it in the library yesterday when they have catch he prowl in the private staircase all along he have tell it while they have try to convict he of under-handed and unfriendly intention i see parede be say that howell would not succeed and it be obvious you and rawlin would do worse while graham 's blunder from the start leave no hope somebody have to rescue bobby then why do you give we the impression graham ask that you be not a friend parede hold up he hand that be go rather far mr graham never once have i give such a impression i have time after time state the fact that i be here in bobby 's service that have be the trouble with all of you as most detective do you have deny fact search always for something more subtle you have ask for impossibility while you bluster that they could not exist still every one be prone to do that when he fancy himself in the presence of the supernatural the fact of this case have be within you reach as well as mine the motive have be a easy one to understand money and you have consistently turn you back robinson spread he hand all right prove that i be a fool and i 'll acknowledge it doctor groom interrupted sharply what be that they bent forward listen even with parede offer they a physical explanation they shrink from the keen that barely survive the heavy atmosphere of the old house you see the woman in black be not miss perrine parede say he run down the stair they follow respond to a excited sense of imminence even in the private staircase the pound that have follow the cry reach they with harsh reverberation its echo fill the house as they dash across the library and the dining room in the hall they realize that it come from the front door it have attain a feverish a desperate insistence parede walk to the fireplace open the door he direct rawlin rawlin step to the door unlock it and fling it wide the woman katherine breathe a feminine figure white with snow stumble in as if she have stand brace against the door rawlin catch she and hold she upright the flake whirl from the court in vicious pursuit bobby slam the door shut marium he cry you be right hartley yet at first he could scarcely accept this pitiful creature as the brilliant and exotic dancer with whom he have dine the night of the first murder as he stare at she she feature twist she burst into retch sob she stagger toward parede as she go the snow melt from she hat and cloak she become a black figure again with a appearance of have be immerse in water she sink on the hearth sway back and forth reach blindly for parede 's hand do what you please with I carlo she whimper with she slight accent from which all the music have flee i could not stand it another minute i could not get to the station and i -- i want to know which -- which -- parede watch she curiously get jenkin he say softly to rawlin he face marium again i could have tell you i think when you fight I away out there no one want to arrest you jenkin will verify my own knowledge this be dangerous the doctor rumble this woman should not wait here she should have dry clothing at once marium shrink from he for the first time she wet skirt expose she foot encase in tear stocking the dancer wear no shoe and bobby guess why she have be so elusive why she have leave so few trace i will not go she cry until he tell I katherine get a cloak and throw it across the woman 's shoulder marium look up at she with a dumb gratitude then rawlin come back with jenkin the butler be bent and haggard he surrender to fear be more pronounced than it have be at the grave or when they have last see he in the kitchen he grasp a chair and breathing heavily look from one to the other moisten he lip parede face the man completely master of the situation through the old butler it become clear he would make he revelation and announce that simple fact they all have miss it be mr sila of course who come back oh my god the butler moan what do you mean i know everything jenkin parede say evenly the butler collapse against the chair parede grasp he arm pull yourself together man they will not want you as more than a accessory marium start to rise she shrink back again shiver close to the fire be you master hide parede ask or have he leave the house jenkin 's answer come through tremble lip he be go mr sila be go how do you find out my god how do you find out he say nothing to you parede ask jenkin shake he head tell I how he be dress the old servant cover he face mr sila stumble through the kitchen he answer hoarsely i try to stop he but he push I away and run out he voice rise i tell you he run without a coat or a hat into the storm parede sigh the cedar 's final tragedy yet it be the most graceful exit he could have make marium struggle to she foot she eye be the eye of a person without reason that familiar hysterical quality which they have hear before at a distance vibrate in she voice then he be the one i want to kill he i could not kill he because i never be sure do you see he go out a hour or so ago parede ask i see he she cry feverishly run from the back of the house and down the path to the lake i -- i try to catch he but my foot be freeze and the snow be slippery and i could not find my shoe but i call and he would not stop i have to know because i want to kill he if it be sila blackburn and i see he run to the lake and splash in until the water be over he head she fling she clenched hand out she voice become a scream shot with all she suffering all she doubt all she fury you do not understand he can not be punish i tell you he be at the bottom of the lake with the man he murder and i can not pay he i try to go after he but it -- it be too cold she sink in one of the chair shake and sob unless we want another tragedy the doctor say this woman must be put to bed and take care of she have be terribly expose you have hear she she be delirious not so delirious that she have not tell the truth parede say the doctor lift she in he arm and with rawlin 's help carry she upstairs katherine go with they almost immediately the doctor and rawlin hurry down i have tell katherine what to do doctor groom say the woman may be all right in the morning what be she be up to here then bobby cry there be a connection between the dinner party and the murder but what about my come here unconscious what about my handkerchief i can see no answer yet graham say parede smile not when you have have the answer to everything i have show you that sila blackburn be the murderer the fact stare you in the face everything that have happen at the cedar have point to he guilt except the doctor say he own apparent murder which make he guilt seem impossible and i be not sure you be right now for there be no other blackburn he could have murder and blackburn look alike you would not mistake another man for one of they this house parede smile have all along be full of the presence of the other blackburn there have be evidence enough for you all to have know he be here he stretch himself in a easy chair he light a cigarette and blow the smoke toward the ceiling i shall tell you the simple fact if only to save my skin from this blood-thirsty district attorney rub it in robinson grin i 'll take my medicine they gather closer about the panamanian jenkin sidle to the back of he chair i do not see how you find it out he mutter i have only one advantage over you or the police graham parede begin and you be in a position to overcome that marium do telephone I the afternoon of that ghastly dinner she ask I to get hold of bobby she be plainly anxious to keep he in new york that night and to be frank i be glad enough to help she when you turn up try to impress we with you puritan watchfulness even you guess that she have drug bobby i suspect it when i see he go to piece in the cafe he give I the slip as i tell you in the coat room when i be try to get he home so i go back and ask maria what she idea be she laugh in my face deny everything i too suspect the stranger but i have convince myself that he simply happen along by chance now here be the first significant point : marium by drug bobby defeat she own purpose he have be drink more than the band of hope would approve of and on top of that he get a overdose of a powerful drug the doctor can tell you better than i of the likely effect of such a combination what i tell you in the court bobby the doctor answer much the same symptom as genuine aphasia you brain be unquestionably dull by a overdose on top of all that alcohol while you mechanical reflex be stimulate automatically you follow you ruling impulse automatically at the last minute you revolt from expose yourself in such a condition to you cousin and you grandfather you lucid period in the wood just before you reach the desert house and go to sleep show that you exercise be overcome the effect of the drug that moment you 'll remember be color by the fanciful idea such a drug would induce so bobby parede say although you be asleep when the body move and when howell be murder you can be sure you be not anywhere near the old room but i walk in my sleep last night bobby remind he the doctor slap he knee i understand it be only when we think that be you habit that it frighten we it be plain this sleep-walking have be suggest to you and you have brood upon the suggestion until you be bind to respond graham 's presence in you room watch for just that reaction be a perpetual a unescapable stimulation it would have be a miracle in itself if you brain have fail to carry it out bobby make a swift gesture of distaste if you have not come carlo where would i have be why do you come graham ask bobby be my friend the panamanian answer he have be very good to I when i read of he grandfather 's death i wonder why marium have drug he to keep he in new york in the coincidence lurk a element of trouble for he at first i suspect some kind of a understanding between she and old blackburn -- perhaps she have engage to keep bobby away from the cedar until the new will have be make but here be blackburn murder and it be manifest she have not try to throw suspicion on bobby and the point that make howell 's case incomplete assure I of he innocence who then have kill he grandfather not maria for i have drop she at she apartment that night too late for she to get out here by the hour of the murder still as you suspect marium be the key and i begin to speculate about she she have tell I something of she history you might have have as much from she press agent although she have live in spain since she be a child she be bear in panama my own country of a spanish mother and a american father right away i wonder if blackburn have ever be in panama or spain i begin to seek the inception of the possible understanding between they since i find no illuminating document about blackburn 's past in the library i conclude if such papers exist they would be lock up in the desk in he room i search there a number of time give you every excuse i could think of to get upstairs the other night after i have suspect she of know something miss katherine nearly catch I but i find what i want -- a carefully hide packet of account and letter and newspaper clipping they be at you service mr district attorney they tell I that sila blackburn have be in panama they prove that marium instead of ever have be he accomplice be he enemy they explain the source of he wealth and the foundation of that enmity certainly you remember the doctor tell we sila blackburn start life with nothing and have not you ever wonder why with all he money he bury himself in this lonely hole he return from south america rich more than twenty-five year ago the doctor say why should we bother about he money i wish you have bother about several thing besides you ghost parede say you would have find it significant that blackburn lay the foundation of he fortune in panama during the hideous scandal of the old french canal company we know he be a selfish tyrant that discovery show I how selfish how merciless he be for to succeed in panama during those day require a utter contempt for all the standard of law and decency the man who get along hold life cheaper than a handful of copper that be what i mean when i walk around the hall talking of the ghost of panama for i be begin to see sila blackburn 's fear he trip to smithtown be the first indication of the presence of the other blackburn the papers outline he more clearly why have it be forget here doctor that sila blackburn have a brother -- he partner in those wretched and profitable contract scandal you mean the doctor answer robert blackburn he be a year younger than sila this boy be name in memory of he why should any one have remember he die in south america more than a quarter of a century ago before these child be bear that be what sila blackburn tell you when he come back parede say he may have believe it at first or he may not have i daresay he want to for he come back with he brother 's money as well as he own -- the cash and the easily convertible security that be all man would handle in that hell but he never forget that he brother 's wife be alive and when he run from panama he know she be about to become a mother that bring I to the other feature that make I wander around here like a restless spirit myself that night you have just tell you story about the woman cry if there be a strange woman around here it be almost certainly marium as rawlin deduce she must either be hysterical or signalling some one why should she come unless something have go wrong the night she drug bobby to keep he in new york she be not he enemy because that very night she do he a good turn by trample out he track in the court bobby take marium 's letter from he pocket and hand it to parede then how would you account for this the panamanian read the letter she way of cover herself he explain in case you suspect she have make you drink too much or have drug you she really want you to come to tea that afternoon it be after write that that she find out what have go wrong in other word she read in the paper of sila blackburn 's death and in a panic she put on plain clothes and hurry out to see what have happen the fact that she forget she manager she professional reputation everything testify to she anxiety and i begin to sense the truth she have be bear in panama of a spanish mother and a american father she have some stealthy interest in the cedar and the blackburn she be about the right age ten to one she be sila blackburn 's niece so for I many hour before sila blackburn walk in here the presence of the other blackburn about the cedar become a tragic and threatening inevitability have sila blackburn be murder or have he brother where be the survivor who have commit that brutal murder marium have come here hysterically to answer those question she might know the light in the desert house she might be hide he and take food to he there but she cry suggest a signal which he never answer at any rate i have to find marium so i slip out i think i hear she at the lake she be not there i be sure i would trap she at the desert house for the diffused glow of the light we have see prove that it have come through the cobwebbed window of the cellar which be set in little well below the level of the ground the cellar explain also how she have turn she flashlight off and slip through the hall and out while we search the room she have not go back i could not find she so i go on into smithtown and send a costly cable to my father he answer come to-night just before sila blackburn walk in he have talk with several of the survivor of those evil day he give I a confirmation of everything i have gather from the papers the blackburn have quarrel over a contract robert have be strike over the head he wander about the isthmus half-witted forget he name nursing one idea someone have rob he and he want he money back or a different kind of payment but he could not remember who and he take it out in angry talk then he disappear and people say he have go to spain of course he wife suspect a good deal in blackburn 's desk be pitiful and threatening letter from she which he ignore then she die and blackburn think he be safe but he take no chance some survivor of those day might turn up and try blackmail it be safer to bury himself here then bobby say marium must have bring she father with she when she come from spain last summer bring he or send for he parede answer she be make most of she money on this side you know and she be as loyal and generous as she be impulsive undoubtedly she have the doctor do what they could for she father and when she get track of sila blackburn through you bobby she nurse in the warped brain that dominant idea with she own latin desire for justice and payment then graham say that be what sila blackburn be afraid of instead of bobby as he try to convince we to-night to cover himself one minute mr parede robinson break in why do you maintain this extraordinary secrecy nobody would have hurt you if you have put we on the right track and ask for a little help why do you throw sand in we eye why do you talk all the time about ghost i have to go on tiptoe parede smile i suspect there be at least one spy in the house so i give the doctor 's ghost talk all the impetus i could i be like howell as i have tell you in believe the case could not be complete without the discovery of the secret entrance of the room of death my belief in the existence of such a thing make I lean from the first to sila blackburn rather than robert it be a tradition in many family to hand such thing down to the head of each generation sila blackburn be the one most likely to know such a secret door have never be mention to you have it bobby bobby shake he head parede turn and smile at the haggard butler i be right so far be i not jenkin jenkin bob he head jerkily then parede go on you might answer one or two question when do the first letter that frighten you master come the day he go to smithtown and talk to the detective the butler quaver you can understand he reflection parede muse money be he god he distrust and hate he own flesh and blood because he think they covet it he be prepare to punish they by leave it to a public charity now arise this apparition from the past with no claim in a court of law with a intention simply to ask and in case of a refusal to punish the conclusion reach by that selfish and merciless mind be inevitable he probably know nothing whatever about marium if all the world think he brother dead he brother 's murder now would not alter anything i 'll wager doctor that at that time he talk over wound at the base of the brain with you the doctor move restlessly yes but he be very superstitious we talk about it in connection with he ancestor who have die of such wound in that room everything be ready when he make the rendezvous here parede go on he expect to have bobby at hand in case he plan fail and he have to defend himself but marium have make sure that there should be no help for he when the man come do you take he upstairs jenkin no sir i watch that miss katherine do not leave the library but i think she must have catch mr sila in the upper hall after he have pretend to give up and have persuade he brother to spend the night parede smile whimsically he take two fade photograph from he pocket they be of young man after the fashion of blackburn remarkably alike even without the gray obliterate mark of old age i find these in the family album he say we should have know the difference just the same the doctor grumble why do not we know the difference i have complain often enough parede smile of the necessity of use candle in this house there be never more than one candle in the old bedroom there be only two when we look at the murder man in he coffin and in death there be no familiar facial expression no eccentricity of speech so you can imagine my feeling when i try to picture the drama that have go on in that room you can imagine poor marium 's which one and marium do not know about the panel or the use of miss katherine 's hat-pin or the handkerchief all of those detail indicate sila blackburn how could my handkerchief indicate anything of the kind bobby ask how do it come there what parede say be the commonest form of borrowing in the world particularly in a climate where people have frequent cold i find a number of you handkerchief in you grandfather 's bureau the handkerchief furnish I with a important clue it explain i think jenkin will tell you the moving of the body it be obviously the cause of howell 's death yes sir jenkins quaver mr sila think he have drop he own handkerchief in the room with the body i do not know how you have find these thing out by add two and two parede laugh in the first place you must all realize that we might have have no mystery at all if it have not be for miss katherine for i do not know that marium could have do much in a legal way sila blackburn have intend to dispose of the body immediately but miss katherine hear the panel move and run to the corridor she make jenkin break down the door and she send for the police sila blackburn be helpless he be beat at that moment but he do the best he could he go to water hope at the worst to establish a alibi through the book-worm who probably would not remember the exact hour of he arrival water 's house offer he too a strategic advantage you hear he say the spare room be on the ground floor you hear he add that he refuse to open he door either ask to be leave alone or fail to answer at all and he have to return to the cedar the next day for he miss he handkerchief and he picture himself since he think it be he own in the electric chair i be right jenkin yes sir i keep he hide and give he he chance along in the afternoon he want I to try to find the handkerchief but i do not have the courage he could not find it he search through the panel all about the body and the bed that be when katherine hear bobby say when we find the body have be move it put he in a dreadful way jenkin mumble for no one have bother to tell I it be young mr robert the detective suspect and when mr sila hear the detective boast that he know everything and would make a arrest in the morning he think about the handkerchief and know he be do for unless he take howell up and the man do ask for trouble sir well mr sila give it to he to save himself i have never be able to understand parede say why he do not take the evidence when he kill howell do not you know you prevent that sir jenkin ask i hear you come in from the court i think you would be listen i signalled mr sila there be danger and to get out of the private stairway before you could trap he and i could not give he another chance for a long time some of you be in the room after that or miss katherine and mr graham be sit in the corridor watch the body until just before mr robert try to get the evidence for himself mr sila have to act then it be he last chance for he think mr robert would be glad enough to turn he over to the law why do you ever hide that stuff in miss katherine 's room bobby ask jenkin fling up he hand oh he be angry sir when he know the truth and learn what a mistake he have make howell do not give I that report i show you it be in he pocket with the other thing we get it open without tear the envelope and mr sila read it he would not destroy anything he never dream of anybody 's suspect miss katherine so he tell I to hide the thing in she bureau i think he figure on use the evidence to put the blame on mr robert in case it be the only way to save himself why do you show the report to I bobby ask i -- i be afraid to take all that responsibility the butler quaver i figure if you be partly to blame it might go easier with I parede shrug he shoulder you be a good mate for sila blackburn he sneer even now i do not see how that old scoundrel have the courage to show himself to-night rawlin say that be the beautiful justice of the whole thing parede answer for there be nothing else whatever for he to do there never have be anything else for he to do since miss katherine have spoil he scheme since you all believe that it be he who have be murder he have to hide the truth or face the electric chair if he disappear he be infinitely worse off than though he have settle with he brother -- a man without a home without a name without a penny jenkin nod he have to come back he say slowly and he know how scared you be of the old room the funeral and the snow parede say give he he chance jenkin will doubtless tell you how they uncover the grave late this afternoon take that poor devil 's body and throw it in the lake then fasten the coffin and cover it again of course the snow efface every one of they track he come in naturally scare to death and tell we that story base on the legend of the cedar and the doctor 's supernatural theory and you must admit that he might as you call it have get away with it he do create a mystification the body of the murder man have disappear there be no murder blackburn as far as you could tell heaven know how long you might have struggle with the case of howell he glance up here be miss katherine she stand at the head of the stair i think she be all right she say to the doctor she be asleep she go to sleep cry may i come down the doctor nod she walk down glance from one to the other questioningly poor marium parede muse she be the one i pity most she be be at time i think what rawlin suspect -- a insane woman wander and cry through the wood assuredly she be out of she head to-night when i find she finally at the grave i try to tell she that she father be dead i begged she to come in i tell she we be friend but she fight she would not answer my question she strike I finally when i try to force she to come out of the storm robinson i want you to listen to I for a moment i honestly believe for everybody 's sake i do a good thing when i ask sila blackburn just before he disappear why he have throw he brother 's body in the lake i would hope it would simply make he run for it i pray that we would never hear from he again and that miss katherine and bobby could be spare the ugly scandal do not this do as well can not we get along without much publicity you have about earn the right to dictate robinson say gruffly thanks for everybody 's sake bobby echo you be right carlo marium must be consider now she shall have what be take from she father with interest i know katherine will agree katherine nod i doubt if marium will want it or take it parede say simply she have plenty of she own it be not fair to think it be greed that urge she you must understand that it be a bigger impulse than greed it be a thing of which we of spanish blood be rather proud -- a desire for justice for something that have no softer name than revenge suddenly rawlin stooped and take the panamanian 's hand say we have be give you the raw end of a lot of snap judgment we have never get acquaint until to-night glad to meet you too robinson grin rawlin pat the panamanian 's shoulder at that you would make a first-class detective parede yawn i disagree with you thoroughly i have no equipment beyond my eye and my common sense he yawn again he arrange the card table in front of the fire he get the card and pile they in neat pack on the green cloth he place a box of cigarette convenient to he right hand he smoke i be very sleepy but i have be so stupid over this solitaire since i have be at the cedar that i must solve it in the interest of my self-respect before i go to bed bobby go to he impulsively i be ashamed carlo i do not know what to say how can i say anything how can i begin to thank you if you ever tell I i save you life parede yawn i shall have to disappear because then you would have a claim on I katherine touch he hand there be tear in she eye it be not necessary for she to speak parede indicate two chair if you be not too tired sit here and help I for a while perhaps between we we 'll get somewhere i wonder why i have be so stupid with the thing after a time as he manipulate the card he laugh lightly the same thing -- the thing i have be scold you all for with a perfectly simple play stare I in the face i nearly make the mistake of choose a difficult one that would have get I in trouble while the simple one give I the game why be people like that as he move the card with a deft assurance to they desire combination he smile drolly at graham rawlin and robinson i guess it must be human nature do not you think so mr district attorney \* \* \* \* \* the condition parede have more than once foresee be about to shroud the cedar in loneliness and abandonment after the hasty double burial in the old graveyard the few thing bobby and katherine want from the house have be pack and take to the station at katherine 's suggestion they have decide to leave last of all and to walk parede with a tender solicitude have help marium to the wait automobile he come back try to color he good-bye with cheerfulness after all you may open the place again and let I visit you you will visit we perpetually bobby say while katherine press the panamanian 's hand but never here again we will leave it to its ghost as you have often prophesied i be not sure parede say thoughtfully that the ghost be not here it be evident that graham wish to speak to bobby and katherine alone so the panamanian stroll back to the automobile graham 's embarrassment make they all uncomfortable you have not say much to I katherine he begin be it because i practically lie to bobby try to keep you apart she try to smile i too must ask forgiveness i should not have speak to you as i do the other night in the hall but i think because you see bobby and i have come together that you have spy on I have deliberately trick I know the evidence be in my room of course you do try to help bobby yes he say and i try to help you that night i be sure you be innocent i believe the best way to prove it to they be to let they search the two of you have nothing worse than jealousy to reproach I with in a sense it please bobby that graham who have always make he feel unworthy in katherine 's presence should confess himself not beyond reproach come hartley he cry i be begin to think you be perfect we 'll get along all the better the three of we for have have it out graham murmur he thanks he join parede and marium in the automobile as they drive off parede turn he face as he wave a languid farewell be quite without expression bobby and katherine be leave alone to the thicket and the old house after a time they walk through the court and from the shadow of the time-stained melancholy wall at the curve of the driveway they pause and look back the shroud of loneliness and abandonment descend upon the cedar become for they nearly ponderable so they turn from that brooding picture and hand in hand walk out of the forest into the friendly and welcome sunlight the end end of the project
