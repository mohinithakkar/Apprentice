aspiration of the world he rise victor who be triumphant in some great experience of the race the first energy be combative : the warrior be the primitive hero there be nature to whom mere combat be a joy strife be the atmosphere in which they find they finest physical and spiritual development in the early time there must have be those who stand apart from they tribesman in contest of pure athletic skill -- in run jump leap wrestling in lay on thew and thigh with arm hand and curl fist in sheer delight of action and of the display of strength as foe arise these athlete of the tribe or

they freedom and strength such man do not ask a life of ease like tortulf the forester they learn how to strike the foe to sleep on the bare ground to bear hunger and toil summer 's heat and winter 's frost -- how to fear nothing but ill-fame they court danger and ask only to stand as victor at the last hence we read of old-world warrior -- of gog and magog and the king of bashan of the son of anak of hercule with he lion-skin and club of beówulf who drag the sea-monster from she lair plunge beneath the drift of sea-foam and the flame of dragon-breath and meet the clutch of dragon-tooth we read

the soul of man the world have come into other and greater battle-day this be a era of great spiritual conflict and of great triumph to-day faith call the soul of man to arm it be a clarion to awake to put on strength and to go forth to holy war if there be no fighting work in the christian life much of the intense energy and interest of the race would be unaroused there be apathetic nature who do not want to undertake the difficult -- sluggish soul who would rather not stir from they present position and there be coward who run to cover but there be in all strong nature the primitive combative instinct -- the let-us-see-which-is-the-stronger which delight in contest which be undismay by opposition and which grow firmer through the warfare of the soul it be this phase of the christian life which be most need to-day -- the warrior-spirit the all-conquering soul in enter the christian life one must put out of he heart the expectation that it be to be a easy life or one remove from toil and danger it be preëminently the adventurous life of the world -- that in which the most happen as well as that in which the spiritual possibility be the greatest it be a life full of splendor of excitement of trial of test of courage and endurance and be mean to appeal to those who be the very bravest and the best there be two form of conquest to which the soul of man be call -- the inner and the outer the inner be the conquest of the evil within he own nature the outer be the struggle against the evil force of the world -- the constructive task of build up under war condition the spiritual kingdom of god the real world be far more subtle than we as yet understand when we dive down into the deep sky and air and house disappear we enter a new world -- the under-world of water and thing that glide and swim of sea-grass and current of flow wave that lap about the body with a cool chill of palpitating color that at great depths become a sort of darkness of sea-bed of shell and sand and bit of scatter wreckage of ooze and tangled sea-plant dusky shape and fan-like fin or if we look upward we reach a over-world where moon and sun be circle in the height what draw they together what keep a subtle distance between they which they never cross how do they age after age run a predestined course we drop a stone what bind it earthward under we foot run magnetic current that flow from pole to pole in the cloud above there be electric vibration which can not be describe in exact term thus also in spiritual experience there be current which we can not measure or describe the psychic world be the final world though its tower and pinnacle no eye have see if we try to shut out for a hour the outer world and descend into the soul-world of the life of man we find ourselves in a new environment and with a outlook over new form and power we find ourselves in a world of image and attraction of impulse and desire of instinct and attainment it be not only a world of separate and individual soul but each soul be as a thousand for within each man there be a inner host contend for mastery and everywhere be the uproar of battle and of spiritual strife what be the self that abide in each man be it not the consciousness of existence together with a consciousness of the power of choice we individuality lie in the fact that we can decide choose and rule among the various contestant impulse of we soul herein be the possibility of victory and also the possibility of defeat look inward we find that self begin when man begin we inherit we disposition from adam as well as from we parent and a long ancestral line when the first man and woman be create force be set in action which have result in this I that to-day think and will and love heredity include savagery and culture health and disease empire and serfdom hope and despair each man can say : in I rise impulse that run riot in the vein of anak that belong to libyan slave and to the ptolemaic line i be aryan and semite roman and teuton : alike i have know the galley and the palm-set court of king under a thousand shift generation there be rise the combination that i to-day be in I culminate for my life 's day human history until now individuality be thus a unique selection and arrangement of what have be touch with something -- a degree of life -- that have not be before to rise above heredity be to rise above the downward drag of all the year it be not escape the special sin of one ancestor but the sin of all ancestor _ this be the first problem that be set before each man : to rise above he race -- to be the culmination of virtue until now _ _ the second problem be not greater but different it be to mould environment to spiritual use _ the condition of this struggle and the opportunity of this conquest be the content of this book it be mean to deal with the more heroic aspect of the christian life what be environment be it the material horizon that bound we if so where do it end we first environment be a crib a room we mother 's eye sensation of hunger heat and motion beat upon the baby-brain there be a vague murmur of sound in the baby-ears yet it be this babe who in after day have all the universe for he soul 's demesne he environment stretch out to town and river shore and sea look upward into space he can view a star whose distance be a thousand time ten thousand mile beyond the path of he foot or of he sight there be the path of thought which lead he into new country new clime new year he meditation be upon age go he work compete with that of the dead in he reverie and imagining he can transport himself anywhither and can commune with any friend or god hence to be master of one 's environment be really to have the universe within one 's grasp we be too much afraid of custom and tradition we be put into we time not that the time may mould we but that we may mould the time way custom they exist to be change the _ tempora _ and the _ mores _ should be plastic to we touch the time be never level with we best we soul be higher than the _ zeitgeist _ why should we cringe before a inferior essence or command but society seal we lip : we walk about with frozen tongue each ask himself at some time : how shall i become one of the victor of the race be it in I mankind be weight by every previous sin where be i free how be i free can i do as i choose or be there bourn of conduct beyond which i can never go be i foreordain to sin do the star in they course lay limitation on free will there be in man two force work : a human longing after god and in response god inly work in the soul the victor be he who in he own life unite these two thing : a great longing after the god-like which make he yearn for virtue -- and the divine power within he through which and by which he be triumphant over time and death and sin whatever we trial sorrow or temptation joy and courage be ever mean to be in the ascendant life however it may break in storm upon we be not mean to beat down we soul unless we be triumphant we be not wholly useful or well train will and heart together work for victory as there flash and thrill through all nature a subtle electric vibration which be the supreme form of physical energy so there run through the history of mankind a current of spiritual inspiration and power to possess this magnetism of soul this heroism of life this flame-like flower of character be to be victor in the great combat of the race it be the spirit of courage energy and love nothing be too hard for it nothing too distasteful nothing too insignificant through all the course of duty it spur one to do one 's best its essence be to overcome this be the indwelling holy spirit wherein be freedom power and rest to its final triumph all thing be accessory to joy all power converge ii prelude : the call of jesus -lrb- vox dilectus -rrb- _ i hear the voice of jesus say come unto I and rest lay down thou weary one lay down thy head upon my breast i come to jesus as i be weary and worn and sad i find in he a resting-place and he have make I glad _ _ i hear the voice of jesus say behold i freely give the living water thirsty one stoop down and drink and live i come to jesus and i drink of that life-giving stream my thirst be quench my soul revive and now i live in he _ _ i hear the voice of jesus say i be this dark world 's light look unto I thy morn shall rise and all thy day be bright i look to jesus and i find in he my star my sun and in that light of life i 'll walk till travel day be do _ horatius bonar it be a world of voice in which we live we be daily visit by appeal which be minister to we growth and progress or which be tend to we spiritual downfall there be the voice of nature in sky and sea and storm the voice of childhood and of early youth the voice of playfellow and companion -- voice long still it may be in death the voice of lover and beloved the voice of ambition of sorrow of aspiration and of joy but among all these many voice there be one which be most inspiring and supreme when the _ vorspiel _ to _ parsifal _ break upon the ear it be as if all other music be inadequate and incomplete -- as if a voice call from the confines of eternity in the infinite space where no time be and roll onward to the far-off age when time shall be no more even so high and clear above the voice of the world deeper and tenderer than any other word or tone come the voice of jesus to the soul of man look if you will upon the world of soul many-tiered and vast stretch from day 's end to day 's end -- a world of hunger and of anger of toiling and of strive of clamor and of triumph -- a dim upheave mass which from century to century wake and breathe and sleep again year roll on tide flow but there be no cessation of the march of year and no whisper of a natural change be it not a strange thing that one voice and only one should have really win the hearing of the race what be this voice of jesus so enduring matchless and supreme what do it promise for the help or hope of man there be some who say that jesus have hold the attention and allegiance of the race by a appeal to the religious instinct that all man naturally seek god and long to know he but if we try to define the religious instinct we shall find it a hard task what might be call a religious instinct lead to human sacrifice upon the aztec altar direct the hindu to cast the new-born child in the stream the friend to sacrifice he best friend to a pagan deity there be other who say that christ appeal to the gentler instinct of man -- to he unselfishness he meekness and compassion yet some of the most admirable christian have be ambitious and aggressive other say he appeal to we need of help but self-reliance be a christian trait other say he appeal to we sense of sin -- we need of pardon but many a christian go through life like a happy child scarcely conscious at any time of deep guilt and never overwhelm by intense conviction or despair the truth seem to be that christ appeal to we whole self he call we by a attraction which be unique in the universe there exist a force which we must recognize -- though we do not yet in the least understand it -- which be gradually draw the race christward the law of spiritual gravitation be that by all the change impulse of we nature we be draw upward unto he spohr 's lovely anthem voice this cry of the soul : _ as pants the hart for cool stream when heat in the chase so long my soul o god for thee and thy refreshing grace for thee my god the living god my thirsty soul doth pine oh when shall i behold thy face thou majesty divine _ 1 jesus call we by the mystery of life there be hour of silence and meditation when the great thought _ i be _ beat in upon the soul but what be i whence come i a heap of atom in some strange human semblance -- be that all and so many other heap of atom have already be and pass away blow hither and thither -- where the universe reel with change star-dust and earth-dust be alike in ceaseless whirl little it profit to build the spire the sea-wall the dome the bridge the myriad-roofed town a new era shall dawn upon they and they shall fall away not only that but each man who live to-day have less possible material dominion than he have who precede he only so many square foot of earth and now there be more to walk upon they the ground we tread be once trodden by the foot of those long dead i be take up they room and in due time i must myself depart that there may be footway for those who be to come after I only the under-sod be really mine -- the little earth-barrow to which i go there be no question more baffling than this simple ever-recurring one : what be i if i should decide what i be to-day i discover that yesterday i be quite a different person to-day i may be six foot in height and climb the alp yesterday i lay helpless in swaddle clothes yesterday i be a thing of laughter and frolic to-day i be grave and brush away tear as a babe be i still i what be myself when do i come to myself how far can i extend myself my foot be here but in a moment my spirit can flee to xanadu and zanzibar there be no spot in the universe where i may not go where then be the limit of myself personality be never for a single moment fix : it be as change and evanescent as a cloud we be whirlwind spirit sweep through time and space bearing within we soul hope fear joy sorrow which be never twice the same every aspect of the universe leave new impression on we and we will in they world-sweep daily desire different thing incompleteness lie on life -- restlessness be in the heart true love have no final habitation on earth there be no abiding-place for we deepest affection we most tender yearning it be curious how deeply one may love and yet feel that there be something more in all we journey skyward and sunward we never reach the end of all over against this vague and change self there stand out the figure of the changeless christ the same yesterday to-day and forever in he we find the environment of all we life and the sum of all we dream 2 jesus call we by we earth-born care in mendelssohn 's _ elijah _ there be a voice which sing : o rest in the lord this angel 's message be the voice of jesus to the human race the voice of jesus call we to awake to toil we sometimes forget this and imagine that if we follow jesus we shall never have anything to do christ do not still the machinery of the world nor shut the mine nor take away the sowing and the reap the call of jesus be not a call to rest from work but to rest in work the rest we receive be that of sympathy of inspiration of efficiency christ really increase the toil-capacity of man man can do more work harder work and always better work because of the faith that be in he what make the confusion and fatigue of life be that man be everywhere scramble for themselves and try to manage they own undertaking instead of fall into harmony with god and through he with all that be what wear the soul out be not the work of life itself -- it be its drudgery its monotony its blind vagueness its apparent purposelessness we do not wish to scatter we life and spend we year in nothingness christ come into the world and say : over-fatigue be abnormal there be not enough work in the universe to tire every one all out there be just enough for each one to do happily and to do well i be come as the great industrial organizer my mission be not to take away toil but to redistribute it my industrial plan be the largest of history -- it be also the most simple i look down over the world as a master upon he man my work be not to find a earthly kingdom as some have think it be not primarily to set up industrial establishment or syndicate or way of transport and trade my work be to build up in the universe a spiritual kingdom of energy power and progress to this kingdom all material thing be accessory in my hand be all ability as well as all knowledge not a sparrow fall to the ground without my notice not a lily bloom without my delight not a brick be lay not a stone be set not a axe be swing except beneath my eye i provide for my own to each man i assign he work he task if he take upon he only what i give he to do he will never be under-paid or over-tired hence the first step towards a industrial millennium be to arise and do what jesus bid heaven be heaven because no one be unruly there or idle or lazy or vicious or morose each soul be at true and happy work each energy be absorb each hour be alive with interest and there be no oppressive thought or way if each heart and soul respond to the call of jesus there would be a new heaven and a new earth -- a utopia such as more never dream of nor plato nor bellamy nor campanellum in he _ city of the sun _ each hand would be at its own work each eye would be upon its own task each foot would be in the right path all the fear the weariness the squalor and the unrest of life would be do away the life of each man would be a life of contentment and of economic advance 3 jesus call we by the scourging of we sin flagellation be not of the body -- it be of the soul remorse be as a scorpion-whip and memory beat we with many stripe the first sin that beset we be forgetfulness of god apathy creep over the spirit and sloth wind itself about we deed nothing be more pathetic than the decline of the merely forgetful soul be sleepless in the thing of the spirit say pythagora for sleep in they be akin to death sin lift bar against success : the root of failure lie in irreligion pride conceit disobedience malice evil-speaking covetousness idolatry vice oppression injustice and lack of truth and honor fight more strongly against one 's career than any other foe no sin be without its lash no experience of evil but have its rebound to expect a higher moral insight in middle age because of a larger experience of sin in youth be as reasonable as to look for sanity of judgment in middle age because in youth a man have fit look at ourselves in a mirror do we not sometimes think how we would fashion ourselves if we could create a new self in the image of some ideal which be before we would we not make ourselves wholly beautiful if we could make ourselves even so look out upon we own spirit do we not some day rouse to the distortion and deformity of sin do we wish to retain these grimace phase of ourselves do we not yearn eagerly for the dignity and beauty of high virtue do we not long for the grace and perfection which make up a radiant and happy life if we could be bear again would we not be bear a more spiritual be it be to this new birth that jesus call we soul all around the babe hide in its mother 's womb there lie a world of which it have neither sight nor knowledge the fact that the babe be ignorant do not change the fact that the world be there so about we soul there lie the invisible world of god which until bear of the spirit we do not see or understand it be a world in which god be everywhere in which there be no first cause except god in which there be no will except the will of god in which there be no true and perfect love except from god no truth except reveal by god no power except from he conversion be the outlook over a world which be arrange not for we own glory but for the good of god 's creature in which what we do be necessary fundamental permanent -- not because we ourselves have do it well nor in truth because we have do it at all -- but because what we have do be a part of the universe which god be build we change from a self-centre to a god-centre from the thought of whether the world applaud to whether god approve from the thought of keep we own life to the thought of preserve we own integrity from isolation from all other soul to a sympathy with they a understanding of they need and a desire to help they life it be a turn from a delight in sin or a indifference to sin or merely a moral aversion to it to a deep-rooted hatred of every thought and act of sin to penitence and to a earnest desire to pattern after god 4 jesus call we by we sorrow jesus call we by we dream he thrill we by each high aim that life inspire he voice be one of understanding of tenderness of human appeal how could we love jesus if he do not sympathize with we ideal but here be a divine one in whose sight we be not visionary who lovingly guard we least hope who welcome we faintest spiritual insight who take a interest in we social plan and point out to we the great kingdom that be to be christ lay hold of the divine that be in we and will not let we go 5 jesus call we by we latent gift and power which of we have ever exhaust he possibility which of we be all that he might be it be a impressive thought that nothing in the universe ever get use up it change form motion semblance -- but the force the energy neither waste nor die away air -- it be as fresh as the air that blow over the pharaoh sun -- it be as undimmed as the sun that look down on the completion of cheop earth -- it be as unworn as the earth that be trodden by the caveman no generation can ever bequeath to we a single new material atom the race be ever in old clothes nor can we hand down to other one atom which be not long ere we be bear yet the vitality of the universe be be constantly increase and this increase be also permanent god have a great deal more to work with now than a thousand year ago for not all energy be material with each birth there come a new force into the world and its influence never die the body be bear of age past of the material store of century but the soul in its living think work power be a new phase of energy add to the energy of the race this fact confer on each individual man a strange impressiveness and power it give a new significance to the fact that i be i be something different from what have be or ever shall be in the great whirling myriad i be distinguish and apart i be a appreciable factor in universal development and a being of elemental power by every true thought of mine the race become wiser by every right deed its inheritance of tradition be uplift by every high affection its horizon of love be enlarged we can bequeath to other this new spiritual energy of we life this thought give we a new zest for life there be a appetite which be of the soul it be this wish for growth for the development of we power for a larger life for ourselves and for those who shall come after we be there any one who wish to stay always where he be to-day -- to be always what he be this morning beyond the hill-top lie we dream not all the voice that call man from place to place be audible one we hear whisper from a far-off leader we be beckon by a unseen guide out of ancestry tradition talent and training each depart to he own way what call be not largeness of place -- it be largeness of ideal to each of we think of this one and that one who have take a large part in the shaping of the world there come a feeling : beside all these i be in a narrow way what can i think that shall be worth the consideration of the race what can i do that shall be a stepping-stone to progress what can i hope that shall unseal other eye to the universal glory comfort other in the universal pain we say : i do not want to be mew up here while other be out where throne and empire be sweeping by i do not want to parse verb add fraction and mark ledger while other be the poet the singer the statesman the ruler and the wealth-controller of the world we wish to step out of the trivial experience into that which be significant each day bring uneasiness of soul man 's unhappiness say carlyle as i construe it come of he greatness it be because there be a infinite in he which with all he cunning he can not quite bury under the finite say tennyson : _ it be not death for which we pant but life more life and fuller that we want _ these aspiration be prophetic do a clod-hopper dream we move toward we desire the wish for growth be but the call of jesus to we soul we sometimes hear of the limitation of life what be they who set they man himself not god the call of jesus urge the soul of man to possibility which be infinite a large life be the fulfilment of god 's ideal of we life -- the life which from all eternity he have look upon as possible for we could any career be grander than the one that god have plan for we god do not think petty thought : he long for grandeur for we all 6 jesus call we by the spirit of the time there be a grow recognition of the affinity between god and the human soul religion have change in spirit as well as in form it use to be consider a tract in one 's experience and now it be perceive to be all of life -- its impetus its central move force the reason for be activity development for ethical conduct and for unselfish and joyous helpfulness religion be more and more perceive to be not a thing of feeble sentiment of restraint of exaction of meek subordination and resignation but the unfold of the free human spirit to the realization of its highest possibility and its allegiance to that which be eternal and supreme the nineteenth century close with the thinker who be also a man of meditation and devotion we offer to heaven the incense of aspiration hope research talent and imagination the chief thing toward which we be move be i believe the enthronement of the christ christ have always be in the heart of the few enthrone and enshrine even in the dark year of mediaeval superstition and unrest there be the cloistered one who maintain tradition of faith and do work of mercy as there be knightly one who uphold the ministry of chivalry and follow though afar the tender shine of the holy grail but now all the sign point to a great and general recognition of the christ -- christ to be lift high on the hand of the nation to he throne above the star a new spiritual note be to be hear in modern subject of study be noticeable in all path of intellectual prestige history be no more look upon as the story of the trophy of warrior conqueror and king history rise out of dim mist be see to be the march and the countermarching of nation in the throe of progress and of social change it be not the story of prince alone but of peasant as well the result of myriad of small obscure life of change condition of the movement of great economic psychologic and spiritual force look backward over the move processional of the nation of the earth we may see how without rest without pause through countless age the myriad legion of man have be pass across the scene of life -- pass and fading away _ all that tread the globe be but a handful of the tribe that slumber in its bosom _ empire have rise and empire have decay dynasty have be bury and long line of king wrap stately robe about they have lie down to die throne have be overturn army and navy have be muster and scatter land and sea have be people and make desolate as the thronging tribe and race have live they little life and pass away babylon and assyrium indium and arabium egypt and persium rome and greece -- each of these have have its land and conquest its song and story its war and tumult its wrath and praise under all the tide of conquest and endeavor but one fact shine supreme : the steady progress of the cross one principle of growth and development be be slowly reveal -- a approach to symmetry and civic form which be see in freedom justice popular education the rise of mass the power of public opinion and a general regard for life health peace national prosperity and the individual weal the day have pass when man merely live sleep eat fight they be now involve in a intricate and progressive civilization sociology ethic and politics be newly blaze pathway for its development its guidance and its ideal we be move on to new dream of patriotism of statesmanship and of civil rule literature instead of be consider as merely a expression of the primitive experience of a race in its saga glee ballad drama and larger work and song be more and more revealing itself as a appeal to the highest in the supreme moment of life it be the unfold panorama of the concept of the soul in regard to duty conduct love and hope literature ask : what do i live for as well as how shall i speak forth beauty how ought the soul of man to act in a emergency what be the best solution of the great human problem of duty love and fate the voice of dante milton shakespeare tennyson and browning sweep the soul upward to spiritual height and answer some of the deepest questioning of the soul of man and hence literature be no longer merely a thing of vocabulary of phrase of rhythm of assonance of alliteration or of metrical and philosophical form it be a revelation of the progress of the soul of its standard of its triumph its defeat and its desire it be the unfold of one 's intellectual helplessness before the unmoved calm passing of year of one 's emotional inadequacy without god for adjudicator it be a direct search for god one find wrap within it the mystery aspiration and spiritual passion of the soul science no longer a dry assemble of fact and figure be a increase revelation of the imagination the exactness the thoroughness and the great

longing eye be blest and the great church victorious shall be the church at rest _ samuel john stone first : reconstruction the subject that be be carefully consider by many think man and woman to-day be this : the place and prospects of the christian church all about we we hear the cry that the church be decline and may eventually pass away that it do not gain new member in proportion to its need nor hold the attention and allegiance of those already enrol be these thing true if so how may better thing be bring to pass to share in the civilization that have come from nineteen hundred year of the work of the church and to be unwilling to lift a pound 's weight of the present burden in order to pass on to other we precious heritage be certainly a selfish and unworthy course it be better to ask what be my work in the upbuilding of the church what can i do to further the royal progress of the church of god the root-failure of the organize church to-day be its failure to share in the grow life of the world a grow life be one that be full of new idea new experience new emotion a new outlook over life -- that work in new way and that be full of seething and tumultuous energy enthusiasm and hope if we look out over the college business enterprise periodical agriculture manufacturing and shipping of the world we find everywhere one story -- growth impetus courage resource vigorous and bound life beside these thing the average church service to-day be both stupid and poky the force of religion be neither guide nor wield well there be in most church however we may dislike to own the fact a decrease of interest and proportionate membership a wane prestige a general air of discouragement and a tale of baffled effort and of disappointed hope the church -- and by this word i here mean the organize body of both clergyman and layman -- be mean to be the supreme spiritual leader of the world it be mean to possess vigor decision insight hope and intellectual power but before it can accomplish its high and holy work a great reconstruction must begin to help in this reconstruction to aid in vivify coördinating and rule the varied process of organize religion be you work and mine 1 the church must rouse to a sense of its noble duty and exalted power we underrate the church we be look elsewhere for we highest ideal instead of claim from the church that spiritual guidance and inspiration which should be its right to give one of the thing that be a monumental astonishment to I be that when we need supplication intercession prayer for the avert of great personal or national calamity we flee to the church but we seldom think of the church when we need brain the church should lead and not follow the great dream of the world in the midst of we new national life we be send all over the country for the best-trained help and think in every department of government influence and control we problem of the day be preëminently spiritual one colonial control be not a question of material ascendancy -- it be a rule over the mind heart and ideal of man its moral significance be patent we be call upon not only to import provision clothing and household and industrial goods into we new possession we be call upon to develop a higher sense of honor truth honesty and every-day morality scholar working-men business man farmer and merchant be be consult in regard to different phase of we national advance and every idea which they insight and experience furnish be seize upon but who be consult the church in these concern except in reference to mere technical point who be look to the intellectual moral and spiritual standard of the church for guidance we be to-day rule spiritually as well as intellectually by layman and in a way which be quite outside the organize work of the church 2 the church need a more business-like organization and way of work it need a more military spirit and discipline the church be diffuse and loosely string there be in the united state alone about two hundred and fifty-six kind of religious body there be no centralized interest or work there be no economic adjustment of fund there be no internal agreement as to practical method the result be a most wasteful expenditure of force movement be not only duplicated but reproduce a hundred time in miniature in one denomination after another special talent be restricted to a narrow field building and church-plant be multiply but lie largely disused sect and community be at loggerheads on unessential point all this -- and the world be not be save the church fail to see opening for aggressive work it fail to seize strategic point it do not carry a well-knit local organization with a husbanding of economic force it do not front the world in dead-earnest it be not proud and honorable in meet its local debt it lose progressive force from lack of knowledge as to how to judge man and train they and set they to work it also lack greatly in office-force and in supplies the gospel itself be without price but in the nature of thing it can not be proclaim nor church-work efficiently carry on without financial outlay there should be a more adequate equipment for this work all other enterprise need without question stationery stenographer literature for distribution office-room office-hours and a general arrangement look toward enlargement and progress a busy pastor should have a office-equipment just as much as a business man and it should be support as a business office be out of the fund of the business organization _ ie _ the local church there should be first of all a unite spirit and a general reorganization throughout the whole of evangelical christendom not necessarily destroy denominational line with a view to quick mobilization of energy in any direction most need what would a general do who in look over he troops should find two hundred and fifty-six provincial army not at ease or at peace with each other and yet expect to make war upon a common foe shall we not endeavor to share in some broadly plan magnificently execute scheme of world-advance the church have reach a point where a vast constructive work be to be do its scattered part must be knit into a powerful and aggressive whole to turn a solid front upon the evil of the world the time be ripe for a successor of peter the hermit of luther knox calvin zwinglus savonarola whitefield finney moody whether a great preacher theologian or evangelist he will certainly be a business man a man of vast energy and executive capacity who shall perform this miracle of organization of which many dream and who shall set the progress of the church for a full century to come this unite spirit should prevail not only through the smaller body but between the roman catholic and protestant communion there have be a distinct division between these two body much mutual suspicion jealousy and antagonism : it be only quite lately that protestant and catholic leader have be willing to work amicably together for great common cause a new situation have arise in we new possession we be confront with a large population who whatever may be the reason be unquestionably not as a whole progressive enlighten educate or highly moral the problem now be not for catholic and protestant to waste energy and spiritual strength in contend for mastery over each other but for they to unite in change and better the condition of we island people what be past be past we present duty be to bring peace industry intelligence high ideal and spiritual living to we new countryman this be a work to fill the hand and heart of both church and perhaps in a common task each may learn to understand and regard the other as those should understand and regard each other who have one lord one hope one heaven 3 the church need stronger and more gifted leader in every business or intellectual enterprise to-day there be a effort to place at the head of each organization the most powerful and resourceful man whose service can be obtain nothing in this age work or be expect to work without the leadership of brain a primary step in a far-reaching ecclesiastical policy be to endeavor to draw into both ministry and membership the most active and intellectual class all earnest soul can work but not all can work equally effectively particularly in the ministry north south east and west man be need who be really _ man _ this do not necessarily mean the man with the longest string of academic degree the man who can write the best poem or make the best speech on public occasion it mean the think man who be brave talented spiritual and warm-hearted in the report of one of the missionary board i have recently read the follow stir word they refer to the work of missionary in the far north one of whom have lately travel a thousand mile over the snow in a dog-sled : he who follow that mining crowd must be more than the minister who would do well for town in the west or elsewhere in alaska he must be a man who when night overtake he will be thankful if he can find a bunk and a plate in a miner 's cabin he must travel much and therefore can not be cumber with extra trappings -- must dress as the miner do and accept they food and fare he must be no less in earnest in he search for soul than they in search for gold he must be so ` furnish ' that without recourse to book or study-table he can minister acceptably to man who under the guise of a miner 's garb hide the social and mental culture of life in eastern college and professional day it be far from that land of frost and snow to the beautiful island of porto rico wash by tropical sea through the street of whose capital there pass every day the carriage of the governor with its white-covered upholstery and its livery of white but i add this word : the missionary send to porto rico be he catholic or protestant must be a man who can stand among statesman and society man and woman as well as one who can live and work among the humblest folk who lodge in leaf-thatched hut along the roadside or far on lonely hill representative man of ability health culture and courage be be choose to carry on governmental work : it be idle to send provincial man to the church what be locally true of the church in porto rico be fundamentally true all over the world at home and abroad each ministerial post to-day require a imperial man not every post require the same sort of man either in regard to general heredity or education man be need of the peter-type of the john-type of the paul-type it suffice that they be man of unusual power and well fit to they individual work 4 the church need a better system for the proper placing of man no phase of the world 's work can be carry on merely and simply because a man be pious in every phase of life there be a constant shift of man accord to temperament ability and general influence and power in the church we must have a quick and decisive recognition of a man 's ability and he must be set where that talent can work easily and effectively church be not all alike there be no two alike when we think of it what a ghoulish business candidating be no scheme for the right placing of man can be devise which do not place a great deal of power in the hand of a few lead man this power may be abused but ought not to be if it be really look upon as under divine direction and inspiration can not a great leader be inspire to the choice of a man as well as a great author to the choice of a word a rhyme comparatively few man thoroughly understand how to rate other man and to these few man as in all other great enterprise must be give the power and authority to select and adjust by this i do not mean that a set of ecclesiastic will alone be adequate ecclesiastical vision like all other highly specialize vision be partial and do not always see quite straight there should also be call into play the business ability and discernment of man of large business interest or administrative gift sooner or later the various religious organization will have to meet in some better way than any thus far formulate this grow need 5 we need a release of pressure on the abler man many a minister to-day be a sort of community lackey what other man be frankly too busy to do he be suppose to be cheerfully ready to do the list of odd job which fall to he lot would be ridiculous be not they influence upon he life and work so retrogressive and so sad he live to serve other but this vow of service be greatly impose upon if he be to lead in intellectual and spiritual matter he must be give fewer errand to run the financial burden of he church must be take absolutely from he shoulder he must have a suitable salary and he time must be at least as carefully guard as that of the average man some call he be bind to obey at whatever cost of time or strength -- illness certain public duty and real spiritual need -- but he life must not be at the mercy of crank or of idle person ' whim 6 we need a reorganization of preach tradition it be a tradition that a minister must in general preach two set sermon every week give one informal week-day lecture and be prepare to deliver at any moment funeral address anniversary speech remark or to perform other utterly impossible intellectual feat anyone who write or who speak in public know that the preparation of a half-hour address which be worth anything require a great deal of time it can not ordinarily be toss off and help man 's soul only a occasional inspiration the result of a lifetime of thought and experience be bear in this sudden way usually excellence be the result of long and careful labor the way to help this would seem to be a constant interchange of preacher not only in one denomination but among the various denomination so that a really fine sermon would be hear by many people and fewer sermon would require to be write this be easily do in a large city or its vicinity what congregation need most be not altogether formal sermon but thoughtful helpful talk contain a fresh uplifting and spiritual outlook over life with a practical bearing on the occasion and duty of life the work of both frederick robertson and horace bushnell have this direct and vital tone minister must study more if they be free from many task now put upon they it be not unreasonable to ask that this time be put on more careful thinking too many a minister of to-day be intellectually something of a flibbertigibbet he sermon do not take hold because they have not the root to take hold with how many minister possess for instance a scholarly knowledge of human nature or of the deeper aspect of redemption yet these thing he ought to know there be a large amount of intensely interesting though spiritually undigested material for a minister in a book like william jame 's _ variety of religious experience _ 7 greater care must be take of the rural church any one interested in a great ecclesiastical polity must surely recognize the ultimate possibility of we rural region here be grow up the lead man and woman of to-morrow ideal and inspiration set upon they heart will bear fruit a thousand-fold hence there should be a definite arrangement by which a certain portion of the preach time of the really able preacher shall be place each year in some small and remote place several scattered country church might unite for these service let such a man also make helpful suggestion for neighborhood social and intellectual life while he be in the village let the country pastor go to town browse in library art-collection hear music and get a general quickening of interest and inspiration let each compare note with the other they will both gain by this interchange 8 there be too little recognition of individual talent in the church too few worker be set at work which they know how to do and the untaught rush at task which angel fear to touch we have myriad of sabbath-school teacher but how many man or woman really know how to teach a little child the man be ask to speak or pray in prayer-meeting who can not possibly do it well but no notice be take of the fact that he thoroughly understand public account a man be ask to subscribe ten dollar to a church affair who can not afford it but he spiritual insight might save the impending church quarrel people come and go in the church and many i be convinced drift away because they be never ask for anything but money for the support and interest of the church in no other sort of organization be this true even in the summer camp or mountain hotel or atlantic liner when any pastime or entertainment be suggest the first thing to discover be what can each one _ do _ one who have the gift of organization and management get it up one sing one read or recite one write a bright bit of verse another smooth out rise jealousy or bridge by a little tact the abyss of caste why do we hide so many pretty talent under a bushel when the church-door swing behind we why do we substitute such strange and foolish task particularly for woman what would lead lawyer and doctor do i wonder if they be ask as busy woman often have be to spend a precious morning in a church-room sort cast-off clothes in every church large or small there be both man and woman who be talent in a special way who could bring gift of training and experience to bear upon the problem and opportunity of the church tell I in prayer or speech-making formal or social occasion pastor or people do we often bring we very deepest tenderest most inspiring emotional or intellectual life it be not a whit more spiritual to be stupid than to be bright this be what we church-meeting should be -- not a formal and very dull round of prayer and set remark more or less pointless they ought to be a yielding-up of we heart 's best life to other 9 we need as a church a deeper spiritual life we need the power of the holy ghost in spite of all the sorrow of the world sorrow both of a personal nature and that which touch whole community there be only one real burden upon the heart of earnest man and woman : it be we own inadequate representation of christianity -- the disheartening difference between what we practice and what we profess when the church of god be in reality a powerful and hard-working body of sincere honest and loving people the world will soon be save second : adherence by the question why join the church -- i do not mean alone why add my name to a church-roll i mean why give myself my power my education my love my loyalty to advance the progress of the church there be nothing we resent more than a waste of ourselves to attract we service there must be in the church a inner vitality a move and spiritual fire 1 the church embody the spiritual dream of the world man do not live by bread alone he live by imagination and by religious power in the church of god the spiritual imagination of man reach its highest field of energy and have bring forth its most triumphant work the great art of the world have centre about the christian church -- its architecture and much of its noblest speech imagine a world in which every work which be inspire by the church or by the concept of religion embody in it should be leave out what would we then lack we would lack the greatest work of michelangelo raphael titian francesca botticellus murillo we would not see the cathedral of milan strasburg or cologne we would never read the poem of caedmon milton or dante the hamlet would be without a spire philanthropy would be almost unknown there would be neither night-watch nor morning-watch of unite prayer we should have no processional of million churchward on the lord 's day no hymn to stir we soul to joy and praise no anthem or oratorio no minister no ecclesiastical court and assembly no church convention no church-school religious society nor religious press all these work and institution proclaim the glory of belief and hand down the religious tradition and the spiritual aspiration of the generation of man shall we let other share in the mystery and triumph while we stand apart silent unapproving and alone the dream of the church be high and holy there be the dream of freedom of the freedom of the soul it be a inspiring thought this the essential democracy of the race we do not find intellectual equality of soul we see each man or woman differently circumstance differently gifted differently train yet each may say i be spiritually free to I also be give the opportunity of development of majesty of character of high service the soul be the thrall of none nothing can bind it to spiritual serfdom next there be the dream of allegiance some one have well say : wouldst thou live a great life ally thyself with a great cause allegiance be devotion of the whole of ourselves to a leader a cause we can no more go through the world without ally ourselves to something than we can go through it and live nowhere if the object of we allegiance be a high one if the ideal be a grand one we life be in a constant process of development toward that height that grandeur each act of faith become a impetus to progress we be daily enrich by the experience of mere obedience to obey and follow be act in the universal process if on the other hand we ally ourselves to that which be lower than ourselves by the very act we be drag down no one can remain upon even he own level who be in obedience and devotion to that which be below he allegiance to a higher be one of the trumpet-call of the world it have be the rally of all army of all legion of all crusade the great commander be by he very position a grouper of other man the ruler of they thought they deed they dream he power to call and to sway be beyond he own idea of it how otherwise could it be that out of one century one heart call to another -- out of one age proceed the answer to the cry of age go the lover of music to-day ally himself to bach to haydn to mozart to wagner by he appreciation he sympathy he understanding of what they have do he acknowledge they control of he musical self by he effort to interpret they work to other and to create new work which shall be inspire by they ideal thus he acknowledge they control of he own power such control over the spirit of man be that of the church over the social body it stir the spiritual aspiration of man it direct he ambition it fix upon a standard the cross upon a hero the christ and reach unto all the world its arm of power draw unto itself the loyalty the faith the affection and the royal service of successive generation of mankind the dream of redemption it be not technical creed for which the church as a whole stand but for certain vital principle which concern the life of the soul and its relation to god and man virtue have always be a dream of the heart but how inaccessible be virtue with a past of unforgiven sin the height of we ideal of redemption be condition upon the depth of we realization of sin to the shallow redemption be a easy-going process a way of healing the scratch which the world make to the deep and serious-minded redemption involve the regeneration of the race only the ransom can truly work love or praise there be one sorrow which god never call we to -- the sorrow of a waste life by redemption the church reveal not only a saving from rebellion unbelief and crime but redemption from sloth from indifference from lack of purpose and from low aim redemption loom up as the great economic force of time -- that which inspire and preserve we power direct we energy create opportunity bring to pass we most high and holy desire and fill life with satisfy and abide thing beauty harmony and affection be the natural law of the moral world there be no despair where there have be no disobedience _ christus salvator _ stand out before the world in majesty and power virtue be enthrone in a universe which be beneficent the dream of fellowship the church be the great social body we can never live we best life in the world and stand outside the church there be something vital in personal contact and in social affiliation it strengthen the best and otherwise most complete work the christian church be a body of ally whose work be the upbuilding of the kingdom of god we do not realize how great a bond this be we have we own church center we own denomination we own local interest but by and by a great occasion arise -- a revival which sweep the country a reunion of two long-divided party a ecumenical council a chinese persecution -- and suddenly there arise before the mind 's eye a glimpse of that church which girdle the world whose emissary be in every country whose voice speak in every tongue we perceive that everywhere be _ swell hill and spacious plain besprent from shore to shore with steeple-tower and spire whose silent finger point to heaven _ say wordsworth also : _ they dream not of a perishable home who thus could build _ many a ideal state have be think out in which fellowship should be the root of social progress but in what state be the proffer fellowship like that of the communion of saint each have he share of work and dream each have he endowment of talent and of opportunity each have he aspiration and supreme hope the joy of one be the joy of all the sorrow of one be the sorrow of all the triumph of one be the triumph of all the world-burden be the task set to be remove the world-upbuilding in love joy peace and truth be the final endeavor this community of interest be the strongest coalition the world have yet know there be those who say i prefer to worship by myself one might as well say i prefer to fight in battle by myself there be a time for personal worship and there be a time for social worship alone the heart meet god alone its prayer for individual need and longing be offer up alone it ask for blessing on the individual life and work but the personal life be only a fragmentary part of the life universal above the age ring a over-song of praise from shrine and cathedral from chapel church tent and cave there arise day after day this incense of unite prayer from a vast and heaven-uplifted throng each of we would say canopy under world-sky i too would join this chorus of adoring love the dream of permanence the immortality of the church be akin to the immortality of the soul it be a connection which be never sever when we enter the visible body of the church on earth we connect ourselves with the invisible host of the church on high we enter a company which shall never be disband nor dismayed something subtle and eternal seem to lay hold of we spirit and to lift they even to god 's throne for this time have be and for this time now be : to present spotless before he the innumerable company of the redeem the lion-hearted who arm by faith and shod with fire in robe of azure and with song of praise shall stand before he even for evermore 2 the church be the center of a great circle of remembrance one of constable 's famous painting represent the cathedral of salisbury outline against a storm-swept sky with a lovely rainbow arch beyond it so stand the church athwart the landscape of we life in each community the church be like a living thing how every stone grow significant and dear how the light and shadow of its arch the dim faint-tinted window the carving and tracing the atmosphere and color all sink into the heart and make a background for memory that never pass away who ever forget the tone of the old organ the voice of the choir the accent look and bearing of one 's early pastor the rustle of the leaf without the window the rush of the fresh summer air the soft fall of the rain the path to the church be worn by the foot of generation thither the aged go up and thither the laugh romp child weary man and woman bear they burden thither triumphant soul bring shine face and uplifted brow love and dream cluster round the church and the life of the soul silent and hidden be subtly act upon by persuasion and conviction that rule the heart amid the fiercest storm and temptation of the world the church be a sanctuary and shield it be a emblem of strength and peace three angel stand before its altar : life love death hither be bring the babe for the christen hither come the wedding procession and here be lay with farewell tear the quiet dead day by day within that church as one grow to manhood and womanhood one enter into race-experience and feel however vaguely that the holy spirit abide within they all 3 the church afford the best outlet for moral activity where shall we put we moral power in what work shall they center from what point shall they diverge scatter action be irresolute it be the centripetal power that count the church stand ready to engage to the full the moral power of man it can rightly distribute the spiritual vitality of the world it rouse the moral emotion and affection and give scope for contrition adoration and thanksgiving -- the trisagion of the heart in the press and stir of life we sometimes forget that the highest emotion of which we be capable be those of joy praise and prayer joy be a heavenward uplift of life -- deep happiness of spirit praise be a appreciation of the greatness and mercy of the infinite worship be the outpouring of the whole nature a ascription of blessing glory honor and power and majesty to god it flow from the religious imagination and be the supreme offering of the intellectual as well as of the emotional life the church be a body ministrant : it have receive the accolade of spiritual service it stand among the world 's force as one of give not of gain it hold within its scope both a teaching and a training power it be the school of the soul the illuminator of the meaning and discipline of life abélard be say to have attract thirty thousand student to pari by he teaching but the church to-day call into its assembly fully one-third of the million of the world they be hold by its tenet guide by its ideal thrill by its hope and set to its work of charity and mercy the highest philanthropy be but a scientific renewal and adaptation of work which have have its start primarily in the christian church wealth be its vicegerent and from the adherent to the church fall largely the contribution to great philanthropic cause take the work of mission alone : have there ever before be a body which attempt to bring the whole world into its fellowship to make known everywhere its ideal and to share with all live a spiritual inheritance the evangelization of the world by this generation be one of the most sublime thought which have come to the race 4 there be a large amount of ability in the world which the church need but which have not yet be thoroughly enlist in church service take business energy executive ability it be a common say that business man be not interested in the church and do not work well in it why because there be not yet in the church enough of the active and economic spirit to make a business man feel at home in it or approve of its way of work this weak spot in the church which business man mock at or fret at exactly reveal the work that be wait for business man to do business to-day take intellectual grasp and insight -- promptness energy enterprise and common-sense these quality be need at once in the conduct of the church a second class greatly need by the church be the university-bred many college graduate be church-member -- some be even active worker but until lately the university as a whole have stand rather indifferently apart from the church they have somewhat indulgently regard it as one more historic institution for preserve myth and legend to they the christ-life have mean little more than the beówa-myth the arthur-saga the nibelungen cycle the homeric story the thor-and-odin tale druid fire-worshipper moon-dancer and christian communicant have be comparatively study with a view to understand the race-progress in rite and religious form this spirit be change the most remarkable aspect of the intellectual life of to-day be the rise of faith in the university like the incoming of a great tidal wave at sea be the wave of spiritual insight and religious aspiration that be roll over the college of we land the whole intellectual structure of the church be approach reconstruction -- its doctrine creed tenet this reconstruction can not possibly be effect by school of theology alone at every point the theologian need assistance from the man of science philosophy psychology ethic history literature sociology language natural science and archaeology be all bind up in a old creed and must be look into ere a new statement can take form they datum must be know at first-hand hence there be no intellectual specialty which may not be make invaluable to the church too often religion have be a matter of hearsay or dogma a bitter conflict have always rage between theology and the latest word of science the church can not afford to be without the scientific thinker of the race the time have come when there be everywhere hear the call of jesus to man of mind what work await the university man or woman it be to help free the church from tradition and superstition which scholarship can not uphold it be to throw fresh vigor and intellectual vitality into the service of the church it be to build up a hymnology which shall be noble and poetic in expression it be to contribute a great religious literature to the world it be the work of educate man and woman to add they insight they zeal for truth they scholarship they training and ideal to the christian community : to sweep thought and practice out of ancient rut to clarify the spiritual vision of the world and to present new aspect of truth and new goal of human endeavor let research join hand with prayer a third class which the church need to-day be that of the working-man the hand of the working-man be the hand that have really moulded history working-man lead a brave and self-sacrificing life from they toil come the necessaries and many of the comfort of the race the man of labor know the root-problem of the industrial world while all he industry and skill all he courage heroism and strong-armed life be so largely alienate from the church the church be deprive of one of the fundamental source of inspiration and growth the tree of progress can never grow except it have labor-root it be absolutely essential for the health of the church that every form of human energy be represent suppose that by some great revival a very large number of work man and woman could suddenly be add to the membership of the church what would happen would there not be at once a return to more simplicity of life there be two current at work always in society -- emulation and sympathy rightly use each be for the social good if all class of man and woman work side by side in the church many great social difference would become adjusted 5 it hold sway over the fortune of the home where outside of the church will you find the ideal conception of marriage and the really unite and happy home the church make for domestic happiness because it go straight to the root of life and plant happiness where happiness alone can grow more and more the church be lift the standard of a noble proud pure and rejoice married life its ideal of human love be sacred because found on the deeper love of the soul in god the church be draw host of young people under the shelter of its teaching and be place before man and woman ideal which can not fail to make they mark upon the social standard of the time it stand for purity for patience for tenderness for the love of little child for unite education and endeavor for mutual hope and dream for large public service 6 it be the militant force of time we speak of the church militant and of the church triumphant for we to-day the church militant to-morrow triumph come army have be and army shall be but the host of this world fight against material foe and largely for material end it be the glory of the church militant that its conquest be spiritual and its victory be eternal its fight be chiefly against the inner not the outer foe -- against sin and wrong-doing impatience strife anger clamor meanness evil-speaking wrath it be the foe of tyranny and its heel be upon the head of the oppressor and the avenger its banner fly over every country and have be carry through tribulation through sorrow through danger and through death to the remotest part of the yet-known world its troops be legion march from the far distance of the past and extend out to the far confines of the eternal year 7 it be the ascendant force of the future rightly conduct it will surely absorb the vigor of the world to stand apart from it be to be out of step with the march of nation the processional of progress to-day be the processional of the historic influence of the church what force have there be in time go by which have live and so greatly grow for nineteen hundred year nation have rise and nation have decay state once prominent have pass into the oblivion of the year plato and pericle socrate and sophocle philip and alexander the caesar the george and the loui have pass away they politics have pass from we follow they empire be no more but through these century of change the church of god have rise stronger more powerful year by year stretch its arm out to the uttermost part of the earth levy tribute on the island of the sea enlist all age and condition and look out over come generation -- not as a wane but as a grow and ever-increasing power think you that such a church can die think you that any spiritual power aloof from this church can be as efficient as if it be ally with it these you say be the reason why one 's allegiance should be give to the christian church let we now look back over the processional as it march across the dim year saint martyr confessor evangelist and singing child have join its historic train be there any other processional in the world 's history which numbering such million and million begin with only one when the christ enter the arena of history he come as one to lead myriad deep-lived soul next there follow twelve they two by two take up the march line think of they deed and influence of they inspiring power what would have be the record of those obscure fisherman of galilee and of they simple friend have they refuse to ally themselves with the leader who call for they allegiance and they obedient love next follow the early disciple try by scourging by stripe by poverty by imprisonment by all manner of danger and trial they yet remain true then follow the prophet those whose clear vision look out on thing unknown and thing unseen to the prophet be intrust the ministry of hope and inspiration then follow the martyr who yield life for the cause they profess in torture at the stake and on the cross by fire and by sword they show forth a unshaken and undying faith then follow matron and virgin babe and child reformer and mediaeval saint with a convoy of angel singing as they march these be the church triumphant the church above but to-day we have among we

personal force there be a natural gift of leadership which be strengthen by endurance perseverance and ceaseless hard work kingship also involve a larger vision one man look at he shoe-string another man look at the star the first step toward rule be to find a point of view from which one can look widely out over the race this be the primary value of education : it be not that book be important

to realize that we may be just as ambitious as we please that we may long earnestly for high thing and work for they if we inmost desire be not for self but for god this new idea of ambition should be at the root of education and of religious teaching piety be not a namby-pamby sentiment it be a great intellectual force desire be architectural : we dream should be of prestige and power true ambition be the reaching-out of the soul toward preordained thing what else be the meaning of we love for excellence we insatiable yearning for perfection what be excellent say emerson be permanent to

of power or crush it strengthen it or weaken it turn it toward the highest help of man or deflect it to tyranny cruelty and crime child-training be guidance in the way of god 's decree it be not the setting of one 's own idea upon a little child it be not the gratification of one 's own love of power it be not the satisfaction of one 's own self-conceit it be a firm humble strive to carry on the harmony of the universe : to bring up the child to love order justice mercy and truth education be the teaching of how to direct energy for the universal good it lay hold of a child and out of he

than this grave upbuild the next rule be social : the direction of personal energy that shall leave a distinct impress on other life it be long before we realize that for each exertion we be responsible that what we do be hold against we in strict account not only by fate which build we destiny for we out of we own deed but by every other person with whom we come in contact we fellow check off daily against we so much vitality so much magnanimity so much idleness cruelty spite goodness selfishness meanness or loving-kindness life hold a record of we every deed and from no least responsibility can we make we escape we be the prisoner of event which we ourselves have bring about the discipline of ethic of home-training of the church and of religious teaching be address fundamentally to this social consciousness of ours this responsibility which we can not evade to bear rule aright be to go forth into the world to build up in authority talent and influence the kingdom of god 1 there be the agricultural phase of social rule a man till a farm it have upon it tree stream woodland and meadow-land he may rule -- to what end if he rule it for he own personal end -- merely to fill he granary and lay up gold -- he rule it for miserliness with a sort of thrift that be as pass in inheritance as the fly April rain or he may say : i will keep my land in trust for god i will hold rain and frost heat and cold storm and sun in fee simple for the race my grain shall pass out into the world 's mart send forth with love and prayer such a farmer be the incarnation of moral grandeur let man laugh if they will at he overalls and plough he wide-brimmed hat he simple manners and he homely racy speech he foot be by the furrow but he heart be in heaven and he treasure be there also say the author of _ nine acre on the hillside _ the agriculturist walk side by side with the creator there be a fine integrity which lie in land there be a resolution which be concern with crop there be a wisdom bear of wind and weather there be a power which come from the constant revival of life in seed and fruit and flower this man be king of god 's acre let he not despise he kingdom and may the succession not depart from he house 2 there be a rule which be industrial a man be send into the world to wield a hammer a saw and run a engine if he rule over he hammer be weak if he do not know how to use it well if its blow be uncertain and its result unskilled then he pass from the line of king and be subject instead of in authority in he own domain he be captive to a piece of steel or wood so with every tool of trade each man who conquer he tool be a ruler -- be in control of element of human happiness and good the roof-mender the furnace-builder the cloth-weaver the yarn-spinner the steel-worker the miller -- do not these all keep the race warm and clothe and feed 3 the next rule be commercial trade itself be neither menial nor demeaning rightly use it be a high form of control people have thing to buy and thing to sell the maker be handicapped he can not travel elsewhere to dispose of what he have the buyer be ignorant he do not know where to go or can not go at first-hand for the shoe the hat the reaper the brick the lumber the stationery which he must use there appear upon the scene the man of observation of investigation of capital of shrewdness of

hill he set up a establishment he put forth runner advertisement and show-window he stock shelf deck counter and employ clerk packer salesman cash-boys buyer and department head the man who want to buy buy from a man across the sea and yet be serve in he own town the man of commercial power be a man of world-wide rule he may lay up in bank a fortune which he intend to try to spend upon himself or he may say : i be accountable for the pocket-book of the world i be in authority over they i open a market or close it i buy dispense and disperse human labor i create want and i satisfy they i will establish honest law of trade what i do shall be rate as commercial law what i say shall be quote as a way of equity and probity that man be a king of trade he throne be set upon hill and sea he subject be all man with need and all man with product of the land the coast the sea or brain or skill this be the lawful king of trade he represent god 's mart of exchange primarily goods be not buy and sell in the market they be first transfer in that man 's brain 4 another rule be of concerted work : the rule of the engineer back of every advance in we country in facility of trade and transportation or of public health and safety stand the man who think it out take for instance the development of the great american desert who project its irrigation by which area have be redeem from barrenness and waste who plan the economic use of the niagara fall who build the brooklyn bridge who project the vast waterway from chicago to the gulf who first think of a cable across the depths of sea who bridge the firth of forth the gange the mississippus who project the gray dock of montreal the simplon tunnel who wind the iron rail across the alleghany the rocky the sierra who draw the wall that have encircle china for a thousand year who project the suez canal the trans-siberian railway who sink the mine of eldorado who design the esplanade at hamburg the stone bank of the seine the waterway of venice the aqueduct of rome the appian way the military road of chili and peru the subway in new york gravity stress strain weight tension sag cohesion -- a few mathematical formula and a knowledge of the primary law of physics -- upon such principle as these the world be rapidly change form and use the engineer in a strange and subtle way stand near to god he work be do hand-in-hand with god he take the force of nature and the law of the material world and bend they to the need and use of man sky and sea or desert may be about he he know the arctic cold the tropic heat the forest and the plain the mountain and the marsh the brook and river the peak and the precipice the glacier and the tempest in they course out of the very element he be daily building new path for man to tread soon he too must pass lay after death it may be beside some mighty water that he handiwork have span in loneliness and silence do he not often think i wonder of the god with whom he deal it be god who provide the river and the sea god who through endless age have pile stone on stone crust on crust and have crumple the stratum of the earth as tissue in he hand it be god who have bind every mote to the earth-centre who have send magnetic current course through the globe and have make tide and sea-change and the trade-wind to blow it be the god of the gulf stream the caribbean sea the god of the appalachian the god of the himalaya the god of the cordillera of the amazon the yukon the yang-tse-kiang with which he really deal the endless age pass and go but god abide little daring man lift here and there a hand to mould the world which god have make -- prick the earth for gold or silver iron or coal -- but god be everywhere immanent and shine through every hour of change hence the march of engineer be the march of man whom god have train in a special sense he master-workmen craftsman whom he love it be theirs to say we be the king of work : the master-builder of the most high 5 there be king of academic thought man who lead in profession and in collegiate career the wise man be the true aristocrat he court may not be in a palace but within its precinct be receive and entertain the leader of the race to be provost to be college president or university professor be to be seat on a intellectual throne the problem of academic rule be not to attract a large number of student to put up impose building to have endowment and fill chair with learn specialist to grant many degree and to keep the hum of a teaching staff and of a student body alive in the ear of a community mark the college group by flag and color cap and gown procession and occasion these thing be right but be mainly accessory we have not all of a university when we have man and building money student brain back of a university there lie its foundation-idea that of academic control what be academic rule it be rule over the pride of man a college be a place whose chief power be to inculcate humility by the means of true learn to establish intellectual honor and integrity by search out the way of god in nature science and philosophy and in letter and in art it be the primary work of a university to make man humble the freshman be not teachable the sophomore be a intellectual upstart but by the time a man have be beat and conquer by the great ideal of the world which have pierce he bone and humble he conceit -- by the time the race-passion and the race-sorrow have creep across he spirit by the time that he have be confront with the achievement of homer empedocle hippocrate michelangelo socrate buddha plato emerson gladstone bismarck lincoln and carlyle -- he self-exaltation drop from he like a garment he -- who know how to construe a few page of the classic who know how to demonstrate a few mathematical problem scan a few verse recite a few ode carry on a few scientific experiment undertake a small research -- how shall he compete with these ruler of the thought of man then it be that the real rule of a university -- its spirit of humility and of reverence for antiquity -- begin the true university man bear and breed in the century not in the year in the race hall not those alone in he alma mater be neither a scoffer nor a atheist nor a critic sceptic or cynic he be a man of simple and exalted faith god who have bring such great thing to pass in science nature and art in human character in the destiny of nation and the history of humble man and woman be a god before whom there must be awe and reverence and not a flippant scout of the ancient ideal man who be so try by temptation and scourging of the spirit be a creature to be love appreciate understand not a be to whom shall be show arrogance aloofness and pride the university that make snob of its graduate have not yet enter into its kingdom of control a university also hold rule over truth absolute truth be in god 's hand but the university have class-room and library apparatus and laboratory which be intend for the discovery and furtherance of truth the university be not a place to cry out for big salary the salary should be live salary the seeker after truth should not be leave without enough money for heat and shelter for bread and meat rest and summer-change for the come of child and they education but truth may lodge without shame in a humble dwelling and may be greatly further without a elaborate bill of fare the university man of the time be the establisher of a kind of righteousness that be not always find in book they individual value as they go out into the world be to set right value on social custom and decree to establish the law of freedom in the home to lead man and woman out of the thraldom of ignorance vulgarity hearsay and style into simplicity of living and a sane scale of household expense the university leader of the future be the man who shall set law over household account and who shall rule over such simple thing as what best to eat and buy he shall be a economist of the larger sort provide for the spiritual necessity of man and they moral conduct rather than for they ball card-party and social side-show include church entertainment and philanthropic dance and bazaar he shall pave the way to a larger view of wealth influence and reform endue man with a keener sense of he own responsibility make he a creature of larger desire and of more aspiring want in particular he shall pass down from generation to generation the high and noble learning of the past he shall keep alive the flower of courtesy and charity he shall tell the dream of past sage and interpret they he shall review the throng nation and he shall so imbue the mind with a love of truth of ideal of excellence of honor that a new race shall go out into a larger and a nobler world and then a better day shall dawn for man 6 the king of state say milton in he sonnet on cromwell : _ yet much remain to conquer still peace have she victory no

gagging of a few loud tongue it be the problem of the training of better boss the education of man and woman in social control they enlightenment from childhood up in civic duty in national affair and the conduct of civil power thereupon oratory turn to its higher end through statesman preacher and political teacher it cry aloud of righteousness i look for the time when the typical politician shall be a honorable man when to be in the ring of municipal or national control shall mean to be a integral and orderly part of the administration of god 's great world when city life shall be purify and when international law shall be the interpretation of the will of the almighty for the rule of nation we have honest doctor lawyer tradesman shall we not have a honest politician and a upright ward-boss public service be a god-like service we president shall more and more be choose not alone for idea experience or for party affiliation : the president shall be choose because he be a moral hero something have stir in the heart of the american people which shall not soon be still : a spiritual outlook upon political preferment in the white house we long to have the great spiritual exemplar of we race not alone in church shall we offer up a prayer before election the time be come when each true ballot-slip shall be a prayer within the next fifty year shall be determine some of the greatest question of history among they shall be question of industrial adjustment and development and of social progress we must have in we cabinet not only the representative of war and state of

of all individual dominion there be rise a yet higher dominion -- the dominion of the english-speaking race we have be call by the providence of god to stand at the head of the march of progress may well ask ourselves concern we imperial power the line of progress for a nation be to allow no spiritual ideal to stagnate or to retrograde the spiritual aspiration of a nation always dominate what be call the social mind we grow toward what we worship it be ours to plant the dominion of civilization in foreign land and to supplant a wane culture by a richer truer and nobler way of life the first

a foot high and therein stand a naked sword by the point about the sword there be letter write say whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil be righteous king bear of all england many assay to pull the sword forth but all fail until the young arthur come and take the sword by the handle lightly and fiercely pull it out of the stone by this token he be lord of the land each man 's life be prove by some sword of assay the test of a man 's call to the ministry be he power to seize the sword of the spirit : wield the spiritual force of the world insight conviction persuasion truth to do this successfully at least five thing appear to be necessary : a sterling education mark ability in write and in public speak a noble manner a voice capable of majestic modulation and a deep and tender heart these phrase sound very simple but perhaps they mean more than at first appear have we not all meet some one in we lifetime whose acquaintance with we seem to have no preliminary -- some one who never bother to say anything at all to we until one day he say something that leap and tingle through we very be this be the power that a minister ought to have with every soul with whom he come in contact : he word should quickly touch a vital spot no one to-day care much for mere oratory literary discussion polemic or cursory exegesis mark ability in write and in public speaking mean that grip on reality which make people quiver repent believe adore sincerity be the basis of such power at heart we worship the man who will not lie who will not use convention or formula in which he do not believe who do not give we a second-hand view of either life or god who do not play with we conscience because it be not politic to be too direct who do not juggle with we doubt nor ignore we hope and power who also frankly acknowledge that he too be a man a call to the ministry also involve a over-mastering spiritual desire tell I what a man want and i will tell what he be and what he can best do if a man desire above all thing to conduit a great business he be by nature qualify for trade if he desire knowledge he be design for a scholar if he be always observe form rhyme aesthetic beauty and strive to produce verse he be a bear poet but if the one thing that rule he dream be the longing for spiritual power -- the thought of impress god upon he generation and lead man to a clearer view of life and duty -- he be a bear minister of the spirit and to the spirit of the son of man along with this go the great burden : woe be I if i preach not the gospel wherever to-day there be a young man in whose heart be stir a great devotional dream for the race who long to project he life into the most enduring and far-reaching influence who crave the exercise of great gift and power there be a man whose heart god be call to possibility such as no one can measure and to triumph such as no one can forecast the highest triumph of these come year be to be spiritual the leader be to be the one who can carry the deepest spiritual inspiration to the heart of he fellow-man do not let the hour go by this day of vision be the prophetic day but if the call be answer if certain high-spirited and noble-minded man ask thus to stand as spiritual ministrant to the soul of man how shall they be train for the high office the old way will not do sweeping change in these last day have come over the commercial academic and social world we do not go back to the hand-loom the hand-sickle the hand-press what be true of these aspect of life be true of the spiritual training it must be larger freer grander than before time be when a theologian it be think must be separate from the world -- a ascetic working in the dim half-light of the old library or scriptorium or hall to-day he must gain much of he training from the great life of the world -- learn how to meet man and occasion and be prepare to deal with modern force and energy with courage knowledge and decision we read of the earnest thoma goodwin : he favorite author be such as augustine calvin musculus zanchius paraeus walaeus gomarus and amesius what doctor of theology take the last six of these to bed with he to-day we theological course be too dry look carefully over the catalogue of thirty or forty of we own seminary and notice the curious almost monastic impression which they make then realize that the man who pursue these abstruse and mediaeval subject be the man who go out into church where the chief topic of thought and conversation be crop stock politics clothes servant baby there be a grim humor in the thing which seem to have escape those who have draw up the curriculum life be not monastic it be very lively we scarcely get in all we post-collegiate life a chance to sit and muse we go through sensation experience and incongruity which stir a sense of fun a man read -lrb- i notice -rrb- in he seminary st leo _ ad flaeirmum _ and make he first pastoral call on a woman who proudly bring out she first baby for he to see _ ad flaeirmum _ indeed what do st leo tell the youth to say what should be breathe into a man in the seminary be not the mere fact of ecclesiastical history but the warm pulsate current of human life the profound significance of the founding and the progress of the church a deep psychological understanding of human desire motive joy ambition grief the relentlessness of sin the help and glory of redemption the quicken of the christ the vigor and the tenderness of faith coincident with these must be a growth in depth and dignity of life no one like to take spiritual instruction from man who be themselves crude foolish sentimental or conceited many social snag on which young minister be sure to run be simply the rudiment of social conduct as practice by the world noble manners be one 's personal action as influence and guide by the great behavior of the race under the impulse of ideal much that be untoward or superficial in one 's bearing will disappear it be impossible to think as noble man and woman have think -- to dream love and work as they have dream loved and work -- and not have pass into one 's mien the high excellence of such life the first education be spiritual until mind and heart be sweep by the spirit of god chasten purify ennobled and inspired vain be all the learning of the school to this end there should be a more deeply spiritual atmosphere in we seminary less of the mere academic impulse in every age there be man just to come in contact with whom be a benediction and a help for year such a man be mark hopkin noah porter jame mccosh such the lead man in every seminary should be the plan of education must be of principle not of fact the university research-man gather fact and scientific man everywhere collect analyze and classify they but each small department of human learning -- each minute branch in that department -- need a lifetime for the mastery of that one theme hence the work of the college be quite apart from that of the school of theology it be the place of the school of theology not to ignore the new learning but to group upon the basis of a thorough college training certain great interest and pursuit of mankind in such a way as to afford by means of they a leverage for spiritual work after all be say and do it be not the grammar-detail of latin greek hebrew and aramaic dialect that make a minister 's power it be the strange language-culture of the race which should enter in the inner vitality of word the beauty of poetic cadence the strong flow of rhythm noble theme great thought impressive imagery and appeal we should know the bible as literature not as one know a story-book or a dialect-exercise but as one know the melody and memory of childhood the vital thing be not a knowledge of the historical schism and decree of christendom -- not the external evidence of religion ecclesiastical history ecclesiastical polity monument text memorabilia -- the vital thing be the power to think about god and the problem of mankind it be a heart-knowledge of the difficulty and questioning of a race that yearn for virtue man thirst for god no one be wholly indifferent to the spirit i fear that some minister do not know -- and never will know -- the heart-hunger of the world when they rise to speak there be always some one present whose breath be hush with longing to hear speak some real word of truth or strength or comfort if he receive but chaff -- theology be not a dry thing and ought not be make so it be quick with the life of the race each dogma be a mile-stone of human progress it be the sift and garner wisdom of the century concern god and he way with man each student should feel not that a system be be drive into he as pile be drive into the stream but that he be be put in philosophic contact with the thought of the race on the great topic of religion with liberty himself to experiment think and add to the store homiletics be not a series of nursery-rule for man -- formal didactic dropping of a pedant 's tongue homiletics be the appeal of man to man for the welfare of he soul and the true progress of mankind exegesis be not a matter of hebrew or greek alone it include the spiritual interpretation of the great problem of the race homer tennyson browning and dante be exegete no less than lightfoot lange and schaff pastoral divinity be not the etiquette of a polite way of make call : it be a enter into the social spirit of the time the learning of friendliness unreserve sympathy persuasion and a way of approach it be the mastery of spiritual _ savoir-faire _ outside of this group of technical subject there be yet other of vital importance from a scientific understanding of the world and of one 's work they be psychology ethic sociology and politics since we have know more of the psychological meaning of adolescence a new theory of conversion have spring up and whether or not we accept it the whole outlook over the underlie principle of conversion have be change we must at least recognize that conversion be a scientific process as much as digestion be or respiration it be not a purely emotional occurrence the minister must learn what society really be and how the far still force of time act and react upon each other produce group-action institution custom way there be social fossil as well as physical one sociology be not a system of fad and reform it be the scientific study of society of its constitution development institution and growth he must also breathe largely of the great governmental life of the race -- understand the primary principle of politics and administration he should have some knowledge of commercial interest of the formula incentive and right principle of trade there should also be in the seminary a inspirational atmosphere of music literature and art literature be a revelation of the life of the soul the man who read literature and comprehend its message be receive a fine training which shall fit he for a thorough understanding of the heart of its practical ethical and spiritual problem of its domestic joy and sorrow of its human care and burden of the appeal that will come to he for sympathy of the temptation that beset the race and of the hope and trial of the world literature be one of the best tool a minister can have he should be read in the great literary and sermonic literature the work of bossuet massillon chrysostom augustine fénelon marcus aurelius mediaeval homily epictetus pascal guyon amiel vinet la brunetière phelp jeremy taylor barrow fuller whitefield bushnell edward bacon newman ruskin carlyle emerson davy law bunyan luther spalding robertson kingsley maurice chalmer guthrie stalker drummond maclaren chan beecher and phillip brook yes even john stuart mill all these man by whatever name or school they be call be writer of essay or sermon which appeal to the most spiritual deep of man he should read the novel of richter thackeray dickens scott eliot and victor hugo he should know intimately the great verse which involve spiritual problem and human strife and aspiration -- milton beówulf caedmon chaucer shakespeare spenser ballad saga the arthur-saga the nibelungenlied wordsworth coleridge keat herbert tennyson brown dante and christina rossettus whittier lowell longfellow to say nothing of goethe corneille and the greek roman persian egyptian hindu and arabian verse in music he heart should wake to the beauty of oratorio symphony choral concert music national and military music and inspiring song not to speak of hymn and of anthem the progress of christian song the _ creation _ the _ messiah _ the _ redemption _ bach 's _ passion music _ the _ st cecilium mass _ spohr 's _ judgment _ stainer 's _ resurrection _ the _ twelfth mass _ mendelssohn 's _ elijah _ -- these be monumental work and theme what be a hymn we think of it as be some simple churchly word set to a serious tune a hymn be the rhythmic aspiration of the race no one can look through a good hymnal -- through _ hymn ancient and modern _ for instance or the church hymnary -- without feeling that therein be bind up the devotional life of the world the spiritual outlook be cosmic we every mood of penitence praise and aspiration resound in melodious and time-defying strain in art the religious spirit brood over the great work of the world in angelo francesca veronese botticellus titian raphael tintoretto and correggio the brush of the painter have set forth the adoration of the church of god thus take all in all to be educate as a minister should be to be educate in the higher life of the race finally above all else be the spiritual study and interpretation of the word of god a minister may be fearless of the investigation of scientific criticism every truth be important to he but not all truth be vital when a man such as caspar rene gregory speak something of the holy mystery and inspiration of biblical research as well as a scientific result be present and one gain a new conception of what it really mean to study and to understand the word of god under all be the life of ceaseless and prevailing prayer by the life of prayer many mean merely a way of learn to make public petition a objective appeal to god the true life of prayer be as simple as unteachable and as vital as the life of a child with its mother -- the little lip daily learn new way of approach to its mother 's heart and new word to make its want and interest and sorrow know prayer be the true world-power just as there be vast stretch in the world where the foot of man have never tread so there be unmeasured region whereon prayer have never be the more we pray the more illimitable appear this spiritual realm and all about we in the universe be also great hidden force : nothing will lay hold of they but prayer each prayer enlarge the soul the measure of we pray be the measure of we growth no man have reach he full possibility of achievement who have not complete the circuit of he possible prayer power be proportionate to prayer and last of all there be the inspiration of the holy spirit what it be who may say but that it be real who can doubt to read the life of wesley whitefield finney moody be to feel a strange deep thrill they be man who speak and man listen who call and man come to god other alas so often call and there be no response they can not make headway through the indifference the sloth the materialism and the inherent vulgarity of the world the life itself be arduous after all be say it be not quite the same task to examine and classify either protoplasm or the most highly organized form of nature that it be to analyze and understand the mysterious workings of the heart the intricacy of conscience and conduct the possibility of spiritual development or of moral downfall and the many questioning agony and ecstasy of the soul of man and they be to be study and understand with the definite and positive aim of the absolute reconstruction of the world-bound spirit -- a change of its motive purpose affection ideal more than this there must be at the heart of the more thoughtful minister a philosophic basis for the reconstruction of society itself youth be not a adequate preparation for this task : a man must live and grow to deal with such theme and occasion there must appear in the world life of such vigor that they can command of such charm that they can attract of such wisdom that they can guide and comfort of such vitality that they can inspire and hence there rise before the mind 's eye a figure that be both knightly and kingly -- a man earnest in the redress of wrong and who yet hold a subtle authority over the force that make for wrong a man burden with the care and sorrow of many other and yet conduct he own life with serenity enthusiasm dignity and hope a man to whose keen yet tender gaze a life-history be reveal by a word or tone but whose own eye receive they light from god a prophet and a father a priest and a counsellor a brother friend and judge a sacrifice and a inspiration should he be who in reverence and love bring before a wait congregation the very word of life second : of spiritual rule 1 the primary rule be over conscience the man who sway a conscience sway a human life the man who sway a nation 's conscience control that nation 's life to rule conscience a man must himself be unprejudiced and well inform he must strive not to keep up a unhealthy excitement which shall make conscience introspective and morbid but to preserve a sane moral outlook to encourage freedom of thought and judgment and to develop a normal conscience which react promptly against wrong conscience measure we inner recoil from evil the power of a preacher be in direct proportion to the energy with which he reveal sin in the heart of man and wake he whole nature against its insidious power sin be to-day sin be think a somewhat brusque word lack in polish to use it frequently be a mark of lack of ' _ savoir-faire _ indeed to speak of it at all be as archaic as to speak of the ichthyosaurus but sin be a root-fact of the life of man it be the office of the spiritual teacher to pluck out sin to pierce the heart with a recognition of the enormity of sin and of its far-reaching consequence to stir the seared conscience rouse the apathetic life thrill the spiritual imagination and to quicken the heart to better love and to nobler dream he rebuke the private sin of individual and the public sin of nation in the _ faerie queene _ the soul-diseased knight be in a state _ in which he torment often be so great that like a lyon he would cry and rare and rend he flesh and he own synewe eat _ but fidelium like the faithful pastor be both _ able with she word to kill and raise againe to life the heart that she do thrill _ this power have at time be misunderstand and misapply no human authority can bind the conscience nor set rule and regulation for the soul of man the prerogative of final direction belong to god alone no man may arrogate it -- no pastor for people no husband for wife no wife for husband no parent for child the sadness of the world have be that man have not always be spiritually free freedom have be a social growth -- a phase of progress it have take war and persecution revolution and reformation the blood of saint and martyr the sorrow of age to plant this precept in the mind of man the evangelist warn he speak of sin death hell and the judgment to come it be for these thing that he be send to testify these be not the catch-word of a new sort of fear king who use oral terror to affright the soul of man heaven and hell be not a new sort of ghost-land : retribution be not a larger way of tribal revenge no the latest fact of science present this universe as not only progressive but as retributive there be a rebound of evil which make for pain each broken law exact a penalty each deed of sin be a forerunner of personal and of social disaster the generation that sin shall be cut off while the stock of the righteous grow strong from age to age the scientific vista open to the eye of man be impressive and appalling each man have within himself a future of joy or sadness for the race do you remember the sermon of horace bushnell on the populate power of the christian faith do you recall the history of the infamous juke family that of the seven devout and noble generation of the murray the day of judgment be not only the last great day -- it be to-day and every day every day be doomsday say emerson nature be unforgetful nature be accountant each iniquity must be pay for out of the resource of the race it be of these grave omen that the man of god must speak he dare not be tongue-tied by custom or by fear he must proclaim hell in the ear of all mankind for wherever hell may be and we do not yet know and whatever hell may be and we can not even imagine hell _ be _ and the soul of man must be keep mindful of these great thing the evangelist comfort and console the heart of man be wayward and go oft astray no one can be belabor into righteousness the true lover of soul allow for the hereditary weakness of man for he infirmity of will and temper for he excuse wanderings and tear and present to he jesus in whose sight no one be too wretched to be receive too wicked to be forgive we must have forgiveness in order to know god the most comforting thought in the world be that god know all we do there can be no misunderstanding between we : he can not be misinform the evangelist must come close in sympathy and counsel to the personal and individual life of those whom he would help perhaps the best way to emphasize this point would be to insert here word write by a woman who have be think on this subject she say : i have never have a pastor it be the one good thing lack in my life i have grow up among minister and have have many friend among they -- some of they have care for I but there have never be one among they all who stand in a attitude of spiritual authority and helpfulness to my life we church-going and christian man and woman of the educate class be almost wholly let alone apparently no one take think for we soul we be not in the least infallible we come face to face with fierce temptation we have heart-breaking sorrow we be burden with anxiety and perplexity but we be leave to grope as blind sheep there be no one to point out the path to we however dimly no one to say at any crucial moment of we life walk here once however she continue one of my friend a minister kneel down by I and pray it be a simple and ordinary occasion -- other be present but every word of that prayer be mean for the uplifting of my heart in that hour i be as if overshadow by the holy ghost new aim and purpose be bear within I my friend love I -- that do not matter -- it be he spiritual intensity i care for and this be he reward for he fidelity and tenderness : in the hour when i come to die when one do not ask for father or mother or husband or wife or brother or sister or friend or child but only for the strong comfort of the man of god -- in that hour i say if i be at all able to make my wish know i shall send for that man to come to I he and no other shall present my soul to god read the above word more than one minister will cry out he eye blaze : i say the same to you who be there that try to shield the minister from sorrow and from pain who be there to comfort and help _ he _ you think we can just go on and preach preach preach stand utterly alone and with no one on earth to keep we own heart close to god i tell you it be a lonely and weary work at time this be a minister yes there must be a people as well as a pastor the relation be reciprocal wherever there be a strong man lean down in fire and tenderness to help the life about he there must be a loyal and loving congregation with here and there in it some one who more fully appreciate and understand nothing beat down and discourage a man more than to feel that he be preach to cold air and not to human folk and to get back when he offer sympathy a stare a congregation be a mysterious and subtle social force its effect on a minister he can neither analyze nor explain but he know that its power be mesmeric and can not be escape he go into its presence from a hour of exalted and uplifted prayer serene happy strong and prepared to speak word of power and life gaze at he people -- he can never tell why -- the word freeze on he lip a icy hand seem lay upon he heart and he make a cold and formal presentation of he glowing theme and wonder who or what have do it all something satanic and repelling have lay hold of he tongue and brain or again he may have have a worried and troubled week full of personal anxiety and sorrow he have not have full time to study -- he feel quite unprepared and enter the pulpit with a halting step and a choke fear of failure at he heart in a moment the world change something imperceptible but sweet and comforting steal over he -- a uplifting atmosphere of attention sympathy affection he begin to speak very quietly at first with quite a effort but the congregation lead he on to deeper thought to nobler word to modulation of voice that carry he quite beyond himself he voice rise and every syllable be firm and musical he language spring from some far center of inspiration he be conscious of superb power and as sentence after sentence fall from he lip -- sentence that amaze himself more than any other -- he enter into the supreme height of joy that of be a spiritual messenger to the heart of longing man and woman he and they together talk of god this sympathetic atmosphere make great preacher and great man in return there flow from a pastor toward he people a love that few can know or understand 2 he rule be also over spiritual enthusiasm what be a revival we confound it with a local excitement a community-sensation of a hysterical and pass type -- with sensational disturbance fall exercise shout weep and the like a revival be something far different a revival be a awakening of the community heart and mind it be a quicken of dead backsliding or inattentive soul man as a individual be quite a different person from the same man in a crowd one be himself alone the other be himself plus the influence of the social mind a revival be a social state in which the social religious enthusiasm be stir up it be a lofty form of religion just as the patriotism which break forth in tear and cheer as troops go out to war be a finer type than the mere excitement and fervor of one patriotic man what would the queen 's jubilee have be if but one soldier have march up and down a great commemoration if we grant the reality of national rejoicing in the royal jubilee commercial rejoice in business man 's procession university enthusiasm on commencement day -- shall we not grant the reality of the religious interest and enthusiasm of a great revival in which whole community shall be lead to a clearer knowledge of spiritual thing the crusade be a magnificent revival the reformation be a revival the salvation army movement be a revival but the greatest revival of all time be even now upon we : it be a revival in the scientific circle of the race time be when science and religion be suppose to be at odds to-day the intellectual phalanx be sweeping christward with a impetus that be sublime thinker be find in the large life of religion a motive power for they think they growth -- a reason for they existence -- a forecast of they destiny we be begin to realize the dynamic value of belief this revival be come not with shout and noise but with the quiet insistence of new idea of new fact -- with the still voice of scientific announcement the atheist be be overcome not by emotion but by evidence the scoffer be be put down by cool logic hence the evangelist of to-day be more than a man who can popularly address a public audience and by tale and tear arouse a weep commotion the evangelist be a man of intellect and prayer who can preach the gospel to a scientific age and to a think coterie -- a coterie of college man and mechanic of society woman and servant-girl of poet and of mine-digger of convict and of reformer to-day call for the utmost intellectual resource of the teacher of the truth for a great imagination great style great sympathy with man large learning and unceasing prayer 3 he rule be over social ideal he must be a man of social insight the social spirit be abroad in the world but it be woefully erratic and misguided any one think he can be a altruist why not take a class in a college settlement make some bib for a day nursery give tramp a cos card with one 's compliment and attend about six lecture a year on philanthropy -- the lecture very good indeed one be then a full-fledged altruist _ n'est - ce pas _ the philanthropy of to-day have a bewildering iridescence of aspect each present impulse be reformatory correction like a centipede show a hundred leg and want to run upon they all much of the so-called philanthropy be not well balanced and be run by crank crank attach themselves to any social movement as a shaggy gown will gather burr it be not all of philanthropy to classify degenerate titter at ignorance and to go a-peeping through the slum we have not yet realize the fulness of redemption of what avail be it to save one street-arab or one chinaman if a million arab and chinaman remain unsaved redemption be a race-savior : it seize not only the individual but he environment he friend and he future state the true minister be a reformer a reformer be one who re-crystallize the social ideal of man who break up idol and bad custom and sweep away abuse but we must first ask : what be a idol what be a bad custom what be a abuse they be social standard which be out of harmony with true concept of god life and duty behind the work of the reformer be the dream of the reformer the meditation of the mystic the seer he must first have in mind a plain clear conception of what the relation be of man to god of what man 's environment should be and of what the society of the kingdom should be the reformer be one who change a exist social environment for approximately this ideal environment of he own thought when he break a idol it be not the idol itself that he everlastingly hate it be the materialistic concept of the community what he wish in place of the idol be a right conception no man could break up every idol in the sandwich island but a man go about implant a spiritual idea of god and the idol disappear hence the work of the reformer be deep and heart-searching work it mean constant study of the spiritual need of the age continual insight into the material force which be mould the age-images money conquest or whatever they may be he wish to maintain a spiritual hold on civilization itself so to transform the ideal within a man a community a nation in regard to custom observance belief that the outer rite shall follow to reform be not to rush through the slum and then preach a sensational sermon about bad place in the slum of which most people never know before to reform be to know something of the condition which produce the slum -- it be not to scatter the slum-people broadcast elsewhere in the town it be not alone to give they bath playground circulate library of book and picture dancing-parties and social club to reform the slum be to set up a new ideal of god and of righteous conduct in the heart of the slum-dweller one must know something of the slow process of social change of social assimilation growth and stability to have a intellectual perception of the problem as well as a spiritual one one do not make a ill-fed child strong by stuff five pound of oatmeal down its throat the reformer must not only be a man of energy he must be a man of patience great reform come slowly as man have advance idleness indolence brutality tyranny drunkenness cant and social scorn be gradually be cast out but behind these simple word lie hide century of strife and endeavor and limitless darkening of human hope to fly against vice be merely to invite enmity and opposition to present a pure and noble ideal to breathe forth a holy atmosphere for the soul be constructive work the trouble be not that the minister preach on social theme -- all theme that concern the life of man be social theme it be that they do piece-work and patch-work of reform instead of plain direct upbuilding work in the soul and conscience of man to preach upon horse-stealing be one thing the horse-stealer may be impressed convict make penitent and return the steal horse but not until he heart be imbue with a spiritual conception of honesty as the law of god will he steal a stray horse no more hence the first question in reform be not : how many groggery be there in my parish how many corrupt poll how many hypocrite on my church-roll the question be : how be my parish society in enmity to the highest spiritual ideal i know many man preach about saloon when they ought to be preach about christ the force of this reform-energy be uncomputed we hear of occasional great reformer but forget that there have be a prevailing influence extend over the age of holy man of god who have preach and teach and pray who have preserve we social institution of spiritual import and have be a mighty and continuous force work for righteousness and peace mission be a higher form of politics to further mission be to further government international comity world-peace 4 he rule be over creed he be inevitably a teacher of doctrine what be doctrine doctrine be spiritual truth formulate in a systematic way it be also in church matter a system of truth which have be believe in and clung to by a body of believer constitute some branch of the catholic church it be a noble and serious office to hand down from generation to generation the faith and tradition of the church of god but this handing-down must be upright you must bind nothing upon you charge say jeremy taylor but what god have bind upon you conviction be at the root of the lasting tradition of the church only this -- he conviction -- can one man really teach another if he try to speak otherwise he shall have a lolling and unsteady tongue no soul be finally hold by the indefinite or the namby-pamby it begin to question upon what foundation do this phrase this fine sentiment rest it must stand upon a proposition this proposition rest either upon a scientific fact or upon that which for want of a more definite term we call the religious instinct of man but a proposition can not standalone it be connect with other proposition argument conclusion hence a system of logic of philosophy of express belief of doctrine inevitably grow up in a think community a think church the statement of a ecclesiastical system of doctrine may not be the absolutely true one nor the final one doctrine change even as scientific theory change with fuller information doctrine also expand with the growth of the human spirit and understanding to-day in one 's library one have a thousand book they be shelve and catalogue for reference in a special order but year hence one 's grandson who inherit these book may have ten thousand book the aspect of the library be change it be fill with new volume and new thought shall we give a liberty to a man 's library which we refuse to he belief must he -- and he church -- have only he grandfather 's idea standard and decree the tenet of a sect be the theological arrangement of belief which for the present seem best it be the systematic arrangement of fact so far examine determine and classify but no system of theology can be final thought be move on experience be progressive providence be continually reveal the race be a creed-builder as well as a builder of pyramid cathedral and triumphal arch the building-up of doctrine be superb into doctrine be weave the intellectual belief the emotional experience and the spiritual struggle of mankind doctrine be a attempt to classify the spiritual problem of the race and to present a theory of redemption which shall be adequate spiritually progressive and the exact expression so far as yet reveal of the will of god for man all christian doctrine be centre about one point : the redemption of the race from sin deal with such great and fundamental theme each system of doctrine be a intellectual triumph doctrine be a intellectual necessity christ be not sporadic either in history or philosophy to teach christ as the unlettered savage may who have just learn of christ the savior and turn to teach he fellow-savage might do good or save a soul from death but in order to command the intellectual respect of the race there must be another form of teaching yet than this a teaching which present christ in the historic and philosophic setting : the central figure in a great body of associate spiritual truth christ as the fulfilment of prophecy the means of social adjustment and regeneration the finisher of we faith and the source of eternal joy we must be not less spiritual christian but increasingly intellectual one as time roll on who be the man who have build up doctrine man speak as if doctrine be a ecclesiastical toy -- to be shake by priest or prelate as one shake a rattle for noise for play a doctrine be not a toy it be the crystallize belief of earnest thoughtful and godly man -- belief which have pass into a church tradition and be now receive as a act of faith shall doctrine be teach a child yes to have a specific doctrine clearly in mind do not fetter the young soul any more than to be teach the apparent fact of geography and history which may change either in reality or in he own interpretation as he mind mature a doctrine be a practical and definite thing to work with in later life to believe and to approve of or disbelieve and disapprove of if a man wish to build a house do it fetter he to know square measure cubic contents geometry mensuration and mechanical law yet when he build he house he build it in he own individual way he stamp it with he own personality and idea while build it perchance he discover some new relation or geometric law doctrine do not save from hell but it do save from many a snare that beset the foot of man it be a steadier of life a strengthener of hope a stalwart aid to a practical devout and duty-doing life a catechism be a system of doctrine express in its simplest form therefore for the intellectual and moral training of the church let we have sound doctrine in the pulpit and the catechism in the home and sabbath-school it be object that doctrinal terminology be too hard for a child to understand be this not absurd when the same child can come home from school and talk glibly of a parallelepipedon a rhombus rhomboid polyhedral angle archipelago law of primogeniture the binomial theorem and of a dicotyledon he also learn french german latin greek and the _ argot _ of the public school the theological leader of to-day can not be a creed-monger : he must be a creed-maker side by side with the executive officer who will reorganize the christian force there will stand great creed-maker giant theologian firm logical scientific and convincing who out of the vast array of new fact bring forth by modern science will produce new creed a new catechism a new dogmatic series it be worth while to live in these day -- to know the possibility of such monumental constructive work in one 's own lifetime the creed-maker must have a thorough literary training no mere vocabulary of philosophy will answer like the elizabethan divine they must rule the living word which shall echo for a century yet to come as the great ecumenical council be convene for missionary progress so the time be now ripe for the assemble of a historic theological council to revise and restate not one denominational catechism but the creed of christendom to provide a new literary expression of the christian faith together we be work in god 's world and for he kingdom if doctrine be the crystallize thought and belief of godly man what be heresy what be schism who be dictator of doctrine how far be the limit of authority to be press what be the bound of ecclesiastical control of intellectual mandate in the christian church in the academic world we do not cast a man out of he mathematical chair because he can also work in astro-physics or in psycho-physics if he can pursue advanced research in a ally or apply field it will help he in he regular and prescribed work we do not cast a english professor out of he chair because he announce that there be two manuscript of layamon 's _ brut _ and that the text of beówulf have be many time work over before we have receive it in its present form yet there be accredited professor of english who do not know these fact and who if call upon could neither prove they nor disprove they they have not work in the bodleian in the british museum or in other foreign library on old english text and authority they think themselves well up in old english if they can translate the text of beówulf fairly well remember its most difficult vocabulary and can tell a tale or two from the _ brut _ not every man have europe or asia in he backyard nor a lifetime of leisure for research for special learning on the moot question of church-scholarship progress consist in each man 's do he best to advance the interest of the kingdom of god in he own special sphere from other he must take something for grant the ear of the church ought always to be open to the saying of the specialist a church should grant liberty of research of thought of speech -- to a degree but whatever may come out of twentieth-century or thirtieth-century combat one thing remain clear : a church be a organization a social body with a certain doctrine to proclaim a certain faith to hand down to man the doctrine be not in all detail final -- each phase of faith may change but the organization to protect its own purity and integrity -- however generous in allow individual research and the expression of individual idea -- must exert authority over the teacher in she midst those who be call by she name who have she child in they charge and for whose teach the church as a whole be responsible there be doubtless a time when the man who be really in advance of he time intellectually must be misunderstand must be disagree with must be cast out but all truth may await the verdict of time if he have discover something new something true the century will make it plain there remain a chance -- and the church dare not risk too great a chance -- that he be mistaken impious presumptuous or self-deceived we dare not rush to a new doctrine or spiritual conception merely because one man who know more of a certain kind of learning than we do have say so one must be bolster up by a generation of convinced and believe man before he can draw a church after he no other process be intellectually legitimate in any other event ecclesiastical anarchy would reign to maintain the historic position of the church be a necessity until that position be prove untrue so to maintain it be not bigotry it be not lack of charity it be merely common-sense the question where be the line between ecclesiastical integrity and individual freedom be therefore one which the common-sense of christendom be leave to solve -- not to-day not to-morrow but gradually generously and conscientiously as the century go on third : obstacle and opportunity it be say that a minister be greatly handicapped to-day in all he effort for two reason : first that the time be spiritually lethargic that man be so engross by material aim indifference or sin that a pastor can get no hold upon they heart second that he be bind hand and foot by condition exist in the organization and personnel of he church and hence be not free to act what would we think of a electrician who would complain that a storm have cast down he network of wire of a civil engineer who would lament that the mountain over which he be ask to project a road be steep of a doctor who would grieve that host of people about he be very ill of a statesman who would cry out that horrid folk oppose he it be the work of the specialist to meet emergency and it be he professional pride to triumph over difficult condition the harder he task the more he exult in he power of success it be a glorious task that lie before the minister of to-day -- to maintain develop and uplift the spiritual life of the most wonderful epoch of the world 's history to place upon human soul that vital touch that shall hold they power subject to eternal influence and aim the time be not wholly unfavorable : we era which spurn many ecclesiastical form be at heart essentially religious _ the world for christ _ how this war-cry of the spirit thrill anew as one realize how much more there be to win to-day than ever before the warrior gird himself and long eagerly to marshal great shine active host for god it be true that the condition of work be more try than they have usually be a man go out from the seminary he have have a good education follow by perhaps a year or two abroad and some practical experience in sociological work he have plan idea ideal a vigorous and whole-souled personality a frank and generous heart what do he find he soon discover that the battle be not always to the strong the educate or the well-bred too often he be at the mercy of rich man who can scarcely put together a grammatical sentence of poorer man who be in church affair unscrupulous politician of woman who carp and gossip and of all sort of man and woman who desire to rule criticise hinder and distrain they too be the very people who in the ear of god and of the community have vow to love he and to uphold he work the more intellectual and spiritual he be the more he be trouble and distressed many church too be in a chronic state of internal war as for these rise church difficulty -- try to put out a burning bunch of fire-cracker with one finger and you have the sort of task he have in hand while one point of explosion be be firmly suppress other cracker be spit and go off whichever way he turn and whatever he do something pop angrily and a new blaze begin and this business incredibly petty as it be block the progress of the christian faith man and woman of education and refinement of a wide outlook and noble thought and deed be more and more unwilling to place themselves on the church-roll a minister sometimes find himself in the anomalous position of have the more culture congenial and philanthropic people of the community quite outside any church organization all these thing mean not that a minister must grow discourage but that he must set he tooth and with pluck and endurance rise strong and masterful and say this shall not be let he not listen to the bark and bay : let he hearken to the great primal voice of man and nature love lie deeper than discord the constructive force of humanity be stronger than the disintegrative the right attraction bind there be some man who by the sheer force of they personality subdue they church difficulty they hold the captious in awe by a sort of magnetic persuasion and lively sense of humor they soothe this one and that win the regard of the outlying community attach many new member to the organization and build up out of discordant and erstwhile discontented element a harmonious and active church this be the man for these martial time if there be bear leader in every other department of the world 's work man who quietly but firmly assert they authority and supremacy in the task in which they hold by free election or legitimate appointment a place at the head -- it ought to be so in the church of god i long to see arise in the ministry _ a race of iron _ there be other difficulty seldom speak of of which one must write frankly though with the keenest sympathy if one be to look deeply into the modern church problem first : be a minister 's environment favorable to he best personal development do he not miss much from the lack of the world 's hearty give-and-take he get criticism but not of a just or all-round kind small thing may be peck at trifle may be make mountain of by the disgruntled but where do he get a clear-sighted whole-hearted estimate of himself and he work who tell he of he real virtue he real fault among all he friend who be there man or woman who be brave enough to be true other man be soon shake into place they personal trait continually undergo a process of chiselling and adjustment they be tell uncomfortable thing how quickly at the club in the university in the market the ploughing-field the counting-room they rub up against each other and no mercy be show by man to man until primary sign of crudeness be wear off let a conceited professor get in a college chair watch a hundred student begin they delightful and salutary process of take he down by the sort of mirth in which college boy excel they unkindness be not right but the result be they never molest a man who be merely eccentric watch a scientific association jump with all fours upon a man who have just read a paper before they body how unsparingly they analyze and criticise he have to meet question opposition comment shaft of wit and envy jovial teasing and correction he go out from the meeting with a keener love of truth and exactness and a less exalted idea of he own power watch the rivalry and sparring that go on in any business man meet man who attack they they fight and overcome they or be themselves overcome human friction be not always harmful a minister should not be hurt or anger by disagreement and discussion no one 's idea be final let he expect to stand in the very midst of a high-strung spirited and hard-working generation let he be turn out of door let he travel look learn meet man and woman and conquer in the arena of manhood then by means of this undaunted manhood he may the better guide the fiery enthusiasm of man inspire they higher ambition and comfort they in they bitter human sorrow again too often a minister be spoil in he first charge by flattery polite lie and gush woman he be sadly overpraise a bright young fellow come from the seminary he can preach that be he can prepare interesting essay chiefly of a literary sort which be pleasant to listen to though in the nature of thing they can have scarcely a word in they of that deep life-giving experience and counsel which come from the heart of man and woman who have live and know the truth of life he be tell that these sermon be lovely beautiful _ so _ inspiring and he believe every word of praise no one say to he when you know more you will preach better and he standard of excellence do not advance this man who might have become a great preacher remain as year go on alas a intellectual potterer he be also socially make too much of be one of the very few man available for golf and afternoon tea supper picnic tennis charity-bazaar other man be frankly too busy for much of these thing except for healthful recreation and not infrequently one find stray minister absolutely the only man at some function to which man have be invite a minister be not a parlor-pet how many a time a energetic man society-bound must long to kick over a few afternoon tea-table and smash he way out through bric-à-brac and chit-chat to freedom and power i should think that a real man in the ministry would get so very tired of woman they tell he all they complaint and difficulty from headache servant and unruly child to they sentimental experience and they spiritual problem man tell he almost nothing watch any group of man talk as the minister come in a moment before they be eager alert argumentative now they be polite or mildly bore he be not of they world some assert that he be not even of they sex hence the lip of man be too often seal to the minister he must find some way not only to meet they as brother to brother but he must capture they inmost heart the shy confidence of a honorable man once win he friendship never fail the question of a minister 's relation to the woman of he congregation and the community be not only curious and complex -- it be a perpetual comedy how do other man in public life deal with this problem they have a genial but indifferent dignity quite compatible with courtesy and friendly way they shoulder responsibility they do not flirt they sort out crank they flee from simper they put down presumption if marry they laugh heartily with they wife over any letter or episode that be comical or sentimental if not marry they get out of thing the best way they know how with a sort of plain manly directness if a minister would arrogate to himself he free-born privilege of be a thorough-going man many of he trouble would disappear let he hold himself firmly aloof both from nonsense and from enervate praise let he dream of great theme and work for great thing let he rely on more quiet friend who watch loyally hope encourage inspire by and by the scale drop from he eye he see himself not as one who have already achieve but as one to whom the radiant gate of life be open so that he too can one day speak to human soul as the master have do he discover that out of the heart 's depths be great work bear this be a memorable day both for this man and for he church from that hour he have vision and power another error in ministerial education and outlook be that too often minister forget that they compete with other man : they be not a isolate class of humanity competition underlie the energy and efficiency of the world 's work when man do not consciously compete with other they inevitably drop behind what a minister be intend for be to stand head and shoulder above other man god seem to have plan the universe in such a way that everywhere the spiritual shall be supreme he be mean to be a towering leader who in other realm have excel mose joshua elijah david paul but if we consider the responsibility which be now be lay upon different class of people and carry by they i think that we must acknowledge that the statesman be loom up as the most influential and upbuilding man to-day he be the one who be adjust the new world-power and the new world-relation over-see the development of we country and planning for its law and commerce close to he come the physician who be lay he hand on world-plague and be study the condition and the form of disease with a view to striking disease at its root the hand of the doctor be lay upon consumption malaria yellow fever diphtheria typhoid fever and bubonic plague and the advance in medical research be marvellous the lawyer and the capitalist be together adjust the industrial relation of the country we have trust syndicate and corporation-problems handle with a firm intellectual grasp and a wide outlook over human affair the reading of the world be in the hand of editor of enterprise and sagacity they daily bring war statecraft business plan political situation trade opening scientific discovery form of church-work and philanthropy accident murder and marriage to we breakfast-table the press of to-day have a tremendous scope when some of the magazine come to hand one feel that he be in touch with the affair of the universe and have reading of a cosmic order the day-laborer be discover that to ingenuity talent and manliness the whole world swing open carnegie 's thirty partner most of whom have come from the working-rank demonstrate that a man can rise from the pick the spade the foreman 's duty to the control of great industrial interest banker be think out the financial problem -- currency legal tender the best form of money and authority the whole monetary system of the world be under consideration and analysis the farmer be learn through chemistry and other form of science new way of make he farm productive and the educate agriculturist be rise to be a intellectual factor in the development of we country everywhere we see life awakening -- a great renaissance have the minister as a thinker and active force of regeneration keep pace with this advance do many sermon thrill we in this large way where do he rank among the world-master of energy and power the ministry be suppose to be a work of save soul but if we could know the direct effect of preach and the conversion which be really due to preach i think we should find they comparatively few what touch the boy or girl man or woman and lead he or she to christ be not the sermon or pastoral talk though this one or another may have unite with the church after a special sermon revival or personal appeal it be the memory and influence of a mother 's prayer of early association of a teacher a lover a friend the conversion come direct from god -- the soul be act upon by some special moving of the holy spirit or it be the death of a friend a illness a accident a disappointment which turn the thought to heavenly thing or it be a book that search the soul 's depths or some quicken human experience be this quite as it should be be not professional pride arouse suppose that new york city should suddenly be invade by the bubonic plague or yellow fever would any one be to blame certainly such a outcry would go up as would echo across the country where be the quarantine officer where be the port physician where be the specialist who attend to sanitation and disinfection we say that divorce and sabbath-breaking be sweep over we country -- gamble social drinking and many other ill a sensational press a corrupt politics a materialistic greed all the minister under heaven can not take sin out of the world nor uproot sin altogether from the heart of man : the plague cony in at birth neither can all the doctor live remove disease so that no one will get sick or die but just as the doctor can by study by training by counsel by practice and by the direction of wise law-making protect the health interest of he country or community so the minister should stand yet more largely than to-day as a break-water between the world and the tide of sin he should not only be able to keep alive in a country a atmosphere of prayer devotion and unselfish service -- he should by god 's help make piety the general estate of the land he should not only be intellectually able to show the great advantage of the upright christian life he should straight-way lead all class into that life he should be able to lay a hand on the moral malady of mankind personal and national and prescribe effectual remedy take lame halt sinning soul and by god 's grace and spirit lift not only individual but whole community to a more spiritual plane this be a titanic intellectual task as well as a spiritual one when a doctor wish to keep plague out of america he go to asia to see what plague be he take microscope instrument and drug he bury himself in a laboratory and give he whole mind to the problem until one day he can come forth and tell how to heal and help more than this he risk he life for every great discovery in medical practice doctor and nurse have die martyr to they faithful work moral evil must be study in a energetic and intellectual way the variation of humanity from righteousness must be deeply understand look at booker t washington or at jacob a rii what daring what indefatigable toil what insight patience and swerveless hope have be put into they task edison be say to have spend six month hiss s into he phonograph to make it repeat that letter and many day he work seventeen hour a day have many minister ever bent themselves in this way to solve a special moral problem -- that of say a disobedient child in the congregation have they spend six month hour and hour a day to make the law of god the word obedience ring in that child 's ear spiritual guidance be definitely and positively a scientific task the mastery of one fact may lead to the correlation of a psychic law when a minister can help a soul to overcome temptation and a parent to bring up a child he be in touch with two final human problem as he gradually enlarge he careful and illuminating work he church become in time a body of spiritually well-educated communicant thoroughly ground in doctrinal ethical and social ideal well teach in public and in private duty it be not self-centred or wholly denominational in spirit but recognize itself to be a part of a catholic body of believer reach out with friendly coöperation to near-by church extend its missionary effort to other neighborhood or land and partake of a world-life a world-love ruling religious thinker should also by and by become leader of national thought and life great public question should be open to they judgment and appeal they should be moral arbiter and spiritual guide in national crisis by a word they should be able to rouse the prayer of the country and by a word to still widespread anger and uprising if accredit spiritual leader can not help who can there be a few man live who seem to hold for the whole world the temporal balance they control mine and shipping bank and trade who to-day hold the spiritual destiny of the world in he hand i long to see man appear upon whom the eye of the world shall be fasten in recognition of they spiritual preeminence as they be now fasten on these

would reveal new possibility of power and delight such a gift god have give we in we power to think what a mysterious and deep-hid gift it be nerve and sensation a few convolution in the brain act of

formulum which will produce it but just as marriage produce new life though we can not say how so study and meditation produce thought something new appear : a concept which be not with the race before the work of sage have be to rule the thinking of the race they receive the inspired idea and spend they life in teach they to other : in set up intellectual vibration throughout the world some day i hope sargent will paint a march of sage as gloriously as he have paint the panel of the prophet then we shall gaze upon the train of heavy-browed noble-eyed wise gentle-mannered man who have be

william of occam bede thomas à kempis francis bacon kant john stuart mill spencer -- with what dignity the processional move down the year the sum of human knowledge be vast but how much more vast seem the achievement of each of these man when we realize how few he year and how many the obstacle and impediment of he all too short career there be ever a pathos in the life of the wise by think we pass from the gossip of the neighborhood into the conversation of the year we do not know what alcibiade say to he man-servant about the care of he clothes bath perfume -- nor what he man-servant retail to other retainer of the eccentricity and vanity of he master but we know what pericle and plato say to the race here be the advantage of a think mind -- that at any moment one may enter into eternal subject of thought and have converse with those who of all time have be the most profound nothing tease the soul like the thought of the unfinished the imperfect the incomplete and yet when we have think and plan a really great and abiding work whether we ever finish it or not -- for many thing in life may intervene between conception and completion -- to have think of it be to have have in we life a pleasure that can never die for one bless hour or year we have be lift to the thought of god and have enter into the great original design hence it be that the life of the real thinker however broken or disturbed be at heart a life of serenity and joy what matter a conflagration a disappointment to he whose thought be set upon the race thinking be a form of vital growth we all wish for growth be there any one who wish to stay always just where he be to-day to be always what he be this morning the tree grow the flower grow the ideal of the race grow -- shall not i we be bear to a destiny which have no limit of grandeur save the limit of the thought of god the wish for growth be the wish to enter into the spiritual ideal of the universe -- to become one with its advancement one with its decree but do not the secular look upon growth as a sort of chase -- a chase for more learn more money a bigger business a higher degree a better position a brilliant marriage -- a struggle for wealth renown acclaim these thing be not in themselves growth nor its real index growth be not a form of avarice growth be a vital state of be growth be the assimilation of experience growth be development in the line of eternal purpose growth be the combination of we soul with the thing that be in such a way as to make a perpetual progress toward the thing that be to be we lose much because

formulate conclusion about they he be the first real thinker then air-philosophy and element-philosophy grow up -- beast-worship animalism fire-worship and the rudiment of simple scientific learning as for instance when man find that they could make a tool to cut a spike to sew since then what the sage have do be to teach man to see read write think count and to work to love ideal to love mankind and relate he work to human progress man 's first primer be near at hand when he wish to write he make a picture with a stick a stone on a leaf or trace he idea in the mud when he want to count he keep tally on he finger or with pebble from the beach or brook when he wish to communicate a idea orally it be with glance shrug gesture and imitative sound once in a game of twenty question this be the question set to guess : who first use the prehistoric root express a verb of action who indeed out of that leaf-writing and bark-etching and later rune have grow the print writings of mankind homer dante milton and shakespeare be the lineal descendant of the man who make hole in a leaf or line on a wave-washed sand out of the finger-counting have grow up book-keeping geometry mathematical astronomy and a knowledge of the higher curve out of the prehistoric shrug and sound and grimace we have oral speech -- much of it worthless and not all of it yet wholly intelligible we be still continually be understand to say what we never mean to say : we be forever put we private interpretation on the word of other man even yet we be all too stupid in we dreariest moment do there not come to we sometimes a voice which cry : up awake cease blinking and begin to see language be electric word have a curious power within themselves they rain upon the heart with the soft memory of century of old association or thought of love vigil and patience they have a power of suggestion which go beyond all that we may dream just as a man show in himself trace of a long-dead ancestry so word have the power to revive emotion of past generation and the experience of former year the man of letter the thinker strew a handful of word into the air breathe a little song the word spring up and bring forth fruit they seed be human progress and a larger life for man think for instance who first fling the word _ freedom _ into space -- _ gravitation evolution atom soul _ there be no power like the power of a word : a word like _ liberty _ can dethrone king we get out of a word just what we put into it plus the individuality of the man who use it some man read into noble word only they own silliness vulgarity prejudice or preconceived idea another man read with he heart open for new impression new insight new fancy and ideal word have not only they inherent meaning they have they ally meaning a word may mean one thing by itself it may mean quite another thing when another word stand beside it even mark of punctuation give word a curiously different sound and shade literature be a mastery not only of the mood of man but of the mood of word corot take a stream some grass and tree a flitting patch of sky by means of a few stroke of he brush he manage to present that tree sky stream in a way which suggest the pastoral experience of the age where do that misty veil come from the tremble light and shadow the half-heard sound and silence of the wood the change cloud the dim reflection the atmosphere of mystery and peace so each man go to the dictionary he take a word here a word there common word that everybody know he put they together : the result be a presentation of the life of man and lay hold of he inmost spirit _ we birth be but a deep and a forget the soul that rise with we we life 's star have have elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trail cloud of glory do we come from god who be we home _ to write the soul choose and god stand ever by to help that be why great work always impress we as inspire god do it it be god who whisper the deathless thought and phrase : the subtler collocation be divine take the word _ star _ to the child it mean a bright point that glitter and twinkle in the sky and set he say a old nursery rhyme to the youth or maiden it suggest love romance a summer eve or a frosty walk under the friendly winter sky to the rhetorician it suggest a figure of speech -- the star of hope to the mariner it suggest guidance and the homeward port to the astronomer it mean the world in which he live he life be centre in that star to the poet it mean all these thing and many more for the poet be the one who in he own heart hold all the meaning that word hold for the race read again the line just quote and think of wordsworth 's outlook on the star the dictionary definition of a word can seldom be the real one nor do it reveal the deeper sense it have it blaze a path for the understanding but individual thought must follow take the word _ time friendship work play heroism _ it take carlyle to define time for we emerson have define friendship let the light and shadow of the thought of carlyle and emerson play upon these word they be at once remove from mechanical definition and we dimly perceive that each word be larger than the outreach of the thought of man another generation than ours shall define and refine they in heaven in some other aeon we shall find out what they really mean thus knowledge be not permanent it reel it proceed it change it be iridescent with new significance from day to day what be true of a word and what we make of it be true of every phase of learn the black-board be not all learning be not tie to it or to any one person demonstration interpretation event or epoch no wise man can keep he learn to himself and yet he can not though he teach a thousand year transmit he deeper learn to another the atmosphere the casual information the spiritual magnetism of a great man will teach better than the text-book the lecture course and the formal resource of academic hall thus mark hopkin be in himself a university give a boy on the other end of the log on which he sit it be the relativity of knowledge that dance before the eye that bewilder elude evade group-system and elective seem like a makeshift for the real thing we can not tie a fact to a pupil because to the tail of the fact be tie history itself until a pupil get a glimpse of that relation that dependence of which we have just hear with all that have yet happen in connection with it he be not yet quite master of he fact he recite glibly the date of thermopyla and do not know that all greece be trail behind he desk when after subsequent research he know something of greece he discover greece to be dovetail into rome and egypt and they lay hold upon the plain of shinar and eden and the immemorial prehistoric year ah no we never really know every fact recede from we as might a ebbing wave and leave we strand upon a unhorizoned beach more despairing than before education do not solve the problem of life -- it deepen the mystery what then may the sage know be there no sage and have we all be misinform a sage be one who know what in he position of life be most necessary for he to know the larger sage the great sage be the one who know what be necessary for the race to know it be a wrong idea of wisdom that we must necessarily know what some one else know wisdom be single-track for each man there be in the world those who know how to build aqueduct and to bake _ charlotte russe _ and to sew trousers aqueduct and tailor work may be alike out of my individual and personal knowledge yet i may not necessarily be a ignorant man the primitive hunter stand in the forest for he to be a hunting-sage be to know the weather trap weapon the time and the lair and way of beast he know lion and monkey the coil serpent and the serpent that hiss by the ruin wall the way of the wolf the jackal and the kite the manners of the bear and the black panther in the jungle-wilds kipling be the brother of that early man : he be a forest-sage and would have hold he own in other time the sea-sage be the one who could toss upon the swan-road without fear he know the strength of oak and ash the swing of oar the curve of prow the dash of wave and the curl breaker 's sweep he know the maelstrom and the aegir that sweep into northern fiord the thunder and wind and tempest the cove safe harbor and retreat to-day the sea-sage rule the fishing-boat the ocean liner the coastwise steamer and the lake-line of the world the fishing-sage know the way and haunt of fish he be wise in the salmon the perch the trout the tarpon and the muscalonge he say to-day the bass will bite on dobson but to-morrow we must have frog no sagacity be universal but the love of sagacity may be the man who start out to implant a new way of education have a noble task before he but be it a final one or even a more than tolerably practical one be there such a thing as a place for truth at wholesale even in a academy or college can a man receive a education outside of himself he may be play upon by grammar and by loci-paper by electrical machine and parse table and grecian accent by the name of note author and statesman and the thrill of historic battle and decision he may be place under a rain of ethical and philosophic idea and may be force to put on a system of think as man put on a mackintosh but he true education be what he make of these thing if he hear of theodoric with a yawn we say -- the college-folk -- he must be imbecile no not imbecile he may become a successful toreador or snake-charmer which thing be out of we line and a man may be a upright citizen a good husband and a sincerely religious man who have never hear of francesca nor fra angelico nor name the name of botticellus the moment we set bound to wisdom we find that we have shut something out wisdom be the free active life of a grow and attach soul we must not only attach information to ourselves we must assimilate it else we be like a crab which should drag about descarte or as a ocean sucker which should hug a copy of thucydide education be the take to one 's self so far as one may in a lifetime all that the race have learn through these six thousand year education be not a thing of book alone or school it be a process of intellectual assimilation of what be about we or what we put about ourselves at every step we have a choice this be the real difference between student at the same school or university one put away greek and the other lay up football and college society a third get all three be a little more swift and alert one stow away insubordination -- another order and obedience one do quiet original work of reading and research the other stow away scheme for get through recitation and examination no two student ever come out of the same school college or shop with the same education they training may have be measurably alike but the result be immeasurably unlike education in the last analysis be get the highest intellectual value out of one 's environment and opportunity there be a cow-boy philosopher a kitchen-philosopher as truly as there be a philosopher of the academic hall conduct be the _ pon asinorum _ of life wise man somehow cross it though stumblingly and with tear fool usurer oppressor and spendthrift of life be leave gaping and wrangle on the hellward side thinker have always be climb up on each other 's shoulder to look over into the beyond what they have see they have tell some man climb so high into the ethereal place of the ideal that they do not get down again they be the impractical man a impractical man be not necessarily the educate man he be the man at the top of some intellectual fence who wish to come down but have absent-mindedly forget that he have leg the leg be not absent but he wit be so with the impractical man in every sphere education have not really remove he common-sense as some say he power to connect pass event with they cause and to act reasonably but it have set he thought on some other thought for the time be and the dinner-bell we will say do not detach he from he inquiry he necktie ride up he go out into the street without a hat let he alone till he prove the worth of what he be about the practical man who hear the dinner-bell and pride himself upon this fact may not hear sound far-off and clear that ring in the impractical man 's ear and that may sometime tell he how to make a better dinner-bell or provide a better dinner -- a great social philosophy -- for the race the really impractical man be not he who reach out to the intellectual and ideal aspect of life it be he who live as if this life be all there be woman who make pet of they clothes as man make pet of horse or dog they have just time enough in life to dress themselves up look back over they year they can only say i have have clothes in the same number of year with no greater advantage or opportunity other woman have become the queenly woman of the race some woman be gird with century instead of gold or gem whenever they appear the event become historic what they do add new lustre to life we be all prodigal we throw away time and strength and year and gold and then weep that we be ignorant and embeggared at the last who shall teach we wisdom and in what manner may we be wise what say the sage of the vast possibility of the race with one voice they say : be brave do not cower shrink or whine throw out upon the world a free fearlessness of thought and word and deed courage freedom heroism faith exactness honor justice and mercy -- these trait have be hand down as the traditional learning of the heart of man another ideal of the race be law we have give up a chaos-philosophy -- the haphazard continuity of event -- a cometary orbit for the world there be fixed relation everywhere existent : the succession of cycle be orderly and prearranged another ideal be progress we be move not toward the bottom but toward the top of possibility we reject annihilation because then there be nothing left and there must always be something leave -- progress -- a bigger something a better something should annihilation be the truth of thing and all the race mortal then some day there would be a last man and after the last man what he would die and then all that any of the other star could view of the vast panorama of we earthly generation would be a unburied corpse with not even a vulture hover to pick it to freshness in the air a last man no instead the seer have show we a great multitude in a heavenly country praise god and singing forth he name forever immortality brood over the great thought of the race all great mind look upward to it : it be the final consummation of we dream another ideal be social adjustment and social service we must do something for some one or we cast current sagacity behind the back people crowd each other to the wall the weak of community and nation be too often crushed redress be in the air the longed-for wisdom of to-day show a kaleidoscopic front in which be turn the slum-dweller and the millionaire the white man the yellow and the black the town and the territorial possession the slave-colony garbage-law magistrate and murderer be mix in motley and there be whirling vacant-lot scheme abroad potato-patches wood-yard organize charity wayfarer ' lodge resounding cry of municipal reform and various other interest of the wisdom-scale hence wisdom have not yet be arrive at : we be still on the run this twentieth century will find new problem new query new crank and new dismay one thing however shine out clear : wisdom be be recognize as have a moral aspect and man be look for a religion which shall sum up the learning of the sage the information of the race when we look down into the physical universe the primary thing that we find there be gravitation when we look into the moral universe the primary thing that we find there be also gravitation -- a sink to a lower this be sin -- a contrariness of thing -- which make the world a evil place to live in instead of a good which wreck character and state eat the heart out of culture and civilization destroy strong race leave a stain upon even the youngest child and which be constantly draw the race downward instead of upward sin sin sin everywhere the fact glare upon we and can not be hide or put away sin be not a intellectual toy for philosopher to play with or define as a limitation of be sin be a reality for man to feel recoil from and of which one must repent sin be energy deliberately misplace : energy direct against the course of thing the infinite development the will of god sin be corruption and desolation and decay death brood over the spirit of man unless a redeemer come the unredeemed age hang over history like a pall in they there be monumental oppression cruelty and crime the breath of myriad million go out in darkness and there be none to save a plague sweep over all the race hence even scientifically consider the final aim of think must be to arrive at some thought which will take hold of this primary fact of sin and uproot it which will show how the world may be purge of sin slowly but inevitably we be move to this great thought it be sum up in one word : redemption the watchword of a century ago be gravitation it explain the poise of the universe by a great and hitherto undiscovered law the watchword of yesterday be evolution it explain progressive change : the mounting-up of life through spire of form the form of the universe be see in a series which be in the main ascendant and in which the survivor be supreme the watchword of to-morrow be redemption the thinker will some day live who will make that great word redemption stand out in all its vast majesty and significance this i take it be the work of we new century redemption be the explanation of the existence of man of he present progress and he future destiny it be the great mystery of joy in which the race partake the spiritual culmination of all thing earthly the forecast of eternal thing yet to be redemption be not a dogma it be a life redemption be a perpetual and ascendant moral growth it mark a world-balm a world-change it be in the spirit of man that it work and not in he outer condition or external striving it be ultimately to root sin out of the world through stormy sorrow and perpetual desolation come the race to god zion be the whole of thing -- the encompassment of space and time and endless year -- a environment of immortality and peace virtue lead the race to joy and there be no byway to this height the final aspect of the universe be joy joy be elemental -- a vast vibration that sweep through century as year a day in he court be as a thousand and a thousand year be as one day because they thrill with a immortal and imperishable emotion the seraph and cherubim sandalphon and azrael be angel of endure joy joy be the soul 's share of the life of god thus when the world have breathe to we the holy name of christ it have tell we the highest that it know the march of sage be toward a redeemer the banner of wisdom be furl about the cross iv the world-march : of trader -lrb- amsterdam -rrb- _ lo my soul look forth abroad and mark the busy stir : wouldst thou say in pride and scorn we god be

transport from sea to sea the cedar oak and pine : build the bridge and plant the town enter every open mart make we nation 's commerce flow -- but this be not we heart many a prayer uplift spring

we king _ anna robertson brown lindsay we be all trader each of we be endowed with some faculty ware or possession which he be constantly exchange for other thing we trade time talent service goods acre produce counsel experience ideal the world be in reality a bourse of exchange each of we bring some day he special product to the common mart there be trader and trader -- the just and the unjust -- the man of honor and the rogue we set value on thought and on transaction on merchandise and on philanthropy on idea and on account and there be a constant distribution of the affair as well as of the worldly goods of man but in a restricted sense we think of trade as the exchange of produce which be material and mobile -- which may be touch handle weigh transport buy and sell the substance of the earth be constantly take new shape before we eye be rearrange in kaleidoscopic combination and transport from port to port from town to town from sea to sea one can look nowhere without see this ceaseless activity progress everywhere there be a whir of wheel a plash of wave a din of assembly as the new combination take place there be a day when trade be a thing of here-and-there a thing of

exchange a very little suffice the poor the rich be house in palace and panoply in gem as time go on the processional of trader become a processional lead out in turn by the merchant of one city after another it be a picturesque study that of the trade-route of the middle age there be the mediterranean seaboard and there be the baltic town and the hanse town the portuguese mariner and trader the venetian merchant prince there be the spanish colonial trade the dutch trade of the east indy the trade of amsterdam and london there be the elizabethan sea-rover then come the british trade in the east indy and the gradual growth of the trade of france germany england and the united state this be a story of human want reach out as civilization advance and of the extend of the earth-exchange everywhere there have be a correspondence between national prosperity and increase trade to-day each man demand more of the earth 's product than ever before he reach out a hand for comfort and luxury as well as for necessity he grasp not only the produce of he own and he neighbor 's field and vineyard but demand what lie across continent and sea instead of the ship the camel and the ass we now have the ocean freighter or liner and the fly train of car : new force oil steam electricity and water-power do the carry work of man and hence trade have become trade and each trader be involve in the comfort success and prosperity of many other a single commercial transaction to-day involve the life of hundred of thousand compete for they toil and life-blood carry the decision of they destiny a great merchant be the real kris kringle he stand at the center of exchange distribute from the tropics and the arctic zone he deal out fur and feather book toy clothing engine ribbon lace silk perfume bread-stuffs sugar cotton iron ice steel wheat flour beef stone lumber drug coal leather he scatter periodically the product of mill and loom of shoe-shop and print-works field factory mine and of art-worker he thus become a social force of great power a social law-giver in fact under he iron rule the life of the mass be uplift or cast down as large era open the ethical ideal become higher we be begin to inquire as never before into the basis of trade the place of the trader the right conduct of this vast problem of distribution upon which hinge so much of human life and fate all thing look not only to the integration of trade but to its exaltation trade have cease to be a thing of individual energy talent and commercial alertness it have rise to great proportion the large trader be in control of national conduit as well as of national expense there be a great deal more in business than the art of make money business be at the root a way of make nation of develop the resource of a country of handle its industry of protect its commerce of enlarge its institution of uplift its training aspiration and ideal traffic be educational import influence the national life we may import opium or bible whiskey or bread-stuffs locomotive or dancing pig the sceptre hold by tyre and venice be pass into we own hand but trade to-day be a matter of the imagination as well as of the stock-book 11 need a great imagination to handle the present-day problem of business and finance the prosperity of a nation depend largely on the intelligence integrity and magnanimity of its business man to be narrow-minded in business be not only intellectual astigmatism it be poor commercial policy to make use of present opportunity to control present advantage need a great education and a large human experience it be the man of insight of sympathy of economic ideal who will lastingly control we national prosperity and advance we industrial wealth with all this demand the business man still stand largely in a class by himself a class apart from the great leader of the world he be not yet receive into the spiritual circle of the race he go about the world sit on board and committee fill directorship and trusteeship pay pew-rent and run town but when the spiritual conclave of the world take place when the thing of life and death be inquire into when word be say of the higher conduct of the life of man if he draw near inquiringly or unguardedly to the sacred place scholar and poet priest saint and proud hand-worker alike rise up and say go away it wear upon the heart -- this spiritual isolation of the business man do not he often say sadly to himself they only want my money why must he go away what have he do that he must be wave down if we discover why he must go away we shall discover the meaning of that great caste-line which have long be draw and ought no longer to be draw between trade and letter trade and the church trade and social prestige the reason he must go away be this : he have never rule the higher history of man he do not yet quite belong to the ideal-maker of the race understand i be not now speak of the new business man the exceptional one upright culture altruistic whom you and i may know i be speaking of a broad class-line a class distinction it be a strange concept that would bar the business man from the ideal that would limit he life to a account-book a ledger a roll of stock rent and possession instead of grant he the freedom of the universe the privilege of minister to the race singularly enough the business class be the last class that christianity have set free slave have be give liberty woman social companionship and intellectual equality manual labor have be lift to dignity and honor but to break the shackle of the man of trade be the work of we era or of a era yet to come thousand of young man be daily step into counting-house or behind sales-counter or into independent store who will never lift they eye from they goods and account-book nor rise above the linen hardware grocery or house-fixture which they sell such a situation be suicidal of national prosperity and block the high hope of the world lack of appreciation of the life of business be sinful and unjust a high-principled businessman may be one of the noblest leader of mankind the world need great business man -- man who will know how to use the resource of a country how to plan for its industry manufacture and commerce : man who understand the principle of production and exchange way of transportation system of credit and banking : man who know the constitution of the country and the history of its development its strength and weakness its possibility and need : man who will deal honorably in business contract both with buyer and employee and also with law-making body : man who will steadily try to advance international prosperity as well as personal wealth but to understand business on this plane and to conduct it in this large way need a fine education a education build first of all on a practical basis such as the education of we common school then should follow a course in the ideal of the race the classic study in language literature history science and philosophy then should come a technical course graduate or undergraduate such as the course offer by the university of pennsylvanium chicago wisconsin which include in general lecture and special study in public law and politics business law and practice political economy statistics bank finance and sociology in addition to this there should be a thorough knowledge of the bible and of christian ethic with a deep heart-experience of religion endowed with natural business talent the young man who go out into the world with such preparation as this know a great deal more than just how to make money he know how to make it honorably and how to spend it in he business family and social life for the public good he have in he the making of a statesman and a philanthropist as well as a man of wealth two thing take one into the inner circle of the ideal-maker of the race -- imagination and sympathy ideal can not be buy with gold the ideal be always found on integrity progress and common-sense it be preëminently practical as well : the thing that inevitably must be now or hereafter however man laugh it to scorn to-day imagination be the faculty of perceive the higher and final relation of life the relation of one 's work to the progress of the world and of one 's conduct : to spiritual history what the ideal-maker try to do be to set holy standard that shall not pass away : to do abide work in think deed word work philosophically plan and perseveringly carry out work which he shall do regardless of the outer circumstance of he life -- poverty or wealth of threat misunderstand or hoot of scorn he be unmoved both by the rage of the populace and by its most tumultuous applause he live for truth not for personal advance for progress not for wealth or honor what he lay down as a precept that he try to live up to in the way that shall win the approval of the eternal year sordidness in commercial life be not necessary : greed be not foreordain christianity establish a new system of trading-philosophy and a new basis of commercial ethic there be a god-like way of trade -- christ might himself have buy and sell -- else christianity fail of its full mission and there remain a class of the socially lose of the ethically unsaved one reason why it be so hard to get business man into the church or to interest they religiously in any way be that minister in general do not understand or appreciate business man in one of the most stir sermon i ever hear occur this unjust sentence : we country have be build up by the martyr and not by the millionaire no we country have be build up by _ both _ the martyr and the millionaire christianity project into the world new ideal of trade of gain of competition value and return for toil what be trade be it merely a way of make money then there be no ethical basis for it the amount of money which be need for a good life say aristotle be not unlimited one concept be : trade be something which belong to I it be that part of the world 's exchange which i can get under my personal control it be the balance between human industry and human need which i hold for my part of the world and which other be continually try to wrest from I and which i must keep by all means fair or foul competition be the battle of the strongest the quickest the meanest i must know trick i must get in with people get hold of some sort of pull learn to dissemble to flatter manipulate hedge dodge success be a matter of be sly anything be allowable which come out ahead which add to the dollar-pile or which make the loudest advertising noise to buy at the least and sell at the most regardless of the condition under which least and most be attain -- the man who enter life with this idea of trade in he mind might just as well be bear a shark and live to prey every free dollar in the world will tease and fret he until he see it on its way to he own pocket if this be all there be in trade the noble-minded will let it alone : it give no human outlook it not only undermine personal character it be the root of national ignominy and dishonor what have christianity to do with this shark-instinct with the rapacity which look on the world as a vast grabbing-ground and upon all natural resource as mere commercial prey the value of christianity lie in its reasonable and intellectual appeal it do not spring upon one like a highwayman and say hand up give I you purse it say gently son give I thy heart it then proceed to refashion that heart to fill it with new principle and with world-dream trade be a just exchange of what one man have for what another man need it may take place individually between man and man in which transaction a horse a ox or a tool may change hand or one man may assume a responsibility for a number of people and say : i will give this whole town shoe in return for which you may give I a house market-produce clothing and a education for my child the thing will come out even if you and i be honest or a climate a civilization may give to another that which the other lack we send school-book and machinery to china she send we tea matting and bamboo the whole right theory of trade be a give-and-take between man and nation base on a just price and with a deep law of value not yet wholly formulate underlie each transaction bargain should not be one-sided trade in a large sense be a way of exchange in which each party to the trade receive a advantage not only this it be a process of distribution by which each one receive the greatest possible advantage money-making be a secondary result : in true trade it be not the final benefit take the case of a specially helpful and pay book the author receive a royalty and have a income the publisher receive he profit and make a live the public gain inspiration and ideal who be loser this be sheer business yet it mean loving service for all concern to illustrate further : a physician have a frail child with which the ordinary milk in the market do not agree to build up its health he buy a country place and a good cow the child thrive in he practice he see many other frail child and it occur to he that they too can be benefit by the same kind of care and watchfulness that he be give he own child he buy more cow have they scientifically care for and he agent sell the milk he find himself in the course of time the owner of a dairy farm and a man of increase income but he trade be not trade for the sake of money it be trade to make sick child strong and well he exchange professional knowledge executive ability and human sympathy for money in return for which child receive health parent joy and the race a more athletic set of man and woman this be a instance of the inner spirit of the true trade : the spirit which may rule all trade deny it or discount it or scorn it as you will price be a value set on material on labor on interest on scarcity on excellence on commercial risk it be the approximate measure of the cost of production the ethical price of a commodity be the price which would enable its producer to produce it under healthful and happy condition -- which would insure he have what dr patten call he economic rights this joyous exertion be not harmful it be tonic excellence be a inspiration a intoxication let excellence not will-it-pass be the standard of exchange from the very endeavor after excellence come a certain exaltation of spirit which ennoble the least fragment of daily toil when the producer bring forth somewhat for sale let he say : there that be the best that i can do it be not what i try to make of it -- the thing of my dream -- but it be the very best which under the give condition i could produce then the shoddy side of trade will disappear the law of equity be the final law of trade but in whose hand be equity who appraise value who set price in whose hand be the final price of the necessaries of life -- wheat rice sugar soap cotton wool coal milk iron lumber ice the man who put a price on a article as buyer or seller enter a arena which be not only commercial -- it be judicial and ethical : he declare for what amount a man 's life-blood shall be use no one absolutely set price it be determine by far-reaching industrial condition and by economic law war weather famine stock strike election all have a say yet to a certain degree there be those who rule price as a representative of the ideal as executor of social trust how shall each one use he power of price the man who have control of a price -- a price for a day 's labor for wages for a cargo or for any kind of product -- have control of the living condition of the one who work for he the question be not : how shall i grind down price to the lowest it be : what price will be a ethical return to this man for he social toil -- just to I for my brain my capital my energy my distribute power -- just to he for he brain he time he skill he artistic perception he fidelity and honor each buyer must henceforth not only resolve : i will buy only what i can pay for but what i can pay for at a just rate so far as lie in my power i will make a adequate return to society for this personal benefit some one say : do you realize that you be make a moral laughing-stock of much of we system of trade that you be set a axe to that system more cut than the axe of any socialist nihilist or anarchist in the world oh no i have simply set myself to answer the question : how can the business man stand among the ideal-maker of the world so that he shall no more in spiritual assembly be tell to go away woman be the real economic distributer the millionaire manufacturer imagine that he himself run he business oh no it be run by farmer ' wife when they do not care for yarn or calico he loom stand idle for a year the vast machinery of the world turn on woman 's little word : _ i want _ hence the education of woman should include this factor : the desire to want the right thing extravagance be not a part of woman 's make-up it be extraneous _ gain be that which permanently enrich the life _ by every act of charity or justice or insight or right barter the soul be make more grand true trade everywhere may be make a new method of inspiration growth and power money be a makeshift of the race god be the only real appraiser and we never get back a money-value for we soul 's toil whether we pass wampum or nickel or tael or bank-check we be not yet pay for we trade the higher value of money be its spiritual capacity not what it will bring I be primarily important but what i can buy with it for the race sometimes the question come over I : what be i trading for money my time my energy my ideal part of my soul be pass from I : do dollar ever repay hence it come about that all money transaction be fragmentary and symbolic money may lead to poverty or to spiritual wealth the gift of trade be a gift of god as much as the gift of prophecy or song in a right way we should all love gain we be not bear to go out of the world as poor as when we come into it we should gain stature wisdom strength influence ideal if we latent business capacity be more fully arouse we should get much more out of life we would refuse to barter a spiritual heritage for carnal thing we trade thought and feeling but it be very hard to trade fine impulse with those who be intrinsically vulgar they treasury be empty of spiritual coin and they storehouse contain no world-thought we can send a caravan across the desert a ship across the sea but we can not send a think into a flaccid or a pompous brain we trade position and influence the evil of the spoil system be not that one get something for something -- it be that one get something for something less or for nothing whatever we have to give may be rightly give the wrong come when we give it to the idle or unworthy when we trade political preferment for high merit both the office-holder and the country be gainer by the exchange marriage be the great mart of exchange here the possession of one sex be set up against those of the other everywhere marriage be speak of as a good or a bad bargain each man shall say : sweetheart in myself i offer you the treasure of manhood i give strength courage magnanimity action protection and the indomitable will each wife should say : dear in I be all gentleness courtesy beauty grace patience mercy and hope i too be brave but my courage be of the heart i too be strong-willed but my will be deep-set in love as year go on there come a time when love say : between we now there be neither mine nor thine the universe be ours together human love be not all there be yet a higher impulse the most business-like question that ever touch the heart of man be this : for what shall i trade my soul we hold we soul high : we perceive that eternity itself be not too much to ask and hence the highest barter be that of the earthly for the spiritual of the temporal for the unseen and eternal we say give I god give I heaven give I divine and sacrificial love and i will give my heart and thus the last transaction be between god and the soul godliness be great gain and to exchange earth for heaven be a satisfying and unregretted trade iv the world-march : of worker -lrb- armagedon -rrb-

the creation of either material or immaterial product the digging of the soil preparatory to raise a corn-crop be work the making of broom the writing of fugue there be no one who do not work at one time or another and a man 's social value depend largely upon the amount of work that he can do even the energy which be seemingly apply to destructive task be really subsidiary to a constructive ideal thus the hewing of timber be a destructive task but its object be not to scatter tree around but to make a clearing on which to plant wheat or to have lumber in order to build a house so also we blast rock in order to get stone for a stone wall or for the filling of a road-bed and we rip up old clothes in order to have rag and to make room in we home for other thing destructiveness from a sheer love of destructiveness be not work -- it be vandalism the true man work when adam 's crook-stick turn over the brown earth to make it fertile he begin the industry of the world the whole horizon of man 's endeavor be span by one word work it have build city bridge river unite continent and send the myriad spindle of trade whir under a thousand change sky work be the open-sesame of success it be curious to see how uneasily some man will roam from one end of the earth to the other try to find a easy place a place where work will not be need or require there be no such place the higher the honor the harder the work the power to work be ordinarily the measure of a man 's possibility of success long hour hard toil lack of recognition and appreciation drudgery a thousand attempt to one successful issue -- these be the way in which the colossal achievement of mankind have be build up work as have well be say be a ascend stairway on its broad base be range all the multitude of the earth those who can climb mount the higher and ever-narrowing stair the great man can begin anywhere or with any task he say if i be go into the giant-business i may as well begin now bear and breed in the forest he lay hand to he axe and look up at some tall oak cry out i will begin here with the first stroke of the axe success be not less sure than in he last endeavor success of the right kind be a scientific achievement the line have not yet be draw and i doubt whether it ever can be draw between productive and non-productive labor there be a cleavage of task however which may be approximately express as work that be do for support for daily bread and work which be do because certain faculty of mind and heart and soul demand expression development and scope we all have power which be willing to be set in action primarily for self-preservation -- for personal material and transitory end we be also endow with faculty which react primarily in behalf of universal aim though that may not debar they from also bring a advantage to ourselves in proportion as we be talented magnanimous and high-minded we delight in spend a part of we life in work for the race thus thoreau when he by survey carpentry and day-labor of various other kind have earn $ 1334 be do income-work the work by which he have to live for the same purpose he work at raise potato green corn and pea when he write _ walden _ he do a kind of work which also in time bring he a income but he do not write _ walden _ for food or money he write it primarily because he like to write and for the benefit of mankind in order to be contented and happy each normal adult human be must have at least the chance of do these two kind of work unless he or she can do income-work he or she be not economically independent unless he can do universal work he be not socially and spiritually free much of the present-day discontent be owe to the fact that these two kind of work be not represent as they should be in every working-life the problem in regard to the working-man be not how to pet he nor to patronize he but how to educate he and inspire he he be not a parasite to be feed by the capitalist nor be the capitalist a parasite upon the working-power of the working-man both be man the problem be how shall the capitalist lead the noblest most public-spirited and helpful life in relation to those in he employ how shall the working-man lay hold on the best that life can give how shall he find a work which he be competent to do and like to do and may be support by do -- and at the same time have a chance to grow to enter into the large free culture-life of the world the complaint of the working-man when really analyze run down to this : i do income-work but it do not bring I bread enough to live not only that but ground down as i be by toil all possibility of the larger universal work be shut away from I my faculty be atrophy -- paralyzed -- and hence my soul smoulder with deep and angry discontent this ceaseless and sordid anxiety for bread cut I out of my world-life my world-toil i can not do scientific research-work or write the book and papers that i ought my universal labor be interrupted : i can not be happy until i can take up this larger work again as the trade of civilization advance the meaning of bread change the university professor no less than the day-laborer find he income too small for he and say i too do income-work which do not bring I bread book travel society a summer home and surroundings which be not only decent and sanitary but refined and beautiful be it not also the source of the discontent to-day among almost all class of woman except the most highly educate and efficient woman say -- we modern daughter wife and mother : in the home we do income-work for which we do not receive income when stranger do this work they be pay and we be not in addition many a woman be so bind down by daily task that she whole soul cry out and we hear of the high rate of insanity among farmer ' wife of nervous prostration of the housewife in we town and become accustomed to such expression as the death of a woman on a kansas farm this discontent take many restless form it lead daughter who ought to be at home out into morally dangerous but income-earning work it take wife out into all manner of club without regard to the fact : as to whether the particular club in its atmosphere and influence be good or bad it bring discouragement disorder and unrest into the home dissatisfaction with house-duty and home-task and be sap we life where it should be best and strongest -- in the home -- take out of it youth spirit enthusiasm inspiration and content the three question ask in regard to each worker be : 1 what work can he do 2 of what quality 3 in what time the difference between industry and idleness be that work be one thing which no one may honorably escape since it must be do the problem of life be not how to escape work but how to find the right work and how best to do it and most swiftly when the choice be make _ forth they come from grief and torment on they wend toward health and mirth all the wide world be they dwelling every corner of the earth buy they sell they for thy service try the bargain what ` tis worth for the day be march on these be they who build thy house weave thy raiment win thy wheat smooth the rugged fill the barren turn the bitter into sweet all for thee this day -- and ever what reward for they be meet till the host come march on _ william morris second the trade of toil for money have lead to many problem and discussion to-day the trenchant question : what more than wages be a matter of eager talk be this a living-wage -- just enough warmth not to freeze just enough clothing to be decent just enough food to go through the day without actual hunger just enough shelter to keep out the wind and rain and snow just enough education to learn to read and write and count no as the theory of bodily freedom demand for each man life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so the highest theory of to-day lay down demand of economic freedom beyond the mere fad of possible existence dr patten have formulate certain economic rights of man each employer must say : before i settle back with a serene belief that i have give my man a living-wage let I ask : have they sun air sanitary surroundings and condition medical care leisure education a chance to grow have they enough money for ordinary occasion and a little to give away no man or woman have a living-wage who have no money to give away education and comfort add to the value of the employ the cook who have a rocking-chair a cook-book and a housekeeping magazine in she kitchen will do more work and better work other thing be equal than the cook who have none the workman who live in a clean sunny well-aired place where he can find a home and bring up healthy child will do more work and better work than the workman who live in a damp dark ill-ventilated tenement and who go to he day 's work with a heart sullen and broken because of avoidable illness and sorrow in he poor little home five thousand employee who have a night-school luncheon-room little house and garden a savings-bank and a library of book and picture be worth more than those who be give no such advantage of happiness growth and content the railroad young man 's christian association be say to be a good economic investment as well as a uplifting moral influence this appear to be a fundamental economic law : _ every physical mental or spiritual advantage offer to a honest work man or woman increase he economic efficiency _ therefore even the selfish policy of shrewd corporation to-day be to screw up and not down while the more philanthropic be begin to see in they social power a luminous opportunity to do a god-like service but the capitalist however just or generous can not do for a man what he can not or will not do for himself too many worker imagine that a living-wage be to be give to each man no matter how he behave or work this be a false assumption underlie all human effort there run a final law that of compensation : _ what i earn i shall some day have _ this be a very different proposition from this : _ what i do not earn i want to have _ for every stroke of human toil the universe assign a right reward -- a reward not of money only but of peace of heart joy and the possibility of helpfulness but when the work do have not be do faithfully or well or honestly or in the right spirit the reward be lessen to that exact degree to the end of time the idle and the lazy must if they be dependent on they own exertion be ill house and feed if a man waste or he wife do he must not complain that he income will not support he if he let opportunity of sustenance and advancement go by the capitalist be not to be hold to account there be two chief kind of economic difficulty one be the problem of the capitalist : how much ought i to pay the second be that of the working-man : how much service must i render how much ought i to be pay of the second kind nearly every phase of it begin right here that man and woman demand for labor something which they have not earn they do careless indifferent shiftless reckless work and then demand a living-wage the capitalist be not incline to raise he scale of price know that he have build up he business by prudence sagacity and tireless application -- the very quality which he dissatisfied employee lack we need not pay -- we ought not to pay -- for incompetence for impertinence for disobedience of order for laziness for shirk for cheating or for theft to do so be a social wrong it be the wrong that lie back not only of sinecure and spoil but of employ incompetent and wasteful cook and dressmaker what we make of we life through wages depend upon ourselves for instance a man give each of five boy twenty-five cent for sweeping snow off he sidewalk one boy toss penny and lose he quarter by gamble one boy buy cigarette and send he money up in smoke one boy buy newspaper and sell they at a profit which buy he he dinner a fourth boy buy seed plant they and raise a tiny garden which keep he in bean for a whole season the fifth boy buy a book which start he on the career of a educate man : he become a inventor and a man of mean the man who pay out the twenty-five cent to each boy be in no way responsible for the success or failure of they investment of this quarter he be responsible only for the fact that he do or do not pay a fair price for the work god the great paymaster give to each of we the one talent the two talent or the ten talent of endowment and opportunity : after that we be leave to we own device there be four thing which every employee should constantly bear in mind if he wish to advance -- skill business opportunity loyalty and control until a man have master what he have to do he can not be expect to be account a serious factor in the economic world the moment he achieve skill in what he have to do -- and this be a question of thoroughness accuracy and speed -- he have achieve power a possibility of dictation in the matter of hour and wages the next point be business opportunity two man of exactly the same opportunity and endowment take up the same task one man idle and be surpass by the other or he do only what he be tell to do without further think the other perform he set task but at the same time he be examine into the principle of he engine or into the conduct of the factory or business in a few year he be the foreman or a inventor or a partner with independent capital of he own again there be a blind way of do skilled work or of merely do it without notice where it be most need or how the market be go for this special kind of work the one who have he eye open read note the state of the market add to he skill the power of counsel and can gradually take a larger responsibility upon he which will advance the economic value of he time as well as the work there be a constant flux in the labor-world which be the result largely not of special opportunity but of worth application and concentrate think third loyalty have a high mercantile value disloyalty be a sin the fourth point be control do it not strike wonder to think how some man have under they either in they industrial plant or in they railway system or in they syndicate-work anywhere from a few hundred to ten fifteen or twenty thousand man how do they maintain discipline either themselves or through they subordinate this problem of control be a serious one in business every angry threat every sullen hour each case of insubordination every strike every widespread dissatisfaction mean economic waste it mean expense both of time and money to send for pinkerton to keep order and preserve discipline the man who add to he technical skill and he knowledge of the market the power of control add great force and value to he work higher yet be executive force the power to adjust responsibility and duty in such a way as to get back a high economic return in the way of service but above all there be that force of character which impress itself on a company on a decade on a generation -- so that some name be hand down in business from generation to generation all man know that from father to son and again to he son there will pass down that certain integrity nobility steadfastness of purpose fidelity and honor which give credit throughout the business world and which promise health and happiness for those who be happy to be in they employ before a man complain of he wages then let he ask himself : have i master my work be i loyal be i capable of larger responsibility and of wider control third william morris say : _ it be right and necessary that all man should have work to do which shall be worth do and be of itself pleasant to do : and which should be do under such condition as would make it neither over-wearisome nor over-anxious _ this theorem can not be uphold in its entirety though there be a deep truth beneath it there be many thing such as the collect of garbage the wash of the dead poor the cleaning of cesspool the butchery of cattle for the market and the execution of capital criminal which can scarcely be call pleasant to do and must yet be do as long as the world be the world and there be in it sin decay disease and death we can not hope to make the work or the condition of work absolutely ideal : we _ can _ make ideal the spirit in which work be do a fine story be tell that long ago when the cholera once break out in philadelphium the hospital fall into a fearful state one day a plain quiet little man step into the chief hospital look about a moment and set to work no task be too dirty or disagreeable for he no detail be too disgusting he do anything he see to be do -- call in additional doctor organize the nurse and himself wait on patient night and day he soon have the hospital in good shape again when the crisis pass and every one begin to demand who be this man -- they be tell : it be stephen girard the work be not pleasant but the spirit be kind and the heart delighted in its self-appointed toil work in general however that have worth have several element first it must be individual it must be joyfully do : there must enter into work the vitality of a happy spirit it must be spontaneous this be why machine-work can never be thoroughly beautiful : it lack the spontaneity of life the hand never make two thing alike with the mood the weather the occasion there be little touch add which a machine can not give life always vary and think of new effect when we try to realize what work be when it be merely a amount of toil prod out of man or woman by a hard taskmaster we have only to look back to the bondage of israel in egypt or to the time of scyllum when there be thirteen million slave in italy alone : slave whose set task be of over two hundred and fifty kind who work on the road-building on public work and in rowing in the galley of the slave-propelled ship in carthage agriculture be for a time largely carry on by slave-labor how different be this slave-labor from the craft-work of mediaeval time when under the protection of the guild manual labor become exalted to a artistic rank and the worker at the loom the metal-worker the wood-carver the tapestry-weaver and the worker in pottery and glass produce object whose beauty have never be either equal or surpass andrea del sarto and benvenuto cellinus be worker and they work remain again good work be bear of affection love teach more art than all the school what we love we instinctively beautify the artist beautify the material on which he work he love he task and from he love there begin a gradual shaping of the ideal the product gain a touch of beauty the needlework of egypt and byzantium the lace of venice and of spain be historic it be say of queen isabellum that she be one of the best needleworker of she age that she _ motif _ be the great event of the time a peasant girl of venice be once give a beautiful coral-branch and some rare leaf and shell which she lover have gather for she from the sea-depths she be untaught in art and make fish-net be she wonted work day by day as she work she net she look upon the lovely sea-treasure they beauty pass into she heart and mind and she begin to copy spray by spray the coral-foliage the leaf of the sea-grass and the curve of the sea-shell until after a time in the mesh of she fish-net she have imprison form of exquisite beauty and one saw there reproduce in dainty and artistic group what she very soul have love and feed upon she fish-net become work of art work of a high order be always base on high ideal and on great thought it imply a vast amount of toil the capellmeister of the vatican choir to-day be that wonderful young genius perosus who be stir all europe by the beauty of he musical work and by the spirituality and fervor of he musical imagination he have set himself to compose twelve oratorio which shall body forth the whole life of the savior he believe that the music-lover and the church-lover may be identical and have set he hand to the uniting of all true music-lover with the great office and service and influence of the church here be work exalt to its spiritual office : to carry out not only ideal of beauty and harmony but to advance spiritual progress this be the final aim of all true work : it must be not only aesthetic and honest but spiritual the prayer of the true workman be ever to make himself a workman approve unto god may the beauty of the lord be upon we and the work of we hand establish thou it the worker should have change of work nature never intend that a man should do one thing all he life this be in harmony neither with man 's infinite capacity nor with she inexhaustible variety change be cultural and a man 's work should from time to time engross every working-power he have working-surroundings should not only be sanitary they should be beautiful what influence one most at college and make most for one 's happiness be not the fact of the work in recitation-room out of book laboratory and under teacher the glory of college life be that wherever one go the eye look out on beauty and wherever one work there be those whom we love who work beside we as one pass down the long college corridor the eye fall upon palm and statue upon frieze and fresco and the carbon copy of immortal painting everywhere there be the inspiration of sculpture and architecture of music literature and art beauty be in and about the place in which one think and work this be the undying charm of oxford -- the gathering tradition of century the gleaming spire the age-worn wall and buttress the clinging vine the tremulous light and shadow on the ancient hall the sculpture of porch and clerestory and the light that fall through richly tinted window this beauty should not be monopolize by any one class about the place where we work we should have as far as possible something of the beauty of the world we should have wide shaded street and park even in great city tower and pinnacle sky-line of vigor grace and massive strength can not department store be artistically fashion and build can not market-house have arch and arabesque may not even the bourse have something about it suggestive of great art can not we street have curve and story cross-way can not porter and drayman have somewhat to arouse and satisfy aesthetic instinct can not we day-laborer be grant vision why should we have the gothic cathedral with its exquisite tracery and carving pillar and reredos and screen for man to pray in one or two hour a week and the hideous grime-covered foul-smelling overheate factory in which man and woman spend they working-life this be what christianity must do : it must implant joy and beauty as well as honesty and fidelity in the way place and thought of work when religion education art and brotherly affection have join hand in a charmed circle we shall have new idea of working-place as well as of praying-place and of living-place it be not enough that a factory should be situate as the best factory now be in the open country with sunshine and fresh air the blockhouse parallelogram and square should be replace by something that have intrinsic beauty and the haunting completeness of memory and association so that the place where a man work shall no more be to he a nightmare but the atmosphere and inspiration of he dream and those we love shall work beside we here be another thought : shall all association in work be arbitrary be there not a more human way than the chain-gang way could not friend work more together so that one 's daily work should be not a time of separation from all we love most but a time of intellectual sympathy and helpfulness of companionship and true-hearted loyalty this and many other good thing it be not too much to hope for truly as morri write _ the day be come _ _ then a man shall work and bethink he and rejoice in the deed of he handy nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand _ _ man in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear for the morrow 's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf anear _ _ and what wealth then shall be leave we when none shall gather gold to buy he friend in the market and pinch and pine the sell _ _ nay what save the lovely city and the little house on the hill and the waste and the woodland beauty and the happy field we till _ _ and the home of ancient story the tomb of the mighty dead and the wise man seek out marvel and the poet 's teem head _ _ and the painter 's hand of wonder and the marvellous fiddle-bow and the band choir of music : -- all those that do and know _ _ far all these shall be ours and all man 's nor shall any lack a share of the toil and the gain of living in the day when the world grow fair _ fourth good worker be train in the home the school the shop the wider world every home be a industrial establishment in it go on the industrial process of cooking cleaning sew wash the care of silver glass linen and household store the activity of buy food and clothing the moral responsibility of teaching and training servant and child if any healthy member of the home be excuse from at least some form of active work he will inevitably be a shirker when he grow up can not almost all the problem of human training be run down to this : how to teach a child to work if he can work he can be happy but if he do not want to work he shall never be happy no work no joy be the universal dictum this be the great hardship of the child of great wealth : they be not teach to work to avoid this difficulty in two very wealthy family that i know the boy be even oblige to darn they own stocking and mend they own clothes one young hopeful once tear he clothes a-fishing and mend he trousers with a scarlet flannel patch some mother do not allow they little girl to go to school until they bed be make up and they room in order other equally wise parent have tool in the house and allow the boy to do all the repair work the daughter all the family mending or to care for the linen the boy to put in electric fixture and bell and keep the battery in order queen margherita of italy queen elizabeth of roumanium queen alexandra of england and the empress augusta of germany be all woman who have be from they childhood acquaint with simple and practical household task this principle be a right one and underlie much after-success each child should first of all have a mastery of home-task then whether on the prairie or in the palace he be free and independent what make the difference in the social privilege give to one class of worker above another in reality we be all worker no one ought to live if in health who do not work but for some form of work man and woman receive a income and nothing more for other work man and woman may or may not receive a large personal income but they work be recognize they be a part of the best social circle and when they die a city or a nation grieve the essential difference be this : that one be honor-work and one be not wherever in the world work be do in a spirit of love and fidelity it bring its own reward in recognition and in personal affection sooner or later honor-work receive honor another reason for exaltation of one form of work above another be that some kind of work be so very hard to do they involve the intense and complicated action of many and of complex power it may be hard physical work to break stone for a road-way but the task itself be a simple one -- the lifting of the arm and drop it again with sufficient force to split a rock apart but the writing of a prose masterpiece such as the _ areopagitica _ involve the highest human faculty in harmonious action if we add to the requirement of prose the rhythm the exalted imagery and perhaps the assonance and rhyme of verse we still further increase the difficulty of the task and the honor of its successful achievement the king-work of a powerful monarch the president-work of a republican leader be serious work to do we honor be not all give to the king or president income salary or office it be a tribute to hard and royal-minded work household service be personal service it can not be make a thing of set hour and of measurably set task as office-work maybe we may talk of eight-hour shift but they be scarcely practicable not every baby would go to successive shift house-demand vary not only with every household but with every day when love-making be wholly scientific then domestic service will be there be in it the same delicate personal adjustment the change requirement of weather health temper and season of emergency and stress that be to be find in the most purely personal relation when there be a period of unusual sickness through the community not only the doctor have extra task but all household servant as well what social recognition can be give to servant who lie steal who shirk every duty that can be shirk and who be both incompetent and unfaithful the here-and-there one faithful helper receive she meed of appreciation and affection the whole aspect of household work will change when honor-work be give : when home-helper come up to we from the truthful and honor-loving class the school-room be the place in which the principle of work be implant : thoroughness grasp speed decision and definite purpose the shop be the apprentice-place of work before one take up individual responsibility the man who wish to rise in the railroad service go into the shop and roundhouse the man who wish to take charge of a important department in a department store be put to tie package teacher ' work will not be rightly do until certain advantage be give to teacher that be now largely withhold teacher need more society more hour of play freer opportunity of marriage instead of be tie up to exercise-book and roll-book in they home-hour they should have a chance to spend they time on the golf-link at afternoon tea in visit and in entertaining friend take away society from any man or woman and you take away the possibility of a grow happy and helpful life we need friend just as we need air teacher need admiration and affection just as much as the society girl do university should have in they faculty man and woman who represent the best social as well as the best intellectual life of the world -- who be not only in the highest sense of the word society man and woman but who be social leader inspiring truth inculcate larger social ideal of the best sort the problem between capitalist and laborer however only affect a portion of the world that of domestic service a still smaller proportion that of teacher affect only a class there be another problem which affect nearly all married woman and therefore a large section of the human race it be the problem of mother-work here be where the economist should next turn he attention first what be mother-work second what be the best economic condition under which this work can be do when we have solve this question we shall have solve a great human problem mother-work include the bearing and the rearing of child the conduct of a home and the placing of that home in the right social atmosphere and relation it include manual intellectual and spiritual labor the one who live and work as god mean she to live and work will never feel over-fatigue why do mother often look so tired it be because they too often do not have what every mother ought to have : education rest change a sabbath-day individual income intellectual interest society whether in the simplest home or in the stateliest there be certain manual thing to be do in regard to the care and bringing-up of child and the conduct of a home to make the condition of a woman 's life easier the very first thing be this : 1 _ woman should be educate primarily for home-life _ by this i do not mean that a woman should be teach cooking and not political economy that she should be instruct in dressmaking and nursery-work but not in chemistry and logic i mean that the very fullest education that school college university and foreign travel can give should be give to the woman who be fortunate enough to have they at command and that every woman accord to the degree of she possibility of education and opportunity should have the best but always this education should be think of as a part of she preparation for a woman 's life when boy be in a business college the principal of that college do not forget that among the boy there may be more than one who will never have a business life but who will go out into other interest and pursuit yet he turn the thought of _ all _ boy in he school specially toward business problem in school and college for woman not all the girl will marry not all will be mother but most of they will be be not then the normal education of a woman that which while it do not cramp she life in one direction nor mould she in a set way yet keep always in mind the fact that the normal woman be be educate for a normal woman 's life this would not necessarily change the curriculum of we college in any way it would change the spirit and atmosphere of some of they at once instead of the spirit being : my mind be just as good as a man 's what a man can study i can learn what a man can do i can do -- the spirit would be this : i be go out into a woman 's life and it be my business now to take to myself all the wisdom counsel experience and inspiration of past age that i may be the very grandest woman that history have yet see i will be a land-mark in time : i will be a pivot in history around which the earth shall turn because of my life woman to the end of time shall be able to live a truer freer better life with this think in mind all the academic subject would still pass into she mind and life but they would be much more naturally set and they value would be greatly enhance then we would not have the too-ambitious woman step out of college or the restless and discontented one we would have the large-minded earnest noble public-spirited one who would go out into the world as a fine type of woman to live a woman 's life and do a woman 's work marry or unmarried she would still have a woman 's interest a woman 's influence a woman 's charm this higher education may or may not include practical study in domestic science nursing and household emergency but she should learn somewhere the element of these study so that when she go into a home of she own she duty and responsibility will not be meet in a half-hearted and untrained way 2 mother should have rest-hours and rest-days be it not something extraordinary from a purely economic point of view that while it be widely recognize that every one should have one day in seven for rest that while business man be expect to close up they office on the sabbath and all work man and woman be give this day in the store the factory and mine -- the cook and maid have they sunday out and they week-day afternoon -- that nowhere on earth so far as i know have there ever be a systematic arrangement by which mother as a class have any specially arrange hour or day for rest a baby 's care do not stop on the sabbath and the average mother be practically on duty at least over-seeing day and night twenty-four hour out of the twenty-four from one end of the year to the other no matter how many maid and nurse she may have in she employ 3 personal income and its use what we buy mark we own individuality as well as what we do the woman whose father or husband adjust she expense and expenditure can not by any possibility be the kind of woman that the one be who choose she own thing and spend she money absolutely to suit herself when a man buy cigar or fishing-tackle he wife may prefer to buy oratorio and golf-club 4 mother should have some interest outside of home-task to keep they in touch with world-interest and world-task not all mother 's duty be inside the four wall of she home the race have demand upon she as well as she own child she ought to be guard from that short-sighted and selfish devotion which make she look upon she child as the center of the universe and which lead she to sacrifice every hour every thought every talent to he alone 5 build up the place of a home in a community mean much more than a rivalry with one 's neighbor as to which one shall have the cleanest house the prettiest or most expensive curtain and furniture who shall entertain the most and whose child shall present the best appearance in the world make a social place for a family involve a very wide acquaintance with really great social ideal with the best instinct and custom with world refinement and manners as well as those of one 's own town or village -- with the social possibility of life in general as well as the etiquette of quinton 's corner to give the right stamp upon she home a mother must have a social life as well as domestic one she must have time to enter somewhat into the activity of she own neighborhood and must have society after marriage as well as before it be a different sort of society that she then need it be not a boy-and-girl society with its crude way and its adolescent idea of life it be the society of earnest culture and public-spirited man and woman each of whom be add something to the general store of interest and ideal each of whom be do some phase of social work accord to he own talent and opportunity when a mother step out into life in this large way make education and training tributary to she mother-life and do not stop grow intellectually or spiritually -- she charm as a woman increase instead of diminish every year of she married life she look mark she everywhere as a supremely happy woman and she go out into the world mark with that strange deep grand impress of motherhood and womanhood which have always make the true woman not only a working-mother but a love-crowned queen these and many other thought flit over one 's mind in look at any phase of work or any piece of work in the right choice of work lie the fullest use of one 's capacity in the right condition of work lie the freest play of one 's energy in the right spirit of work lie the way of one 's lasting happiness and the foretaste of eternal joy thus the world be see to consist of great cycle of worker rise in tier one above another those who do not work be quickly cut out from all participation in race-progress and in race-delight those who work earnestly but blindly have they small reward but those who work with spiritual energy and enthusiasm be weave they handiwork into the very fiber of the universal frame it be for these spiritual worker that the great eagerness of life be undy for they there be no shadow of fatigue for they there be the joy of mastery and accomplishment for they the peace of soul that come from the triumphant achievement of one 's mission to mankind the end end of project gutenberg 's the warrior by lindsay anna robertson brown
