produce by suzanne shell beginner project dave morgan and the online distribute proofread team the wendigo algernon blackwood 1910 i a considerable number of hunting party be out that year without find so much as a fresh trail for the moose be uncommonly shy and the various nimrod return to the bosom of they respective family with the best excuse the fact of they imagination could suggest dr cathcart among other come back without a trophy but he bring instead the memory of a experience which he declare be worth all the bull moose that have ever be shoot but then cathcart of aberdeen be interested in other thing besides moose -- amongst they the vagary of the human mind this particular story however find no mention in he book on collective hallucination for the simple reason -lrb- so he confide once to a fellow colleague -rrb- that he himself play too intimate a part in it to form a competent judgment of the affair as a whole besides himself and he guide hank davi there be young simpson he nephew a divinity student destine for the wee kirk -lrb- then on he first visit to canadian backwoods -rrb- and the latter 's guide défago joseph défago be a french canuck who have stray from he native province of quebec year before and have get catch in rat portage when the canadian pacific railway be a-build a man who in addition to he unparalleled knowledge of wood-craft and bush-lore could also sing the old _ voyageur _ song and tell a capital hunting yarn into the bargain he be deeply susceptible moreover to that singular spell which the wilderness lay upon certain lonely nature and he love the wild solitude with a kind of romantic passion that amount almost to a obsession the life of the backwoods fascinate he -- whence doubtless he surpass efficiency in deal with they mystery on this particular expedition he be hank 's choice hank know he and swear by he he also swear at he jest as a pal might and since he have a vocabulary of picturesque if utterly meaningless oath the conversation between the two stalwart and hardy woodsman be often of a rather lively description this river of expletive however hank agree to dam a little out of respect for he old hunting boss dr cathcart whom of course he address after the fashion of the country as doc and also because he understand that young simpson be already a bit of a parson he have however one objection to défago and one only -- which be that the french canadian sometimes exhibit what hank describe as the output of a curse and dismal mind meaning apparently that he sometimes be true to type latin type and suffer fit of a kind of silent moroseness when nothing could induce he to utter speech défago that be to say be imaginative and melancholy and as a rule it be too long a spell of civilization that induce the attack for a few day of the wilderness invariably cure they this then be the party of four that find themselves in camp the last week in October of that shy moose year ` way up in the wilderness north of rat portage -- a forsake and desolate country there be also punk a indian who have accompany dr cathcart and hank on they hunting trip in previous year and who act as cook he duty be merely to stay in camp catch fish and prepare venison steak and coffee at a few minute ' notice he dress in the worn-out clothes bequeath to he by former patron and except for he coarse black hair and dark skin he look in these city garment no more like a real redskin than a stage negro look like a real african for all that however punk have in he still the instinct of he die race he taciturn silence and he endurance survive also he superstition the party round the blaze fire that night be despondent for a week have pass without a single sign of recent moose discover itself défago have sing he song and plunge into a story but hank in bad humor remind he so often that he kep ' mussing-up the fac 's so that it be ` most all nothin ' but a petered-out lie that the frenchman have finally subside into a sulky silence which nothing seem likely to break dr cathcart and he nephew be fairly do after a exhausting day punk be wash up the dish grunt to himself under the lean-to of branch where he later also sleep no one trouble to stir the slowly die fire overhead the star be brilliant in a sky quite wintry and there be so little wind that ice be already form stealthily along the shore of the still lake behind they the silence of the vast listen forest steal forward and envelop they hank break in suddenly with he nasal voice i be in favor of break new ground tomorrow doc he observe with energy look across at he employer we do not stand a dead dago 's chance around here agree say cathcart always a man of few word think the idea 's good sure pop it be good hank resume with confidence s ` pose now you and i strike west up garden lake way for a change none of we be not touch that quiet bit o ' land yet -- i be with you and you défago take mr simpson along in the small canoe skip across the lake portage over into fifty island water and take a good squint down that thar southern shore the moose ` yard ' there like hell last year and for all we know they may be doin ' it agin this year jest to spite we défago keep he eye on the fire say nothing by way of reply he be still offended possibly about he interrupted story no one 's be up that way this year a ' i 'll lay my bottom dollar on _ that _ hank add with emphasis as though he have a reason for know he look over at he partner sharply better take the little silk tent and stay away a couple o ' night he conclude as though the matter be definitely settle for hank be recognize as general organizer of the hunt and in charge of the party it be obvious to anyone that défago do not jump at the plan but he silence seem to convey something more than ordinary disapproval and across he sensitive dark face there pass a curious expression like a flash of firelight -- not so quickly however that the three man have not time to catch it he funk for some reason _ i _ think simpson say afterwards in the tent he share with he uncle dr cathcart make no immediate reply although the look have interested he enough at the time for he to make a mental note of it the expression have cause he a pass uneasiness he could not quite account for at the moment but hank of course have be the first to notice it and the odd thing be that instead of become explosive or angry over the other 's reluctance he at once begin to humor he a bit but there be not no _ speshul _ reason why no one 's be up there this year he say with a perceptible hush in he tone not the reason you mean anyway las ' year it be the fire that kep ' folk out and this year i guess -- i guess it jest happen so that be all he manner be clearly mean to be encouraging joseph défago raise he eye a moment then drop they again a breath of wind steal out of the forest and stir the ember into a pass blaze dr cathcart again notice the expression in the guide 's face and again he do not like it but this time the nature of the look betray itself in those eye for a instant he catch the gleam of a man scare in he very soul it disquiet he more than he care to admit bad indian up that way he ask with a laugh to ease matter a little while simpson too sleepy to notice this subtle by-play move off to bed with a prodigious yawn or -- or anything wrong with the country he add when he nephew be out of hearing hank meet he eye with something less than he usual frankness he be jest skeered he reply good-humouredly skeered stiff about some ole feery tale that be all be not it ole pard and he give défago a friendly kick on the moccasined foot that lay nearest the fire défago look up quickly as from a interrupted reverie a reverie however that have not prevent he see all that go on about he skeer -- _ nuthin ' _ he answer with a flush of defiance there be nuthin ' in the bush that can skeer joseph défago and do not you forget it and the natural energy with which he speak make it impossible to know whether he tell the whole truth or only a part of it hank turn towards the doctor he be just go to add something when he stop abruptly and look round a sound close behind they in the darkness make all three start it be old punk who have move up from he lean-to while they talk and now stand there just beyond the circle of firelight -- listen ` nother time doc hank whisper with a wink when the gallery be not step down into the stall and spring to he foot he slap the indian on the back and cry noisily come up t ' the fire a ' warm yer dirty red skin a bit he drag he towards the blaze and throw more wood on that be a mighty good feed you give we a hour or two back he continue heartily as though to set the man 's thought on another scent and it be not christian to let you stand out there freezin ' yer ole soul to hell while we be gettin ' all good a ' toast punk move in and warm he foot smile darkly at the other 's volubility which he only half understand but say nothing and presently dr cathcart see that further conversation be impossible follow he nephew 's example and move off to the tent leave the three man smoking over the now blaze fire it be not easy to undress in a small tent without wake one 's companion and cathcart harden and warm-blooded as he be in spite of he fifty odd year do what hank would have describe as considerable of he twilight in the open he notice during the process that punk have meanwhile go back to he lean-to and that hank and défago be at it hammer and tong or rather hammer and anvil the little french canadian be the anvil it be all very like the conventional stage picture of western melodrama : the fire light up they face with patch of alternate red and black défago in slouch hat and moccasin in the part of the badland villain hank open-faced and hatless with that reckless fling of he shoulder the honest and deceive hero and old punk eavesdropping in the background supply the atmosphere of mystery the doctor smile as he notice the detail but at the same time something deep within he -- he hardly know what -- shrink a little as though a almost imperceptible breath of warning have touch the surface of he soul and be go again before he could seize it probably it be traceable to that scared expression he have see in the eye of défago probably -- for this hint of fugitive emotion otherwise escape he usually so keen analysis défago he be vaguely aware might cause trouble somehow he be not as steady a guide as hank for instance further than that he could not get he watch the man a moment longer before diving into the stuffy tent where simpson already sleep soundly hank he see be swearing like a mad african in a new york nigger saloon but it be the swearing of affection the ridiculous oath fly freely now that the cause of they obstruction be asleep presently he put he arm almost tenderly upon he comrade 's shoulder and they move off together into the shadow where they tent stand faintly glimmering punk too a moment later follow they example and disappear between he odorous blanket in the opposite direction dr cathcart then likewise turn in weariness and sleep still fight in he mind with a obscure curiosity to know what it be that have scare défago about the country up fifty island water way -- wonder too why punk 's presence have prevent the completion of what hank have to say then sleep overtake he he would know tomorrow hank would tell he the story while they trudge after the elusive moose deep silence fall about the little camp plant there so audaciously in the jaw of the wilderness the lake gleam like a sheet of black glass beneath the star the cold air prick in the draught of night that pour they silent tide from the depths of the forest with message from distant ridge and from lake just begin to freeze there lay already the faint bleak odor of come winter white man with they dull scent might never have divine they the fragrance of the wood fire would have conceal from they these almost electrical hint of moss and bark and harden swamp a hundred mile away even hank and défago subtly in league with the soul of the wood as they be would probably have spread they delicate nostril in vain but a hour later when all sleep like the dead old punk creep from he blanket and go down to the shore of the lake like a shadow -- silently as only indian blood can move he raise he head and look about he the thick darkness render sight of small avail but like the animal he possess other sens that darkness could not mute he listen -- then sniff the air motionless as a hemlock stem he stand there after five minute again he lift he head and sniff and yet once again a tingling of the wonderful nerve that betray itself by no outer sign run through he as he taste the keen air then merge he figure into the surround blackness in a way that only wild man and animal understand he turn still move like a shadow and go stealthily back to he lean-to and he bed and soon after he sleep the change of wind he have divine stir gently the reflection of the star within the lake rise among the far ridge of the country beyond fifty island water it come from the direction in which he have stare and it pass over the sleep camp with a faint and sigh murmur through the top of the big tree that be almost too delicate to be audible with it down the desert path of night though too faint too high even for the indian 's hair-like nerve there pass a curious thin odor strangely disquieting a odor of something that seem unfamiliar -- utterly unknown the french canadian and the man of indian blood each stir uneasily in he sleep just about this time though neither of they wake then the ghost of that unforgettably strange odor pass away and be lose among the league of tenantless forest beyond ii in the morning the camp be astir before the sun there have be a light fall of snow during the night and the air be sharp punk have do he duty betime for the odor of coffee and fry bacon reach every tent all be in good spirit wind 's shift cry hank vigorously watch simpson and he guide already load the small canoe it be across the lake -- dead right for you feller and the snow 'll make bully trail if there be any moose muss around up thar they 'll not get so much as a tail-end scent of you with the wind as it be good luck monsieur défago he add facetiously give the name its french pronunciation for once _ bonne chance _ défago return the good wish apparently in the best of spirit the silent mood go before eight o'clock old punk have the camp to himself cathcart and hank be far along the trail that lead westwards while the canoe that carry défago and simpson with silk tent and grub for two day be already a dark speck bob on the bosom of the lake go due east the wintry sharpness of the air be temper now by a sun that top the wooded ridge and blaze with a luxurious warmth upon the world of lake and forest below loon fly skim through the sparkling spray that the wind lift diver shake they drip head to the sun and pop smartly out of sight again and as far as eye could reach rise the league of endless crowd bush desolate in its lonely sweep and grandeur untrodden by foot of man and stretch its mighty and unbroken carpet right up to the frozen shore of hudson bay simpson who see it all for the first time as he paddle hard in the bow of the dancing canoe be enchant by its austere beauty he heart drink in the sense of freedom and great space just as he lung drink in the cool and perfumed wind behind he in the stern seat singing fragment of he native chanty défago steer the craft of birch bark like a thing of life answering cheerfully all he companion 's question both be gay and light-hearted on such occasion man lose the superficial worldly distinction they become human being work together for a common end simpson the employer and défago the employ among these primitive force be simply -- two man the guider and the guide superior knowledge of course assume control and the younger man fall without a second thought into the quasi-subordinate position he never dream of object when défago drop the mr and address he as say simpson or simpson boss which be invariably the case before they reach the farther shore after a stiff paddle of twelve mile against a head wind he only laugh and like it then cease to notice it at all for this divinity student be a young man of part and character though as yet of course untraveled and on this trip -- the first time he have see any country but he own and little switzerland -- the huge scale of thing somewhat bewilder he it be one thing he realize to hear about primeval forest but quite another to see they while to dwell in they and seek acquaintance with they wild life be again a initiation that no intelligent man could undergo without a certain shift of personal value hitherto hold for permanent and sacred simpson know the first faint indication of this emotion when he hold the new 303 rifle in he hand and look along its pair of faultless gleaming barrel the three day ' journey to they headquarters by lake and portage have carry the process a stage farther and now that he be about to plunge beyond even the fringe of wilderness where they be camp into the virgin heart of uninhabited region as vast as europe itself the true nature of the situation steal upon he with a effect of delight and awe that he imagination be fully capable of appreciate it be himself and défago against a multitude -- at least against a titan the bleak splendor of these remote and lonely forest rather overwhelm he with the sense of he own littleness that stern quality of the tangled backwoods which can only be describe as merciless and terrible rise out of these far blue wood swim upon the horizon and reveal itself he understand the silent warning he realize he own utter helplessness only défago as a symbol of a distant civilization where man be master stand between he and a pitiless death by exhaustion and starvation it be thrill to he therefore to watch défago turn over the canoe upon the shore pack the paddle carefully underneath and then proceed to blaze the spruce stem for some distance on either side of a almost invisible trail with the careless remark throw in say simpson if anything happen to I you 'll find the canoe all correc ' by these mark -- then strike doo west into the sun to hit the home camp agin see it be the most natural thing in the world to say and he say it without any noticeable inflexion of the voice only it happen to express the youth 's emotion at the moment with a utterance that be symbolic of the situation and of he own helplessness as a factor in it he be alone with défago in a primitive world : that be all the canoe another symbol of man 's ascendancy be now to be leave behind those small yellow patch make on the tree by the axe be the only indication of its hiding place meanwhile shoulder the pack between they each man carry he own rifle they follow the slender trail over rock and fall trunk and across half-frozen swamp skirt numerous lake that fairly gemm the forest they border fringe with mist and towards five o'clock find themselves suddenly on the edge of the wood look out across a large sheet of water in front of they dot with pine-clad island of all describable shape and size fifty island water announce défago wearily and the sun jest goin ' to dip he bald old head into it he add with unconscious poetry and immediately they set about pitch camp for the night in a very few minute under those skilful hand that never make a movement too much or a movement too little the silk tent stand taut and cozy the bed of balsam bough ready lay and a brisk cooking fire burn with the minimum of smoke while the young scotchman clean the fish they have catch troll behind the canoe défago guess he would jest as soon take a turn through the bush for indication of moose _ may _ come across a trunk where they bin and rub horn he say as he move off or feedin ' on the last of the maple leave -- and he be go he small figure melt away like a shadow in the dusk while simpson note with a kind of admiration how easily the forest absorb he into herself a few step it seem and he be no longer visible yet there be little underbrush hereabouts the tree stand somewhat apart well space and in the clearing grow silver birch and maple spearlike and slender against the immense stem of spruce and hemlock but for occasional prostrate monster and the boulder of gray rock that thrust uncouth shoulder here and there out of the ground it might well have be a bit of park in the old country almost one might have see in it the hand of man a little to the right however begin the great burnt section mile in extent proclaim its real character -- _ brulé _ as it be call where the fire of the previous year have rage for week and the blacken stump now rise gaunt and ugly bereft of branch like gigantic match head stick into the ground savage and desolate beyond word the perfume of charcoal and rain-soaked ash still hang faintly about it the dusk rapidly deepen the glade grow dark the crackling of the fire and the wash of little wave along the rocky lake shore be the only sound audible the wind have drop with the sun and in all that vast world of branch nothing stir any moment it seem the woodland god who be to be worship in silence and loneliness might stretch they mighty and terrific outline among the tree in front through doorway pillare by huge straight stem lay the stretch of fifty island water a crescent-shaped lake some fifteen mile from tip to tip and perhaps five mile across where they be camp a sky of rose and saffron more clear than any atmosphere simpson have ever know still drop its pale streaming fire across the wave where the island -- a hundred surely rather than fifty -- float like the fairy barque of some enchanted fleet fringe with pine whose crest finger most delicately the sky they almost seem to move upwards as the light fade -- about to weigh anchor and navigate the pathway of the heaven instead of the current of they native and desolate lake and strip of color cloud like flaunt pennon signal they departure to the star the beauty of the scene be strangely uplifting simpson smoke the fish and burnt he finger into the bargain in he effort to enjoy it and at the same time tend the frying pan and the fire yet ever at the back of he thought lay that other aspect of the wilderness : the indifference to human life the merciless spirit of desolation which take no note of man the sense of he utter loneliness now that even défago have go come close as he look about he and listen for the sound of he companion 's return footstep there be pleasure in the sensation yet with it a perfectly comprehensible alarm and instinctively the thought stir in he : what should i -- _ could _ i do -- if anything happen and he do not come back -- they enjoy they well-earned supper eat untold quantity of fish and drinking unmilked tea strong enough to kill man who have not cover thirty mile of hard go eat little on the way and when it be over they smoke and tell story round the blaze fire laughing stretch weary limb and discuss plan for the morrow défago be in excellent spirit though disappointed at have no sign of moose to report but it be dark and he have not go far the _ brulé _ too be bad he clothes and hand be smear with charcoal simpson watch he realize with renew vividness they position -- alone together in the wilderness défago he say presently these wood you know be a bit too big to feel quite at home in -- to feel comfortable in i mean eh he merely give expression to the mood of the moment he be hardly prepare for the earnestness the solemnity even with which the guide take he up you have hit it right simpson boss he reply fix he search brown eye on he face and that be the truth sure there be no end to 'em -- no end at all then he add in a lowered tone as if to himself there be lot find out _ that _ and go plumb to piece but the man 's gravity of manner be not quite to the other 's like it be a little too suggestive for this scenery and set he be sorry he have broach the subject he remember suddenly how he uncle have tell he that man be sometimes stricken with a strange fever of the wilderness when the seduction of the uninhabited waste catch they so fiercely that they go forth half fascinate half delude to they death and he have a shrewd idea that he companion hold something in sympathy with that queer type he lead the conversation on to other topic on to hank and the doctor for instance and the natural rivalry as to who should get the first sight of moose if they go doo west observe défago carelessly there be sixty mile between we now -- with ole punk at halfway house eatin ' himself full to bustin ' with fish and coffee they laugh together over the picture but the casual mention of those sixty mile again make simpson realize the prodigious scale of this land where they hunt sixty mile be a mere step two hundred little more than a step story of lose hunter rise persistently before he memory the passion and mystery of homeless and wander man seduce by the beauty of great forest sweep he soul in a way too vivid to be quite pleasant he wonder vaguely whether it be the mood of he companion that invite the unwelcome suggestion with such persistence sing we a song défago if you be not too tired he ask one of those old _ voyageur _ song you sing the other night he hand he tobacco pouch to the guide and then fill he own pipe while the canadian nothing loth send he light voice across the lake in one of those plaintive almost melancholy chanty with which lumberman and trapper lessen the burden of they labor there be a appealing and romantic flavor about it something that recall the atmosphere of the old pioneer day when indian and wilderness be league together battle frequent and the old country farther off than it be today the sound travel pleasantly over the water but the forest at they back seem to swallow it down with a single gulp that permit neither echo nor resonance it be in the middle of the third verse that simpson notice something unusual -- something that bring he thought back with a rush from faraway scene a curious change have come into the man 's voice even before he know what it be uneasiness catch he and look up quickly he see that défago though still singing be peer about he into the bush as though he hear or see something he voice grow fainter -- drop to a hush -- then cease altogether the same instant with a movement amazingly alert he start to he foot and stand upright -- _ sniff the air _ like a dog scent game he draw the air into he nostril in short sharp breath turn quickly as he do so in all direction and finally point down the lake shore eastward it be a performance unpleasantly suggestive and at the same time singularly dramatic simpson 's heart flutter disagreeably as he watch it lord man how you make I jump he exclaim on he foot beside he the same instant and peer over he shoulder into the sea of darkness what be up be you frighten -- even before the question be out of he mouth he know it be foolish for any man with a pair of eye in he head could see that the canadian have turn white down to he very gill not even sunburn and the glare of the fire could hide that the student feel himself tremble a little weakish in the knee what be up he repeat quickly d'you smell moose or anything queer anything -- wrong he lower he voice instinctively the forest press round they with its encircle wall the nearer tree stem gleam like bronze in the firelight beyond that -- blackness and so far as he could tell a silence of death just behind they a pass puff of wind lift a single leaf look at it then lay it softly down again without disturb the rest of the covey it seem as if a million invisible cause have combine just to produce that single visible effect _ other _ life pulsed about they -- and be go défago turn abruptly the livid hue of he face have turn to a dirty gray i never say i heered -- or smell -- nuthin ' he say slowly and emphatically in a oddly altered voice that convey somehow a touch of defiance i be only -- takin ' a look round -- so to speak it be always a mistake to be too previous with yer question then he add suddenly with obvious effort in he more natural voice have you get the match boss simpson and proceed to light the pipe he have half fill just before he begin to sing without speak another word they sit down again by the fire défago change he side so that he could face the direction the wind come from for even a tenderfoot could tell that défago change he position in order to hear and smell -- all there be to be hear and smell and since he now face the lake with he back to the tree it be evidently nothing in the forest that have send so strange and sudden a warn to he marvelously trained nerve guess now i do not feel like singing any he explain presently of he own accord that song kinder bring back memory that be troublesome to I i never oughter have begin it it set I on t ' imagine thing see clearly the man be still fight with some profoundly move emotion he wish to excuse himself in the eye of the other but the explanation in that it be only a part of the truth be a lie and he know perfectly well that simpson be not deceive by it for nothing could explain away the livid terror that have drop over he face while he stand there sniff the air and nothing -- no amount of blaze fire or chat on ordinary subject -- could make that camp exactly as it have be before the shadow of a unknown horror naked if unguessed that have flash for a instant in the face and gesture of the guide have also communicate itself vaguely and therefore more potently to he companion the guide 's visible effort to dissemble the truth only make thing worse moreover to add to the younger man 's uneasiness be the difficulty nay the impossibility he feel of ask question and also he complete ignorance as to the cause indian wild animal forest fire -- all these he know be wholly out of the question he imagination search vigorously but in vain \* \* \* \* \* yet somehow or other after another long spell of smoking talking and roast themselves before the great fire the shadow that have so suddenly invade they peaceful camp begin to shirt perhaps défago 's effort or the return of he quiet and normal attitude accomplish this perhaps simpson himself have exaggerate the affair out of all proportion to the truth or possibly the vigorous air of the wilderness bring its own power of healing whatever the cause the feeling of immediate horror seem to have pass away as mysteriously as it have come for nothing occur to feed it simpson begin to feel that he have permit himself the unreasoning terror of a child he put it down partly to a certain subconscious excitement that this wild and immense scenery generate in he blood partly to the spell of solitude and partly to overfatigue that pallor in the guide 's face be of course uncommonly hard to explain yet it _ might _ have be due in some way to a effect of firelight or he own imagination he give it the benefit of the doubt he be scotch when a somewhat unordinary emotion have disappear the mind always find a dozen way of explain away its cause simpson light a last pipe and try to laugh to himself on get home to scotland it would make quite a good story he do not realize that this laughter be a sign that terror still lurk in the recess of he soul -- that in fact it be merely one of the conventional sign by which a man seriously alarmed try to persuade himself that he be _ not _ so défago however hear that low laughter and look up with surprise on he face the two man stand side by side kick the ember about before go to bed it be ten o'clock -- a late hour for hunter to be still awake what be ticklin ' yer he ask in he ordinary tone yet gravely i -- i be think of we little toy wood at home just at that moment stammer simpson come back to what really dominate he mind and startle by the question and compare they to -- to all this and he sweep he arm round to indicate the bush a pause follow in which neither of they say anything all the same i would not laugh about it if i be you défago add look over simpson 's shoulder into the shadow there be place in there nobody will not never see into -- nobody know what live in there either too big -- too far off the suggestion in the guide 's manner be immense and horrible défago nod the expression on he face be dark he too feel uneasy the younger man understand that in a _ hinterland _ of this size there might well be depths of wood that would never in the life of the world be know or trodden the thought be not exactly the sort he welcome in a loud voice cheerfully he suggest that it be time for bed but the guide linger tinker with the fire arrange the stone needlessly do a dozen thing that do not really need do evidently there be something he want to say yet find it difficult to get at say you boss simpson he begin suddenly as the last shower of spark go up into the air you do not -- smell nothing do you -- nothing pertickler i mean the commonplace question simpson realize veil a dreadfully serious thought in he mind a shiver run down he back nothing but burn wood he reply firmly kick again at the ember the sound of he own foot make he start and all the evenin ' you be not smell -- nothing persist the guide peer at he through the gloom nothing extrordiny and different to anything else you ever smell before no no man nothing at all he reply aggressively half angrily défago 's face clear that be good he exclaim with evident relief that be good to hear have _ you _ ask simpson sharply and the same instant regret the question the canadian come closer in the darkness he shake he head i guess not he say though without overwhelming conviction it must have be just that song of mine that do it it be the song they sing in lumber camp and godforsaken place like that when they be skeer the wendigo 's somewhere around doin ' a bit of swift travel -- and what be the wendigo pray simpson ask quickly irritated because again he could not prevent that sudden shiver of the nerve he know that he be close upon the man 's terror and the cause of it yet a rush passionate curiosity overcome he better judgment and he fear défago turn swiftly and look at he as though he be suddenly about to shriek he eye shine but he mouth be wide open yet all he say or whisper rather for he voice sink very low be : it be nuthin ' -- nuthin ' but what those lousy feller believe when they have bin hittin ' the bottle too long -- a sort of great animal that live up yonder he jerk he head northwards quick as lightning in its track a ' bigger 'n anything else in the bush a ' be not suppose to be very good to look at -- that be all a backwoods superstition -- begin simpson move hastily toward the tent in order to shake off the hand of the guide that clutch he arm come come hurry up for god 's sake and get the lantern go it be time we be in bed and asleep if we be go to be up with the sun tomorrow the guide be close on he heel i be come he answer out of the darkness i be come and after a slight delay he appear with the lantern and hang it from a nail in the front pole of the tent the shadow of a hundred tree shift they place quickly as he do so and when he stumble over the rope diving swiftly inside the whole tent tremble as though a gust of wind strike it the two man lay down without undress upon they bed of soft balsam bough cunningly arrange inside all be warm and cozy but outside the world of crowd tree press close about they marshal they million shadow and smother the little tent that stand there like a wee white shell face the ocean of tremendous forest between the two lonely figure within however there press another shadow that be _ not _ a shadow from the night it be the shadow cast by the strange fear never wholly exorcise that have leap suddenly upon défago in the middle of he singing and simpson as he lay there watch the darkness through the open flap of the tent ready to plunge into the fragrant abyss of sleep know first that unique and profound stillness of a primeval forest when no wind stir and when the night have weight and substance that enter into the soul to bind a veil about it then sleep take he iii thus it seem to he at least yet it be true that the lap of the water just beyond the tent door still beat time with he lessen pulse when he realize that he be lie with he eye open and that another sound have recently introduce itself with cunning softness between the splash and murmur of the little wave and long before he understand what this sound be it have stir in he the center of pity and alarm he listen intently though at first in vain for the run blood beat all its drum too noisily in he ear do it come he wonder from the lake or from the wood then suddenly with a rush and a flutter of the heart he know that it be close beside he in the tent and when he turn over for a better hearing it focus itself unmistakably not two foot away it be a sound of weep défago upon he bed of branch be sob in the darkness as though he heart would break the blanket evidently stuff against he mouth to stifle it and he first feeling before he could think or reflect be the rush of a poignant and search tenderness this intimate human sound hear amid the desolation about they wake pity it be so incongruous so pitifully incongruous -- and so vain tear -- in this vast and cruel wilderness : of what avail he think of a little child cry in mid-atlantic then of course with fuller realization and the memory of what have go before come the descent of the terror upon he and he blood run cold défago he whisper quickly what be the matter he try to make he voice very gentle be you in pain -- unhappy -- there be no reply but the sound cease abruptly he stretch he hand out and touch he the body do not stir be you awake for it occur to he that the man be cry in he sleep be you cold he notice that he foot which be uncovered project beyond the mouth of the tent he spread a extra fold of he own blanket over they the guide have slip down in he bed and the branch seem to have be drag with he he be afraid to pull the body back again for fear of wake he one or two tentative question he venture softly but though he wait for several minute there come no reply nor any sign of movement presently he hear he regular and quiet breathing and put he hand again gently on the breast feel the steady rise and fall beneath let I know if anything 's wrong he whisper or if i can do anything wake I at once if you feel -- queer he hardly know what to say he lay down again think and wonder what it all mean défago of course have be cry in he sleep some dream or other have afflict he yet never in he life would he forget that pitiful sound of sob and the feeling that the whole awful wilderness of wood listen he own mind busy itself for a long time with the recent event of which _ this _ take its mysterious place as one and though he reason successfully argue away all unwelcome suggestion a sensation of uneasiness remain resist ejection very deep-seated -- peculiar beyond ordinary iv but sleep in the long run prove greater than all emotion he thought soon wander again he lay there warm as toast exceedingly weary the night soothe and comfort blunt the edge of memory and alarm half a hour later he be oblivious of everything in the outer world about he yet sleep in this case be he great enemy conceal all approach smother the warning of he nerve as sometimes in a nightmare event crowd upon each other 's heel with a conviction of dreadfulest reality yet some inconsistent detail accuse the whole display of incompleteness and disguise so the event that now follow though they actually happen persuade the mind somehow that the detail which could explain they have be overlook in the confusion and that therefore they be but partly true the rest delusion at the back of the sleeper 's mind something remain awake ready to let slip the judgment all this be not _ quite _ real when you wake up you 'll understand and thus in a way it be with simpson the event not wholly inexplicable or incredible in themselves yet remain for the man who see and hear they a sequence of separate fact of cold horror because the little piece that might have make the puzzle clear lay conceal or overlook so far as he can recall it be a violent movement run downward through the tent towards the door that first wake he and make he aware that he companion be sit bolt upright beside he -- quiver hour must have pass for it be the pale gleam of the dawn that reveal he outline against the canvas this time the man be not cry he be quake like a leaf the tremble he feel plainly through the blanket down the entire length of he own body défago have huddle down against he for protection shrink away from something that apparently conceal itself near the door flap of the little tent simpson thereupon call out in a loud voice some question or other -- in the first bewilderment of wake he do not remember exactly what -- and the man make no reply the atmosphere and feeling of true nightmare lay horribly about he make movement and speech both difficult at first indeed he be not sure where he be -- whether in one of the earlier camp or at home in he bed at aberdeen the sense of confusion be very troubling and next -- almost simultaneous with he wake it seem -- the profound stillness of the dawn outside be shatter by a most uncommon sound it come without warn or audible approach and it be unspeakably dreadful it be a voice simpson declare possibly a human voice hoarse yet plaintive -- a soft roar voice close outside the tent overhead rather than upon the ground of immense volume while in some strange way most penetratingly and seductively sweet it ring out too in three separate and distinct note or cry that bear in some odd fashion a resemblance farfetched yet recognizable to the name of the guide : _ dé-fa-go _ the student admit he be unable to describe it quite intelligently for it be unlike any sound he have ever hear in he life and combine a blending of such contrary quality a sort of windy cry voice he call it as of something lonely and untame wild and of abominable power and even before it cease drop back into the great gulf of silence the guide beside he have spring to he foot with a answering though unintelligible cry he blunder against the tent pole with violence shake the whole structure spread he arm out frantically for more room and kick he leg impetuously free of the clinging blanket for a second perhaps two he stand upright by the door he outline dark against the pallor of the dawn then with a furious rush speed before he companion could move a hand to stop he he shoot with a plunge through the flap of canvas -- and be go and as he go -- so astonishingly fast that the voice could actually be hear die in the distance -- he call aloud in tone of anguished terror that at the same time hold something strangely like the frenzied exultation of delight -- oh oh my foot of fire my burning foot of fire oh oh this height and fiery speed and then the distance quickly bury it and the deep silence of very early morning descend upon the forest as before it have all come about with such rapidity that but for the evidence of the empty bed beside he simpson could almost have believe it to have be the memory of a nightmare carry over from sleep he still feel the warm pressure of that vanish body against he side there lay the twisted blanket in a heap the very tent yet tremble with the vehemence of the impetuous departure the strange word ring in he ear as though he still hear they in the distance -- wild language of a suddenly stricken mind moreover it be not only the sens of sight and hearing that report uncommon thing to he brain for even while the man cry and run he have become aware that a strange perfume faint yet pungent pervade the interior of the tent and it be at this point it seem bring to himself by the consciousness that he nostril be take this distressing odor down into he throat that he find he courage spring quickly to he foot -- and go out the gray light of dawn that drop cold and glimmer between the tree reveal the scene tolerably well there stand the tent behind he soak with dew the dark ash of the fire still warm the lake white beneath a coating of mist the island rise darkly out of it like object pack in wool and patch of snow beyond among the clearer space of the bush -- everything cold still wait for the sun but nowhere a sign of the vanish guide -- still doubtless fly at frantic speed through the frozen wood there be not even the sound of disappear footstep nor the echo of the die voice he have go -- utterly there be nothing nothing but the sense of he recent presence so strongly leave behind about the camp _ and _ -- this penetrate all-pervading odor and even this be now rapidly disappear in its turn in spite of he exceed mental perturbation simpson struggle hard to detect its nature and define it but the ascertaining of a elusive scent not recognize subconsciously and at once be a very subtle operation of the mind and he fail it be go before he could properly seize or name it approximate description even seem to have be difficult for it be unlike any smell he know acrid rather not unlike the odor of a lion he think yet softer and not wholly unpleasing with something almost sweet in it that remind he of the scent of decaying garden leave earth and the myriad nameless perfume that make up the odor of a big forest yet the odor of lion be the phrase with which he usually sum it all up then -- it be wholly go and he find himself stand by the ash of the fire in a state of amazement and stupid terror that leave he the helpless prey of anything that choose to happen have a muskrat poke its pointed muzzle over a rock or a squirrel scuttle in that instant down the bark of a tree he would most likely have collapse without more ado and faint for he feel about the whole affair the touch somewhere of a great outer horror and he scattered power have not as yet have time to collect themselves into a definite attitude of fight self-control nothing do happen however a great kiss of wind run softly through the awaken forest and a few maple leave here and there rustle tremblingly to earth the sky seem to grow suddenly much lighter simpson feel the cool air upon he cheek and uncovered head realize that he be shiver with the cold and make a great effort realize next that he be alone in the bush -- _ and _ that he be call upon to take immediate step to find and succor he vanish companion make a effort accordingly he do though a ill-calculated and futile one with that wilderness of tree about he the sheet of water cut he off behind and the horror of that wild cry in he blood he do what any other inexperienced man would have do in similar bewilderment : he run about without any sense of direction like a frantic child and call loudly without cease the name of the guide : défago défago défago he yell and the tree give he back the name as often as he shout only a little softened -- défago défago défago he follow the trail that lay a short distance across the patch of snow and then lose it again where the tree grow too thickly for snow to lie he shout till he be hoarse and till the sound of he own voice in all that unanswer and listen world begin to frighten he he confusion increase in direct ratio to the violence of he effort he distress become formidably acute till at length he exertion defeat they own object and from sheer exhaustion he head back to the camp again it remain a wonder that he ever find he way it be with great difficulty and only after numberless false clue that he at last see the white tent between the tree and so reach safety exhaustion then apply its own remedy and he grow calmer he make the fire and breakfast hot coffee and bacon put a little sense and judgment into he again and he realize that he have be behave like a boy he now make another and more successful attempt to face the situation collectedly and a nature naturally plucky come to he assistance he decide that he must first make as thorough a search as possible fail success in which he must find he way into the home camp as best he could and bring help and this be what he do take food match and rifle with he and a small axe to blaze the tree against he return journey he set forth it be eight o'clock when he start the sun shine over the top of the tree in a sky without cloud pin to a stake by the fire he leave a note in case défago return while he be away this time accord to a careful plan he take a new direction intend to make a wide sweep that must sooner or later cut into indication of the guide 's trail and before he have go a quarter of a mile he come across the track of a large animal in the snow and beside it the light and smaller track of what be beyond question human foot -- the foot of défago the relief he at once experience be natural though brief for at first sight he see in these track a simple explanation of the whole matter : these big mark have surely be leave by a bull moose that wind against it have blunder upon the camp and utter its singular cry of warning and alarm the moment its mistake be apparent défago in whom the hunting instinct be develop to the point of uncanny perfection have scented the brute come down the wind hour before he excitement and disappearance be due of course to -- to he -- then the impossible explanation at which he grasp fade as common sense show he mercilessly that none of this be true no guide much less a guide like défago could have act in so irrational a way go off even without he rifle the whole affair demand a far more complicated elucidation when he remember the detail of it all -- the cry of terror the amazing language the gray face of horror when he nostril first catch the new odor that muffle sob in the darkness and -- for this too now come back to he dimly -- the man 's original aversion for this particular bit of country besides now that he examine they closer these be not the track of a bull moose at all hank have explain to he the outline of a bull 's hoof of a cow 's or calf s too for that matter he have draw they clearly on a strip of birch bark and these be wholly different they be big round ample and with no pointed outline as of sharp hoof he wonder for a moment whether bear track be like that there be no other animal he could think of for caribou do not come so far south at this season and even if they do would leave hoof mark they be ominous sign -- these mysterious writings leave in the snow by the unknown creature that have lure a human be away from safety -- and when he couple they in he imagination with that haunting sound that break the stillness of the dawn a momentary dizziness shake he mind distressing he again beyond belief he feel the _ threatening _ aspect of it all and stoop down to examine the mark more closely he catch a faint whiff of that sweet yet pungent odor that make he instantly straighten up again fight a sensation almost of nausea then he memory play he another evil trick he suddenly recall those uncovered foot project beyond the edge of the tent and the body 's appearance of have be drag towards the open the man 's shrink from something by the door when he wake later the detail now beat against he tremble mind with concerted attack they seem to gather in those deep space of the silent forest about he where the host of tree stand wait listen watch to see what he would do the wood be close round he with the persistence of true pluck however simpson go forward follow the track as best he could smother these ugly emotion that seek to weaken he will he blaze innumerable tree as he go ever fearful of be unable to find the way back and call aloud at interval of a few seconds the name of the guide the dull tap of the axe upon the massive trunk and the unnatural accent of he own voice become at length sound that he even dread to make dread to hear for they draw attention without cease to he presence and exact whereabouts and if it be really the case that something be hunting himself down in the same way that he be hunting down another -- with a strong effort he crush the think out the instant it rise it be the beginning he realize of a bewilderment utterly diabolical in kind that would speedily destroy he \* \* \* \* \* although the snow be not continuous lie merely in shallow flurry over the more open space he find no difficulty in follow the track for the first few mile they go straight as a rule line wherever the tree permit the stride soon begin to increase in length till it finally assume proportion that seem absolutely impossible for any ordinary animal to have make like huge fly leap they become one of these he measure and though he know that stretch of eighteen foot must be somehow wrong he be at a complete loss to understand why he find no sign on the snow between the extreme point but what perplex he even more make he feel he vision have go utterly awry be that défago 's stride increase in the same manner and finally cover the same incredible distance it look as if the great beast have lift he with it and carry he across these astonishing interval simpson who be much longer in the limb find that he could not compass even half the stretch by take a run jump and the sight of these huge track run side by side silent evidence of a dreadful journey in which terror or madness have urge to impossible result be profoundly move it shock he in the secret depths of he soul it be the most horrible thing he eye have ever look upon he begin to follow they mechanically absentmindedly almost ever peer over he shoulder to see if he too be be follow by something with a gigantic tread and soon it come about that he no longer quite realize what it be they signify -- these impression leave upon the snow by something nameless and untame always accompany by the footmark of the little french canadian he guide he comrade the man who have share he tent a few hour before chat laugh even singing by he side v for a man of he year and inexperience only a canny scot perhaps ground in common sense and establish in logic could have preserve even that measure of balance that this youth somehow or other do manage to preserve through the whole adventure otherwise two thing he presently notice while forge pluckily ahead must have send he headlong back to the comparative safety of he tent instead of only make he hand close more tightly upon the rifle stock while he heart train for the wee kirk send a wordless prayer wing its way to heaven both track he see have undergo a change and this change so far as it concern the footstep of the man be in some undecipherable manner -- appalling it be in the bigger track he first notice this and for a long time he could not quite believe he eye be it the blow leaf that produce odd effect of light and shade or that the dry snow drift like finely ground rice about the edge cast shadow and high light or be it actually the fact that the great mark have become faintly color for round about the deep plunging hole of the animal there now appear a mysterious reddish tinge that be more like a effect of light than of anything that dye the substance of the snow itself every mark have it and have it increasingly -- this indistinct fiery tinge that paint a new touch of ghastliness into the picture but when wholly unable to explain or to credit it he turn he attention to the other track to discover if they too bear similar witness he notice that these have meanwhile undergo a change that be infinitely worse and charge with far more horrible suggestion for in the last hundred yard or so he see that they have grow gradually into the semblance of the parent tread imperceptibly the change have come about yet unmistakably it be hard to see where the change first begin the result however be beyond question smaller neater more cleanly model they form now a exact and careful duplicate of the larger track beside they the foot that produce they have therefore also change and something in he mind rear up with loathing and with terror as he see it simpson for the first time hesitate then ashamed of he alarm and indecision take a few hurry step ahead the next instant stop dead in he track immediately in front of he all sign of the trail cease both track come to a abrupt end on all side for a hundred yard and more he search in vain for the least indication of they continuance there be -- nothing the tree be very thick just there big tree all of they spruce cedar hemlock there be no underbrush he stand look about he all distraught bereft of any power of judgment then he set to work to search again and again and yet again but always with the same result : _ nothing _ the foot that print the surface of the snow thus far have now apparently leave the ground and it be in that moment of distress and confusion that the whip of terror lay its most nicely calculate lash about he heart it drop with deadly effect upon the sorest spot of all completely unnerve he he have be secretly dread all the time that it would come -- and come it do far overhead mute by great height and distance strangely thin and wail he hear the cry voice of défago the guide the sound drop upon he out of that still wintry sky with a effect of dismay and terror unsurpassed the rifle fall to he foot he stand motionless a instant listening as it be with he whole body then stagger back against the nearest tree for support disorganized hopelessly in mind and spirit to he in that moment it seem the most shatter and dislocate experience he have ever know so that he heart empty itself of all feeling whatsoever as by a sudden draught oh oh this fiery height oh my foot of fire my burning foot of fire run in far beseech accent of indescribable appeal this voice of anguish down the sky once it call -- then silence through all the listen wilderness of tree and simpson scarcely know what he do presently find himself run wildly to and fro search call trip over root and boulder and fling himself in a frenzy of undirected pursuit after the caller behind the screen of memory and emotion with which experience veil event he plunge distract and half-deranged pick up false light like a ship at sea terror in he eye and heart and soul for the panic of the wilderness have call to he in that far voice -- the power of untame distance -- the enticement of the desolation that destroy he know in that moment all the pain of someone hopelessly and irretrievably lose suffer the lust and travail of a soul in the final loneliness a vision of défago eternally hunt drive and pursue across the skiey vastness of those ancient forest flee like a flame across the dark ruin of he thought it seem age before he could find anything in the chaos of he disorganized sensation to which he could anchor himself steady for a moment and think the cry be not repeat he own hoarse call bring no response the inscrutable force of the wild have summon they victim beyond recall -- and hold he fast \* \* \* \* \* yet he search and call it seem for hour afterwards for it be late in the afternoon when at length he decide to abandon a useless pursuit and return to he camp on the shore of fifty island water even then he go with reluctance that cry voice still echo in he ear with difficulty he find he rifle and the homeward trail the concentration necessary to follow the badly blaze tree and a bite hunger that gnaw help to keep he mind steady otherwise he admit the temporary aberration he have suffer might have be prolong to the point of positive disaster gradually the ballast shift back again and he regain something that approach he normal equilibrium but for all that the journey through the gathering dusk be miserably haunt he hear innumerable follow footstep voice that laugh and whisper and see figure crouch behind tree and boulder make sign to one another for a concerted attack the moment he have pass the creep murmur of the wind make he start and listen he go stealthily try to hide where possible and make as little sound as he could the shadow of the wood hitherto protective or cover merely have now become menacing challenging and the pageantry in he frightened mind mask a host of possibility that be all the more ominous for be obscure the presentiment of a nameless doom lurk ill-concealed behind every detail of what have happen it be really admirable how he emerge victor in the end man of riper power and experience might have come through the ordeal with less success he have himself tolerably well in hand all thing consider and he plan of action prove it sleep be absolutely out of the question and travel a unknown trail in the darkness equally impracticable he sit up the whole of that night rifle in hand before a fire he never for a single moment allow to die down the severity of the haunt vigil mark he soul for life but it be successfully accomplish and with the very first sign of dawn he set forth upon the long return journey to the home camp to get help as before he leave a written note to explain he absence and to indicate where he have leave a plentiful _ cache _ of food and match -- though he have no expectation that any human hand would find they how simpson find he way alone by the lake and forest might well make a story in itself for to hear he tell it be to _ know _ the passionate loneliness of soul that a man can feel when the wilderness hold he in the hollow of its illimitable hand -- and laugh it be also to admire he indomitable pluck he claim no skill declare that he follow the almost invisible trail mechanically and without think and this doubtless be the truth he rely upon the guide of the unconscious mind which be instinct perhaps too some sense of orientation know to animal and primitive man may have help as well for through all that tangled region he succeed in reach the exact spot where défago have hide the canoe nearly three day before with the remark strike doo west across the lake into the sun to find the camp there be not much sun leave to guide he but he use he compass to the best of he ability embark in the frail craft for the last twelve mile of he journey with a sensation of immense relief that the forest be at last behind he and fortunately the water be calm he take he line across the center of the lake instead of coast round the shore for another twenty mile fortunately too the other hunter be back the light of they fire furnish a steering point without which he might have search all night long for the actual position of the camp it be close upon midnight all the same when he canoe grate on the sandy cove and hank punk and he uncle disturb in they sleep by he cry run quickly down and help a very exhaust and break specimen of scotch humanity over the rock toward a die fire vi the sudden entrance of he prosaic uncle into this world of wizardry and horror that have haunt he without interruption now for two day and two night have the immediate effect of give to the affair a entirely new aspect the sound of that crisp hulloa my boy and what be up _ now _ and the grasp of that dry and vigorous hand introduce another standard of judgment a revulsion of feeling wash through he he realize that he have let himself go rather badly he even feel vaguely ashamed of himself the native hard-headedness of he race reclaim he and this doubtless explain why he find it so hard to tell that group round the fire -- everything he tell enough however for the immediate decision to be arrive at that a relief party must start at the earliest possible moment and that simpson in order to guide it capably must first have food and above all sleep dr cathcart observe the lad 's condition more shrewdly than he patient know give he a very slight injection of morphine for six hour he sleep like the dead from the description carefully write out afterwards by this student of divinity it appear that the account he give to the astonished group omit sundry vital and important detail he declare that with he uncle 's wholesome matter-of-fact countenance stare he in the face he simply have not the courage to mention they thus all the search party gather it would seem be that défago have suffer in the night a acute and inexplicable attack of mania have imagine himself call by someone or something and have plunge into the bush after it without food or rifle where he must die a horrible and linger death by cold and starvation unless he could be find and rescue in time in time moreover mean _ at once _ in the course of the follow day however -- they be off by seven leave punk in charge with instruction to have food and fire always ready -- simpson find it possible to tell he uncle a good deal more of the story 's true inwardness without divine that it be draw out of he as a matter of fact by a very subtle form of cross examination by the time they reach the beginning of the trail where the canoe be lay up against the return journey he have mention how défago speak vaguely of something he call a ` wendigo ' how he cry in he sleep how he imagine a unusual scent about the camp and have betray other symptom of mental excitement he also admit the bewildering effect of that extraordinary odor upon himself pungent and acrid like the odor of lion and by the time they be within a easy hour of fifty island water he have let slip the further fact -- a foolish avowal of he own hysterical condition as he feel afterwards -- that he have hear the vanish guide call for help he omit the singular phrase use for he simply could not bring himself to repeat the preposterous language also while describe how the man 's footstep in the snow have gradually assume a exact miniature likeness of the animal 's plunge track he leave out the fact that they measure a _ wholly _ incredible distance it seem a question nicely balanced between individual pride and honesty what he should reveal and what suppress he mention the fiery tinge in the snow for instance yet shrink from tell that body and bed have be partly drag out of the tent with the net result that dr cathcart adroit psychologist that he fancy himself to be have assure he clearly enough exactly where he mind influence by loneliness bewilderment and terror have yield to the strain and invite delusion while praise he conduct he manage at the same time to point out where when and how he mind have go astray he make he nephew think himself finer than he be by judicious praise yet more foolish than he be by minimize the value of the evidence like many another materialist that be he lie cleverly on the basis of insufficient knowledge _ because _ the knowledge supply seem to he own particular intelligence inadmissible the spell of these terrible solitude he say can not leave any mind untouch any mind that be possess of the higher imaginative quality it have work upon yours exactly as it work upon my own when i be you age the animal that haunt you little camp be undoubtedly a moose for the ` belling ' of a moose may have sometimes a very peculiar quality of sound the color appearance of the big track be obviously a defect of vision in you own eye produce by excitement the size and stretch of the track we shall prove when we come to they but the hallucination of a audible voice of course be one of the commonest form of delusion due to mental excitement -- a excitement my dear boy perfectly excusable and let I add wonderfully control by you under the circumstance for the rest i be bind to say you have act with a splendid courage for the terror of feeling oneself lose in this wilderness be nothing short of awful and have i be in you place i do not for a moment believe i could have behave with one quarter of you wisdom and decision the only thing i find it uncommonly difficult to explain be -- that -- damned odor it make I feel sick i assure you declare he nephew positively dizzy he uncle 's attitude of calm omniscience merely because he know more psychological formula make he slightly defiant it be so easy to be wise in the explanation of a experience one have not personally witness a kind of desolate and terrible odor be the only way i can describe it he conclude glance at the feature of the quiet unemotional man beside he i can only marvel be the reply that under the circumstance it do not seem to you even worse the dry word simpson know hover between the truth and he uncle 's interpretation of the truth \* \* \* \* \* and so at last they come to the little camp and find the tent still stand the remains of the fire and the piece of paper pin to a stake beside it -- untouch the cache poorly contrived by inexperienced hand however have be discover and open -- by musk rat mink and squirrel the match lay scatter about the opening but the food have be take to the last crumb well feller he be not here exclaim hank loudly after he fashion and that be as sartain as the coal supply down below but whar he be get to by this time be ` bout as unsartain as the trade in crown in t ` other place the presence of a divinity student be no barrier to he language at such a time though for the reader 's sake it may be severely edit i propose he add that we start out at once a ' hunt for be like hell the gloom of défago 's probable fate oppress the whole party with a sense of dreadful gravity the moment they see the familiar sign of recent occupancy especially the tent with the bed of balsam branch still smooth and flatten by the pressure of he body seem to bring he presence near to they simpson feeling vaguely as if he world be somehow at stake go about explain particulars in a hushed tone he be much calmer now though overwearied with the strain of he many journey he uncle 's method of explain -- explain away rather -- the detail still fresh in he haunted memory help too to put ice upon he emotion and that be the direction he run off in he say to he two companion point in the direction where the guide have vanish that morning in the gray dawn straight down there he run like a deer in between the birch and the hemlock hank and dr cathcart exchange glance and it be about two mile down there in a straight line continue the other speak with something of the former terror in he voice that i follow he trail to the place where -- it stop -- dead and where you heer he callin ' a ' catch the stench a ' all the rest of the wicked entertainment cry hank with a volubility that betray he keen distress and where you excitement overcome you to the point of produce illusion add dr cathcart under he breath yet not so low that he nephew do not hear it \* \* \* \* \* it be early in the afternoon for they have travel quickly and there be still a good two hour of daylight leave dr cathcart and hank lose no time in begin the search but simpson be too exhaust to accompany they they would follow the blaze mark on the tree and where possible he footstep meanwhile the best thing he could do be to keep a good fire go and rest but after something like three hour ' search the darkness already down the two man return to camp with nothing to report fresh snow have cover all sign and though they have follow the blaze tree to the spot where simpson have turn back they have not discover the smallest indication of a human being -- or for that matter of a animal there be no fresh track of any kind the snow lay undisturbed it be difficult to know what be best to do though in reality there be nothing more they _ could _ do they might stay and search for week without much chance of success the fresh snow destroy they only hope and they gather round the fire for supper a gloomy and despondent party the fact indeed be sad enough for défago have a wife at rat portage and he earnings be the family 's sole means of support now that the whole truth in all its ugliness be out it seem useless to deal in further disguise or pretense they talk openly of the fact and probability it be not the first time even in the experience of dr cathcart that a man have yield to the singular seduction of the solitude and go out of he mind défago moreover be predispose to something of the sort for he already have a touch of melancholia in he blood and he fiber be weaken by bout of drinking that often last for week at a time something on this trip -- one might never know precisely what -- have suffice to push he over the line that be all and he have go go off into the great wilderness of tree and lake to die by starvation and exhaustion the chance against he finding camp again be overwhelming the delirium that be upon he would also doubtless have increase and it be quite likely he might do violence to himself and so hasten he cruel fate even while they talk indeed the end have probably come on the suggestion of hank he old pal however they propose to wait a little longer and devote the whole of the follow day from dawn to darkness to the most systematic search they could devise they would divide the territory between they they discuss they plan in great detail all that man could do they would do and meanwhile they talk about the particular form in which the singular panic of the wilderness have make its attack upon the mind of the unfortunate guide hank though familiar with the legend in its general outline obviously do not welcome the turn the conversation have take he contribute little though that little be illuminate for he admit that a story run over all this section of country to the effect that several indian have see the wendigo along the shore of fifty island water in the fall of last year and that this be the true reason of défago 's disinclination to hunt there hank doubtless feel that he have in a sense help he old pal to death by overpersuade he when a indian go crazy he explain talk to himself more than to the other it seem it be always put that he be ` see the wendigo ' a ' pore old défaygo be superstitious down to he very heel and then simpson feel the atmosphere more sympathetic tell over again the full story of he astonishing tale he leave out no detail this time he mention he own sensation and grip fear he only omit the strange language use but défago surely have already tell you all these detail of the wendigo legend my dear fellow insist the doctor i mean he have talk about it and thus put into you mind the idea which you own excitement afterwards develop whereupon simpson again repeat the fact défago he declare have barely mention the beast he simpson know nothing of the story and so far as he remember have never even read about it even the word be unfamiliar of course he be tell the truth and dr cathcart be reluctantly compel to admit the singular character of the whole affair he do not do this in word so much as in manner however he keep he back against a good stout tree he poke the fire into a blaze the moment it show sign of die down he be quicker than any of they to notice the least sound in the night about they -- a fish jump in the lake a twig snap in the bush the drop of occasional fragment of frozen snow from the branch overhead where the heat loosen they he voice too change a little in quality become a shade less confident lower also in tone fear to put it plainly hover close about that little camp and though all three would have be glad to speak of other matter the only thing they seem able to discuss be this -- the source of they fear they try other subject in vain there be nothing to say about they hank be the most honest of the group he say next to nothing he never once however turn he back to the darkness he face be always to the forest and when wood be need he do not go farther than be necessary to get it vii a wall of silence wrap they in for the snow though not thick be sufficient to deaden any noise and the frost hold thing pretty tight besides no sound but they voice and the soft roar of the flame make itself hear only from time to time something soft as the flutter of a pine moth 's wing go past they through the air no one seem anxious to go to bed the hour slip towards midnight the legend be picturesque enough observe the doctor after one of the longer pause speak to break it rather than because he have anything to say for the wendigo be simply the call of the wild personify which some nature hear to they own destruction that be about it hank say presently a ' there be no misunderstandin ' when you hear it it call you by name right ` nough another pause follow then dr cathcart come back to the forbid subject with a rush that make the other jump the allegory _ be _ significant he remark look about he into the darkness for the voice they say resemble all the minor sound of the bush -- wind fall water cry of the animal and so forth and once the victim hear _ that _ -- he be off for good of course he most vulnerable point moreover be say to be the foot and the eye the foot you see for the lust of wander and the eye for the lust of beauty the poor beggar go at such a dreadful speed that he bleed beneath the eye and he foot burn dr cathcart as he speak continue to peer uneasily into the surround gloom he voice sink to a hushed tone the wendigo he add be say to burn he foot -- owe to the friction apparently cause by its tremendous velocity -- till they drop off and new one form exactly like its own simpson listen in horrified amazement but it be the pallor on hank 's face that fascinate he most he would willingly have stop he ear and close he eye have he dare it do not always keep to the ground neither come in hank 's slow heavy drawl for it go so high that he think the star have set he all a-fire a ' it 'll take great thumpin ' jump sometimes a ' run along the top of the tree carry its partner with it a ' then droppin ' he jest as a fish hawk 'll drop a pickerel to kill it before eatin ' a ' its food of all the muck in the whole bush be -- moss and he laugh a short unnatural laugh it be a moss-eater be the wendigo he add look up excitedly into the face of he companion moss-eater he repeat with a string of the most outlandish oath he could invent but simpson now understand the true purpose of all this talk what these two man each strong and experienced in he own way dread more than anything else be -- silence they be talk against time they be also talk against darkness against the invasion of panic against the admission reflection might bring that they be in a enemy 's country -- against anything in fact rather than allow they inmost thought to assume control he himself already initiate by the awful vigil with terror be beyond both of they in this respect he have reach the stage where he be immune but these two the scoffing analytical doctor and the honest dogged backwoodsman each sit tremble in the depths of he be thus the hour pass and thus with lowered voice and a kind of taut inner resistance of spirit this little group of humanity sit in the jaw of the wilderness and talk foolishly of the terrible and haunting legend it be a unequal contest all thing consider for the wilderness have already the advantage of first attack -- and of a hostage the fate of they comrade hang over they with a steadily increase weight of oppression that finally become insupportable it be hank after a pause longer than the precede one that no one seem able to break who first let loose all this pent-up emotion in very unexpected fashion by spring suddenly to he foot and let out the most ear-shattering yell imaginable into the night he could not contain himself any longer it seem to make it carry even beyond a ordinary cry he interrupt its rhythm by shake the palm of he hand before he mouth that be for défago he say look down at the other two with a queer defiant laugh for it be my belief -- the sandwiched oath may be omit -- that my ole partner 's not far from we at this very minute there be a vehemence and recklessness about he performance that make simpson too start to he foot in amazement and betray even the doctor into let the pipe slip from between he lip hank 's face be ghastly but cathcart 's show a sudden weakness -- a loosening of all he faculty as it be then a momentary anger blaze into he eye and he too though with deliberation bear of habitual self-control get upon he foot and face the excited guide for this be unpermissible foolish dangerous and he mean to stop it in the bud what might have happen in the next minute or two one may speculate about yet never definitely know for in the instant of profound silence that follow hank 's roar voice and as though in answer to it something go past through the darkness of the sky overhead at terrific speed -- something of necessity very large for it displace much air while down between the tree there fall a faint and windy cry of a human voice call in tone of indescribable anguish and appeal -- oh oh this fiery height oh oh my foot of fire my burning foot of fire white to the very edge of he shirt hank look stupidly about he like a child dr cathcart utter some kind of unintelligible cry turn as he do so with a instinctive movement of blind terror towards the protection of the tent then halt in the act as though frozen simpson alone of the three retain he presence of mind a little he own horror be too deep to allow of any immediate reaction he have hear that cry before turn to he stricken companion he say almost calmly -- that be exactly the cry i hear -- the very word he use then lift he face to the sky he cry aloud défago défago come down here to we come down -- and before there be time for anybody to take definite action one way or another there come the sound of something drop heavily between the tree strike the branch on the way down and landing with a dreadful thud upon the frozen earth below the crash and thunder of it be really terrific that be he s ` help I the good gawd come from hank in a whisper cry half choke he hand go automatically toward the hunting knife in he belt and he be come he be come he add with a irrational laugh of horror as the sound of heavy footstep crunch over the snow become distinctly audible approach through the blackness towards the circle of light and while the step with they stumbling motion move nearer and nearer upon they the three man stand round that fire motionless and dumb dr cathcart have the appearance of a man suddenly wither even he eye do not move hank suffering shockingly seem on the verge again of violent action yet do nothing he too be hew of stone like stricken child they seem the picture be hideous and meanwhile they owner still invisible the footstep come closer crunch the frozen snow it be endless -- too prolonged to be quite real -- this measure and pitiless approach it be accursed viii then at length the darkness have thus laboriously conceive bring forth -- a figure it draw forward into the zone of uncertain light where fire and shadow mingle not ten foot away then halt stare at they fixedly the same instant it start forward again with the spasmodic motion as of a thing move by wire and come up closer to they full into the glare of the fire they perceive then that -- it be a man and apparently that this man be -- défago something like a skin of horror almost perceptibly draw down in that moment over every face and three pair of eye shine through it as though they see across the frontier of normal vision into the unknown défago advance he tread falter and uncertain he make he way straight up to they as a group first then turn sharply and peer close into the face of simpson the sound of a voice issue from he lip -- here i be boss simpson i heered someone call I it be a faint dry up voice make wheezy and breathless as by immense exertion i be havin ' a reg ` lar hellfire kind of a trip i be and he laugh thrust he head forward into the other 's face but that laugh start the machinery of the group of waxwork figure with the wax-white skin hank immediately spring forward with a stream of oath so farfetched that simpson do not recognize they as english at all but think he have lapse into indian or some other lingo he only realize that hank 's presence thrust thus between they be welcome -- uncommonly welcome dr cathcart though more calmly and leisurely advanced behind he heavily stumble simpson seem hazy as to what be actually say and do in those next few seconds for the eye of that detestable and blast visage peer at such close quarter into he own utterly bewildered he sens at first he merely stand still he say nothing he have not the train will of the older man that force they into action in defiance of all emotional stress he watch they move as behind a glass that half destroy they reality it be dreamlike perverted yet through the torrent of hank 's meaningless phrase he remember hear he uncle 's tone of authority -- hard and force -- say several thing about food and warmth blanket whisky and the rest and further that whiff of that penetrate unaccustomed odor vile yet sweetly bewildering assail he nostril during all that follow it be no less a person than himself however -- less experienced and adroit than the other though he be -- who give instinctive utterance to the sentence that bring a measure of relief into the ghastly situation by express the doubt and think in each one 's heart it _ be _ -- you be not it défago he ask under he breath horror break he speech and at once cathcart burst out with the loud answer before the other have time to move he lip of course it be of course it be only -- can not you see -- he be nearly dead with exhaustion cold and terror be not _ that _ enough to change a man beyond all recognition it be say in order to convince himself as much as to convince the other the overemphasis alone prove that and continually while he speak and act he hold a handkerchief to he nose that odor pervade the whole camp for the défago who sit huddle by the big fire wrap in blanket drink hot whisky and hold food in waste hand be no more like the guide they have last see alive than the picture of a man of sixty be like a daguerreotype of he early youth in the costume of another generation nothing really can describe that ghastly caricature that parody masquerade there in the firelight as défago from the ruin of the dark and awful memory he still retain simpson declare that the face be more animal than human the feature draw about into wrong proportion the skin loose and hang as though he have be subject to extraordinary pressure and tension it make he think vaguely of those bladder face blow up by the hawker on ludgate hill that change they expression as they swell and as they collapse emit a faint and wail imitation of a voice both face and voice suggest some such abominable resemblance but cathcart long afterwards seek to describe the indescribable assert that thus might have look a face and body that have be in air so rarify that the weight of atmosphere be remove the entire structure threaten to fly asunder and become -- _ incoherent _ it be hank though all distraught and shake with a tear volume of emotion he could neither handle nor understand who bring thing to a head without much ado he go off to a little distance from the fire apparently so that the light should not dazzle he too much and shade he eye for a moment with both hand shout in a loud voice that hold anger and affection dreadfully mingle : you be not défaygo you be not défaygo at all i do not give a -- damn but that be not you my ole pal of twenty year he glare upon the huddle figure as though he would destroy he with he eye a ' if it be i 'll swab the floor of hell with a wad of cotton wool on a toothpick s ` help I the good gawd he add with a violent fling of horror and disgust it be impossible to silence he he stand there shout like one possess horrible to see horrible to hear -- _ because it be the truth _ he repeat himself in fifty different way each more outlandish than the last the wood ring with echo at one time it look as if he mean to fling himself upon the intruder for he hand continually jerk towards the long hunting knife in he belt but in the end he do nothing and the whole tempest complete itself very shortly with tear hank 's voice suddenly break he collapse on the ground and cathcart somehow or other persuade he at last to go into the tent and lie quiet the remainder of the affair indeed be witness by he from behind the canvas he white and terrify face peeping through the crack of the tent door flap then dr cathcart closely follow by he nephew who so far have keep he courage better than all of they go up with a determine air and stand opposite to the figure of défago huddle over the fire he look he squarely in the face and speak at first he voice be firm défago tell we what be happen -- just a little so that we can know how best to help you he ask in a tone of authority almost of command and at that point it _ be _ command at once afterwards however it change in quality for the figure turn up to he a face so piteous so terrible and so little like humanity that the doctor shrink back from he as from something spiritually unclean simpson watch close behind he say he get the impression of a mask that be on the verge of drop off and that underneath they would discover something black and diabolical reveal in utter nakedness out with it man out with it cathcart cry terror run neck and neck with entreaty none of we can stand this much longer it be the cry of instinct over reason and then défago smile _ whitely _ answer in that thin and fading voice that already seem pass over into a sound of quite another character -- i see that great wendigo thing he whisper sniff the air about he exactly like a animal i be with it too -- whether the poor devil would have say more or whether dr cathcart would have continue the impossible cross examination can not be know for at that moment the voice of hank be hear yell at the top of he voice from behind the canvas that conceal all but he terrify eye such a howl be never hear he foot oh gawd he foot look at he great change -- foot défago shuffling where he sit have move in such a way that for the first time he leg be in full light and he foot be visible yet simpson have no time himself to see properly what hank have see and hank have never see fit to tell that same instant with a leap like that of a frightened tiger cathcart be upon he bundle the fold of blanket about he leg with such speed that the young student catch little more than a pass glimpse of something dark and oddly mass where moccasined foot ought to have be and see even that but with uncertain vision then before the doctor have time to do more or simpson time to even think a question much less ask it défago be stand upright in front of they balance with pain and difficulty and upon he shapeless and twisted visage a expression so dark and so malicious that it be in the true sense monstrous now _ you _ see it too he wheeze you see my fiery burning foot and now -- that be unless you kin save I a ' prevent -- it be ` bout time for -- he piteous and beseeching voice be interrupt by a sound that be like the roar of wind come across the lake the tree overhead shake they tangled branch the blaze fire bent its flame as before a blast and something sweep with a terrific rush noise about the little camp and seem to surround it entirely in a single moment of time défago shake the clinging blanket from he body turn towards the wood behind and with the same stumbling motion that have bring he -- be go : go before anyone could move muscle to prevent he go with a amazing blunder swiftness that leave no time to act the darkness positively swallow he and less than a dozen seconds later above the roar of the sway tree and the shout of the sudden wind all three man watch and listen with stricken heart hear a cry that seem to drop down upon they from a great height of sky and distance -- oh oh this fiery height oh oh my foot of fire my burning foot of fire then die away into untold space and silence dr cathcart -- suddenly master of himself and therefore of the other -- be just able to seize hank violently by the arm as he try to dash headlong into the bush but i want ter know -- you shriek the guide i want ter see that be not he at all but some -- devil that be shunt into he place somehow or other -- he admit he never quite know how he accomplish it -- he manage to keep he in the tent and pacify he the doctor apparently have reach the stage where reaction have set in and allow he own innate force to conquer certainly he manage hank admirably it be he nephew however hitherto so wonderfully control who give he most cause for anxiety for the cumulative strain have now produce a condition of lachrymose hysteria which make it necessary to isolate he upon a bed of bough and blanket as far remove from hank as be possible under the circumstance and there he lay as the watch of that haunt night pass over the lonely camp cry startled sentence and fragment of sentence into the fold of he blanket a quantity of gibberish about speed and height and fire mingled oddly with biblical memory of the classroom people with broken face all on fire be come at a most awful awful pace towards the camp he would moan one minute and the next would sit up and stare into the wood intently listen and whisper how terrible in the wilderness be -- be the foot of they that -- until he uncle come across the change the direction of he thought and comfort he the hysteria fortunately prove but temporary sleep cure he just as it cure hank till the first sign of daylight come soon after five o'clock dr cathcart keep he vigil he face be the color of chalk and there be strange flush beneath the eye a appalling terror of the soul battle with he will all through those silent hour these be some of the outer sign at dawn he light the fire himself make breakfast and wake the other and by seven they be well on they way back to the home camp -- three perplexed and afflict man but each in he own way have reduce he inner turmoil to a condition of more or less systematize order again ix they talk little and then only of the most wholesome and common thing for they mind be charge with painful thought that clamour for explanation though no one dare refer to they hank be nearest to primitive condition be the first to find himself for he be also less complex in dr cathcart civilization champion he force against a attack singular enough to this day perhaps he be not _ quite _ sure of certain thing anyhow he take longer to find himself simpson the student of divinity it be who arrange he conclusion probably with the best though not most scientific appearance of order out there in the heart of unreclaimed wilderness they have surely witness something crudely and essentially primitive something that have survive somehow the advance of humanity have emerge terrifically betray a scale of life still monstrous and immature he envisage it rather as a glimpse into prehistoric age when superstition gigantic and uncouth still oppress the heart of man when the force of nature be still untame the power that may have haunt a primeval universe not yet withdraw to this day he think of what he term year later in a sermon savage and formidable potency lurk behind the soul of man not evil perhaps in themselves yet instinctively hostile to humanity as it exist with he uncle he never discuss the matter in detail for the barrier between the two type of mind make it difficult only once year later something lead they to the frontier of the subject -- of a single detail of the subject rather -- can not you even tell I what -- _ they _ be like he ask and the reply though conceive in wisdom be not encourage it be far better you should not try to know or to find out well -- that odour persist the nephew what do you make of that dr cathcart look at he and raise he eyebrow odour he reply be not so easy as sound and sight of telepathic communication i make as much or as little probably as you do yourself he be not quite so glib as usual with he explanation that be all \* \* \* \* \* at the fall of day cold exhaust famish the party come to the end of the long portage and drag themselves into a camp that at first glimpse seem empty fire there be none and no punk come forward to welcome they the emotional capacity of all three be too over-spent to recognize either surprise or annoyance but the cry of spontaneous affection that burst from the lip of hank as he rush ahead of they towards the fire-place come probably as a warning that the end of the amazing affair be not quite yet and both cathcart and he nephew confess afterwards that when they see he kneel down in he excitement and embrace something that recline gently move beside the extinguished ash they feel in they very bone that this something would prove to be défago -- the true défago return and so indeed it be it be soon tell exhaust to the point of emaciation the french canadian -- what be leave of he that be -- fumble among the ash try to make a fire he body crouch there the weak finger obey feebly the instinctive habit of a lifetime with twig and match but there be no longer any mind to direct the simple operation the mind have flee beyond recall and with it too have flee memory not only recent event but all previous life be a blank this time it be the real man though incredibly and horribly shrunken on he face be no expression of any kind whatever -- fear welcome or recognition he do not seem to know who it be that embrace he or who it be that fed warm and speak to he the word of comfort and relief forlorn and broken beyond all reach of human aid the little man do meekly as he be bid the something that have constitute he individual have vanish for ever in some way it be more terribly move than anything they have yet see -- that idiot smile as he draw wad of coarse moss from he swollen cheek and tell they that he be a damned moss-eater the continue vomiting of even the simplest food and worst of all the piteous and childish voice of complaint in which he tell they that he foot pained he -- burn like fire -- which be natural enough when dr cathcart examine they and find that both be dreadfully frozen beneath the eye there be faint indication of recent bleed the detail of how he survive the prolonged exposure of where he have be or of how he cover the great distance from one camp to the other include a immense detour of the lake on foot since he have no canoe -- all this remain unknown he memory have vanish completely and before the end of the winter whose beginning witness this strange occurrence défago bereft of mind memory and soul have go with it he linger only a few week and what punk be able to contribute to the story throw no further light upon it he be clean fish by the lake shore about five o'clock in the evening -- a hour that be before the search party return -- when he see this shadow of the guide pick its way weakly into camp in advance of he he declare come the faint whiff of a certain singular odour that same instant old punk start for home he cover the entire journey of three day as only indian blood could have cover it the terror of a whole race drive he he know what it all mean défago have see the wendigo end of the project gutenberg ebook of the wendigo by algernon blackwood
