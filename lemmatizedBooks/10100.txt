do so another she consent on inquire next morning after the child she be tell by captain byron that he have have quite enough of he young visitor after a short stay in the north the captain extort enough money from he wife to enable he to fly from he creditor escape to france he absence must have be a relief but he death be say to have so affect the unhappy lady that she shriek disturb the neighborhood the circumstance recall a anecdote of a similar outburst -- attest by sir w scott who be present on the occasion -- before she marriage be present at a representation in edinburgh of the _ fatal marriage _ when mr siddon be personate isabellum miss gordon be seize with a fit and carry out of the theater scream out o my biron my biron all we know of she character show it to have be not only proud impulsive and wayward but hysterical she constantly boast of she descent and clung to the courtesy title of honorable to which she have no claim she affection and anger be alike demonstrative she temper never for a hour secure she half worshipped half hate the blackguard to whom she be marry and take no step to protect she property she son she alternately pet and abuse you mother 's a fool say a school companion to he year after i know it be he unique and tragic reply never be poet bear to so much illustrious and to so much bad blood the record of he infancy betray the temper which he preserve through life -- passionate sullen defiant of authority but singularly amenable to kindness on be scold by he first nurse for have soil a dress without utter a word he tear it from top to seam as he have see he mother tear she cap and gown but she sister and successor in office may gray acquire and retain a hold over he affection to which he have bear grateful testimony to she training be attribute the early and remarkable knowledge of the scripture especially of the psalm which he possess : he be accord to she later testimony peculiarly inquisitive and puzzling about religion of the sense of solitude induce by he earliest impression he characteristically make a boast my daughter my wife my half-sister my mother my sister 's mother my natural daughter and myself be or be all only child but the fiercest animal have the fewest number in they litter as lion tiger & c to this practical orphanhood and inheritance of feverish passion there be add another and to he a heavy and life-long burden a physical defect in a healthy nature may either pass without notice or be turn to a high purpose no line of he work reveal the fact that sir walter scott be lame the infirmity fail to cast even a pass shade over that serene power milton 's blindness be the occasion of the noblest prose and verse of resignation in the language but to understand pope we must remember that he be a cripple : and byron never allow we to forget because he himself never forget it account differ as to the extent and origin of he deformity and the doubt on the matter be not remove by the inconsistent account of the indelicate post-mortem examination make by mr trelawny at mesolonghus it be certain that one of the poet 's foot be either at birth or at a very early period so seriously club or twist as to affect he gait and to a considerable extent he habit it also appear that the surgical means -- boot bandage & c -- adopt to straighten the limb only aggravate the evil he sensitiveness on the subject be early awaken by careless or unfeeling reference what a pretty boy byron be say a friend of he nurse what a pity he have such a leg on which the child with flash eye cut at she with a baby 's whip cry out dinna speak of it he mother herself in she violent fit when the boy run round the room laughing at she attempt to catch he use to say he be a little dog as bad as he father and to call he a lame brat -- a incident which notoriously suggest the opening scene of the _ deform transform _ in the height of he popularity he fancy that the beggar and street-sweeper in london be mock he he satirize and discourage dancing he prefer ride and swim to other exercise because they conceal he weakness and on he death-bed ask to be blister in such a way that he might not be call on to expose it the countess guicciolus lady blessington and other assure we that in society few would have observe the defect if he have not refer to it but it be never far from the mind and therefore never far from the mouth of the least reticent of man in 1792 he be send to a rudimentary day school of girl and boy teach by a mr bower where he seem to have learn nothing save to repeat monosyllable by rote he next pass through the hand of a devout and clever clergyman name ross under whom accord to he own account he make astonishing progress be initiate into the study of roman history and take special delight in the battle of regillus long afterwards when stand on the height of tusculum and look down on the little round lake he remember he young enthusiasm and he old instructor he next come under the charge of a tutor call paterson whom he describe as a very serious saturnine but kind young man he be the son of my shoemaker but a good scholar with he i begin latin and continue till i go to the grammar school where i threaded all the class to the fourth when i be recall to england by the demise of my uncle of byron 's early school day there be little further record we learn from scatter hint that he be backward in technical scholarship and low in he class in which he seem to have have no ambition to stand high but that he eagerly take to history and romance especially luxuriate in the _ arabian night _ he be a indifferent penman and always dislike mathematics but be note by master and mate as of quick temper eager for adventure prone to sport always more ready to give a blow than to take one affectionate though resentful when he cousin be kill at corsica in 1794 he become the next heir to the title in 1797 a friend mean to compliment the boy say we shall have the pleasure some day of read you speech in the house of common he with precocious consciousness reply i hope not if you read any speech of mine it will be in the house of lord similarly when in the course of the following year the fierce old man at newstead die and the young lord 's name be call at school with dominus prefix to it he emotion be so great that he be unable to answer and burst into tear belong to this period be the somewhat shadowy record of a childish passion for a distant cousin slightly he senior mary duff with whom he claim to have fall in love in he ninth year we have a quaint picture of the pair sit on the grass together the girl 's younger sister beside they play with a doll a german critic gravely remark this strange phenomenon place he beside dante byron himself dilate on the strength of he attachment tell we that he use to coax a maid to write letter for he and that when he be sixteen on be inform by he mother of mary 's marriage he nearly fall into convulsion but in the history of the calf-love of poet it be difficult to distinguish between the imaginative afterthought and the reality this equally apply to other recollection of later year moore remark -- that the charm of scenery which derive its chief power from fancy and association should be feel at a age when fancy be yet hardly awake and association be but few can with difficulty he conceive but between the age of eight and ten a appreciation of external beauty be sufficiently common no one doubt the accuracy of wordsworth 's account in the _ prelude _ of he early half-sensuous delight in mountain glory it be impossible to define the influence of nature either on nation or individual or to say beforehand what selection from he varied surroundings a poet will for artistic purpose elect to make shakespeare rest in meadow and glade and leave to milton teneriffe and atla burn who live for a considerable part of he life in daily view of the hill of arran never allude to they but in this respect like shelley byron be inspire by a passion for the high-place of the earth they shadow be on half he verse the loftiest peak most wrapt in cloud and snow perpetually remind he of one of he constantly recur refrain -- he who surpass or subdue mankind must look down on the hate of those below in the course of 1790 after a attack of scarlet fever at aberdeen he be take by he mother to ballater and on he recovery spend much of he time in rambling about the country from this period he say i date my love of mountainous country i can never forget the effect year afterwards in england of the only thing i have long see even in miniature of a mountain in the malvern hill after i return to cheltenham i use to watch they every afternoon at sunset with a sensation which i can not describe elsewhere in _ the island _ he return amid allusion to the alp and apennine to the friend of he youth : -- the infant rapture still survive the boy and lach-na-gair with ida look would o'er troy mixed celtic memory with the phrygian mount and highland linn with castalie 's clear fount the poet owe to he physical defect be not a great climber and we be inform on the authority of he nurse that he never even scale the easily attainable summit of the steep frowning hill of which he have make such effective use but the impression of it from a distance be none the less genuine in the midst of a generous address in _ don juan _ to jeffrey he again refer to the same association with the country of he early training : -- but i be half a scot by birth and breed a whole one and my heart fly to my head as auld lang syne bring scotland one and all -- scotch plaid scotch snood the blue hill and clear stream the dee the don balgounie 's brig 's black wall -- all my boy feeling all my gentler dream of what i then dream clothe in they own pall like banquo 's offspring byron 's allusion to scotland be variable and inconsistent he satire on she reviewer be sharpen by the show of national as well as personal antipathy and when about the time of its production a young lady remark that he have a little of the northern manner of speech he burst out good god i hope not i would rather the whole d -- d country be sink in the sea i the scotch accent but in the passage from which we have quote the swirl of feeling on the other side continue -- i rail would at scot to show my wrath and wit which must be own would be sensitive and surly yet ` tis in vain such sally to permit they can not quench young feeling fresh and early i scotch would not kill would the scotchman in my blood and love the land of mountain and of flood this suggest a few word on a question of more than local interest byron 's most careful biographer have say of he : although on he first expedition to greece he be dress in the tartan of the gordon clan yet the whole bent of he mind and the character of he poetry be anything but scottish scottish nationality be taint with narrow and provincial element byron 's poetic character on the other hand be universal and cosmopolitan he have no attachment to locality and never devoted himself to the study of the history of scotland and its romantic legend somewhat similarly thoma campbell remark of burn he be the most un-scotsmanlike of scotchmen have no caution rough national verdict be apt to be superficial mr leslie stephen in a review of hawthorne have comment on the extent to which the nobler quality and conquer energy of the english character be hide not only from foreigner but from ourselves by the detestable lay figure of john bull in like manner the obtrusive type of the canny scot be apt to make critic forget the hot heart that have mark the early annals of the country from the hebride to the border with so much violence and at the same time have be the source of so much strong feeling and persistent purpose of late year the struggle for existence the temptation of a too ambitious and over active people in

to idle company and in other way be continually hamper he progress byron on he accession to the peerage have become a ward in chancery be hand over by the court to the guardianship of lord carlisle nephew of the admiral and son of the grand aunt of the poet like he mother this earl aspire to be a poet and he tragedy _ the father 's revenge _ receive some commendation from dr johnson but he relation with he illustrious kinsman be from the first unsatisfactory in answer to dr glennie 's appeal he exert he authority against the interruption to he ward 's education but the attempt to mend matter lead to such outrageous exhibition of temper that he say to the master i can have nothing more to do with mr byron you must now manage she as you can finally after two year of work which she have do she best to mar she herself request he guardian to have she son remove to a public school and accordingly he go to harrow where he remain till the autumn of 1805 the first vacation in the summer of 1801 be mark by he visit to cheltenham where he mother from whom he inherit a fair amount of scotch superstition consult a fortune-teller who say he would be twice marry the second time to a foreigner harrow be then under the management of dr joseph drury one of the most estimable of its distinguished head-master he account of the first impression produce by he pupil and he judicious manner of handle a sensitive nature can not with advantage be condensed mr hanson he write lord byron 's solicitor consign he to my care at the age of thirteen and a half with remark that he education have be neglect that he be ill prepare for a public school but that he think there be a cleverness about he after he departure i take my young disciple into my study and endeavor to bring he forward by inquiry as to he former amusement employment and associate but with little or no effect and i soon find that a wild mountain colt have be submit to my management but there be mind in he eye in the first place it be necessary to attach he to a elder boy but the information he receive give he no pleasure when he hear of the advance of some much younger than himself this i discover and assure he that he should not be place till by diligence he might rank with those of he own age he manner and temper soon convinced I that he might be lead by a silken string to a point rather than a cable : on that principle i act after a time dr drury tell we that he wait on lord carlisle who wish to give some information about he ward 's property and to inquire respect he ability and continue : on the former circumstance i make no remark as to the latter i reply ` he have talent my lord which will add lustre to he rank ' ` indeed ' say he lordship with a degree of surprise that accord to my feeling do not express in it all the satisfaction i expect with perhaps unconscious humor on the part of the writer we be leave in doubt as to whether the indifference proceed from the jealousy that cling to poetaster from incredulity or a feeling that no talent could add lustre to rank in 1804 byron refer to the antipathy he mother have to he guardian later he express gratitude for some unknown service in recognition of which the second edition of the _ hour of idleness _ be dedicate by he obliged ward and affectionate kinsman to lord carlisle the tribute be coldly receive lead to fresh estrangement and when byron on he come of age write to remind the earl of the fact in expectation of be introduce to the house of peer he have for answer a mere formal statement of its rule this rebuff affect he as addison 's praise of tickell affect pope and the follow line be publish in the march of the same year : -- lord too be bard such thing at time befall and ` tis some praise in peer to write at all yet do or taste or reason sway the time ah who would take they title with they rhyme roscommon sheffield with you spirit flee no future laurel deck a noble head no muse will cheer with renovate smile the paralytic puling of carlisle in prose he add if before i escape from my teens i say anything in favor of he lordship 's paper-book it be in the way of dutiful dedication and more from the advice of other than my own judgment and i seize the first opportunity of pronounce my sincere recantation as be frequently the case with he he recant again in a letter of 1814 he express to roger he regret for he sarcasm and in he reference to the death of the hon frederick howard in the third canto of _ childe harold _ he try to make amends in the line -- yet one i would select from that proud throng partly because they blend I with he line and partly that i do he sire some wrong this be all of any interest we know regard the fitful connection of the guardian and ward towards dr drury the poet continue through life to cherish sentiment of gratitude and always speak of he with veneration he be he say the best the kindest -lrb- and yet strict too -rrb- friend i ever have and i look on he still as a father whose warning i have remember but too well though too late when i have err and whose counsel i have but follow when i have do well or wisely great educational institution must consult the greatest good of the greatest number of common-place mind by regulation against which genius be apt to kick and byron who be by nature and lack of discipline peculiarly ill fit to conform to routine confess that till the last year and a half he hate harrow he never take kindly to the study of the place and be at no time a accurate scholar in the _ bard and reviewer _ and elsewhere he evince considerable familiarity with the lead author of antiquity but it be doubtful whether he be able to read any of the more difficult of they in the original he translation be generally commonplace and from the mark on he book he must have often fail to trust he memory for the meaning of the most ordinary greek word to the well-known passage in _ childe harold _ on soracte and the latian echo he append a prose comment which preserve its interest as hearing on recent educational controversy : -- i wish to express that we become tired of the task before we can comprehend the beauty that we learn by rote before we get by heart that the freshness be worn away and the future pleasure and advantage deaden and destroy at a age when we can neither feel nor understand the power of composition which it require a acquaintance with life as well as latin and greek to relish or to reason upon in some part of the continent young person be teach from common author and do not read the best classic till they maturity comparatively slight stress be then lay on modern language byron learn to read french with fluency as he certainly make himself familiar with the great work of the eighteenth century but he speak it with so little ease or accuracy that the fact be always a stumbling-block to he meeting frenchman abroad of german he have a mere smattering italian be the only language besides he own of which he be ever a master but the extent and variety of he general reading be remarkable he list of book draw up in 1807 include more history and biography than most man of education read during a long life a fair load of philosophy the poet en masse among orator demosthene cicero and parliamentary debate from the revolution to the year 1742 pretty copious divinity include blair tillotson hooker with the characteristic addition -- all very tiresome i abhor book of religion though i reverence and love my god without the blasphemous notion of sectary lastly under the head of miscellany we have _ spectator rambler world & c & c _ among novel the work of cervante field smollett richardson mackenzie sterne rabelai and rousseau he recommend burton 's _ anatomy of melancholy _ as the best storehouse for second-hand quotation as sterne and other have find it and tell we that the great part of the book name be peruse before the age of fifteen make allowance for the fact that most of the poet 's autobiographic sketch be emphatically _ dichtang und wahrheit _ we can believe that he be a omnivorous reader -- i read eat read in bed read when no one else read -- and have a memory only less retentive than macaulay 's acquire so much general information as to be suspect of pick it up from review he himself declare that he never read a review till he be eighteen year old -- when he himself write one utterly worthless on wordsworth at harrow byron prove himself capable of violent fit of work but of few continuous drudgery he would turn out a unusual number of hexameter and again lapse into as much idleness as the teacher would tolerate he forte be in declamation : he attitude and delivery and power of extemporize surprised even critical listener into unguarded praise my quality he say be much more oratorical and martial than poetical no one have the least notion that i should subside into poesy unpopular at first he begin to like school when he have fight he way to be a champion and from he energy in sport more than from the impression produce by he talent have come to be recognize as a leader among he fellow unfortunately towards the close of he course in 1805 the headship of harrow change hand dr drury retire and be succeed by dr butler this event suggest the line begin -- where be those honor ida once you own when probus fill would you magisterial throne the appointment be generally unpopular among the boy whose sympathy be enlist in favor of mark drury brother of they former master and dr butler seem for a time to have have considerable difficulty in maintain discipline byron always famous for rowing be a ringleader of the rebellious party and compare himself to tyrlaeus on one occasion he tear down the window grating in a room of the school-house with the remark that they darken the hall on another he be report to have refuse a dinner invitation from the master with the impertinent remark that he would never think of ask he in return to dine at newstead on the other hand he seem to have set limit to the mutiny and prevent some of the boy from set they desk on fire by point to they father ' name carve on they byron afterwards express regret for he rudeness but butler remain in he verse as pomposus of narrow brain yet of a narrower soul of the poet 's free hour during the last year of he residence which he refer to as among the happiest of he life many be spend in solitary musing by a elm-tree near a tomb to which he name have be give -- a spot command a far view of london of windsor bosome high in tufted

one of the warmest of friend and he pluck the more eagerly at the choicest fruit of english public school and college life from the feeling he so pathetically express -- be there no cause beyond the

resistance to he fag master and byron rush up to intercede with a offer to take half the blow peel be a exact contemporary have be bear in the same year 1788 it have be remark that most of the poet 's associate be he junior and less fairly that he like to regard they as he satellite but even at dulwich he ostentation of rank have provoke for he the nickname of the old english baron to wildman who as a senior have a right of inflict chastisement for offence he say i find you have get delawarr on you list pray do not lick he why not be the reply why i do not know except that he be a brother peer

affectionate verse address in the characteristic stanza entitle l'amiti est l'amour san aile we feel as if between they the qualify phrase might have be omit : for they letter carefully preserve on either side be a record of the jealous complaint and the reconciliation of lover in 1821 byron write i never hear the name clare without a beating of the heart even now and i write it with the feeling of 1803-4-5 ad infinitum at the same date he say of a accidental meeting : it annihilate for a moment all the year between the present time and the day of harrow it be a new and inexplicable feeling

I think so we be but five minute together on the public road but i hardly recollect a hour of my existence that could be weigh against they they be all that brother should be but the name and it be interesting to trace this relationship between the greatest genius of the new time and the son of the statesman who in the precede age stand out serene and strong amid the swarm of turbulent rioter and rant orator by whom he be surround and revile before leave harrow the poet have pass through the experience of a passion of another kind with a result that unhappily color he life account differ as to he first meeting with mary ann chaworth the heiress of the family whose estate adjoin he own and daughter of the race that have hold with he such varied relation in one of he letter ho date the introduction previous to he trip to cheltenham but it seem not to have ripen into intimacy till a later period byron who have in the autumn of 1802 visit he mother at bath join in a masquerade there and attract attention by the liveliness of he manners in the following year mr byron again settle at nottingham and in the course of a second and longer visit to she he frequently pass the night at the abbey of which lord gray de ruthyn be then a temporary tenant this be the occasion of he renew he acquaintance with the chaworth who invite he to they seat at annesley he use at first to return every evening to newstead give the excuse that the family picture would come down and take revenge on he for he grand-uncle 's deed a fancy repeat in the _ siege of corinth _ latterly he consent to stay at annesley which thus become he headquarters during the remainder of the holiday of 1803 the rest of the six week be mainly consume in a excursion to matlock and castleton in the same companionship this short period with the exception of prologue and epilogue embrace the whole story of he first real love byron be on this occasion in earnest he wish to marry miss chaworth a event which he say would have join broad land heal a old feud and satisfied at least one heart the intensity of he passion be suggestively bring before we in a account of he cross the styx of the peak cavern alone with the lady and the charon of the boat in the same passage he inform we that he have never tell he love but that she have discover -- it be obvious that she never return -- it we have another vivid picture of he irritation when she be waltz in he presence at matlock then a account of they ride together in the country on they return to the family residence again of he bend over the piano as she be play the welsh air of mary anne and lastly of he overhear she heartless speech to she maid which first open he eye to the real state of affair -- do you think i could care for that lame boy -- upon which he rush out of the house and run like a hunt creature to newstead thence he shortly return from the rougher school of life to he haunt and task at harrow a year later the pair again meet to take farewell on the hill of annesley -- a incident he have commemorate in two short stanza that have the sound of a wind moan over a moor i suppose he say the next time i see you you will be mrs chaworth i hope so she reply -lrb- she betrothed mr muster have agree to assume she family name -rrb- the announcement of she marriage which take place in August 1805 be make to he by he

haunt by a loss which he have make the theme of many of he verse in 1807 he send to the lady herself the line begin -- o have my fate be join would with thine in the following year he accept a invitation to dine at annesley and be visibly affect by the sight of the infant daughter of mr chaworth to whom he address a touching congratulation shortly afterwards when about to leave england for the first time he finally address she in the stanza -- ` tis do and shiver in the gale the bark unfurl she snowy sail some year later have a opportunity of revisit the family of he successful rival mr

contain passage of real pathos write in the year 1816 at diodatus as we be tell amid a flood of tear miss chaworth 's attraction beyond those of personal beauty seem to have be mainly due -- a common occurrence -- to the poet 's imagination a young lady two year he senior of a lively and volatile temper she enjoy the steal interview at the gate between the grounds and laugh at the ardent letter pass through a confidant of the still awkward youth whom she regard as a boy she have no intuition to divine the presence or appreciate the worship of one of the future master-mind of england nor any ambition to ally herself with the wild race of newstead and prefer she hale commonplace fox-hunting squire she be the beau ideal say byron in he first accurate prose account of the affair write 1823 a

cambridge be then mainly direct add somewhat rashly that english national literature stand for the most part beyond the range of the academic circle this statement be often reiterate with persistent inaccuracy but the most casual reference to biography inform we that at least four-fifth of the lead statesman reformer and philosopher of england have be nurture within the wall of she university and cherish a portion of they spirit from they have spring the intellectual fire that have at every crisis of we history kindle the nation into a new life from the age of wycliffe through those of latimer

poet of real note from barbor to tennyson we find the proportion of university man increase poeta nascitur et fit and if the demand of technical routine have sometimes tend to stifle the comparative repose of a seclusion unravaged by the fierce activity around it the habit of dwelling on the old wisdom and harping on the ancient string be calculate to foster the poetic temper and enrich its resource the discouraging effect of a sometimes supercilious and conservative criticism be not a unmixed evil the verse-writer who can be snuff out by the cavil of a tutorial drone be a poetaster silence for he country 's good it be true however that to original mind bubble with spontaneity or arrogant with the consciousness of power the discipline be hard and the restraint excessive and that

author similarly the richest page of byron 's work -- from the date of _ the curse of minerva _ to that of the isle of greece -- be brighten by light and adorn by allusion due to he training imperfect as it be on the slope of harrow and the association foster during he truant year by the sluggish stream of he injusta noverca at she however he continue to rail as late as the publication of _ beppo _ in the 75th and 76th stanza of which we find another cause of complaint -- one hate a author that be all author fellow in foolscap uniform turn would up with ink -- so very anxious clever fine and

expression of a sentiment which sound enough within limit byron push to a extreme he have a rooted dislike of professional _ littrateurs _ and be always haunt by a dread that they would claim equality with he on the common ground of authorship he aspire through life to the superiority of a double distinction that of a lord among wit and among wit a lord in this same spirit lie resent the comparison frequently make between he and rousseau and insist on point of contrast he have a bad memory i a good one he be of the people i of the aristocracy byron be capable of unbend where the difference of rank be so great that it could not be ignore on this principle we may explain he enthusiastic regard for the chorister eddlestone from whom he receive the cornelian that be the theme of some of he verse and whose untimely death in 1811 he sincerely mourn of he harrow friend harness and long in due course follow he to cambridge where they common pursuit be renew with the latter who be drown in 1809 on a passage to lisbon with he regiment he spend a considerable portion of he time on the cam swimming and diving in which art they be so expert as to pick up egg plate thimble and coin from a depth of fourteen foot -- incident recall to the poet 's mind by read milton 's invocation to sabrina during the same period he distinguish himself at cricket as in boxing ride and shooting of he skill as a rider there be various account he be a undoubted marksman and he habit of carry about pistol and use of they wherever he go be often a source of annoyance and alarm he profess a theoretical objection to duel but be as ready to take a challenge as scott and more ready to send one regard the master and professor of cambridge byron have little to say he own tutor tavell appear pleasantly enough in he verse and he commend the head of he college dr lort mansel for dignified demeanor in he office and a past reputation for convivial wit he attention to professor hailstone at harrowgate be graciously offer and receive but in a letter to murray he give a graphically abusive account of porson hiccuping greek like a helot in he cup the poet be first introduce at cambridge to a brilliant

of the pilgrimage and subsequent literary and political career byron bear witness to the warmth of he affection and the charm of he conversation and to the candor which as he confess to lady blessington sometimes try he patience there be little doubt that they have some misunderstanding when travel together but it be a pass cloud eighteen month after he return the poet admit that hobhouse be he best friend and when he unexpectedly walk up the stair of the palazzo lanfranchus at pisa madame guiccioli inform we that byron be seize with such violent emotion and so extreme a excess of joy that it seem to take away he strength and he be force to sit down in tear on the edge of this inner circle and in many respects associate with it be the rev franci hodgson a ripe scholar good translator a sound critic a fluent writer of graceful verse and a large-hearted divine whoso correspondence recently edit with a connect narrative by he son have throw light on dispute passage of lord byron 's life the view entertain by the friend on literary matter be almost identical they both fight under the standard of the classic school they resent the same criticism they applaud the same success and be bind together by the strong tie of mutual admiration byron commend hodgson 's verse and encourage he to write hodgson recognize in the _ bard and reviewer _ and the early canto of _ childe harold _ the promise of _ manfr _ and _ cain _ among the associate who strive to bring the poet back to the anchorage of fix belief and to wean he from the error of he thought franci hodgson be the most charitable and therefore the most judicious that he caution and exhortation be never stultify by pedantry or excessive dogmatism be apparent from the frank and unguarded answer which they call forth in several which be preserved and some for the first time reproduce in the recently-published memoir we be strike by the mixture of audacity and superficial dogmatism sometimes amount to effrontery that be apt to characterize the negation of a youthful sceptic in September 1811 byron write from newstead : -- i will have nothing to do with you immortality we be miserable enough in this life without the absurdity of speculate upon another christ come to save man but a good pagan will go to heaven and a bad nazarene to hell i be no platonist i be nothing at all but i would sooner be a paulician manichean spinozist gentile pyrrhonian zoroastrian than one of the seventy-two villainous sect who be tear each other to piece for the love of the lord and hatred of each other i will bring ten mussulman shall shame you all in good will towards man and prayer to god on a similar outburst in verse the rev f hodgson comment with a sweet humanity the poor dear soul mean nothing of this elsewhere the poet write i have read watson to gibbon he prove nothing so i be where i be verge towards spinoza and yet it be a gloomy creed and i want a better but there be something pagan in I that i can not shake off _ in short i deny nothing but i doubt everything _ but he early attitude on matter of religion be best set forth in a letter to gilford of 1813 in which he say i be no bigot to infidelity and do not expect that because i doubt the immortality of man i should be charge with deny the existence of a god it be the comparative insignificance of ourselves and we world when place in comparison of the mighty whole of which man be a atom that first lead I to imagine that we pretension to eternity might be overrate this and be early disgusted with a calvinistic scotch school where i be cudgel to church for the first ten year of my life afflict I with this malady for after all it be i believe a disease of the mind as much as other kind of hypochondria hodgson be a type of friendly forbearance and loyal attachment which have for they return a perfect open-heartedness in he correspondent to no one do the poet more freely abuse himself to no one do he indulge in more reckless sally of humor to no one do he more readily betray he little conceit from he byron seek and receive advice and he owe to he the prevention of what might have be a most foolish and disastrous encounter on the other hand the clergyman be the recipient of one of the poet 's many single-hearted act of munificence -- a gift of 1000_l _ to pay off debt to which he have be leave heir in a letter to he uncle the former gratefully allude to this generosity : oh if you know the exultation of heart aye and of head to i feel at be free from those depressing embarrassment you would as i do bless my dearest friend and brother byron the whole transaction be a please record of a benefit that be neither sooner nor later resent by the receiver among other associate of the same group should be mention henry drury -- long hodgson 's intimate friend and ultimately he brother-in-law to whom many of byron 's first series of letter from abroad be address -- and robert charle dalla a name surround with various association who play a not insignificant part in byron 's history and after he death help to swell the throng of he annotator this gentleman a connexion by marriage and author of some now forget novel first make acquaintance with the poet in london early in 1808 when we have two letter from byron in answer to some compliment on he early volume in which though address he correspondent merely as ` sir ' he flippancy and habit of boasting of excessive badness reach a absurd climax meanwhile during the interval of he attendance at college byron have make other friend he vacation be divide between london and southwell a small town on the road from mansfield and newark once a refuge of charle i and still adorn by a old norman minster here mr byron for several summer season take up

literary pursuit to whom a number of he letter be address also to the rev jt becher author of a treatise on the state of the poor to whom he be indebted for encouragement and counsel the poet often rail at the place which he find dull in comparison with cambridge and london writing from the latter in 1807 : o southwell how i rejoice to have leave thee and how i curse the heavy hour i drag along for so many month among the mohawk who inhabit you kraal and add that he sole satisfaction during he residence there be have pare off some pound of flush notwithstanding in the small but select society of this inland watering-place he pass on the whole a pleasant time -- listen to the music of the simple ballad in which he delight take part in the performance of the local theater make excursion and write verse this otherwise quiet time be disturb by exhibition of violence on the part of mr byron which suggest the idea of insanity after one more outrageous than usual both mother and son be say to have go to the neighbouring apothecary each to request he not to supply the other with poison on a later occasion when he have be meet she burst of rage with stubborn mockery she fling a poker at he head and narrowly miss she aim upon this he take flight to london and he hydra or alecto as ho call she follow : on they meeting a truce be patch and they withdraw in opposite direction

to harrogate when he lordship 's favorite newfoundland boatswain whose relation to he master recall that of bounce to pope or maida to scott sit on the box in November byron print for private circulation the first issue of he juvenile poem mr becher have call he attention to one which he think objectionable the impression be destroy and the author set to work upon another which at once weed and amplify see the light in January 1807 he send copy under the title of _ juvenilium _ to several of he friend and among other to henry mackenzie -lrb- the man of feeling -rrb- and to fraser tytler lord woodhouselee encourage by they favourable notice he determine in appeal to a wider audience and in march 1807 the _ hour of idleness _ still proceed from the local press at newark be give to the world in June we find the poet again write from he college room dwelling with boyish detail on he growth in height and reduction in girth he late hour and heavy potation he comrade and the prospects of he book from July to September he date from london excite by the praise of some now obscure magazine and plan a journey to the hebride in October he be again settle at cambridge and in a letter to miss pigot make a humorous reference to one of he fantastic freak : i have get a new friend the finest in the world -- a _ tame bear _ when i bring he here they ask I what i mean to do with he and my reply be ` he should sit for a fellowship ' this answer delight they not the greater part of the spring and summer of 1808 be spend at dorant 's hotel albemarle street leave to himself he seem during this period for the first time to have freely indulge in dissipation which be in most life more or less carefully conceal but byron with almost unparalleled folly be perpetually take the public into he confidence and all he sin of blood with the strange addition of a imaginative effrontery have be thrust before we in a manner in which rochester or rousseau might have think indelicate nature and circumstance conspire the result with passion which he be fond of compare to the fire of vesuvius and hecla he be on he entrance into a social life which he rank help to surround with temptation unconscious of any sufficient motive for resist they he have no one to restrain he from the whim of the moment or with sufficient authority to give he effective advice a temperament of general despondency relieve by reckless outburst of animal spirit be the least favourable to habitual self-control the melancholy of byron be not of the pensive and innocent kind attribute to cowley rather that of the -lrb- greek : melancholikous -rrb- of whom aristotle assert with profound psychological or physiological intuition that they be -lrb- greek : aei en sphodra orexei -rrb- the absurdity of moore 's frequent declaration that all great poet be inly wrapt in perpetual gloom be only to be excuse by the modesty which in the say so obviously exclude himself from the list but it be true that anomalous energy be source of incessant irritation to they possessor until they have find they proper vent in the free exercise of he highest faculty byron have not yet do this when he be

he old friend and corporeal pastor and master there be no inducement to dwell on amours devoid of romance further than to remember that they never trench on what the common code of the fashionable world term dishonor we may believe the poet 's later assertion back by want of evidence to the contrary that he have never be the first means of lead any one astray -- a fact perhaps worthy the attention of those moral worshipper of goethe and burn who hiss at lord byron 's name -lrb- footnote 1 : in reference to one of these see a interesting letter from mr minto to the _ athenaeum _ -lrb- sept 2nd 1876 -rrb- in which with considerable though not conclusive ingenuity he endeavor to identify the girl with thyrza and with astart whom he regard as the same person -rrb- though much of this year of he life be pass unprofitably from it date the impulse that provoke he to put forth he power the _ edinburgh _ with the attack on the _ hour of idleness _ appear in march 1808 this production by lord brougham be a specimen of the tomahawk style of criticism prevalent in the early year of the century in which the main motive of the critic be not to deal fairly with he author but to acquire for himself a easy reputation for cleverness by a series of smart contemptuous sentence take apart most of the stricture of the _ edinburgh _ be sufficiently just and the passage quote for censure be all bad byron 's genius as a poet be not remarkably precocious the _ hour of idleness _ seldom rise either in thought or expression very far above the average level of juvenile verse many of the piece in the collection be weak imitation or commonplace description other suggest by circumstance of local or temporary interest have serve they turn before come into print they prevailing sentiment be a affectation of misanthropy convey in such line as these : -- weary of love of life devour would with spleen i rest a perfect timon not nineteen this mawkish element unfortunately survive in much of the author 's later verse but even in this volume there be indication of force and command the _ prayer of nature _ indeed though previously write be not include in the edition before the notice of the critic but the sound of _ loch-na-gair _ and some of the stanza on _ newstead _ ought to have save he from the mistake of he impudent advice the poet who through life wait with feverish anxiety for every verdict on he work be report after read the review to have look like a man about to send a challenge in the midst of a transparent show of indifference he confess to have drunk three bottle

attack of tertian fever the next record of consequence be from the volage frigate at sea June 29 1811 when he write in a despondent strain to hodgson that he be return home without a hope and almost without a desire to wrangle with creditor and lawyer about execution and coal pit in short i be sick and sorry and when i have a little repair my irreparable affair away i shall march either to campaign in spain or back again to the east where i can at least have cloudless sky and a cessation from impertinence i be sick of fop and poesy and prate and shall leave the whole castalian state to

know you be a vixen but keep some champagne for I he have write from abroad on receipt of the letter she remark if i should be dead before he come down what a strange thing it would be towards the close of the month she have a attack so alarming that he be summon but before he have time to arrive she have expire on the 1st of August in a fit of rage bring on by read a upholsterer 's bill on the way byron hear the intelligence and write to dr pigot : i now feel the truth of gray 's observation that we can only have _ one _ mother peace be with she on arrive at newstead all they storm forget the son be so affect that he do not trust himself to go to the funeral but stand dreamily gaze at the cortge from the gate of the abbey five day later charle s matthew be drowned chapter v second period of authorship -- in london -- correspondence with scott the death of long wingfield eddlestone matthew and of he mother have narrow the circle of the poet 's early companion and though he talk of each loss in succession as if it have be that of a only friend we can credit a degree of loneliness and excuse a certain amount of bitterness in the feeling with which he return to london he have at this time see very little of the only relative whom he over deeply love he and he half-sister meet casually in 1804 and again in the following year after she marriage -lrb- 1807 -rrb- byron write from abroad -lrb- 1810 -rrb- regret have distressed she by he quarrel with lord carlisle in 1811 she be mention as reversionary heiress of he estate towards the close of 1813 there be two allusion which testify to they mutual affection next will come to the interesting series of letter of 1815-16 publish with the memoir of mr hodgson to whom along with hobhouse and scrope davy he lordship in a will and codicil leave the management of he property harness appear frequently at this period among he survive intimate : to this list there be shortly add another in speaking of he _ bard and reviewer _ the author make occasional reference to the possibility of he be call to account for some of he attack he expectation be realize by a letter from the poet moore date dublin jan 1 1810 couch in peremptory term demand to know if he lordship avow the authorship of the insult contain in the poem this letter be entrust to mr hodgson be not forward to byron abroad but shortly after he return he receive another in more conciliatory term renew the complaint to this he reply in a stiff but manly letter that he have never mean to insult mr moore but that he be if necessary ready to give he satisfaction moore accept the explanation somewhat querulously complain of he advance to friendship not be receive byron again reply that much as he would feel honor by mr moore 's acquaintance he be practically threaten by the irate irishman could hardly make the first advance this call forth a sort of apology the correspondent meet at the house of mr roger and out of the somewhat awkward circumstance owe to the frankness of the noble author as the other ever after delight to call he arise the life-long intimacy which have such various and lasting result moore have be call a false friend to byron and a traitor to he memory the judgment be somewhat harsh but the association between they be unfortunate thoma moore have some sterling quality he best satirical piece be inspire by a real indignation and light up by a genuine humor he be also a exquisite musician in word and must have be occasionally a fascinating companion but he be essentially a worldle and as such a superficial critic he encourage the shallow affectation of he great friend 's weaker work and recoil in alarm before the daring defiance of he stronger he criticism on all byron write and feel seriously on religion be almost worthy of a conventicle he letter to other on _ manfr _ and _ cain _ and _ don juan _ be the expression of sentiment which he have never the courage to state explicitly to the author on the other hand byron be attract beyond reasonable measure by he gracefully deferential manners pay too much regard to he opinion and overestimate he genius for the subsequent destruction of the memoirs urge by mr hobhouse and mr leigh he be not wholly responsible though a braver man have accept the position of he lordship 's literary legatee with the express understanding that he would seue to the fulfilment of the wish of he dead friend would have to the utmost resist they total frustration meanwhile on landing in england the poet have place in the hand of mr dalla the _ hint from horace _ which he intend to have bring out by the publisher cawthorne of this performance -- a inferior edition relieve by a few strong touch of the _ bard and reviewer _ -- dalla venture to express he disapproval have you no other result of you travels he ask and get for answer a few short piece and a lot of spenserian stanza not worth trouble you with but you be welcome to they dalla take the remark literally see they be a safe success and assume to himself the merit of the discovery the risk and the profit it be the converse of the story of gabriel harvey and the _ faery queene _ tho first two canto of _ childe harold _ bear no comparison with the legend of _ una and the red cross knight _ but there be no mistake about they proof of power they novelty and adaptation to a public taste as yet unjaded by eloquent and imaginative description of foreign scenery manners and climate the poem -- after be submit to gifford in defiance of the protestation of the author who fear that the reference might seem to seek the favor of the August _ quarterly _ -- be accept by mr murray and proceed through the press subject to change and addition during the next five month the _ hint from horace _ fortunately postpone and then suspend appear posthumously in 1831 byron remain at newstead till the close of October negotiate with creditor and lawyer and engage in a correspondence about he publication in the course of which he deprecate any identification of himself and he hero though he have at first call he childe byron instruct mr murray he entreat not to allow he shopman to call the work ` child of harrow 's pilgrimage ' as he have do to some of my astonished friend who write to inquire after my _ sanity _ on the occasion as well they might at the end of the month we find he in london again indulge in a voyage in the ship of fool in which moore claim to have accompany he but at the same time exhibit remarkable shrewdness in reference to the affair of he household in February 1812 he again declare to hodgson he resolve to leave england for ever and fix himself in one of the fairest island of the east on the 27th he make in the house of lord he speech on a bill to introduce special penalty against the frame-breaker of nottingham this effort on which he receive many compliment lead among other result to a friendly correspondence with lord holland on April 21st of the same year he again address the house on behalf of roman catholic emancipation and in June 1813 in favor of major cartwright 's petition on all these occasion as afterwards on the continent byron espouse the liberal side of politics but he role be that of manlius or caesar and he never fail to remind we that he himself be _ for _ the people not _ of _ they he latter speech owe partly to he delivery blame as too asiatic be less successful to a reader the three seem much on the same level they be clever but evidently set performance and leave we no ground to suppose that the poet 's abandonment of a parliamentary career be a serious loss to the nation on the 29th of February the first and second canto of _ childe harold _ appear a early copy be send to mr leigh with the inscription : to augusta my dearest sister and my best friend who have ever love I much better than i deserve this volume be present by she father 's son and most affectionate brother b the book run through seven edition in four week the effect of the first edition of burn and the sale of scott 's _ lay _ be the only parallel in modern poetic literature to this success all eye be suddenly fasten on the author who let he satire sleep and throw politics aside to be the romancer of he day and for two year the darling of society previous to the publition mr moore confess to have gratify he lordship with the expression of the fear that _ childe harold _ be too good for the age its success be due to the reverse be the truth it be just on the level of its age its flow verse deface by rhymical fault perceptible only to finer ear its prevail sentiment occasional boldness relieve by please platitude its half affect rakishness here and there elevated by a rush as of morning air and its frequent richness -- not yet as afterwards splendor -- of description be all appreciate by the fashionable london of the regency while the comparatively mild satire not keen enough to scarify only give a more piquant flavor to the whole byron 's genius yet in the green leaf be not too far above the clever mass of pleasure-loving manhood by which it be surround it be natural that the address on the reopen of drury lane theater should be write by the world 's new joy -- the first great english poet-peer as natural as that in he only publish satire of the period he should inveigh against almost the only amusement in which he could not share the address be write at the request of lord holland when of some hundred competitive piece none have be find exactly suitable -- a circumstance which give rise to the famous parody entitle _ the reject address _ -- and it be think that the ultimate choice would conciliate all rivalry the care which byron bestow on the correction of the first draft of this piece be characteristic of he habit of write off he poem at a gush and afterwards carefully elaborate they _ the waltz _ be publish anonymously in April 1813 it be follow in may by the _ giaour _ the first of the flood of verse romance which during the three succeed year he pour forth with impetuous fluency and which be receive with almost unrestrained applause the plot and sentiment and imagery be similar in they all the giaour steal the mistress of hassan who revenge he honor by drown she the giaour escape return kill hassan and then go to a monastery in the _ bride of abydo _ publish in the December of the same year giaffir want to marry he daughter zuleika to carasman pasha she run off with selim she reputed brother -- in reality she cousin and so at last she legitimate lover they be catch he be slay in fight she die to slow music in the _ corsair _ publish January 1814 conrad a pirate link with one virtue and a thousand crime be beloved by medora who on he predatory expedition sit wait for he -lrb- like hassan 's and sisera 's mother -rrb- in a tower on one of these he attack seyd pasha and be overborne by superior force but gulnare a female slave of seyd kill she master and run off with conrad who find medora dead and vanish in _ lara _ the sequel to this -- write in may and June publish in August -- a man of mystery appear in the morea with a page kale after adventure worthy of mr radcliffe -- from whose schledonus the giaour be say to have be draw -- lara fall in battle with he deadly foe ezzelin and turn out to be conrad while kale be of course gulnare the _ hebrew melody _ write in December 1814 be interesting in connexion with the author 's early familiarity with the old testament and from the force and music that mark the best of they but they can hardly be consider a important contribution to the devotional verse of england the _ siege of corinth _ and _ parisina _ compose after he marriage in the summer and autumn of 1815 appear in the following year the former be found on the siege of the city when the turk take it from menottus but we attention be concentrate on alp the renegade another sketch from the same protoplastic ruffian who lead on the turk be in love with the daughter of the governor of the city try to save she but die the poem be frequently vigorous but it end badly _ parisina _ though unequal be on the whole a poem of a higher order than the other of the period the trial scene exhibit some dramatic power and the shriek of the lady mingle with ugo 's funeral dirge linger in we ear along with the convent bell -- in the gray square turret swing with a deep sound to and fro heavily to the heart they go these romance belong to the same period of the author 's poetic career as the first two canto of _ childe harold _ they follow one another like brilliant firework they all exhibit a command of word a sense of melody and a flow of rhythm and rhyme which master moore and even scott on they own ground none of they be want in passage as he who have bent he o'er the dead and the description of alp lean against a column which strike deeper than any verse of either of those writer but there be a air of melodrama in they all harmonious delight of novel reader they will not stand against the winnowing wind of deliberate criticism they harp on the same string without the variation of a paganinus they be potentially endless reproduction of one phase of a ill-regulated mind -- the picture of the same quasi-melancholy vengeful man who know no friend but a dog and read on the tomb of the great only the glory and the nothing of a name the exile who can not flee from himself the wander outlaw of he own dark mind who have not love the world nor the world he -- whose heart be form would for softness warp would by wrong betray would too early and beguile too long -- all this _ decy repetita _ grow into a weariness and vexation mr carlyle harshly compare it to the scream of a meat-jack the reviewer and the public of the time think differently jeffrey penitent for the early _ faux pa _ of he _ review _ as byron remain penitent for he answering assault write of _ lara _ passage of it may be put into competition with anything that poetry have produce in point either of pathos or energy moore -- who afterwards write not to byron that seven devil have enter into _ manfr _ -- profess himself enrapture with it fourteen thousand copy of the _ corsair _ wear sell in a day but hear the author 's own half-boast half-apology : _ lara _ i write while undress after come home from ball and masquerade in the year of revelry 1814 the _ bride _ be write in four the _ corsair _ in ten day this i take to he a humiliating confession as it prove my own want of judgment in publishing and the public be in read thing which can not have stamen for permanence the pecuniary profit accrue to byron from he work begin with _ lara _ for which he receive 700_l _ he have make over to mr dallas besides other gift to the same ungrateful recipient the profit of _ harold _ amount to 600_l _ and of the _ corsair _ which bring 525_l _ the proceeds of the _ giaour _ and the _ bride _ be also surrender during this period 1813-1816 he have become familiar with all the phase of london society taste they pleasure and towards the close feel they decay he associate in those year be of two class -- man of the world and author fted and court in all quarter he patronize the theater become in 1815 a member of the drury lane committee like the dandy include beau brummell and be introduce to the regent they interview in June 1812 in the course of which the latter pay unrestrained compliment to _ harold _ and the poetry of scott be naively refer to by mr moore as reflect even still more honor on the sovereign himself than on the two poet byron in a different spirit write to lord holland : i have now great hope in the event of mr pye 's decease of warble truth at court like mr mallet of indifferent memory consider one hundred mark a year besides the wine and the disgrace we can hardly conceive the future author of the _ vision of judgment _ write ode to dictation he do not seem to have be much fascinate with the first gentleman of europe whom at no distant date he assail in the terrible avatar and leave the laureateship to mr southey among leader in art and letter he be bring into more or less intimate contact with sir humphry davy the edgeworth sir jame mackintosh colman the dramatic author the older kean monk lewi grattan curran and madame de stal of a meeting of the last two he remark it be like the confluence of the rhone and the sone and they be both so ugly that i could not help wonder how the best intellect of france and ireland could have take up respectively such residence about this time a communication from mr murray in reference to the meeting with the regent lead to a letter from sir walter scott to lord byron the beginning of a life-long friendship and one of the most please page of biography these two great man be for a season perpetually pit against one another as the foremost competitor for literary favor when _ rokeby _ come out contemporaneously with the _ giaour _ the undergraduate of oxford and cambridge run race to catch the first copy and lay bet as to which of the rival would win during the anti-byronic fever of 1840-1860 they be perpetually contrast as the representative of the manly and the morbid school a later sentimentalism have affect to despise the work of both the fact therefore that from a early period the man themselves know each other as they be be worth illustrate scott 's letter in which a generous recognition of the pleasure he have derive from tho work of the english poet be follow by a manly remonstrance on the subject of the attack in the _ bard and reviewer _ draw from byron in the follow month -lrb- July 1812 -rrb- a answer in the same strain descant on the prince 's praise of the _ lay _ and _ marmion _ and candidly apologize for the evil work of he nonage the satire he remark be write when i be very young and very angry and fully bent on display my wrath and my wit and now i be haunt by the ghost of my wholesale assertion this in turn call forth another letter to byron eager for more of he verse with a cordial invitation to abbotsford on the ground of scotland 's maternal claim on he and ask for information about pegasus and parnassus after this the correspondence continue with greater freedom and the same display on either side of mutual respect when scott say the _ giaour _ be praise among we mountain and byron return _ waverley _ be the best novel i have read there be no suspicion of flattery -- it be the interchange of compliment between man et cantare pare et respondere parati they talk in just the same manner to third party i give over write romance say the elder in the spirit of a great-hearted gentleman because byron beat I he hit the mark where i do not even pretend to fledge my arrow he have access to a stream of sentiment unknown to I the younger on the other hand deprecate the comparison that be be invidiously draw between they he present he copy of the _ giaour _ to scott with the phrase to the monarch of parnassus and compare the feeling of those who cavil at he fame to that of the athenian towards aristide from those sentiment he never swerve recognize to the last the breadth of character of the most generous of he critic and refer to he during he later year in italy as the wizard and the ariosto of the north a meeting be at length arrange between they scott look forward to it with anxious interest humorously remark that byron should say -- art thou the man whom man famed grissell call and he reply -- art thou the still more famed tom thumb the small they meet in london during the spring of 1815 the follow sentence be from sir walter 's account of it : -- report have prepare I to meet a man of peculiar habit and quick temper and i have some doubt whether we be likely to suit each other in society i be most agreeably disappoint in this respect i find lord byron in the highest degree courteous and even kind we meet for a hour or two almost daily in mr murray 's drawing-room and find a great deal to say to each other we sentiment agree a good deal except upon the subject of religion and politics upon neither of which i be incline to believe that lord byron entertain very fix opinion on politics he use sometimes to express a high strain of what be now call liberalism but it appear to I that the pleasure it afford he as a vehicle of display he wit and satire against individual in office be at the bottom of this habit of think at heart i would have term byron a patrician on principle he reading do not seem to I to have be very extensive i remember repeat to he the fine poem of hardyknute and some one ask I what i could possibly have be tell byron by which he be so much agitate i see he for the last time in -lrb- September -rrb- 1815 after i return from france he dine or lunch with I at long be in bond street i never see he so full of gaiety and good humor the day of this interview be the most interesting i ever spend several letter pass between we -- one perhaps every half year like the old hero in homer we exchange gift i give byron a beautiful dagger mount with gold which have be the property of the redoubted elfus bey but i be to play the part of diom in the _ iliad _ for byron send I some time after a large sepulchral vase of silver full of dead man 's bone find within the land wall of athen he be often melancholy almost gloomy when i observe he in this humor i use either to wait till it go off of its own accord or till some natural and easy mode occur of lead he into conversation when the shadow almost always leave he countenance like the mist arise from a landscape i think i also remark in he temper start of suspicion when he seem to pause and consider whether there have not be a secret and perhaps offensive meaning in something that be say to he in this case i also judge it best to let he mind like a troubled spring work itself clear which it do in a minute or two a downright steadiness of manner be the way to he good opinion will rise look by accident at he foot see he scowl furiously but on he show no consciousness he lordship resume he easy manner what i like about he besides he boundless genius be he generosity of spirit as well as of purse and he utter contempt of all the affectation of literature he like moore and I because with all we other difference we be both good-natured fellow not care to maintain we dignity enjoy the _ mot-pour-rire _ he write from impulse never from effort and therefore i have always reckon burn and byron the most genuine poetic genius of my time and of half a century before I we have many man of high poetic talent but none of that ever-gushing and perennial fountain of natural water scott like all hale man of sound sense regret the almost fatal incontinence which in the year of he greatest private trouble lead he friend to make a parade of they before the public he speak more than once of he unhappy tendency to exhibit himself as the die gladiator and even compare he to he peacock screech before he window because he choose to bivouack apart from he mate but he read a copy of the ravenna diary without alter he view that he lordship be he own worst maligner scott say lockhart consider byron the only poet of transcendent talent we have have since dryden there be preserve a curious record of he meeting with a greater poet than dryden but one whose greatness neither he nor scott suspect mr crabb robinson report wordsworth to have say in charle lamb 's chamber about the year 1808 these reviewer put I out of patience here be a young man who have write a volume of poetry and these fellow just because he be a lord set upon he the young man will do something if he go on as he have begin but these reviewer seem to think that nobody may write poetry unless he live in a garret year after lady byron on be tell this exclaim ah if byron have know that he would never have attack wordsworth he go one day to meet he at dinner and i say ` well how do the young poet get on with the old one ' ` why to tell the truth ' say he ' i have but one feeling from the beginning of the visit to the end and that be _ reverence _ ' similarly he begin by be on good term with southey and after a meeting at holland house write enthusiastically of he prepossessing appearance byron and the leader of the so-called lake school be at start common heir of the revolutionary spirit they be either in they social view or personal feeling to a large extent influence by the most morbid though in some respects the most magnetic genius of modern france jj rousseau but they temperament be in many respects fundamentally diverse and the pre-established discord between they ere long begin to make itself manifest in they follow out widely divergent path wordsworth 's return to nature have be prelude by cowper that of byron by burn the revival of the one ripen into a restoration of simpler manners and old belief the other be the spirit of the storm when they have both become recognize power neither appreciate the work of the other a few year after this date byron write of wordsworth to a common admirer of both : i take leave to differ from you as freely as i once agree with you he performance since the _ lyrical ballad _ be miserably inadequate to the ability that lurk within he there be undoubtedly much natural talent spilt over the _ excursion _ but it be rain upon rock where it stand and stagnate or rain upon sand where it fall without fertilize this criticism with other in like strain be address to mr leigh hunt to whom in 1812 when endure for radicalism 's sake a very comfortable incarceration byron have in company with moore pay a courteous visit of the correspondence of this period -- flippant trenchant or sparkling -- few portion be more calculate to excite a smile than the record of he frequent resolution make reasseverate and break to have do with literature even go the length on some occasion of threaten to suppress he work and if possible recall the exist copy he affect be a man of the world unmercifully and have a real delight in clever companion who assume the same rle frequent allusion be make to he intercourse with erskine and sheridan : the latter he be never tire of praise as the author of the best modern comedy -lrb- _ school for scandal _ -rrb- the best farce -lrb- _ the critic _ -rrb- and the best oration -lrb- the famous begum speech -rrb- ever hear in this country they spend many a evening together and probably crack many a bottle it be byron who tell the story of sheridan be find in a gutter in a sadly incapable state and on some one ask who be this stammer out wilberforce on one occasion he speak of come out of a tavern with the dramatist when they both find the staircase in a very cork-screw condition : and elsewhere of encounter a mr c -- who have no notion of meeting with a bon-vivant in a scribbler and sum the poet 's eulogy with the phrase he drink like a man hunt the tattler who observe he lordship 's habit in italy with the microscope of malice ensconce within the same wall make it a charge against he host that he would not drink like a man once for all it may be note that although there be no kind of excess in which byron whether from bravado or inclination fail occasionally to indulge he be never for any stretch of time give over like burn to what be technically term intemperance he head do not seem to have be strong and under the influence of stimulant he may have be lead to talk a great deal of he dangerous nonsense but though he could not say with wordsworth that only once at cambridge have he brain be excite by the fume of wine he prevail sin be in other direction chapter vi marriage and farewell to england as for poet say scott i have see all the best of my time and country and though burn have the most glorious eye imaginable i never think any of they would come up to a artist 's notion of the character except byron he countenance be a thing to dream of coleridge write to the same effect in language even stronger we have from all side similar testimony to the personal beauty which lead the unhappiest of he devotee to exclaim that pale face be my fate southern critic as chasle castelar even mazzinus have deal leniently with the poet 's relation to the other sex and elze extend to he in this regard the same excessive stretch of charity dear childe harold exclaim the german professor be positively besiege by woman they have in truth no right to complain of he : from he childhood he have see they on they worst side it be the casuistry of hero-worship to deny that byron be unjust to woman not merely in isolate instance but in he prevail view of they character and claim i regard they he say in a passage only distinguish from other by more extravagant petulance as very pretty but inferior creature who be as little in they place at we table as they would be in we council chamber the whole of the present system with regard to the female sex be a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalry of we forefather i look on they as grown-up child but like a foolish mamma i be constantly the slave of one of they the turk shut up they woman and be much happier give a woman a looking-glass and burnt almond and she will be content in contrast with this we have the mood in which he draw he picture of angiolina and haidee and aurora raby and write the invocation to the shade of astarte and he letter in prose and verse to augusta but the above passage could never have be write by chaucer or spenser or shakespeare or shelley the class whom he be revile seem however during the day of he destiny bent on confirm he judgment by the blindness of they worship he rank and fame the glitter splendor of he verse the romance of he travels he picturesque melancholy and affectation of mysterious secret combine with the magic of he presence to bewitch and bewilder they the dissent malcontent condemn as prude and blues have they revenge generally we may say that woman who have not write book adore byron woman who have write or be write book distrust dislike and make he a moral to adorn they tale often to point they fable with he be by the one set caress and spoil and beguile too long by the other betray too late the recent memoirs of france ann kemble present a curious record of the process of pass from one extreme to the other she dwell on the fascination exert over she mind by the first reading of he poetry and tell how she fasten on the book with a grip like steel and carry it off and hide it under she pillow how it affect she like a evil potion and stir she whole be with a tempest of excitement till finally she with equal weakness fling it aside resolve to read that grand poetry no more and break through the thraldom of that powerful spell the confession bring before we a type of the transition of the century on its way from the byronic to the anti-byronic fever of which later state mr norton and miss martineau be among the most pronounced representative byron 's garrulity with regard to those delicate matter on which man of more prudence or chivalry be wont to set

everything that mutual friend could do to bring about the reconciliation for which byron himself profess to be eager but in vain and in vain the effort be renew in later year the wife be inveterately bent on a separation of the cause of which the husband allege he be never inform and with regard to which as long as he live she preserve a rigid silence for some time after the event byron speak of he wife with at least apparent generosity rightly or wrongly he blame she parent and she maid -- mr clermont the theme of he scathing but not always dignified sketch but of herself he write -lrb- march 8 1816 -rrb- i do not believe that there ever be a brighter and a kinder or a more amiable or agreeable being than lady byron i never have nor can have any reproach to make to she when with I elsewhere he add that he would willingly if he have the chance renew he marriage on a lease of twenty year but as time pass and he overture be reject he patience give way and in some of he later satire he even break the bound of courtesy lady byron 's letter at the time of the separation especially those first publish in the _ academy _ of July 19 1879 be to mr leigh always affectionate and confidential often pathetic ask she advice in this critical moment and protest that independent of malady she do not think of the past with any spirit of resentment and scarcely with the sense of injury in she communication to mr hodgson on the other hand -- the first of almost the same date the second a few week later -- she write with intense bitterness state that she action be due to offence which she could only condone on the supposition of she husband 's insanity and distinctly imply that she be in danger of she life this supposition have be by she medical adviser pronounce erroneous she feel in the word only too pungently recall in _ don juan _ that she duty both to man and god prescribe she course of action she playful letter on leave she seem to defend on the ground of the fear of personal violence till lord byron 's death the intimacy between he wife and sister remain unbroken through the latter he continue to send numerous message to the former and to he child who become a ward in chancery but at a later date it begin to cool on the appearance of lady byron 's letter in answer to moore 's first volume augusta speak of it as a despicable tirade feel disgusted at such unfeeling conduct and think nothing can justify any one in defame the dead soon after 1830 they have a open rupture on a matter of business which be never really heal though the then puritanic precisian send a message of relent to mr leigh on she death-bed -lrb- 1851 -rrb- the charge or charge which during she husband 's life lady byron from magnanimity or other motive reserve she be ascertain after he death to have deliver with important modification to various person with little regard to they capacity for read evidence or to they discretion on one occasion she choice of a confidante be singularly unfortunate these write lord byron in he youth these be the first tiding that have ever sound like fame in my ear -- to be redde on the bank of the ohio strangely enough it be from the country of washington whom the poet be wont to reverence as the purest patriot of the modern world that in 1869 there emanate the hideous story which scandalize both continent and ultimately recoil on the retailer of the scandal the grounds of the reckless charge have be weigh by those who have wish it to prove false and by those who have wish it to prove true and find want the chaff have be beat in every way and on all side without yield a ounce of grain and it be ill-advised to rake up the noxious dust that alone remain from nothing leave on record by either of the two person most intimately concern can we derive any reliable information it be plain that lady byron be during the later year of she life the victim of hallucination and that if byron know the secret which he deny he do not choose to tell it put off captain medwin and other with absurdity as that he do not like to see woman eat or with commonplace as the cause my dear sir be too simple to be find out thoma moore who have the memoirs -lrb- 3 -rrb- suppose to have throw light on the mystery in the full knowledge of dr lushington 's judgment and all the gossip of the day profess to believe that the cause of disunion do not differ from those that loosen the link of most such marriage and write several page on the trite theme that great genius be incompatible with domestic happiness negative instance abound to modify this sweeping generalization but there be a kind of genius closely associate with intense irritability which it be difficult to subject to the most reasonable yoke and of this sort be byron 's he valet fletcher be report to have say that any woman could manage my lord except my lady and madame de stal on read the _ farewell _ that she would have be glad to have be in lady byron 's

which in she sex he be wont to make a constant butt she be no fit consort for that men insana in corpore insano what could she stolid temperament conjecture of a man whom she see in one of he fit of passion throw a favorite watch under the fire and grind it to piece with a poker or how could she conscious virtue tolerate the recur irregularity which he be accustom not only to permit himself but to parade the harassment of he affair stimulate he violence till she be incline to suspect he to be mad some of she recently print letter -- as that to lady anne barnard and the report of later observer of she character -- as william howitt tend to detract from the earlier tribute to she consistent amiability and confirm we idea of the incompatibility of the pair it must have be try to a poet to be ask by he wife impatient of he late hour when he be go to leave off write verse to be tell he have no real enthusiasm or to have he desk break open and its compromise contents send to the person for whom they be least intend the smouldering element of discontent may have be fan by the gossip of dependant or the officious zeal of relative and kindle into a jealous flame by the ostentation of regard for other beyond the circle of he home lady byron doubtless believe some story which when communicate to she legal adviser lead they to the conclusion that the mere fact of she believe it make reconciliation impossible and the inveterate obstinacy which lurk beneath she gracious exterior make she cling through life to the substance -- not always to the form whatever that may have be -- of she first impression she later letter to mr leigh as that call forth by moore 's _ life _ be certainly as open to the charge of self-righteousness as those of she husband 's be to self-disparagement -lrb- footnote 3 : captain trelawney however doubt if he ever read they -rrb- byron himself somewhere say strength of endurance be worth all the talent in the world i love the

of which lie write the skimpole and chadband of the world be always incline to talk of filthy lucre : it be equally a fashion of really lavish people to boast that they be good man of business we have

write the famous stanza begin stop for thy tread be on a empire 's dust and in unpatriotic prose record he impression of a plain which appear to he to want little but a better cause to make it vie in interest with those of platea and marathon the rest of he journey lay up the rhine to basle thence to berne lausanne and geneva where he settle for a time at the htel secheron on the western shore of the lake here begin the most interesting literary relationship of he life for here he first come in contact with the impassioned ariel of english verse percy bysshe shelley they live in proximity after they leave the hotel shelley 's headquarters be at mont algre and byron 's for the remainder of the summer at the villa diodatus and they acquaintance rapidly ripen into a intimacy which with some interruption extend over the six remain year of they joint life the place for a estimate of they mutual influence belong to the time of they italian partnership meanwhile we hear of they mainly as fellow-excursionist about the lake which on one occasion depart from its placid poetical character all but swallow they both along with hobhouse off meillerie the boat say byron be nearly wreck near the very spot where st preux and julium be in danger of be drown it would have be classical to have be lose there but not agreeable i run no risk be so near the rock and a good swimmer but we party wear wet and incommode the only anxiety of shelley who could not swim be that no one else should risk a life for he two such revolutionary or such brave poet be in all probability never before nor since in a storm in a boat together during this period byron complain of be still persecute i be in a wretched state of health and worse spirit when i be in geneva but quiet and the lake -- better physician than polidorus -- soon set I up i never lead so moral a life as during my residence in that country but i gain no credit by it on the contrary there be no story so absurd that they do not invent at my cost i be watch by glass on the opposite side of the lake and by glass too that must have have very distorted optics i be waylay in my evening drive i believe they look upon I as a man-monster shortly after he arrival in switzerland he contract a intimacy with miss clairmont a daughter of godwin 's second wife and consequently a connexion by marriage of the shelley with whom she be live which result in the birth of a daughter allegra at great marlow in February 1817 the noticeable event of the follow two month be a joint excursion to chamounus and a visit in July to madame de stal at coppet in the course of which he meet frederick schlegel during a wet week when the family be read together some german ghost story a idea occur of imitate they the main result of which be mrs shelley 's _ frankenstein _ byron contribute to the scheme a fragment of _ the vampire _ afterwards complete and publish in the name of he patron by polidori the eccentricity of this otherwise amiable physician now begin to give serious annoyance he jealousy of shelley grow to such a pitch that it result in the doctor 's give a challenge to the poet at which the latter only laugh but byron to stop further outbreak of the kind remark recollect that though shelley have scruple about duel i have none and shall be at all time ready to take he place polidorus have ultimately to be dismiss and after some year of vicissitude committed suicide the shelley leave for england in September and byron make a excursion with hobhouse through the bernese oberland they go by the col de jaman and the simmenthal to thun then up the valley to the staubbach which he compare to the tail of the pale horse in the apocalypse -- not a very happy though a striking comparison thence they proceed over the wengern to grindelwald and the rosenlau glacier then back by berne friburg and yverdun to diodati the following passage in reference to this tour may be select as a specimen of he prose description and of the idea of mountaineering before the day of the alpine club : -- before ascend the mountain go to the torrent again the sun upon it form a rainbow of the lower part of all color but principally purple and gold the bow move as you move i never see anything like this it be only in the sunshine leave the horse take off my coat and go to the summit 7000 english foot above the level of the sea and 5000 foot above the valley we leave in the morning on one side we view comprise the jungfrau with all she glacier then the dent d'argent shine like truth then the eigher and the wetterhorn hear the avalanche fall every five minute from where we stand on the wengern alp we have all these in view on one side on the other the cloud rise up from the opposite valley curl up perpendicular precipice like the foam of the ocean of hell during a spring tide it be white and sulphury and immeasurably deep in appearance arrive at the grindelwald dine mount again and ride to the higher glacier -- like a frozen hurricane starlight beautiful but a devil of a path pass whole wood of withered pine all withered trunk strip and barkless branch lifeless do by a single winter they appearance remind I of I and my family student of _ manfr _ will recognize whole sentence only slightly modify in its verse though byron talk with contempt of authorship there be scarce a fine phrase in he letter or journal which be not press into the author 's service he turn he deepest grief to artistic gain and use five or six time for literary purpose the expression which seem to have drop from he naturally about he household god be shiver on he hearth he account of this excursion conclude with a passage equally characteristic of he melancholy and incessant self-consciousness : -- in the weather for this tour i have be very fortunate i be dispose to be pleased i be a lover of nature & c but in all this the recollection of bitterness and more especially of recent and more home desolation which must accompany I through life have prey upon I here and neither the music of the shepherd the crash of the avalanche the torrent the mountain the glacier the forest nor the cloud have for one moment lighten the weight upon my heart nor enable I to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty and the power and the glory around above and beneath I such egotism in a idle man would only provoke impatience but byron be during the whole of this period almost preternaturally active detain by bad weather at ouchy for two day -lrb- juno 26 27 -rrb- he write the _ prisoner of chillon _ which with its noble introductory sonnet on bonnivard in some respects surpass any of he early romance the opening line -- lake leman lie by chillon 's wall a thousand foot in depth below its massy water meet and flow -- bring before we in a few word the condition of a hopeless bondage the account of the prisoner himself and of the linger death of the brother the first frenzy of the survivor and the desolation which succeed it -- i only loved : i only draw the accursed breath of dungeon dew -- the bird 's song breaking on the night of he solitude he grow enamoured of despair and regain he

romantic incident explain innumerable allusion eg -- i have shed blood but not hers -- and yet she blood be shed be it not for the fact that the poet have never see the city in question when he write the poem this explanation would be more plausible than most other for the allusion be all to some lady who have be do to death galt assert that the plot turn on a tradition of unhallowed necromancy -- a human sacrifice like that of antinous attribute to hadrian byron himself say it have no plot but he keep tease he questioner with mysterious hint eg it be the staubbach and the jungfrau and something else more than faustus which make I write _ manfred _ and of one of he critic he say to murray it have a better origin than he can devise or divine for the soul of he in any case most method of reading between its line would if similarly apply convict sophocle schiller and shelley of incest shakespeare of murder milton of blasphemy scott of forgery marlowe and goethe of compact with the devil byron be no dramatist but he have wit enough to vary at least the circumstance of he project personality the memory of both faust -- the elizabethan and the german -- mingle in the page of this piece with shadow of the author 's life but to these it never give nor could be intend to give any substantial form _ manfr _ be a chaos of picture suggest by the scenery of lauterbrunnen and

seldom absolutely fresh : that begin the mind which be immortal make itself requital for its good or evil thought be its own origin of ill and end and its own place and time be transplant from milton with as little change as milton make in transplant it from marlowe the author 's own favorite passage the invocation to the sun -lrb- act iii sc 2 -rrb- have some sublimity mar by lapse the lyric scatter through the poem sometimes open well eg -- mont blanc be the monarch of mountain they crown he long ago on a throne of rock in a robe of cloud with a null of snow but they can not sustain themselves like true song-bird and fall to the ground like spend rocket this apply to byron 's lyric generally turn to the incantation in the _ deform transform _ : the first line and a half be in tune -- beautiful shadow of theti 's boy who sleep in the meadow whose grass grow o'er troy nor sternhold nor hopkin have more ruthlessly outraged we ear than the next two -- from the red earth like

translation son of the greek and other have a flow and verve that it be pedantry to ignore but in general byron be too much of the earth earthy to be a great lyrist some of the greatest have live wild life but they wing be not weight with the lead of the love of the world the summer and early month of the autumn of 1817 be spend at la mira and much of the poet 's time be occupy in ride along the bank of the brenta often in the company of the few congenial englishman who come in he way other whom he avoid avenge themselves by retail story none of which wear too improbable for the craving appetite of they slander-loving countryman in August he receive a visit from mr hobhouse and on this occasion draw up the remarkable document afterwards give to mr m g lewi for circulation in england which appear in the _ academy _ of October 9th 1869 in this document he say it have be intimate to I that the person understand to be the legal adviser of lady byron have declare they lip to be seal

repent have consent to the separation -- will be glad to cancel the deed or to go before any tribunal to discuss the matter in the most public manner add that mr hobhouse -lrb- in whose presence he be write -rrb- propose on he part to go into court and end with a renew asseveration of he ignorance of the allegation against he and he inability to understand for what purpose they have be keep back unless it be to sanction the most infamous calumny by silence hobhouse and other during the four succeed year ineffectually endeavor to persuade the poet to return to england moore and other insist that byron 's heart be at home when he presence be abroad and that with all she fault he love he country still leigh hunt on the contrary assert that he care nothing for england or its affair like many man of genius byron be never satisfy with what he have at the time roma tibur amem ventosus tibure romam at seaham he be bore to death and pants for the excitement of the club in london society he long for a desert or island in the cyclade after they separation he begin to regret he wife after he exile he country where he exclaim to hobhouse be real comfort to be find out of england he frequently fall into the mood in which he write the verse -- yet i be bear where man be proud to be not without cause : and should i leave behind th ` immortal island of the sage and free and seek I out a home by a remoter sea but the follow to murray -lrb- June 7 1819 -rrb- be equally sincere some of the epitaph at ferrara pleased I more than the more splendid monument of bologna for instance -- ` martini luigus implora pace ' ` lucrezia picini implora eterna quiete ' can anything be more full of pathos these few word say all that can be say or seek the dead have have enough of life all they want be rest and this they implore there be all the helplessness and humble hope and death-like prayer that can arise from the grave -- ` implora pace ' i hope whoever may survive I and shall see I put in the foreigner 's burying-ground at the lido within the fortress by the adriatic will see these two word and no more put over I i trust they will not think of pickling and bring I home to clod or blunderbuss hall i be sure my bone would not rest in a english grave or my clay mix with the earth of that country hunt 's view be in this as in other subtle respects nearer the truth than moore 's for with all byron 's insight into italian vice he hate more the master vice of england -- hypocrisy and much of he greatest and in a sense latest because unfinished work be the severest as it might be the wholesomest satire ever direct against a great nation since the day of juvenal and tacitus in September -lrb- 1817 -rrb- byron enter into negotiation afterwards complete for rent a country house among the euganean hill near este from mr hoppner the english consul at venice who bear frequent testimony to he kindness and courtesy in October we find he settle for the winter in venice where he first occupy he old quarter in the spezierium and afterwards hire one of the palace of the countess mocenigo on the grand canal between this mansion the cottage at este and the villa of la mira he divide he time for the next two year during the earlier part of he venetian career he have continue to frequent the salon of the countess albrizzus where he meet with people of both sex of some rank and standing who appreciate he genius though some among they fall into absurd mistake a gentleman of the company inform the hostess in answer to some inquiry regard canova 's bust that washington the american president be shoot in a duel by burke what in the name of folly be you think of say byron perceive that the speaker be confounding washington with hamilton and burke with burr he afterwards transfer himself to the rival coterie of the countess benzonus and give himself up with little reserve to the intrigue which cast discredit on this portion of he life nothing be so conducive to dissipation as despair and byron have begin to regard the sea-cybele as a sea-sodom -- when he write to watch a city die daily as she do be a sad contemplation i seek to distract my mind from a sense of she desolation and my own solitude by plunge into a vortex that be anything but pleasure in any case he forsake the dame and by what he biographer call a descent in the scale of refinement for which nothing but the wayward state of he mind can account seek the companion of he leisure hour among the wearer of the fazziolus the carnival of the year 1818 1819 mark the height of he excess early in the former mariana segatus fall out of favor owe to byron 's have detect she in sell the jewel he have give as present and so be lead to suspect a large mercenary element in she devotion to she succeed margarita cognus the wife of a baker who prove as accommodate as he predecessor the linen-draper this woman be decidedly a character and seor castelar have almost elevated she into a heroine a handsome virago with brown shoulder and black hair endowed with the strength of a amazon a face like faustina 's and the figure of a juno -- tall and energetic as a pythoness she quarter herself for twelve month in the palace as donna di governo and drive the servant about without let or hindrance unable to read or write she intercept he lordship 's letter to little purpose but she have great natural business talent reduce by one half the expense of he household keep everything in good order and when she violence rouse he wrath turn it off with some ready retort or witticism she be very devout and would cross herself three time at the angelus one instance of a different kind of devotion from byron 's own account be sufficiently graphic : -- in the autumn one day go to the lido with my gondolier we be overtake by a heavy squall and the gondola put in peril hat blow away boat fill oar lose tumble sea thunder rain in torrent and wind unceasing on we return after a tight struggle i find she on the open stop of the mocenigo palace on the grand canal with she great black eye flash through she tear and the long dark hair which be streaming drench with rain over she brow she be perfectly expose to the storm and the wind blow she dress about she thin figure and the lightning flash round she make she look like medea alight from she chariot or the sibyl of the tempest that be roll around she the only live thing within hail at that moment except ourselves on see I safe she do not wait to greet I as might have be expect but call out to I ` ah can ' della madonna xe esto il

of a tigress over she recover cub some month after she become ungovernable -- throw plate about and snatch cap from the head of other woman who look at she lord in public place byron tell she she must go home whereupon she proceed to break glass and threaten knife poison fire and on he call he boatman to get ready the gondola throw herself in the dark night into the canal she be rescue and in a few day finally dismiss after which he see she only twice at the theater she whole picture be more like that of throigne de mricourt than that of raphael 's fornarina whose name she receive other story of course gather round this strange life -- personal encounter aquatic feat and all manner of romantic and impossible episode they basis be that byron on one occasion thrash on another challenge a man who try to cheat he be a frequent rider and a constant swimmer so that he come to be call the english fish water-spaniel sea-devil & c one of the boatman be report to have say he be a good gondolier spoil by be a poet and a lord and in answer to a traveller 's inquiry where do he get he poetry he dive for it he habit as regard eat seem to have be generally abstemious but he drink a pint of gin and water over he verse at night and then take claret and soda in the morning riotous living may have help to curtail byron 's life but it do not seem to have seriously impaired he power among these adverse surroundings of the court of circe he throw off _ beppo _ _ mazeppa _ and the early book of _ don juan _ the first canto of the last be write in November 1818 the second in January 1819 the third and fourth towards the close of the same year _ beppo _ its brilliant prelude sparkle like a draught of champagne this venetian story or sketch in which the author break ground on he true satiric field -- the satire of social life -- and first adopt the measure avowedly suggest by _ whistlecraft _ -lrb- frere -rrb- be draft in October 1817 and appear in may 1818 it aim at comparatively little but be perfectly successful in its aim and unsurpassed for the incisiveness of its side stroke and the courtly ease of a manner that never degenerate into mannerism in _ mazeppa _ the poet revert to he earlier style and that of scott the description of the headlong ride hurry we along with a breathless expectancy that give it a conspicuous place among he minor effort the passage about the howling of the wolf and the fever faint of the victim be as graphic as anything in burn -- the sky spin like a mighty wheel i see the tree like drunkard reel in the may or June of 1818 byron 's little daughter allegra have be send from england under the care of a swiss nurse too young to undertake she management in such try circumstance and after four month of anxiety he place she in charge of mr hoppner in the course of this and the next year there be frequent allusion to the child all save one which record a mere affectation of indifference full of affectionate solicitude in June 1819 he write she temper and she way mr hoppner say be like mine as well as she feature she will make in that case a manageable young lady later he talk of she as flourish like a pomegranate blossom in march 1820 we have another reference allegra be prettier i think but as obstinate as a mule and as ravenous as a vulture health good to judge by the complexion temper tolerable but for vanity and pertinacity she think herself handsome and will do as she please in may he refer to have receive a letter from she mother but give no detail in the following year with the approval of the shelley then at pisa he place she for education in the convent of cavallus bagnus in the romagna i have he write to hoppner who have think of have she board in switzerland neither spare care kindness nor expense since the child be send to I the people may say what they please i must content myself with not deserving in this instance that they should speak ill the place be a _ country _ town in a good air and less liable to objection of every kind it have always appear to I that the moral defect in italy do _ not _ proceed from a _ conventual _ education because to my certain knowledge they come out of they convent innocent even to ignorance of moral evil but to the state of society into which they be directly plunge on come out of it it be like educate a infant on a mountain top and then take he to the sea and throw he into it and desire he to swim elsewhere he say i by no means intend to give a natural child a english education because with the disadvantage of she birth she after settlement would be doubly difficult abroad with a fair foreign education and a portion of 5000_l _ or 6000_l _ -lrb- he will leave she 5000_l _ on condition that she should not marry a englishman be here explain and justified -rrb- she might and may marry very respectably in england such a dowry would be a pittance while elsewhere it be a fortune it be besides my wish that she should be a roman catholic which i look upon as the best religion as it be assuredly the oldest of the various branch of christianity it only remain to add that when he hear that the child have fall ill of fever in 1822 byron be almost speechless with agitation and on the news of she death which take place April 22nd he seem at first utterly prostrated next day he say allegra be dead she be more fortunate than we it be god 's will let we mention it no more she remains rest beneath the elm-tree at harrow which she father use to haunt in boyhood with the date of birth and death and the scripture -- i shall go to she but she shall not return to I the most interesting of the visit pay to byron during the period of he life at venice be that of shelley who leave he wife and child at bagnus di lucca come to see he in August 1818 he arrive late in the midst of a thunderstorm and next day they sail to the lido and ride together along the sand the attitude of the two poet towards each other be curious the comparatively shrewd man of the world often rely on the idealist for guidance and help in practical matter admire he courage and independence speak of he invariably as the best of man but never pay a sufficiently warm tribute in public to he work shelley on the other hand certainly the most modest of great poet contemplate byron in the fix attitude of a literary worshipper the introduction to _ julian and maddalo _ directly suggest by this visit under the slight veil of a change in the name give a summary of the view of he friend 's character which he continue to entertain he be a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct he energy to such a end of become the redeemer of he degraded country but it be he weakness to be proud he derive from a comparison of he own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellect that surround he a intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life he passion and he power be incomparably greater than those of other man and instead of the latter have be employ in curb the former they have mutually lend each other strength but in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming he be cheerful frank and witty he more serious conversation be a sort of intoxication man be hold by it as by a spell subsequently to this visit byron lend the villa at este to he friend and during the autumn week of they residence there be write the line among the euganean hill where in the same strain of reverence shelley refer to the tempest-cleaving swan of albion to the music fling o'er a mighty thunder-fit and to the sunlike soul destine to immortalize he ocean refuge -- as the ghost of homer cling round seamander 's waste spring as divinest shakespeare 's might fill avon and the world with light the sun he say at a later date have extinguish the glowworm and again i despair of rival lord byron as well i may and there be no other with whom it be worth contend shelley be in the main not only a exquisite but a trustworthy critic and no man be more absolutely above be influence by the fanfaronade of rank or the din of popularity these criticism be therefore not to be lightly set aside nor be they unintelligible perhaps those admirer of the clearer and more consistent nature who exalt he to the rank of a greater poet be mislead by the amiable love of one of the purest character in the history of we literature there be at least no difficulty in understand why he should have be as it be concuss by byron 's greater massiveness and energy into a sense -- easy to a impassioned devotee -- of inferiority similarly most of the estimate -- many already reverse other reversible -- by the man of that age of each other can be explain we can see how it be that shelley overestimate both the character and the power of hunt and byron depreciate keat and be ultimately repel by wordsworth and hold out he hand to meet the manly grasp of scott the one enigma of they criticism be the respect that they join in pay to the witty genial shallow worldly musical tom moore this favorite of fortune and the minor muse in the course of a short tour through the north of italy in the autumn of 1819 find he noble friend on the 8th of October at la mira go with he on a sight-seeing expedition to venice and pass five or six day in he company of this visit he have record he impression some of which relate to he host 's personal appearance other to he habit and lead incident of he life byron have grow fatter both in person and face and the latter have suffer most by the change have lose by the enlargement of the feature some of that refine and spiritualize look that have in other time distinguish it but although less romantic he appear more humorous they renew they recollection of the old day and night in london and compare they with later experience of bore and blues in a manner which threaten to put to flight the historical and poetical association naturally awaken by the city of the sea byron have a rooted dislike to any approach to fine talk in the ordinary intercourse of life and when he companion begin to rhapsodize on the rosy hue of the italian sunset he interrupt he with come d -- n it tom _ do not _ be poetical he insist on moore who sigh after what he imagine would be the greater comfort of a hotel take up he quarter in he palace and as they be grope they way through the somewhat dingy entrance cry out keep clear of the dog and a few pace farther take care or the monkey will fly at you a incident recall the old vagary of the menagerie at newstead the biographer 's reminiscence mainly dwell on he lordship 's change mood and temper and gymnastic exercise he terror of interview stranger he imperfect appreciation of art he preference of fish to flesh he almost parsimonious economy in small matter mingle with allusion to he domestic calamity and frequent expression of a grow distaste to venetian society on leave the city moore pass a second afternoon at la mira have a glimpse of allegra and the first intimation of the existence of the notorious memoirs a short time after dinner byron leave the room and return carry in he hand a white leather bag ` look here ' he say hold it up ` this would be worth something to murray though _ you _ i dare say would not give sixpence for it ' ` what be it ' i ask ` my life and adventure ' he answer ` it be not a thing ' he answer ` that can be publish during my lifetime but you may have it if you like there do whatever you please with it ' in take the bag and thank he most warmly i add ` this will make a nice legacy for my little tom who shall astonish the latter day of the nineteenth century with it ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- shortly after moore for the last time bid he friend farewell take with he from madame guiccioli who do the honor of the house a introduction to she brother count gamba at rome theresa guicciolus say castelar appear like a star on the stormy horizon of the poet 's life a young romagnese the daughter of a nobleman of ravenna of good descent but limited means she have be educate in a convent and marry in she nineteenth year to a rich widower of sixty in early

countess benzonus suddenly the young italian find herself inspire with a passion of which till that moment she mind could not have form the least idea she have think of love but as a amusement and now become its slave byron on the other hand give what remain of a heart never alienate from she by any other mistress till the middle of the month they meet every day and when the husband take she back to ravenna she despatch to she idol a series of impassioned letter declare she resolution to mould she life in accordance with he wish towards the end of may she have prepare she relative to receive

to be nurse this incident be versify in _ don juan _ v 33-39 with anatomical minuteness of detail after try in vain to wrench a answer out of death the poet end in he accustomed strain -- but it be all a mystery here we be and there we go : -- but _ where _ five bit of lead -- or three or two or one -- send very far assassination have sometimes be the prelude to revolution but it may be question if it have over promote the cause of liberty most frequently it have serve as a pretext for reaction or a red signal in this instance -- as afterwards in 1848 -- overt act of violence make the power of despotism more alert and conduce with the half-hearted action of they adversary to the suppression of the rising of 1820-21 byron 's sympathy with the movement seem to have be stimulate by he new association theresa 's brother count pietro a enthusiastic young soldier have return from rome and naple surmount a prejudice not wholly unnatural become attach to he and they enter into a partnership in behalf of what -- adopt a phrase often flaunt in opposite camp -- they call constitutional principle finally the poet so committed himself to the party of insurrection that though he nationality secure he from direct attack he movement be necessarily affect by the fiasco in July the gamba be banish from the romagna pietro be actually carry by force over the frontier and accord to the article of she separation the countess have to follow they to florence byron linger for some mouth partly from a spirit of defiance and partly from he affection towards a place where he have enlist the regard of numerous beneficiary the gamba be for some time bent on migrate to switzerland but the poet after first acquiesce subsequently conceive a violent repugnance to the idea and early in August write to shelley earnestly request he presence aid and counsel shelley at once comply and enter into a correspondence with madame guiccioli succeed in induce she relative to abandon they transmontane plan and agree to take up they headquarters at pisa this incident give rise to a series of interesting letter in which the younger poet give a vivid and generous account of the surroundings and condition of he friend on the 2nd of August he write from ravenna : -- i arrive last night at ten o'clock and sit up talk with lord b till five this morning he be delighted to see I he have in fact completely recover he health and live a life totally the reverse of that which he lead at venice poor fellow he be now quite well and immerse in politics and literature we talk a great deal of poetry and such matter last night and as usual differ i think more than ever he affect to patronize a system of criticism fit only for the production of mediocrity and although all he finer poem and passage have be produce in defiance of this system yet i recognize the pernicious effect of it in the _ doge of venice _ again on the 15th : lord b be greatly improve in every respect -- in genius in temper in moral view in health and happiness he connexion with la guicciolus have be a inestimable benefit to he he live in considerable splendor but within he income which be now about 4000_l _ a year 1000_l _ of which he devote to purpose of charity switzerland be little fitted for he the gossip and the cabal of those anglicised coterie would torment he as they do before ravenna be a miserable place he would in every respect be better among the tuscan he have read to I one of the unpublished canto of _ don juan _ it set he not only above but far above all the poet of the day every word have the stamp of immortality i have speak to he of hunt but not with a direct view of demand a contribution i be sure if i ask it would not be refuse yet there be something in I that make it impossible lord b and i be excellent friend and be i reduce to poverty or be i a writer who have no claim to a higher position than i possess i would freely ask he any favor such be not now the case later after state that byron have decide upon tuscany he say in reference to la guicciolus at the conclusion of a letter full of all the fine thing she say she have hear of I be this request which i transcribe : -- ` signore la vostra bont mi fa ardita di chiedervi un favore I lo accordarete voi _ non partite da ravenna senza milord _ ' of course be now by all the law of knighthood captive to a lady 's request i shall only be at liberty on my parole until lord byron be settle at pisa shelley take he leave after a visit of ten day ' duration about the 17th or 18th of April in a letter date August 26 he mention have secure for he lordship the palazzo lanfranchus a old spacious building on the lung ' arno once the family residence of the destroyer of ugolino and still say to be haunt by they ghost towards the close of October he say they have be expect he any day those six week byron however do not leave till the morning of the 29th on he road there occur at imolum the accidental meeting with lord clare clare -- who on this occasion merely cross he friend 's path on he way to rome -- at a later date come on purpose from geneva before return to england to visit the poet who then at leghorn record in a letter to moore he sense of this proof of old affection undecayed at bologna -- he next stage -- he meet roger by appointment and the latter have preserve he memory of the event in well-known line together they revisit florence and its gallery where they be distract by the crowd of sight-seeing visitor byron must have reach pisa not later than the 2nd of November -lrb- 1821 -rrb- for he first letter from there bear the date of the 3rd the later month of the poet 's life at ravenna be mark by intense literary activity over a great part of the year be spread the controversy with bowle about pope ie between the extreme of art against nature and nature against art it be a controversy for the most part free from personal animus and on byron 's part the genuine expression of a reaction against a reaction to this year belong the greater number of the poet 's historical drama what be say of these at the time by jeffrey heber and other be say with justice it be seldom that the criticism of we day find so little to reverse in that of sixty year ago the author have show himself capable of be pathetic sarcastic sentimental comical and sublime we would be tempt to think that he have write these play to show what no one before suspect that he could also be dull be it not for he own exorbitant estimation of they lord byron have few of the power of a great dramatist he have little architectural imagination or capacity to conceive and build up a whole he work be mainly mass of fine splendid or humorous write heap together the part be seldom forge into one or connect by any indissoluble link he so-called drama be only poem divide into chapter further he have little of what mr ruskin call penetrative imagination so it have be plausibly say that he make he man after he own image he woman after he own heart the former be indeed rather type of what he wish to be than what he be they be better and worse than himself they have stronger will more definite purpose but less genial and less versatile nature but it remain true that when he try to represent a character totally different from himself the result be either unreal or uninteresting _ marino faliero _ begin April finish July 1820 and prefix by a humorous dedication to goethe -- which be however suppress -- be bring on the stage of drury lane theater early in 1821 badly mangled appoint and act -- and damned byron seem to have be sincere in say he do not intend any of he play to be represent we be more inclined to accuse he of self-deception when he assert that he do not mean they to be popular but he take sure means to prevent they from be so _ marino faliero _ in particular be pronounce by dr john watkin -- old grobius himself -- to be the dullest of dull play and even the warmest admirer of the poet have to confess that the style be cumbrous the story may be true but it be none the less unnatural the character be comparatively commonplace the woman especially be mere shadow the motion be slow and the inevitable passage of fine writing be as the extol soliloquy of lionus rather rhetorical than imaginative the speech of the doge be solemn but prolix if not ostentatious and -- perhaps the vital defect -- he cause fail to enlist we sympathy artistically this play be byron 's most elaborate attempt to revive the unity and other restriction of the severe style which when he write have be vanquish in literature i be persuade he write in the preface that a great tragedy be not to be produce by follow the old dramatist who be full of fault but by produce regular drama like the greek he forget that the statement in the mouth of a greek dramatist that he play be not intend for the stage would have be a confession of failure and that aristotle have admit that even the deity could not make the past present the ethical motive of faliero be first the cry for vengeance -- the feeling of affronted or unsatiated pride -- that run through so much of the author 's writing and second the enthusiasm for public end which be begin to possess he the follow line have be point out as embody some of byron 's spirit of protest against the more selfish greasy domesticity of the georgian era : -- i ber such tie be not for those who be call to the high destiny which purify corrupt commonwealth : we must forget all feeling save the one we must resign all passion save we purpose we must behold no object save we country and only look on death as beautiful so that the sacrifice ascend to heaven and draw down freedom on she evermore cal but if we fail -- i ber they never fail who die in a great cause : the block may soak they gore they head may sodden in the sun they limb be string to city gate and castle wall but still they spirit walk abroad -- a passage which after he wont he spoil by platitude about the precisian brutus who certainly do not give rome liberty byron 's other venetian drama the _ two foscarus _ compose at ravenna between the 11th of June and the 10th of July 1821 and publish in the follow December be another record of the same failure and the same mortification due to the same cause in this play as jeffrey point out the preservation of the unity have a still more disastrous effect the author 's determination to avoid rant do not hinder he frequently adopt a inflated style while profess to follow the ancient rule he forget the warning of horace so far as to permit the groan of the tortured foscarus to be hear on the stage the declamation of marina produce no effect on the action and the vindictiveness of loridano though effectively point in the closing word he have pay I be not render interesting either by a well establish injury or by any trace of iago 's subtle genius in the same volume appear _ sardanapalus _ write in the previous may and dedicate to goethe in this play which mark the author 's last reversion to the east we be more arrest by the majesty of the theme -- thirteen hundred year of empire end like a shepherd 's tale by the grandeur of some of the passage and by the development of the chief character make more vivid by its be distinctly autobiographical sardanapalus himself be harold raise high on a throne and rouse himself at the close from a life of effeminate lethargy myrrha have be often identify with la guicciolus and the hero 's relation to he queen zarina compare with that of the poet to he wife but in he portrait of the former the author 's defective capacity to represent national character be manifest : myrrha be only another gulnare medora or zuleika in the domestic play of _ werner _ -- complete at pisa in January 1822 and publish in November there be no merit either of plan or execution for the plot be take with little change from the german 's tale write by harriet lee and the treatment be throughout prosaic byron be never a master of blank verse but _ werner _ he solo success on the modern british stage be write in a style fairly parody by campbell when he cut part of the author 's preface into line and pronounce they as good as any in the play the _ deform transform _ another adaptation suggest by a forget novel call _ the three brother _ with reminiscence of _ faust _ and possibly of scott 's _ black dwarf _ be begin at pisa in 1821 but not publish till January 1824 this fragment owe its interest to the bitter infusion of personal feeling in the first scene and its occasional charm to the march of some of the line especially those describe the bourbon 's advance on rome but the effect of the magical element be kill by previous parallel while the story be chaotic and absurd the _ deform transform _ bear somewhat the same relation to _ manfr as heaven and earth _ -- a occasionally graphic dream of the world before the deluge write October 1821 and issue about the same time as moore 's _ love of the angel _ on a similar theme -- do to _ cain _ the last name begin in July and finish at ravenna in September be the author 's highest contribution to the metaphysical poetry of the century in _ cain _ byron grapple with the perplexity of a belief which he never either accept or reject and with the yet deeper problem of life and death of good and ill in deal with these he position be not that of one justify the way of god to man -- though he somewhat disingenuously appeal to milton in he defense -- nor that of the definite antagonism of _ queen mab _ the distinction in this respect between byron and shelley can not be over-emphasize the latter have a firm faith other than that commonly call christian the former be in the proper sense of the word a sceptic beset with doubt and seek for a solution which he never find shift in he expression of they with every change of a fickle and inconsistent temperament the atmosphere of _ cain _ be almost wholly negative for under the guise of a drama which be mainly a dialogue between two half of he mind the author appear to sweep aside with something approach to disdain the answer of a blindly accept tradition or of a superficial optimism eg -- cain then my father 's god do well when he prohibit the fatal tree lucifer but have do better in not plant it again a kid after suffer agony from the sting of a reptile be restore by antidote -- behold my son say adam how from evil spring good lucifer what didst thou answer cain nothing for he be my father but i think that ` twere a better portion for the animal never to have be sting at all this rebellious nature naturally yield to the argument of lucifer a spirit in which much of the grandeur of milton 's satan be add to the subtlety of mephistophele in the first scene cain be introduce rebel against toil impose on he by a offence commit before he be bear -- i seek not to be bear -- the answer that toil be a good be preclude by its authoritative representation as a punishment in which mood he be confirm by the entrance and reasoning of the tempter who identify the deity with seva the destroyer hint at the dreadful visitation of the yet untasted death when adah enter take he at first for a angel and then recognize he as a fiend she invocation to eve and comparison of the heedless harmless wantonness of bliss in eden to the later lot of those girt about with demon from whose fascination they can not fly be one of the most striking in the drama as be the line put into the mouth of the poet 's most beautiful female character to show that god can not be alone -- what else can joy be but diffuse joy she subsequent contrast of lucifer with the other angel be more after the style of shelley than anything else in byron -- as the silent sunny moon all light they look upon we but thou seemst like a ethereal night where long white cloud streak the deep purple and unnumber would star spangle the wonderful mysterious vault with thing that look as if they would be sun -- so beautiful unnumber would and endearing not dazzling and yet draw we to they they fill my eye with tear and so dost thou the flight with lucifer in the second act in the abyss of space and through the hade of uncreated night with the vision of long-wrecked world and the interminable gloomy realm of swim shadow and enormous shape -- suggest as the author tell we by the reading of cuvier -- leave we with impression of grandeur and desolation which no other passage of english poetry can convey lord byron have elsewhere exhibit more versatility of fancy and richness of illustration but nowhere else have he so nearly strike the star from constellation to constellation the pair speed on cleave the blue with mighty wing but find in all a blank like that in richter 's wonderful dream the result on the mind of cain be sum in the line on the fatal tree -- it be a lie tree -- for we _ know _ nothing at least it _ promise knowledge _ at the price of death -- but _ knowledge _ still but what _ know _ man a more modern poet answer after beat at the same iron gate behold we know not anything the most beautiful remain passage be cain 's reply to the question -- what be more beautiful to he than all that he have see in the unimaginable ether -- my sister adah -- all the star of heaven the deep blue noon of night light by a orb which look a spirit or a spirit 's world -- the hue of twilight -- the sun 's gorgeous come -- he setting indescribable which fill my eye with pleasant tear as i behold he sink and feel my heart flow softly with he along that western paradise of cloud the forest shade -- the green bough -- the bird 's voice -- the vesper bird 's which seem to sing of love and mingle with the song of cherubim as the day close over eden 's wall : -- all these be nothing to my eye and heart like adah 's face lucifer 's speech at the close of the act be perhaps too miltonic to be absolutely original return to earth we have a pastoral of which sir egerton brydge justly and sufficiently remark the censorious may say what they will but there be speech in the mouth of cain and adah especially regard they child which nothing in english poetry but the ` wood-note wild ' of shakespeare ever equal she cry as cain seem to threaten the infant follow by the picture of he bloom and joy be a touch of perfect pathos then come the interview with the pious abel who be amaze at the lurid light in the eye of he brother with the sphere singing in thunder round he -- the two sacrifice the murder the shriek of zillah -- father eve adah come hither death be in the world cain 's rally from stupor -- i be awake at last -- a dreary dream have madden would I -- but he shall never wake : the curse of eve and the close -- -lrb- greek : meizon ae kata dakrua -rrb- cain leave I adah why all have leave thee cain and wherefore lingerest thou dost thou not fear adah i fear nothing except to leave thee \* \* \* \* \* cain eastward from eden will we take we way adah leave thou shalt be my guide and may we god be thine now let we carry forth we child cain and _ he _ who lieth there be childless i have dry the fountain of a gentle race o abel adah peace be with he cain but with _ I _ _ cain _ between which and the _ cencus _ lie the award of the greatest single performance in dramatic shape of we century raise a storm it be publish with _ sardanapalus _ and _ the two foscarus _ in December 1821 and the critic soon give evidence of the truth of elze 's remark -- in england freedom of action be cramp by the want of freedom of think the converse be the case with we german freedom of thought be restrict by the want of freedom in action to we this scepticism present nothing in the least fearful but with we it appear as if a literary guy fawke have be detect in the act of blow up half the cathedral and all the chapel of the country the rage of insular orthodoxy be in proportion to its impotence every scribbler with a cassock denounce the book and its author though few attempt to answer he the hubbub be such that byron write to murray authorize he to disclaim all responsibility and offer to refund the payment he have receive say that both you and mr gilford remonstrate i will come to england to stand trial ` I I adsum qui feci ' -- and much to the same effect the book be pirate and on the publisher 's application to have a injunction lord eldon refuse to grant it the majority of the minor reviewer become hysterical and dr watkin amid much almost inarticulate rave say that sir walter scott who have gratefully accept the dedication would go down to posterity with the brand of _ cain _ upon he brow several even of the higher critic take fright jeffrey while protest he appreciation of the literary merit of the work lament its tendency to unsettle faith mr campbell talk of its frightful audacity bishop heber write at great length to prove that its spirit be more dangerous than that of _ paradise lose _ -- and succeed the _ quarterly _ begin to cool towards the author moore write to he that cain be wonderful terrible never to be forget but dread and deprecate the influence of shelley byron show the letter to shelley who write to a common friend to assure mr moore that he have not the smallest influence over he lordship in matter of religion and only wish he have as he would employ it to eradicate from he great mind the delusion of christianity which seem perpetually to recur and to lie in ambush for the hour of sickness and distress shelley elsewhere write : what think you of lord b 's last volume in my opinion it contain finer poetry than have appear in england since _ paradise lose _ cain be apocalyptic it be a revelation not before communicate to man in the same strain scott say of the author of the grand and tremendous drama : he have certainly match milton on he own ground the worst effect of those attack appear in the shift to which byron resort to explain himself -- to be imputed however not to cowardice but to he waver habit of mind great writer in we country have frequently stir difficult question in religion and life and then seem to be half scared like rouget de lisle by the reverberation of they own voice shelley almost alone be always ready to declare i mean what i say and stand to it byron have with or without design arraign some of the thirty-nine article of he countryman proceed in the follow month -lrb- October 1821 -rrb- to commit a outrage yet more keenly resent on the memory of they sainted king the pattern of private virtue and public vice george iii the perpetration of this occur in the course of the last of he numerous literary duel of which it be the close that mr southey be a well-meaning and independent man of letter there can be no doubt it do not require the conclusive testimony of the esteem of savage landor to compel we respect for the author of the _ life of nelson _ and the open-handed friend of coleridge nor be it any disparagement that with the last-named and with wordsworth he in middle life change he political and other opinion but in he dealings with lord byron southey have eat of the insane root he attack a man of incomparably superior power for whom he utter want of humor -- save in its comparatively childish form -- make he a ludicrously unequal match and pay the penalty in be gibbet in satire that will endure with the language the strife which seem to have begin on byron 's leave england rise to its height when he lordship in the humorous observation and serious defense of he character against the remark in blackwood 1819 -lrb- August -rrb- accuse the laureate of apostasy treason and slander in 1821 when the latter publish he _ vision of judgment _ -- the most quaintly preposterous panegyric ever pen -- he prefix to it a long explanatory note in the course of which he characterize _ don juan _ as a monstrous combination of horror and mockery lewdness and impiety regret that it have not be bring under the lash of the law salute the writer as chief of the satanic school inspire by the spirit of moloch and belial and refer to the remorse that will overtake he on he death-bed to which byron _ inter alia _ : mr southey with a cowardly ferocity exult over the anticipated death-bed repentance of the object of he dislike and indulge himself in a pleasant ` vision of judgment ' in prose as well as verse full of impious impudence what mr southey 's sensation or ours may be in the awful moment of leave this state of existence neither he nor we can pretend to decide in common i presume with most man of any reflection _ i _ have not wait for a death-bed to repent of many of my action notwithstanding the ` diabolical pride ' which this pitiful renegade in he rancor would impute to those who scorn he this dignified though trenchant rejoinder would have be unanswerable but the writer go on to charge the laureate with spread calumny to this charge southey in January 1822 reply with a direct and positive denial and then proceed to talk at large of the whip and brand iron slave of sensuality stone from sling goliah public pander and what not in the manner of the brave day of old in February byron have see this assault in the _ courier _ write off in needless heat i have get southey 's pretended reply what remain to be do be to call he out -- and despatch a cartel of mortal defiance mr dougla kinnaird through whom this be send judiciously suppress it and the author 's thirst for literary blood be destine to remain unquenched meanwhile he have write he own _ vision of judgment _ this extraordinary work have be refuse by both murray and longman appear in 1822 in the page of the _ liberal _ it pass the bound of british endurance and the publisher mr john hunt be prosecute and fine for the publication reader of we day will generally admit that the gouty hexameter of the original poem which celebrate the apotheosis of king george in heaven be much more blasphemous than the _ ottava rima _ of the travesty which profess to narrate the difficulty of he get there byron 's _ vision of judgment _ be as unmistakably the first of parody as the _ iliad _ be the first of epic or the _ pilgrim 's progress _ the first of allegory in execution it be almost perfect _ don juan _ be in scope and magnitude a far wider work but no considerable series of stanza in _ don juan _ be so free from serious artistic flaw from first to last every epithet hit the white every line that do not convulse with laughter sting or lash it rise to greatness by the fact that underneath all its lambent buffoonery it be aflame with righteous wrath nowhere in such space save in some of the prose of swift be there in english so much scathing satire chapter ix 1821-1823 pisa -- genoa -- don juan byron have arrive at pisa with he troop of carriage horse dog fowl servant and a monkey settle himself quietly in the palazzo lanfranchus for ten month interrupt only by a sojourn of six week in the neighborhood of leghorn he life in the old feudal building follow in the main the tenor of he life at ravenna he rise late receive visitor in the afternoon play billiards ride or practice with he pistol in concert with shelley whom he refer to at this time as the most companionable man under thirty he have ever meet both poet be good shot but byron the safest for though he hand often shake he make allowance for the vibration and never miss he mark on one occasion he set up a slender cane and at twenty pace divide it with he bullet the early part of the evening he give to a frugal meal and the society of la guicciolus -- now apparently in defiance of the statute of limitation establish under the same roof -- and then sit late over he verse he be dispose to be more sociable than at venice or ravenna and occasionally entertain stranger but he intimate acquaintanceship be confine to captain william and he wife and shelley 's cousin captain medwin the latter use frequently to dine and sit with he host till the morning collect material for the _ conversation _ which he afterwards give to the world the value of these reminiscence be impair by the fact of they recording as serious revelation the absurd confidence in which the poet 's humor for mystification be wont to indulge another of the group a irishman call taafe be make in he lordship 's correspondence of the period to cut a somewhat comical figure the master-passion of this worthy and genial fellow be to get a publisher for a fair commentary on dante to which he have firmly link a very bad translation and for about six month byron pester murray with constant appeal to satisfy he eg November l6 he must be gratify though the

ditch taafe whose horsemanship be on a par with he poetry can hardly have be consult as to the form assume by these apparently fruitless recommendation so characteristic of the writer 's frequent kindliness and constant love of mischief about this time byron receive a letter from mr shepherd a gentleman in somersetshire refer to the death of he wife among whose papers he have find the record of a touch because evidently heart-felt prayer for the poet 's reformation conversion and restore peace of mind to this letter he at once return a answer mark by much of the fine feeling of he best mood pisa December 8 : sir i have receive you letter i need not say that the extract which it contain have affect I because it would imply a want of all feel to have read it with indifference you brief and simple picture of the excellent person whom i trust you will again meet can not be contemplate without the admiration due to she virtue and she pure and unpretending piety i do not know that i ever meet with anything so unostentatiously beautiful indisputably the firm believer in the gospel have a great advantage over all other -- for this simple reason that if true they will have they reward hereafter and if there be no hereafter they can but be with the infidel in he eternal sleep but a man 's creed do not depend upon _ himself _ : who can say i _ will _ believe this that or the other and least of all that which he least can comprehend i can assure you that not all the fame which ever cheat humanity into higher notion of its own importance would ever weigh in my mind against the pure and pious interest which a virtuous being may be please to take in my behalf in this point of view i would not exchange the prayer of the decease in my behalf for the unite glory of homer caesar and napoleon the letter to lady byron which he afterwards show to lady blessington must have bear about the same date and we have a further indication of he thought revert homeward in a urgent request to murray -- write on December 10th ada 's sixth birthday -- to send he daughter 's miniature after its arrival nothing give he greater pleasure than to be tell of its strong likeness to himself in the course of the same month a event occur which strangely illustrate the manners of the place and the character of the two poet a unfortunate fanatic have take it into he head to steal the wafer-box out of a church at lucca and be detect be in accordance with the ecclesiastical law till lately maintain against sacrilege condemn to be burnt alive shelley who believe that the sentence would really be carry into effect propose to byron that they should gallop off together and by aid of they servant rescue by force the intended victim byron however prefer in the first place to rely on diplomacy some vigorous letter pass ultimately a representation convoy by taafe to the english ambassador lead to a commutation of the sentence and the man be send to the galley the January of 1822 be mark by the addition to the small circle of captain ej trelawny the famous rover and bold free-lance -lrb- long sole survivor of the remarkable group -rrb- who accompany lord byron to greece and have record a variety of incident of the last month of he life trelawny who appreciate shelley with a intensity that be often apt to be exclusive saw or have report for the most part the weaker side of byron we be constrain to accept as correct the conjecture that he judgment be biass by they rivalry in physical prowess and the political difference which afterwards develop between they letter to he old correspondent -- to scott about the _ waverley _ to murray about the drama and the _ vision of judgment _ and _ cain _ -- make up almost the sole record of the poet 's pursuit during the five follow month in February 6th he send through mr kinnaird the challenge to southey of the suppression of which he be not aware till may 17 the same letter contain a sheaf of the random cynicism as -- cash be virtue money be power and when socrate say he know nothing he mean he have not a drachma -- by which he sharpen the shaft of he assailant a little later on occasion of the death of lady noel he express himself with natural bitterness on hearing that she have in she will record a wish against he daughter ada see he portrait in march he sit along with la guicciolus to the sculptor bartolinus on the 24th when the company be on one of they ride excursion outside the town a half-drunken dragoon on horseback break through they and by accident or design knock shelley from he seat byron pursue he along the lung ' arno call for he name and take he for a officer fling he glove the sound of the fray bring the servant of the lanfranchus to the door and one of they it be presume -- though in the scuffle everything remain uncertain -- seriously wound the dragoon in the side a investigation ensue as the result of which the gamba be ultimately exile from tuscany and the party of friend be practically break up shelley and he wife with the williams and trelawny soon after settle at the villa magnus at lericus in the gulf of spezium byron with the countess and she brother establish themselves in the villa rossa at monte nero a suburb of leghorn from which port at this date the remains of allegra be convey to england among the incident of this residence be the homage pay to the poet by a party of american the painting of he portrait -lrb- and that of la guicciolus -rrb- by the artist west who have leave a please account of he visit byron 's letter make inquiry about the country of bolivar -lrb- where it be he fancy to settle -rrb- and another of those disturbance by which he seem destine to be harass one of he servant -- among whom be unruly spirit apparently select with a kind of _ corsair _ bravado -- have make a assault on count pietro wound he in the face this outburst though follow by tear and penitence confirm the impression of the tuscan police that the whole company be dangerous and make the government press for they departure in the midst of the uproar there suddenly appear at the villa mr leigh hunt with he wife and six child they have take passage to genoa where they be receive by trelawny in command of the bolivar -- a yacht construct in that port for lord byron simultaneously with the don juan for shelley the latter on hearing of the arrival of he friend come to meet they at leghorn and go with they to pisa early in July they be all establish on the lung ' arno have assign to they the ground floor of the palazzo we have now to deal briefly -- amid conflict asseveration it be hard to deal fairly -- with the last of the vexatiously controvert episode which need perplex we narrative byron in wish moore from ravenna a merry christmas for 1820 propose that they shall embark together in a newspaper with some improvement on the plan of the present scoundrel to give the age some new light on policy poesy biography criticism morality theology & c moore absolutely refuse to entertain the idea hunt 's name be bring forward in connexion with it during tho visit of shelley shortly after the return of the latter to pisa he write -lrb- August 26 -rrb- to hunt state that byron be anxious to start a periodical work to be conduct in italy and have propose that they should both go share in the concern on which follow some suggestion of difficulty about money nevertheless in August 1821 he press hunt to come moore on the other hand strongly remonstrate against the project i hear some day ago that leigh hunt be on he way to you with all he family and the idea seem to be that you and he and shelley be to conspire together in the _ examiner _ i deprecate such a plan with all my might partnership in fame like those in trade make the strongest party answer for the rest i tremble even for you with such a bankrupt co you must stand alone shelley -- who have in the meantime give he bond to byron for a advance of 200_l _ towards the expense of he friend besides assist they himself to the utmost of he power -- begin shortly before they arrival to express grave doubt as to the success of the alliance he last publish letter -- write July 5th 1822 -- after they have settle at pisa be full of foreboding on the 8th he set sail in the don juan -- that fatal and perfidious bark build in th ` eclipse and rigg would with curse dark and be overtake by the storm in which he perish three day after trelawny ride to pisa and tell byron of he fear when the poet 's lip quiver and he voice falter on the 22nd of July the body of shelley william and vivian be cast ashore on the 16th August hunt byron and trelawny be present at the terribly weird cremation which they have all describe at a later date the two former be seize with a fit of delirium which be one of the phase of the tension of grief byron 's reference to the event be expression less of the loss which he indubitably feel than of he indignation at the world 's wrong thus he write there be another man go about whom the world be ill-naturedly and ignorantly and brutally mistaken it will perhaps do he justice now when he can be no better for it towards the end of the same letter the spirit of he dead friend seem to inspire the sentence -- with these thing and these fellow it be necessary in the present clash of philosophy and tyranny to throw away the scabbard i know it be against fearful odds but the battle must be fight meanwhile shortly after the new settlement at the lanfranchus the preparation for issue the _ liberal _ edit by leigh hunt in italy and publish by john hunt in london progress the first number which appear in September be introduce after a few word of preface by the _ vision of judgment _ with the signature quevedo redivivus and adorn by shelley 's translation of the may-day night in _ faust _ it contain besides the _ letter to the editor of my grandmother 's review _ a indifferent florentine story a german apologue and a gossip account of pisa presumably by hunt three other follow contain byron 's _ heaven and earth _ he translation of the _ morgante maggiore _ and _ the blues _ -- a very slight if not silly satire on literary lady some of shelley 's posthumous minor poem among they i arise from dream of thee and a few of hazlitt 's essay include however none of he best leigh hunt himself write most of the rest one of he contribution be a palpable imitation of _ don juan _ entitle the _ book of beginning _ but he confess that owe to he weak health and low spirit at the time none of these do justice to he ability and the general manner of the magazine be insufficiently vigorous to carry off the frequent eccentricity of its matter the prejudice against it prevail and the enterprise come to a end partner in fail concern be apt to dispute in this instance the unpleasantness which arise at the time rankle in the mind of the survivor and give rise to he singularly tasteless and injudicious book -- a performance which can be only in part condone by the fact of hunt 's afterwards express regret and practically withdraw it he represent himself throughout as a much-injured man lure to italy by misrepresentation that he might give the aid of he journalistic experience and undeniable talent to the advancement of a mercenary enterprise and that when it fail he be despise insult and reject byron on the other hand declare the hunt press I to engage in this work and in a evil hour i consent and he subsequent action in the matter if not always gentle never unjust go to verify he statement in the letter of the period i be afraid he write from genoa oct 9 1822 the journal be a bad business i have do all i can for leigh hunt since he come here but it be almost useless he wife be ill he six child not very tractable and in the affair of this world he himself be a child later he say to murray you and you friend by you injudicious rudeness cement a connexion which you strive to prevent and which have the hunt prosper would not in all probability have continue as it be i can not leave they among the breaker on February 20th we have he last word on the subject to the same effect in the follow sentence moore seem to give a fair statement of the motive which lead to the establishment of the unfortunate journal -- the chief inducement on the part of lord byron to this unworthy alliance be in the first place a wish to second the kind view of he friend shelley in invite mr hunt to italy and in the next a desire to avail himself of the aid of one so experienced as a editor in the favorite object he have so long contemplate of a periodical work in which all the offspring of he genius might be receive as they spring to light for the accomplishment of this purpose mr leigh hunt be a singularly ill-chosen associate a man of radical opinion on all matter not only of religion but of society -- opinion which he acquire and hold easily but firmly -- could never recognize the propriety of the claim to deference which the noble poet be always too eager to assert and be incline to take liberty which he patron perhaps superciliously repel mr hunt do not seem to have be a very judicious person trelawny here say byron jocularly have be speak against my moral it be the first time i ever hear of they she reply mr hunt by he own admission have peculiar notion on the subject of money byron on he part be determine not to be put upon and dole out through he steward state allowance to hunt who say that only stern necessity and a large family induce he to accept they hunt 's expression that the 200_l _ be _ in the first instance _ a debt to shelley point to the conclusion that it be remit on that poet 's death besides this byron maintain the family till they leave genoa for florence in 1823 and defray up to that date all they expense he give he contribution to the _ liberal _ grati and again by hunt 's own confession leave to he and he brother the profit of the proprietorship accord to mr galt the whole extent of the pecuniary obligation appear not to have exceed 500 _ l _ but little or great the manner in which it be recollect reflect no credit either on the head or heart of the debtor of the weakness on which the writer -- bent on verify pope 's line on atossa -- from he vantage in the ground-floor be enable to dilate many be but slightly magnify we be tell for instance in very many word that byron clung to the privilege of he rank while wish to seem above they that he have a small library and be a one-sided critic that bayle and gibbon supply he with the learning he have leave at school that be a good rider with a graceful seat he like to be tell of it that he show letter he ought not to have show that he pretend to think worse of wordsworth than he do that he know little of art or music adore rossinus and call ruben a dauber that though he write _ don juan _ under gin and water he have not a strong head & c & c it be true but not new but when hunt proceed to say that byron have no sentiment that la guicciolus do not really care much about he that he admire gifford because he be a sycophant and scott because he love a lord that he have no heart for anything except a feverish notoriety that he be a miser from he birth and have as little regard for liberty as allierus -- it be new enough but it be manifestly not true hunt 's book which begin with a caricature on the frontispiece and be inspire in the main by uncharitableness yet contain here and there gleam of a deeper insight than we find in all the volume of moore -- a insight which in spite of he irritated egotism be the mark of a man with the instinct of a poet with some cosmopolitan sympathy and a courage on occasion to avow they at any risk lord byron he say truly have be too much admire by the english because he be sulky and wilful and reflect in he own person they love of dictation and excitement they owe he memory a greater regard and would do it much greater honor if they admire he for let they know they be not so perfect a nation as they suppose themselves and that they might take as well as give lesson of humanity by a candid comparison of note with civilization at large in July when at leghorn the gamba receive order to leave tuscany and on he return to pisa byron be persecute by the police begin to prepare for another change after entertaining project about greece america and switzerland -- trelawny undertaking to have the bolivar convey over the alp to the lake of geneva -- he decide on follow he friend to genoa he leave in September with la guicciolus pass by lericus and sestrus and then for the ten remain mouth of he italian life take up he quarter at albaro about a mile to the east of the city in the villa saluzzo which mr shelley have procure for he and he party she herself settle with the hunt -- who travel about the same time at byron 's expense but in they own company -- in the neighbouring casa negroto not far off mr savage landor be in possession of the casa pallavicini but there be little intercourse between the three landor and byron in many respects more akin than any other two englishman of they age be always separate by a unhappy bar or intervene mist the only family with whom the poet maintain any degree of intimacy be that of the earl of blessington consist of the earl himself -- a gouty old gentleman with story about he of the past -- the countess and she sister miss power and the cupidon dchan the anglo-french count alfr d'orsay -- who be to take part in story of the future in the spring of 1823 byron persuade they to occupy the villa paradiso and be accustom to accompany they frequently on horseback excursion along the coast to they favorite nervus it have be say that lady blessington 's _ conversation with lord byron _ be as regard trustworthiness on a par with landor 's _ imaginary conversation _ let this be so they be still of interest on point of fact which it must have be easier to record than to imagine however adorn or the reverse by the fancy of a habitual novelist they convey the impression of a goodhumoured lively and fascinating woman derive from a more or less intimate association with the most brilliant man of the age of he personal appearance -- a matter of which she be a good judge -- we have the following : one of byron 's eye be larger than the other he nose be rather thick so he be best see in profile he mouth be splendid and he scornful expression be real not affect but a sweet smile often break through he melancholy he be at this time very pale and thin -lrb- which indicate the success of he regimen of reduction since leave venice -rrb- he hair be dark brown here and there turn gray he voice be harmonious clear and low there be some gaucherie in he walk from he attempt to conceal he lameness ada 's portrait be like he and he be please at the likeness but hope she would not turn out to be clever -- at any event not poetical he be fond of gossip and apt to speak slightingly of some of he friend but be loyal to other he great defect be flippancy and a total want of self-possession the narrator also dwell on he horror of interviewer by whom at this time he be even more than usually beset one visitor of the period ingenuously observe -- certain person will be chagrin to hear that byron 's mode of life do not furnish the smallest food for calumny another say i never see a countenance more compose and still -- i might even add more sweet and prepossessing but he temper be easily ruffle and for a whole day he could not endure the ringing of bell bribe he neighbor to repress they noise and fail retaliate by surpass they he never forgive colonel carr for break one of he dog 's rib though he generally forgive injury without forget they he have a bad opinion of the inertness of the genoese for whatever he himself do he do with a will -- ` toto se corpore miscuit ' and be wont to assume a sort of dictatorial tone -- as if ' i have say it and it must be so ' be enough from these waif and stray of gossip we return to a subject of deeper interest the countess of blessington with natural curiosity be anxious to elicit from byron some light on the mystery of he domestic affair and renew the attempt previously make by madame de stal to induce he to some movement towards a reconciliation with he wife he reply to this overture be to show she a letter which he have write to lady byron from pisa but never forward of the tone of which the follow extract must be a sufficient indication : -- i have to acknowledge the receipt of ada 's hair i also thank you for the inscription of the date and name and i will tell you why i believe they be the only two or three word of you hand-writing in my possession for you letter i return and except the two word -- or rather the one word ` household ' write twice -- in a old account book i have no other every day which keep we asunder should after so long a period rather soften we mutual feeling which must always have one rallying-point as long as we child exist we both make a bitter mistake but now it be over i consider we re-union as not impossible for more than a year after the separation but then i give up the hope i be violent but not malignant for only fresh provocation can awaken my resentment remember that if you have injure I in aught this forgiveness be something and that if i have injure you it be something more still if it be true as moralist assert that the most offend be the least forgiving it be a strange business say the countess about lady byron when he be praise she mental and personal qualification i ask he how all that he now say agree with certain sarcasm suppose to be a reference to she in he work he smile shake he head and say they be mean to spite and vex she when he be wound and irritated at she refusing to receive or answer he letter that he be sorry he have write they but might on similar provocation recur to the same vengeance on another occasion he say lady b 's first idea be what be due to herself i wish she think a little more of what be due to other my besetting sin be a want of that self-respect which she have in excess when i have break out on slight provocation into one of my ungovernable fit of rage she calmness pique and seem to reproach I it give she a air of superiority that vex and increase my _ mauvaise humeur _ to lady blessington as to every one he always speak of mr leigh with the same unwavering admiration love and respect my first impression be melancholy -- my poor mother give they : but to my sister who incapable of wrong herself suspect no wrong in other i owe the little good of which i can boast : and have i earlier know she it might have influence my destiny augusta be to I in the hour of need a tower of strength she affection be my last rallying-point and be now the only bright spot that the horizon of england offer to my view she have give I such good advice -- and yet find I incapable of follow it love and pity I but the more because i be err similarly in the height of he spleen write leigh hunt -- i believe there do exist one person to whom he would have be generous if she please : perhaps be so at all event he leave she the bulk of he property and always speak of she with the greatest esteem this be he sister mr leigh he tell I she use to call he ` baby byron ' it be easy to see that of the two person she have by far the greater judgment byron have lay aside _ don juan _ for more than a year in deference to la guicciolus be permit to resume it again in July 1822 on a promise to observe the propriety canto vi-xi be write at pisa canto xii-xvi at genoa in 1823 these latter portion of the poem be publish by john hunt he other work of the period be of minor consequence the _ age of bronze _ be a declamation rather than a satire direct against the convention of cintra and the congress of verona especially lord londonderry 's part in the latter only remarkable from its advice to the greek to dread -- the false friend worse than the infuriate foe ie to prefer the claw of the tartar savage to the paternal hug of the great bear -- better still toil for master than await the slave of slave before a russian gate in the _ island _ -- a tale of the mutiny of the bounty -- he revert to the manner and theme of he old romance find a new scene in the pacific for the exercise of he fancy in this piece he love of nautical adventure reappear and he idealization of primitive life catch from rousseau and chateaubriand there be more repose about this poem than in any of the author 's other composition in its page the sea seem to plash about rock and cave that bask under a southern sun ` byron the sorcerer ' he can do with I what he will say old dr parr on read it as the swan-song of the poet 's sentimental verse it have a please if not pathetic calm during the last year in italy he plan a epic on the conquest and a play on the subject of hannibal neither of which be execute in the criticism of a famous work there be often little leave to do but to criticise the critic -- to bring to a focus the most salient thing that have be say about it to eliminate the absurd from the sensible the discriminate from the commonplace _ don juan _ more than any of its precursor _ be _ byron and it have be similarly handle the early canto be usher into the world amid a chorus of mingled applause and execration the minor review represent middle-class respectability be generally vituperative and the higher authority divide in they judgment the _ british magazine _ say that he lordship have degrade he personal character by the composition the _ london _ that the poem be a satire on decency the _ edinburgh monthly _ that it be a melancholy spectacle the _ eclectic _ that it be a outrage worthy of detestation _ blackwood _ declare that the author be brutally outrage all the best feeling of humanity moore characterize it as the most painful display of the versatility of genius that have ever be leave for succeed age to wonder at or deplore jeffrey find in the whole composition a tendency to destroy all belief in the reality of virtue and dr john watkin classically name it the odyssey of immorality _ don juan _ will be read write one critic as long as satire wit mirth and supreme excellence shall be esteem among man stick to _ don juan _ exhort another it be the only sincere thing you have write and it will live after all you _ harold _ have cease to be ' a schoolgirl 's tale the wonder of a hour ' it be the best of all you work -- the most spirited the most straightforward the most interesting the most poetical it be a work say goethe full of soul bitterly savage in its misanthropy exquisitely delicate in its tenderness shelley confess it fulfil in a certain degree what i have long preach the task of produce something wholly new and relative to the age and yet surpassingly beautiful and sir walter scott in the midst of a hearty panegyric : it have the variety of shakespeare himself neither _ childe harold _ nor the most beautiful of byron 's earlier tale contain more exquisite poetry than be to be find scatter through the canto of _ don juan _ amidst verse which the author seem to have throw from he with a effort as spontaneous as that of a tree resign its leaf one noticeable feature about these comment be they sincerity : review however occasionally one-sided have not then sink to be the mere register of adverse or friendly clique and with all he anxiety for its verdict byron never solicit the favor of any portion of the press another be the fact that the adverse critic miss they mark they have not learn to say of a book of which they disapprove that it be weak or dull : in pronounce it to be vicious they help to promote its sale and the most decry have be the most widely read of the author 's work many of the reader of _ don juan _ have it must be confess be find among those least likely to admire in it what be most admirable -- who have be attract by the very excess of buffoonery violation of good taste and occasionally almost vulgar slang which disfigure its page they patronage be at the best of no more value than that of a mob gather by a showy shakespearian revival and it have lay the volume open to the charge of be adapt laudarus ab illaudati but the welcome of the work in other quarter be as indubitably duo to higher quality in write _ don juan _ byron attempt something that have never be do before and he genius so chime with he enterprise that it need never be do again down cry m chasle with the imitator who do they host to make he name ridiculous in comment on they failure a athenaeum critic have explain the pre-established fitness of the ottava rima -- the first six line of which be a dance and the conclude couplet a breakdown -- for the mock-heroic byron 's choice of this measure may have be suggest by whistlecraft but he have study its cadence in pulcus and the _ novella galantus _ of castus to whom he be indebted for other feature of he satire and he add to what have be well term its characteristic jauntiness by he almost constant use of the double rhyme that the ottava rima be out of place in consistently pathetic poetry may be see from its obvious misuse in keat 's _ pot of basil _ many writer from tennant and frere to moultrie have employ it in burlesque or more society verse but byron alone have employ it triumphantly for he have make it the vehicle of thought grave as well as gay of black spirit and white red spirit and gray of sparkling fancy bitter sarcasm and tender memory he have sweep into the page of he poem the experience of thirty year of a life so crowd with vitality that we sense of the plethora of power which it exhibit make we ready to condone its lapse byron it have be say balance himself on a ladder like other acrobat but alone like the japanese master of the art he all the while bear on he shoulder the weight of a man much of _ don juan _ be as obnoxious to criticism in detail as he earlier work it have every mark of be write in hot haste in the midst of the most serious passage -lrb- eg the ave marium -rrb- we be check in we course by bathos or commonplace and throw where the writer do not mean to throw we : but the mock spirit be so prevailingly present that we be often leave in doubt as to he design and what be in _ harold _ a outrage be in this case only a flaw he command over the verse itself be almost miraculous : he glide from extreme to extreme from pun to pathos from melancholy to mad merriment sighing or laughing by the way at he reader or at himself or at the stanza into they he can fling anything under the sun from a doctor 's prescription to a metaphysical theory when bishop berkeley say there be no matter and prove it 'twa no matter what he say be as cogent a refutation of idealism as the cumbrous wit of scotch logician the popularity of the work be due not mainly to the verbal skill which make it rank as the _ cleverest _ of english verse composition to its shoal of witticism its winged word tell phrase and incomparable transition but to the fact that it continue to address a large class who be not in the ordinary sense of the word lover of poetry _ don juan _ be emphatically the poem of intelligent man of middle age who have grow weary of mere sentiment and yet retain enough of sympathetic feeling to desire at time to recall it such mind crust like plato 's glaucus with the world be yet pervious to appeal to the spirit that survive beneath the dry dust amid which they move but only at rare interval can they accompany the pure lyrist singing as if he would never be old and they be apt to turn with some impatience even from _ romeo and juliet _ to _ hamlet _ and _ macbeth _ to they on the other hand the hard wit of _ hudibra _ be equally tiresome and more distasteful they choose friend be the humourist who inspire by a subtle perception of the contradiction of life see matter for smile in sorrow and tear in laughter byron be not in the highest sense a great humourist he do not blend together the two phase as they be blended in single sentence or whole chapter of sterne in the april-sunshine of richter or in _ sartor resartus _ but he come near to produce the same effect by he unequalled power of alternate they he wit be seldom hard never dry for it be moisten by the constant juxtaposition of sentiment he tenderness be none the less genuine that he be perpetually jerk it away -- a equally favorite fashion with carlyle -- as if he could not trust himself to be serious for fear of become sentimental and in recollection of he frequent exhibition of unaffected hysteria we accept he own confession -- if i laugh at any mortal thing ` tis that i may not weep as a perfectly sincere comment on the most sincere and therefore in many respects the most effective of he work he have after he way endeavor in grave prose and light verse to defend it against its assailant say in _ don juan _ i take a vicious and unprincipled character and lead he through those rank of society whose accomplishment cover and cloak they vice and paint the natural effect and elsewhere that he mean to make he scamp end as a member of the society for the suppression of vice or by the guillotine or in a unhappy marriage it be easy to dilate on the fact that in interpret the phrase of the satirist into the language of the moralist we often require to read they backwards : byron 's own statement i hate a motive be however more to the point : but the fact be that i have nothing plann would unless it be to be a moment merry -- a novel word in my vocabulary _ don juan _ can only be credit with a text in the sense in which every large experience of its own accord convey its lesson it be to the author a picture of the world as he see it and it be to we a mirror in which every attribute of he genius every peculiarity of he nature be reflect without distortion after the audacious though brilliant opening and the unfortunately pungent reference to the poet 's domestic affair we find in the famous storm -lrb- c ii -rrb- a bewildering epitome of he prevail manner home-sickness sea-sickness the terror of the tempest wail blasphemy devotion the crash of the wreck the wild farewell the bubble cry of some strong swimmer in he agony the horror of famine the tale of the two father the beautiful apparition of the rainbow and the bird the feast on juan 's spaniel he reluctance to dine on he pastor and he master the consequence of eat pedrillo -- all follow each other like vision in the phantasmagoria of a nightmare till at last the remnant of the crew be drown by a ridiculous rhyme -- find no place for they landing better they run the boat ashore -- and overset she then come the episode of haidee a long low island song of ancient day the character of the girl herself be like a thread of pure gold run through the fabric of its surroundings motley in every page eg after the impassioned close of the isle of greece we have the stanza : -- thus sing or would or could or should have sing the modern greek in tolerable verse if not like orpheus quite when greece be young yet in those day he might have do much worse -- with which the author dash away the romance of the song and then launch into a tirade against bob southey 's epic and wordsworth 's pedlar poem this vein exhaust we come to the ave marium one of the most musical and seemingly heartfelt hymn in the language the close of the ocean pastoral -lrb- in c iv -rrb- be the last of pathetic narrative in the book but the same feeling that mourn o'er the beauty of the cyclade often re-emerge in shorter passage the fifth and sixth canto in spite of the glitter sketch of gulbeyaz and tho fawn-like image of dud be open to the charge of diffuseness and the character of johnson be a failure from the seventh to the tenth the poem decidedly dip partly because the writer have never be in russium then it again rise and show no sign of fall off to the end no part of the work have more suggestive interest or varied power than some of the later canto in which juan be whirl through the vortex of the fashionable life which byron know so well love so much and at last esteem so little there be no

original of imaginary portrait be generally futile but miss millpond -- not donna inez -- be obviously lady byron in adeline we may suspect that at genoa he be draw from the life in the villa paradiso while aurora raby seem to be a idealization of la guicciolus : -- early in year and yet more infantine in figure she have something of sublime in eye which sadly shine as seraph ' shine : all youth -- but with a aspect beyond time radiant and grave -- we pity man 's decline mournful -- but mournful of another 's crime she look would as if she sit by eden 's door and grieve for those who could return no more she be a catholic too sincere austere as far as she own gentle heart allow would and deem would that fall worship far more dear perhaps because 'twa fall : she sire be proud of deed and day when they have fill would the ear of nation and have never bent or bow would to novel power and as she be the last she hold she old faith and old feeling fast she gaze upon a world she scarcely know as seek not to know it silent lone as grow a flower thus quietly she grow and keep she heart serene within its zone constantly towards the close of the work there be a echo of home and country a half involuntary cry after -- the love of higher thing and better day th ` unbounded hope and heavenly ignorance of what be call have the world and the world 's way in the conclude stanza of the last complete canto beginning -- between two world life hover like a star ` twixt night and morn on the horizon 's verge -- we have a condensation of the refrain of the poet 's philosophy but the main drift of the later book be a satire on london society there be element in a great city which may be work into something nobler than satire for all the energy of the age be concentrate where passion be fiercest and think intensest amid the myriad sight and sound of its glare and gloom but those scene and the actor in they be apt also to induce the frame of mind in which a prose satirist describe himself as recline under a arcade of the pantheon : not the pantheon by the piazza navona where the immortal god be worship -- the immortal god now dead but the pantheon in oxford street have not

player -- then play out the play it be the natural conclusion of the foregone stage of byron 's career year have give he power but they be year in which he energy be largely waste self-indulgence have not petrified he feeling but it have throw wormwood into its spring he have learn to look on existence as a walk shadow and be strong only with the strength of a sincere despair through life 's road so dim and dirty i have dragg have to three and thirty what have those year leave to I nothing except thirty-three these line be the summary of one who have drain the draught of pleasure to the dregs of bitterness chapter x 1821-1824 politics -- the carbonarus -- expedition to greece -- death in leave venice for ravenna byron pass from the society of gondolier and successive sultana to a comparatively domestic life with a mistress who at least endeavor to stimulate some of he higher aspiration and smile upon he wear the sword along with the lyre in the last episode of he constantly chequered and too voluptuous career we have the waking of sardanapalus realize in the transmutation of the fantastical harold into a practical strategist financier and soldier no one ever live who in the same space more thoroughly run the gauntlet of existence have exhaust all other source of vitality and intoxication -- travel gallantry and verse -- it remain for the despairing poet to become a hero but he be also move by a public passion the genuineness of which there be no reasonable ground to doubt like alfierus and rousseau he have take for he motto i be of the opposition and as dante under a republic call for a monarchy byron under monarchy at home and abroad call for a commonwealth amid the inconsistency of he political sentiment he have be consistent in so much love of liberty as lead he to denounce oppression even when he have no great faith in the oppress -- whether english or italian or greek byron regard the established dynasty of the continent with a sincere hatred he talk of the more than infernal tyranny of the house of austrium to he fancy as to shelley 's new england be the star of the future attract by a strength or rather force of character akin to he own he worship napoleon even when drive to confess that the hero have sink into a king he lament he overthrow but above all that he be beat by three stupid legitimate old dynasty booby of regular sovereign i

a republic look in the history of the earth -- rome greece venice holland france america we too short commonwealth -- and compare it with what they do under master he serious political verse be all in the strain of the line on wellington -- never have mortal man such opportunity -- except napoleon -- or abuse it more you might have free fall europe from the unity of tyrant and be bless from shore to shore a enthusiasm for italy which survive many disappointment dictate some of the most impressive passage of he _ harold _ and inspire the _ lament of tasso _ and the _ ode on venice _ the _ prophecy of dante _ contain much that have since prove prophetic -- what be there want then to set thee free and show thy beauty in its fullest light to make the alp impassable and we she son may do this with one deed -- _ unite _ he letter reiterate the same idea in language even more emphatic it be no great matter suppose that italy could be liberate who or what be sacrifice it be a grand object -- the very poetry of politics only think -- a free italy byron act on he assertion that a man ought to do more for society than write verse mistrust its leader and detest the wretched lazzaronus who would have betray themselves and all the world he yet throw himself heart and soul into the insurrection of 1820 say whatever i can do by money mean or person i will venture freely for they freedom he join the secret society of the carbonarus write a address to the liberal government set up in naple supply arm and a refuge in he house which he be prepare to convert into a fortress in February 1821 on the rout of the neapolitan by the austrian the conspiracy be crushed byron who have always a idea that it would be bungle express he fear that the country would be throw back for 500 year into barbarism and the countess guicciolus confess with tear that the italian must return to compose and strum operatic air carbonarism have collapse it of course make way for a reaction but the encouragement and countenance of the english poet and peer help to keep alive the smoulder fire that mazzinus fan into a flame till cavor turn it to a practical purpose and the dream of the idealist of 1820 be finally realize on the failure of the luckless conspiracy byron naturally betook himself to history speculation satire and idea of a journalistic propaganda but all through he mind be turn to the renewal of the action which be he destiny if i live ten year longer he write in 1822 you will see that it be not all over with I i do not mean in literature for that be nothing -- and i do not think it be my vocation but i shall do something the greek war of liberation open a new field for the exercise of he indomitable energy this romantic struggle begin in April 1821 be carry on for two year with such remarkable success that at the close of 1822 greece be begin to be recognize as a independent state but in the follow month the tide seem to turn dissension break out among the leader the spirit of intrigue seem to stifle patriotism and the energy of the insurgent be hamper for want of the sinew of war there be a danger of the movement be starve out and the committee of london sympathizer -- of which the poet 's intimate friend and frequent correspondent mr dougla kinnaird and captain blaquire be lead promoter -- be impressed with the necessity of procure fund in support of the cause with a view to this it seem of consequence to attach to it some shine name and man 's thought almost inevitably turn to byron no other englishman seem so fit to be associate with the enterprise as the warlike poet who have twelve year before link he fame to that of gray marathon and athena 's tower and more recently immortalize the isle on which he cast so many a longing glance hobhouse break the subject to he early in the spring of 1823 : the committee open communication in April after hesitate through may in June byron consent to meet blaquire at zante and on hear the result of the captain 's expedition to the morea to decide on future step he share in this enterprise have be assign to purely personal and comparatively mean motive he be it be say disgust with he periodical sick of he editor tire of he mistress and bent on any change from china to peru that would give he a new theater for display one grow weary of the perpetual half-truth of inveterate detraction it be grant that byron be restless vain imperious never do anything without a desire to shine in the do of it and be to a great degree the slave of circumstance have the _ liberal _ prove a lamp to the nation instead of a mere red flag flaunt in the face of john bull he might have cast anchor at genoa but the whole drift of he work and life demonstrate that he be capable on occasion of merge himself in what he conceive to be great cause especially in they evil day of the hunt he may have have enough but the invidious statement about la guicciolus have no foundation other than a somewhat random remark of shelley and the fact that he leave she nothing in he will it be distinctly ascertain that she expressly prohibit he from do so they continue to correspond to the last and she affectionate though unreadable reminiscence be sufficient proof that she at no time consider herself to be neglect injured or aggrieved byron indeed leave italy in a unsettled state of mind : he speak of return in a few month and as the period for he departure approach become more and more irresolute a presentiment of he death seem to brood over a mind always superstitious though never fanatical shortly before he own departure the blessington be prepare to leave genoa for england on the evening of he farewell call he begin to speak of he voyage with despondency say here we be all now together but when and where shall we meet again i have a sort of bode that we see each other for the last time as something tell I i shall never again return from greece : after which remark he lean he head on the sofa and burst into one of he hysterical fit of tear the next week be give to preparation for a expedition which enter on with mingled motive -- sentimental personal public -- become more real and earnest to byron at every step he take he know all the vice of the hereditary bondsman among whom he be go and go among they with yet unquenched aspiration but with the bridle of discipline in he hand resolve to pave the way towards the nation become better by devote himself to make it free on the morning of July 14th -lrb- 1823 -rrb- he embark in the brig hercule with trelawny count pietro gamba who remain with he to the last bruno a young italian doctor scott the captain of the vessel and eight servant include fletcher besides the crew they have on board two gun with other arm and ammunition five horse a ample supply of medicine with 50000 spanish dollar in coin and bill the start be inauspicious a violent squall drive they back to port and in the course of a last ride with gamba to albaro byron ask where shall we be in a year on the same day of the same month of 1824 he be carry to the tomb of he ancestor they again set sail on the follow evening and in five day reach leghorn where the poet receive a salutation in verse address to he by goethe and reply to it here mr hamilton brown a scotch gentleman with considerable knowledge of greek affair join the party and induce they to change they course to cephalonium for the purpose of obtain the advice and assistance of the english resident colonel napier the poet occupy himself during the voyage mainly in reading -- among other book scott 's _ life of swift _ grimm 's _ correspondence _ la rochefoucauld and las casas -- and watch the classic or historic shore which they skirt especially note elba soracte the strait of messina and etna in pass strombolus he say to trelawny you will see this scene in a fifth canto of _ childe harold _ on he companion suggest that he should write some verse on the spot he try to do so but throw they away with the remark i can not write poetry at will as you smoke tobacco trelawny confess that he be never on shipboard with a better companion and that a severer test of good fellowship it be impossible to apply together they shoot at gull or empty bottle and swam every morning in the sea early in August they reach they destination come in sight of the morea the poet say to trelawny i feel as if the eleven long year of bitterness i have pass through since i be here be take from my shoulder and i be scud through the greek archipelago with old bathurst in he frigate byron remain at or about cephalonium till the close of the year not long after he arrival he make a excursion to ithaca and visit the monastery at vathus be receive by the abbot with great ceremony which in a fit of irritation bring on by a tiresome ride on a mule he return with unusual discourtesy but next morning on he give a donation to they alms-box he be dismiss with the blessing of the monk if this isle be mine he declare on he way back i would break my staff and bury my book a little later brown and trelawny be send off with letter to the provisional government the former return with some greek emissary to london to negotiate a loan the latter attach himself to odysseus the chief of the republican party at athen and never again see byron alive the poet after spend a month on board the hercule dismiss the vessel and hire a house for gamba and himself at metaxata a healthy village about four mile from the capital of the island meanwhile blaquire neglect he appointment at zante have go to corfu and thence to england colonel napier be absent from cephalonium byron have some pleasant social intercourse with he deputy but unable to get from he any authoritative information be leave without advice to be besiege by letter and message from the faction among these there be bring to he hint that the greek want a king and he be report to have say if they make I the offer i will perhaps not reject it the position would doubtless have be acceptable to a man who never -- amid he many self-deception -- affect to deny that he be ambitious : and who can say what might not have result for greece have the poet live to add lustre to she crown in the meantime while fare more frugally than a day-labourer he yet surround himself with a show of royal state have he servant arm with gilt helmet and gather around he a body-guard of suliote these wild mercenary become turbulent he be oblige to despatch they to mesolonghus then threaten with siege by the turk and anxiously wait relief during he residence at cephalonium byron be gratify by the interest evince in he by the english resident among these the physician dr kennedy a worthy scotchman who imagine himself to be a theologian with a genius for conversion be conduct a series of religious meeting at argostolus when the poet express a wish to be present at one of they after listen it be say to a set of discourse that occupy the greater part of twelve hour he seem for one reason or another to have feel call on to enter the list and find himself involve in the series of controversial dialogue afterwards publish in a substantial book this volume interesting in several respects be one of the most charming example of unconscious irony in the language and it be matter of regret that we space do not admit of the abridgment of several of its page they bear testimony on the one hand to byron 's capability of patience and frequent sweetness of temper under trial on the other to kennedy 's utter want of humor and to he courageous honesty the curiously confront interlocutor in the course of the missionary and subsequent private meeting run over most of the ground debate between opponent and apologist of the calvinistic faith which kennedy uphold without stint the _ conversation _ add little to what we already know of byron 's religious opinion nor be it easy to say where he cease to be serious and begin to banter or vice versa he evidently wish to show that in argument he be good at fence and could handle a theologian as skilfully as a foil at the same time he wish if possible though as appear in vain to get some light on a subject with regard to which in he graver mood he be often exercise on some point he be explicit he make a unequivocal protest against the doctrine of eternal punishment and infant damnation say that if the rest of mankind be to be damned he would rather keep they company than creep into heaven alone on question of inspiration and the deeper problem of human life he be less distinct be naturally incline to a speculative necessitarianism and disposed to admit original depravity but he do not see he way out of the maze through the atonement and hold that prayer have only significance as a devotional affection of the heart byron show a remarkable familiarity with the scripture and with part of barrow chillingworth and stillingfleet but on kennedy 's lending for he edification boston 's _ fourfold state _ he return it with the remark that it be too deep for he on another occasion he say do you know i be nearly reconcile to st paul for he say there be no difference between the jew and the greek and i be exactly of the same opinion for the character of both be equally vile the good scotchman 's religious self-confidence be throughout free from intellectual pride and he own confession this time i suspect he lordship have the best of it might perhaps be apply to the whole discussion critic who have little history and less war have be accustom to attribute byron 's linger at cephalonium to indolence and indecision they write as if he ought on landing on greek soil to have put himself at the head of a army and storm constantinople those who know more confess that the delay be deliberate and that it be judicious the hellenic uprising be animated by the spirit of a lion after slumber but it have the head of a hydra hiss and tear at one another the chief who defend the country by they arm compromise she by they argument and some of she best fighter be little better than pirate and bandit greece be a prey to

first two year of success they be hold in embryo during the later year of disaster terminate by the ally at navarino they be bury during the interlude of byron 's residence when the foe be like hound in the leash wait for a renewal of the struggle they be rampant have he join any one of they he would have degrade himself to the level of a mere condottiere and help to betray the common cause beset by solicitation to go to athen to the morea to acarnanium he resolutely hold apart bide he time collect information make himself know as a man of affair endeavor to conciliate rival clamant for

spite of medical warning a few day later ie December 28th he embark in a small fast-sailing sloop call a mistico while the servant and baggage be stow in another and larger vessel under the charge of count gamba from gamba 's graphic account of the voyage we may take the following : -- we sail together till after ten at night the wind favourable a clear sky the air fresh but not sharp we sailor sing alternately patriotic song monotonous indeed but to person in we situation extremely touching and we take part in they we be all but lord byron particularly in excellent spirit the mistico sail the fastest when the wave divide we and we voice could no longer reach each other we make signal by firing pistol and carbine to-morrow we meet at mesolonghus -- to morrow thus full of confidence and

the good sense of mavrocordato propose to make cartridge of the tract and small shot of the type he do not think that the turbulent tribe be ripe for freedom of the press and have begin to regard republicanism itself as a matter of secondary moment the disputant ally in the common cause occupy each a flat of the same small house the soldier by profession be bent on write the turk down the poet on fight they down hold that the work of the sword must precede that of the pen and that camp must be the training school of freedom they altercation be sometimes fierce -- despot cry stanhope after profess liberal principle from boyhood you when call to act prove yourself a turk radical retorted byron if i have hold up my finger i could have crush you press -- but this do not prevent the recognition by each of they of the excellent quality of the other ultimately stanhope go to athen and ally himself with trelawny and odysseus and the party of the left nothing can be more statesmanlike than some of byron 's papers of this and the immediately preceding period nothing more admirable than the spirit which inspire they he have come into the heart of a revolution expose to

paper the _ telegrapho _ and disparage dr mayor its swiss editor say of all petty tyrant he be one of the pettiest as be most demagogue byron have none of the sclavonic leaning and almost personal hatred of ottoman rule of some of we statesman but he see on what side lay the force and the hope of the future i can not calculate he say to gamba during one of they latest ride together to what a height greece may rise hitherto it have be a subject for the hymn and elegy of fanatic and enthusiast but now it will draw the attention of the politician at present there be little difference in many respects between greek and turk nor could there be but the latter must in the common course of event decline in power and the former must as inevitably become better the english government deceive itself at first in think it possible to maintain the turkish empire in its integrity but it can not be do that unwieldy mass be already putrify and must dissolve if anything like a equilibrium be to

be headless she city contend for the body as of old for the birth of a poet athen wish he to rest in the temple of theseus the funeral service be perform at mesolonghus but on the 2nd of may the embalmed remain left zante and on the 29th arrive in the downs he relative apply for permission to have they inter in westminster abbey but it be refuse and on the 16th July they be convey to the village church of hucknall chapter xi characteristic and place in literature lord jeffrey at the close of a once-famous review quaintly lament : the tuneful quarto of southey be already little better than lumber and the rich melody of keat and shelley and the fantastical emphasis of wordsworth and the plebeian pathos of crabbe be melting fast from the field of we vision the novel of scott have put out he poetry and the blaze star of byron himself be recede from its place of pride of the poet of the early part of this century lord john russell think byron the greatest then scott then moore such a opinion write a _ national _ reviewer in 1860 be not worth a refutation we only smile at it nothing in the history of literature be more curious than the shift of the standard of excellence which so perplex criticism but the most remarkable feature of the matter be the frequent return to power of the once discard potentate byron be resume he place : he spirit have come again to we atmosphere and every bud critic as in 1820 be impel to pronounce a verdict on he genius and character the present time be in many respects a aftermath of the first quarter of the century which be a era of revolt of doubt of storm there succeed a era of exhaustion of quiescence of reflection the first year of the third quarter see a revival of turbulence and agitation and more than we father we be incline to sympathize with we grandfather macaulay have popularize the story of the change of literary dynasty which in we island mark the close of the last and the first two decade of the present hundred year the corresponding artistic revolt on the continent be closely connect with change in the political world the originator of the romantic literature in italy for the most part die in spielberg or in exile the same revolution which level the bastille and convert versaille and the trianon -- the classic school in stone and terrace -- into a moral herculaneum and pompeius drive the model of the so-called augustan age into a museum of antiquarian in we own country the movement initiate by chatterton cowper and burn be carry out by two class of great writer they agree in oppose freedom to formality in substitute for the old new aim and method in prefer a grain of mother wit to a peck of clerisy they break with the old school as protestantism break with the old church but like the sect they separate again wordsworth southey and coleridge while refuse to acknowledge the literary precedent of the past submit themselves to a self-imposed law the partiality of they maturity be towards thing settle and regulate they favorite virtue endurance and humility they conformity to established institution be the basis of a new conservatism the other be the radical of the movement : they practically acknowledge no law but they own inspiration dissatisfy with the exist order they sympathy be with strong will and passion and defiant independence these find they master-type in shelley and in byron a reaction be always a extreme lollard puritan covenanter be in some respects nauseous antidote to ecclesiastical corruption the ruin of the scotch cathedral and of the french nobility be warning at once against the excess that provoke and the excess that avenge the revolt against the _ ancien rgime _ in letter make possible the ode that be the high-tide mark of modern english inspiration but it be parody in page on page of maunder rusticity byron see the danger but be bear headlong by the rapid hence the anomalous contrast between he theory and he performance both wordsworth and byron be bite by rousseau but the former be at furthest a girondin the latter act like danton on the motto l'audace l'audace toujors l'audace sigh after _ henrus quatre et gabrille _ there be more of the spirit of the french revolution in _ don juan _ than in all the work of the author 's contemporary but he criticism be that of boileau and when deliberate be generally absurd he never recognize the meaning of the artistic movement of he age and overvalue those of he work which the unity help to destroy he hail gifford as he magnus apollo and put roger next to scott in he comical pyramid chaucer he write i think obscene and contemptible he could see no merit in spenser prefer tasso to milton and call the old english dramatist mad and turbid mountebank in the same spirit he write : in the time of pope it be all horace now it be all claudian he see -- what fanatic have begin to deny -- that pope be a great writer and the angel of reasonableness the strong common sense of both be a link between they but the expression he use during he controversy with bowle look like jest till we be convince of he earnestness by he anger neither time nor distance nor grief nor age can ever diminish my veneration for he who be the great moral poet of all time of all clime of all feeling and of all stage of existence you whole generation be not worth a canto of the _ dunciad _ or anything that be he all the while he be himself write prose and verse in grasp if not in vigor as far beyond the stretch of pope as pope be in worth and wit and sense remove above he mimic the point of the paradox be not merely that he desert but that he sometimes imitate he model and when he do so failed macaulay 's judgment that personal taste lead he to the eighteenth century thirst for praise to the nineteenth be quite at fault there can be no doubt that byron love praise as much as he affect to despise it he note on read the _ quarterly _ on he drama i be the most unpopular man in england be like the cry of a child under chastisement but he have little affinity moral or artistic with the spirit of we so-called augustan and he determination to admire they be itself rebellious again we be remind of he phrase i be of the opposition he vanity and pride be perpetually struggle for the mastery and though he thirst for popularity he be bent on compelling it so he war with the literary impulse of which he be the child byron have no relation to the master-mind whose work reflect a nation or a era and who keep they own secret he verse and prose be alike biographical and the inequality of he style be those of he career he live in a glass case and could not hide himself by he habit of burn blue light he be too great to do violence to he nature which be not great enough to be really consistent it be thus natural for he to pose as the spokesman of two age -- as a critic and as a author and of two order of society -- as a peer and as a poet of revolt sincere in both he could never forget the one character in the other to the last he be a aristocrat in sentiment a democrat in opinion vulgarity he write with a pithy half-truth be far worse than downright black guardism for the latter comprehend wit humor and strong sense at time while the former be a sad abortive attempt at all thing signify nothing he could never reconcile himself to the english radical and it have be acutely remark that part of he final interest in greece lay in the fact that he find it a country of classic memory where a man might be the champion of liberty without soil himself in the arena he owe much of he early influence to the fact of he move in the circle of rank and fashion but though himself steep in the prejudice of caste he strike at they at time with fatal force aristocracy be the individual assert a vital distinction between itself and the muck o ' the world byron 's hero all rebel against the associative tendency of the nineteenth century they be self-worshipper at war with society but most of they come to bad end he malign himself in those caricature and have give more of himself in describe one whom with special significance we call a brother poet allen he write in 1813 have lend I a quantity of burn 's unpublished letter what a antithetical mind -- tenderness roughness -- delicacy coarseness -- sentiment sensuality -- soar and grovel -- dirt and deity -- all mix up in that one compound of inspired clay we have only to add to these antithesis in apply they with slight modification to the writer byron have on occasion more self-control than burn who yield to every thirst or gust and could never have live the life of the soldier at mesolonghus but partly owe to meanness partly to a sound instinct he memory have be more severely deal with the fact of he be a nobleman help to make he famous but it also help to make he hate no doubt it half spoil he in make he a show and the circumstance have suggest the remark of a humourist that it be as hard for a lord to be a perfect gentleman as for a camel to pass through the needle 's eye but it also expose to the rancor of jealousy a man who have nearly everything but domestic happiness to excite that most corroding of literary passion and when he get out of gear he become the quarry of spenser 's blatant beast on the other hand burn be beneath he disgust at holy fair and willie sincerely reverential much of _ don juan _ would have seem to he a atheist 's laugh and -- a more certain superiority -- he be absolutely frank byron like pope be give to play monkey-like trick mostly harmless but offensive to they victim he peace of mind be dependent on what people would say of he to a degree unusual even in the irritable race and when they speak ill he be again like pope essentially vindictive the _ bard and reviewer _ beat about where the line to atticus transfix with philoctete ' arrow but they be due to a like impulse byron affect to contemn the world but say what he would he care too much for it he have a genuine love of solitude as a alterative but he could not subsist without society and shelley tell we wherever he go become the nucleus of it he spring up again when fling to the earth but he never attain to the disdain he desire we find he at once munificent and careful about money calmly asleep amid a crowd of tremble sailor yet never go to ride without a nervous caution defy augury yet seriously disturb by a gipsy 's prattle he could be the most genial of comrade the most considerate of master and he secure the devotion of he servant as of he friend but he be too overbearing to form many equal friendship and apt to be ungenerous to he real rival he shift attitude towards lady byron he wavering purpose he impulsive act be a part of the character we trace through all he life and work -- a strange mixture of magnanimity and brutality of laughter and tear consistent in nothing but he passion and he pride yet redeeming all he defect by he grace and wear a greatness that he error can only half obscure alternately the idol and the horror of he contemporary byron be during he life fear and respect as the grand napoleon of the realm of rhyme he work be the event of the literary world the chief among they be translate into french german italian danish polish russian spanish on the publication of moore 's _ life _ lord macaulay have no hesitation in refer to byron as the most celebrated englishman of the nineteenth century nor have we now but in the interval between 1840-1870 it be the fashion to talk of he as a sentimentalist a romancer a shallow wit a nine day ' wonder a poet for green unknowing youth it be a reaction such as lead we to disestablish the hero of we crude imagination till we learn that to admire nothing be as sure a sign of immaturity as to admire everything the weariness if not disgust induce by a throng of more than usually absurd imitator enable carlyle the poet 's successor in literary influence -lrb- follow with even greater unfairness by thackeray -rrb- more effectively to lead the counter-revolt in my mind write the former in 1839 byron have be sink at a accelerate rate for the last ten year and have now reach a very low level he fame have be very great but i do not see how it be to endure neither do that make he great no genuine productive thought be ever reveal by he to mankind he teach I nothing that i have not again to forget the refrain of carlyle 's advice during the most active year of he criticism be close thy byron open thy goethe we do so and find that the refrain of goethe 's advice in reference to byron be -- nocturn versate manu versate diurn he urge eckermann to study english that he might read he remark a character of such eminence have never exist before and probably will never come again the beauty of _ cain _ be such as we shall not see a second time in the world byron issue from the sea-waves ever fresh in _ helena _ i could not make use of any man as the representative of the modern poetic era except he who be undoubtedly the greatest genius -lrb- 1 -rrb- of we century again : tasso 's epic have maintain its fame but byron be the burning bush which reduce the cedar of lebanon to ash the english may think of he as they please this be certain they can show no -lrb- living -rrb- poet who be comparable to he but he be too worldly contrast _ macbeth _ and _ beppo _ where you be in a nefarious empirical world on eckermann 's doubt whether there be a gain for pure culture in byron 's work goethe conclusively reply there i must contradict you the audacity and grandeur of byron must certainly tend towards culture we should take care not to be always look for it in the decidedly pure and moral everything that be great promote cultivation as soon as we be aware of it -lrb- footnote 1 : mr arnold wrongly object to this translation of the german talent -rrb- this verdict of the olympian as against the verdict of the titan be interesting in itself and as be the verdict of the whole continental world of letter what exclaim castelar do spain not owe to byron from he mouth come we hope and fear he have baptize we with he blood there be no one with whose be some song of he be not weave he life be like a funeral torch over we grave mazzinus take up the same tune for italy stendhal speak of byron 's apollonic power and sainte beuve write to the same intent with some judicious caveat m taine conclude he survey of the romantic movement with the remark : in this splendid effort the greatest be exhaust one alone -- byron -- attain the summit he be so great and so english that from he alone we shall learn more truth of he country and he age than from all the rest together dr elze rank the author of _ harold _ and _ juan _ among the four greatest english poet and claim for he the intellectual parentage of lamartine and musset in france of espronceda in spain of puschkin in russium with some modification of heine in germany of berchet and other in italy so many voice of so various country can not be simply set aside : unless we wrap ourselves in a insolent insularism we be bind at least to ask what be the meaning of they concurrent testimony foreign judgment can manifestly have little weight on matter of form and not one of the above-mentioned critic be sufficiently alive to the egregious shortcoming which byron himself recognize that he lose almost nothing by translation be a compliment to the man a disparagement to tho artist very few page of he verse even aspire to perfection hardly a stanza will bear the minute word-by-word dissection which only bring into clearer view the delicate touch of keat or tennyson he picture with a big brush be never mean for the microscope here the contrast between he theoretic worship of he idol and he own practice reach a climax if as he profess to believe the best poet be he who best execute he work then he be hardly a poet at all he be habitually rapid and slovenly a improvisatore on the spot whore he fancy be kindle write _ currente calamo _ and disdain the art to blot i can never recast anything i be like the tiger if i miss the first spring i go grumble back to my jungle he say to medwin blank verse be the most difficult because every line must be good consequently he own blank verse be always defective -- sometimes execrable no one else -- except perhaps wordsworth -- who could write so well could also write so ill this fact in byron 's case seem due not to mere carelessness but to incapacity something seem to stand behind he like the slave in the chariot to check the current of he highest think the glow of he fancy fade with the suddenness of a southern sunset he best inspiration be spoil by the interruption of incongruous commonplace he have none of the guardian delicacy of taste or the thirst after completeness which mark the consummate artist he be more nearly a dwarf shakespeare than a giant popo this defect be most mischievous where he be weakest in he drama and he lyric least so where he be strongest in he mature satire it be almost transmute into a excellence in the greatest of these which be by design and in detail a temple of incongruity if we turn from he manner to he matter we can not claim for byron any absolute originality he source have be find in rousseau voltaire chateaubriand beaumarchai lauzun gibbon bayle st pierre alfierus castus cuvier la bruyore wieland swift sterne le sage goethe scrap of the classic and the book of job absolute originality in a late age be only possible to the hermit the lunatic or the sensation novelist byron like the rover before mino be not ashamed of he piracy he transfer the random prose of he own letter and journal to he drama and with the same complacency make use of the note jot down from other writer as he sail on the lake of geneva but he make they he own by smelt the rough ore into bell metal he brew a cauldron like that of macbeth 's witch and from it arise the image of crown king if he do not bring a new idea into the world he quadruple the force of exist idea and scatter they far and wide southern critic have maintain that he have a southern nature and be in he true element on the lido or under a andalusian night other dwell on the english pride that go along with he italian habit and greek sympathy the truth be he have the power of make himself poetically everywhere at home and this along with the fact of all he writings be perfectly intelligible be the secret of he european influence he be a citizen of the world because he not only paint the environs but reflect the passion and aspiration of every scene amid which he dwell a disparage critic have say byron be nothing without he description the remark only emphasize the fact that he genius be not dramatic all non-dramatic art be concern with bring before we picture of the world the value of which lie half in they truth half in the amount of human interest with which they be invest to scientific accuracy few poet can lay claim and byron less than most but the general truth of he description be acknowledge by all who have travel in the same country the greek verse of he first pilgrimage -- eg the night scene on the gulf of arta many of the albanian sketch with much of the _ siege of corinth _ and the _ giaour _ -- have be invariably commend for they vivid realism attention have be especially direct to the line in the _ corsair _ beginning -- but lo from high hymettus to the plain as be the veritable voice of one spell-bound within the clustering cyclade the opening line of the same canto transplant from the _ curse of minerva _ be even more suggestive : -- slow sink more lovely ere he race be run along morea 's hill the setting sun not as in northern clime obscurely bright but one unclouded blaze of live light & c in the same way the later canto of _ harold _ be steep in switzerland and in italy byron 's genius it be true require a stimulus it could not have revel among the daisy of chaucer or pasture by the bank of the doon or the ouse or thriven among the lincolnshire fen he have a sincere if somewhat exclusive delight in the storm and crag that seem to respond to he nature and to he age there be no affectation in the expression of the wish o that the desert be my dwelling-place though we know that the writer on the shore of the mediterranean still crave for the gossip of the club it only show that -- two desire toss about the poet 's feverish blood one drive he to the world without and one to solitude of byron 's two contemporary rival wordsworth have no feverish blood nothing drive he to the world without consequently he eye avert they ken from half of human fate and he influence though perennial will always be limit he conquer england from he hill and lake but he spirit have never cross the strait which he think too narrow the other with a fever in he vein calm it in the sea and in the cloud and in some degree because of he very excellency have fail as yet to mark the world at large the poet ' poet the cynosure of enthusiast he bear the banner of the forlorn hope but byron with he foot of clay lead the rank shelley as pure a philanthropist as st franci or howard could forget mankind and like he adonas become one with nature byron who profess to hate he fellow be of they even more than for they and so appeal to they through a broader sympathy and hold they with a firmer hand by virtue of he passion as well as he power he be enable to represent the human tragedy in which he play so many part and to which he external universe of cloudless moon and vale of evergreen and lightning-riven peak be but the various background he set the anguish doubt desire the whole chaos of he age to a music whose thunder-roll seem to have inspire the opera of _ lohengrin _ -- a music not design to teach or to satisfy the budge doctor of the stoic fur but which will continue to arouse and delight the son and daughter of man madame de stal say to byron at ouchy it do not do to war with the world : the world be too strong for the individual goethe only give a more philosophic form to this counsel when he remark of the poet he put himself into a false position by he assault on church and state he discontent end in negation if i call _ bad _ bad what do i gain but if i call _ good _ bad i do mischief the answer be obvious : as long as man call _ bad _ good there be a call for iconoclast : half the reform of the world have begin in negation such comment also point to the common error of try to make man other than they be by lecture they this scion of a long line of lawless blood -- a scandinavian berserker if there ever be one -- the literary heir of the edda -- be specially create to wage that war -- to smite the conventionality which be the tyrant of england with the hammer of thor and to sear with the sarcasm of mephistophele the hollow hypocrisy -- sham taste sham moral sham religion -- of the society by which he be surround and infect and which all but succeed in seduce he but for the ethereal essence -- the fount of fiery life which serve for that titanic strife byron would have be merely a more melodious moore and a more accomplished brummell but the caged lion be only half tame and he continual growl be he redemption he restlessness be the sign of a yet unbroken will he fall and rise and fall again but never give up the struggle that keep alive if it do not save the soul he greatness as well as he weakness lay in the fact that from boyhood battle be the breath of he be to tell he not to fight be like tell wordsworth not to reflect or shelley not to sing he instrument be a trumpet of challenge and he live as he appropriately die in the progress of a unaccomplished campaign he work be neither perfect architecture nor fine mosaic but like that of he intellectual ancestor the elder elizabethan whom he perversely malign it be all animated by the spirit of action and of enterprise in good portrait he head have a lurid look as if it have be at a higher temperature than that of other man that high temperature be the source of he inspiration and the secret of a spell which during he life command homage and draw forth love mere artist be often mannikins byron 's brilliant though unequal genius be subordinate to the power of he personality he have the element so mix would in he that nature might stand up and say to all the world -- this be a man we may learn much from he still when we have
