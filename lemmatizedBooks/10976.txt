sun as it sink behind the golden cloud gleam in at the window of a cottage which stand in a pleasant lane about a quarter of a mile from the village of ryefield on each side of the narrow gravel walk that lead from the lane to the cottage-door be a little plot of cultivate ground that on the right hand be plant with cabbage onion and other useful vegetable that on the leave with gooseberry and currant-bush except one small strip where stock sweet-pea and rose-tree be grow whose flower for they be now in full bloom peeping over the neatly trim quick-hedge that fence the garden from the road have a gay and pretty appearance not a weed be to be find in any of the bed the gooseberry and currant-bush have evidently be prune with much care and attention and be load with fine ripe fruit but the most remarkable thing in the garden be a apricot-tree which grow against the wall of the cottage and which be cover with apricot of a large size and beautiful color the cottage itself though small and thatched with straw be clean and cheerful the brick floor be strew with sand and a white though coarse cloth be spread on the little deal table on this table be place tea-thing a loaf of bread and some watercress a cat be purr on the hearth and a kettle be boil on the fire near the window in a large arm-chair sit a old woman with a bible on she knee she appear happy and contented and she countenance express cheerfulness and good temper after read for some time with great attention she pause to look from the window into the lane as if expect to see some one she listen as if for a footstep but all be silent she read again for about ten minute longer and then close the sacred volume rise and have lay the book carefully on a shelf open the door and go out into the garden whence she could see farther into the lane and remain for a considerable time lean over the little wicket gate in anxious expectation what can be the reason that ned be so late she say half aloud to herself he always hasten home to he poor old grandmother as soon as he have do work what can make he a hour later than usual i hope nothing have happen to he but hush she continue after a few minute ' pause surely i hear he come now she be not mistake for in a minute or two ned appear run quite fast up the lane and in a few moment more he be stand by she side panting and breathless dear grandmother he exclaim as soon as he have recover breath enough to speak i have a great deal of good news to tell you farmer tomkyn say he will employ I all through the winter and pay I the same wages that he do now this be one piece of good news and the other be that mr stockwell the greengrocer will buy all my apricot and give I a good price for they i be to take they to he next market-day i have to wait more than half-an-hour before i could speak to he and that make I so late o how beautiful they be continue he gaze with admiration at the tree o grandmother how happy i be he grandmother smile and say she be glad to hear this good news and now come in and have you tea child she add for i be sure you must be hungry o grandmother say ned as they sit at tea now that mr stockwell will buy the fruit you will be able to have a cloak to keep you warm this winter it often use to grieve I last year to see you oblige to go to church such bitter cold weather with only that thin old shawl on i know you say you could not spare money to get a cloak for yourself because you have spend all you could save in buy I a jacket my tree have never bear fruit till this year and you always say that when it do i should do what i please with the money its fruit would fetch now there be nothing i should like to spend it on better than in get a cloak for you thank you ned reply he grandmother it would indeed be a very great comfort i do not think i should have suffer so much from rheumatism last winter if i have have warmer clothing if it be not for you apricot-tree i must have go without a cloak this winter also for what with we pig die and you have no work to do in the spring this have be but a bad year for we the money mr stockwell be go to give I resume ned will be enough all but sixpence and i have a new sixpence you know in a little box upstairs that my aunt give I last June when i go to spend the day with she so when i carry he the fruit i shall take that in my pocket and then when i come home in the evening i can bring the cloak with I o that will be a happy day continue ned get up to jump and clap he hand for joy there be another thing i be very glad of say he sit down again master be go to turn tom andrew away next week you ought not to be glad of that ned tom be one of a large family and he father be very poor it must be a great help to have one of he child earn something but he be ill-natured to I and often plague I very much it be only yesterday he break the best hoe by knock stone about with it and then tell master it be my do besides he be idle and do not mind what be say to he and often get into mischief and do you think be turn away from farmer tomkyn 's will help to cure these fault no answer ned i do not suppose it will on the contrary be it not likely that he will grow more idle and get oftener into mischief when he have no master to look after he and nothing to do all day long but play about the street why yes that be true still it will serve he right to be turn away i have hear mr harri we rector say that those who do wrong ought to be punish pray ned ask he grandmother can you tell I what be the use of punishment the use of punishment -- repeat ned thoughtfully let I think the use of punishment i believe be to make people better right now ned you have allow that tom 's be turn away be not likely to make he better but worse so that i be afraid the true reason why you rejoice at he disgrace be because you bear resentment against he for have be ill-natured to yourself think a minute and tell I if this be not the case ned own that he grandmother be right and then observe it be very difficult not to bear ill-will against any one who have do we wrong yet rejoin he grandmother it be we duty to pardon those who have injure we st paul say in he epistle to the ephesian ` be ye kind one to another tender heart forgiving one another even as god for christ 's sake have forgive you ' and we bless savior have command we to ` love we enemy ' to ` do good to they that hate we and to pray for those that despitefully use we and persecute we ' if you will look at the fourteenth and fifteenth verse of the sixth chapter of st matthew you will see what else we lord say on the subject ned take the bible and have find the place read for if ye forgive man they trespass you heavenly father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not man they trespass neither will you heavenly father forgive you trespass before you go to bed say he grandmother when he have finish reading i wish you to get by heart these three text and repeat they to I ned do as he be desire and then he grandmother kiss he and bid he good-night ned love he grandmother very much for she have always be kind to he he parent have both die when he be very young and she then bring he home to live with she and have take care of he ever since she teach he to read and write and cast up sum to be steady and industrious and above all it be she great care to instil into he mind religious principle she have often tell he that the way to profit by what we read as well as by the good advice that may be give we be to think upon it afterwards and she frequently desire he to make a practice of say over to himself every night whatever verse from the bible he have learn by heart during the day this evening when ned repeat he text he feel that he have be wrong to rejoice at tom andrew 's disgrace because he have behave ill to himself and he pray god to make tom see he fault and leave off he bad way the next day ned as usual go early to he work tom andrew be very teasing but ned try not to be provoke and when tom say ill-natured thing to he he check the angry reply he be tempt to make two day afterwards when ned come home to tea he think with pleasure that to-morrow be market-day at the town where mr stockwell live and he run in and out twenty time to look at and admire he beautiful apricot-tree i must get up very early indeed to-morrow morning he say to he grandmother that i may gather the apricot and take they to mr stockwell before i go to my work accordingly the next morning he rise as soon as it be light and take a basket the greengrocer have lend he in he hand go into the little garden to line it with fresh green leaf before put the fruit into it what be he surprise and sorrow when he see that every one of he apricot be go and the tree itself sawn nearly in two close to the root throw down he basket ned run to he grandmother who be just come down stair and have begin to light the fire he could only exclaim o my apricot my apricot they be all go and my beautiful tree -- then cover he face with he hand he burst into tear what be the matter my dear inquire he grandmother ned reply by take she by the hand and lead she into the garden who can have do this he exclaim sob if they have only steal the apricot i could have bear it better but to see my dear tree spoil -- it must die -- it must be quite kill -- only look how it be cut i be very sorry for you my poor boy say he grandmother kindly it be a most vexatious thing oh cry ned if i do but know who it be that have do it -- i would be revenge on they some how or other he be go to have add but the text which he have learn a few day before concern the forgiveness of injury and which he have frequently repeat to himself since come into he mind and he stop short on look round the garden to see if they could discover any trace of the thief ned and he grandmother see the print of a boy 's shoe rather bigger than ned 's in several of the bed and hang on the quick-hedge be some tattered fragment of a red cotton handkerchief check with white i know this handkerchief say ned it be tom andrew 's i have often see he with it tie round he neck it must be he who steal my apricot you can not be sure that it be tom who steal you apricot rejoin he grandmother many other people besides he have red handkerchief but i be sure it can be no one but tom for only yesterday when i tell he about my apricot and the money i expect to get for they he say he wish he know how to get some that he might have money too oh if i could but get hold of he -- again he stop and think of we savior 's word then turn to he grandmother he say whoever it be that have rob we of the fruit i forgive he even if it be tom andrew ned go to work that day with a heavy heart tom andrew be in high glee for he master have say he would give he another week 's trial ned tell he of the misfortune that have happen to he and think that tom look rather confuse he also remark that he companion have not get the red handkerchief on that he usually wear about he neck and he ask he the reason i tear it last night scramble through a hedge reply tom carelessly how come you to be scramble through a hedge last night inquire ned what make you ask I that question return the other sharply because answer ned fix he eye upon he because the person who steal my apricot leave part of a red handkerchief hang on we hedge do you mean to say then that _ i _ steal they exclaim he companion in a angry tone i 'll teach you to tell this of I so say he strike ned a blow on the face with he fist before ned be aware what he be go to do ned be very much tempt to strike in return but just as he raise he arm something seem to whisper that he ought not to do so and draw back a few step he call after tom who be begin to run away say you need not be afraid of I i be not go to strike you though you do strike I because it be wrong to return evil for evil fine talk indeed rejoin tom tauntingly i know very well the reason why you will not strike I again you dare not because i be the biggest and strongest you be afraid of I now ned be no coward he would have fight in a good cause with a boy twice he size and he be very much provoke at the word and manner of he companion he have a hard struggle with himself not to return the blow but he keep firm to the good resolution he have make and go away as he be return home very sorrowful he could not help think how happy he have expect to be that evening and he regret extremely that he grandmother would have no cloak to keep she warm in the cold weather still the recollection that he have patiently bear the blow and insulting speech of tom and thus endeavor to put in practice the good precept he have be teach console he and make he feel less sad than he would otherwise have be how do you get that black eye ned ask he grandmother as soon as she see he i hope you have not be fight no grandmother indeed i have not reply ned and he tell she how it have happen he grandmother say that he be a good boy to have act as he do and add it make I happier to find that you behave well than twenty new cloak would the next day at dinner time when ned go into the little outhouse where he and tom usually eat this meal he find tom sit there cry what make you cry tom inquire ned because i have no dinner be the reply how happen that ask ned because now father 's out of work mother say she can only give we two meal a-day i only have a little bit of bread this morning and i shall have nothing else till i go home in the evening and then she will give I a cold potato or two ned 's grandmother have give he that day for he dinner a large slice of bread and a piece of cold bacon ned have be work hard and be very hungry he could have eat all the bread and bacon with pleasure and feel certain that if he have get no dinner and tom have tom would not have give he any of he he recollect that tom have never in he life show he any kindness that a fortnight ago when tom have have four apple give he he have eat they all himself without even offer he part of one and above all he call to mind that tom be in all probability the person who have rob he of he apricot and kill he favorite apricot-tree but he remember we savior 's command do good to they that hate you and though tom be a bad boy yet it grieve ned to see he cry with hunger whilst he himself have food to eat so he divide both the bread and the bacon into two equal share with he knife and then go up to tom give he one portion and desire he to eat it tom look at ned in some surprise and then take the food that be offer he eat it in a ravenous manner without say a word he might just have thank I think ned to himself but he forbore to tell tom so ned always read a chapter in the bible to he grandmother every night when he come home from work it happen that this evening the chapter fix on be the twelfth of st paul 's epistle to the roman he be much strike by one of the verse in it : therefore if thine enemy hunger feed he if he thirst give he drink : for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire upon he head grandmother say ned when he have conclude the chapter i understand the first part of this verse very well it be plain enough but what be mean by the word ` for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire upon he head ' he grandmother reply that this passage have once puzzle she but that a old lady with whom she have live when she be a girl and who kindly take great pain in explain different part of the bible that be hard to be understand have make this quite clear to she she tell I continue he grandmother that the apostle allude to the custom of melting gold and other metal by fire and he meaning be that as coal of fire melt and soften the metal on which they be heap so by kindness and gentleness we may melt and soften we enemy and make he love instead of hate we ned thank he grandmother for this explanation and then be silent for some little time perhaps he say to himself if i go on be kind to tom andrew i shall at last make he love I and leave off tease I and say ill-natured thing he would not tell he grandmother that he have give tom part of he dinner for fear she should another day give he more and he know she could not do this without rob herself tom 's father remain out of work for several week and tom would have be oblige to go without a dinner most day if ned have not regularly give he half he for some time tom receive he companion 's kindness sulkily and without appear at all grateful but at last ned 's good-natured conduct appear to touch he and he say -- how kind you be to I ned though i be sure i have do nothing to deserve kindness from you father often say he wish i be more like you and i do think i should be happier if i be for you always seem cheerful and contented though you work harder than i do i like work answer ned nothing make I so dull as be idle besides as grandmother say people be far more likely to do wrong when they be not employ you know the line in the hymn -- ` for satan find some mischief still for idle hand to do ' tom look down and color ned who have not mean to give he pain by what he say add on observe tom 's confusion -- i have so many thing i like to do when i go home after work that i do not deserve praise for not be idle i wish i have anything i like to do when work be over return tom but i have nothing to do but play and i soon get tire of that so do i rejoin ned i like a game of ball or cricket every now and then as well as anybody but it be a great waste of time to say the least of it to spend all one 's spare hour in play besides as you say we get tired and do not enjoy play if we have too much of it what do you do of a evening that be so pleasant inquire tom why i keep we little garden in order -- that take up a good deal of time and i write a copy and do a sum or two and read the bible to grandmother i should like that very well observe tom all except read the bible oh do not say so exclaimed ned surely you do not mean it i dare say rejoin tom that i should like the bible well enough if i could understand it but it be so hard _ you _ understand it all i suppose oh dear no that i do not but grandmother sometimes explain what be hard and tell I a great many please thing about the manners of the country where we savior and he apostle live i never be happier than when i read to she and she talk to I about what i have read well say tom mother hear I read a chapter now and then but she always seem to think it a trouble and so i read as fast as i can to get it the sooner over father commonly say he be too tired to listen ned say no more on the subject then but when they have both do work he ask tom if he would like to walk home with he and look at he garden tom hesitate at first there seem to be something in the idea that make he uncomfortable but he have be gradually grow fond of ned and ned 's account of the pleasure and comfort of he home have make he wish to go there so he tell he companion that he would go with he ned 's grandmother receive the two boy very kindly and give they some tea and bread and butter have learn from tom that he parent would not be uneasy at he absence she ask he to stay with they all the evening the next day tom look wistfully at ned as if he wish to go home with he but do not like to say anything about it ned observe this and tell he that he grandmother have say he might come whenever he like then i 'll go to-night say tom and accordingly he go home with ned that evening and almost every evening afterwards for some time he help ned to work in he garden and take a part in all he other employment ned always read the bible after tea which tom at first thought very tiresome and he would not have stay have he not wish for ned 's company afterwards to walk part of the way back with he to the village but soon he become so much interested in what he hear read as well as by the improving and interesting conversation of ned 's grandmother that he look forward to the evening 's reading as one of the pleasantest event of the day one afternoon as the two boy be digging a bed in the garden tom say to he companion -- i have long be go to tell you of something that make I very uncomfortable but i have never yet have courage to do it i know you think that i steal you apricot do not you ned do not immediately reply he good-nature make he unwilling to own that he _ do _ suspect tom and he could not tell a untruth by say that he do not suspect he well continue tom i be sure you must and i do not wonder at it now the truth be that when you tell I about you apricot i think to myself that i would come when it be dusk and take two or three of they just to eat think that you would not miss such a small number but i do not like to go by myself so i ask fred morri if he would go with I he say ' o yes he would go anywhere or do anything to get some apricot ' he do not know of you tree he add or he should have pay it a visit before i begin to be sorry i have tell he and make he promise that he would not take more than three when it get dark and we be set out i feel that i be do very wrong i wish to turn back but fred would not let I he say i need not take any fruit myself if i want to back out but that if i do not go with he to show he the tree he would beat I within a inch of my life so we come to the wicket together it be fasten and we clamber over the hedge fred have a large basket with he which i have several time ask he about and try to make he say what he bring it for he tell I that i should see when the time come as soon as he get to the tree he begin gather the apricot as fast as he could and put they into he basket i try to hinder he and say i would shout and wake you but he declare that if i do he would kill I and you know ned he be nearly twice as big as i be and terribly violent so all i could do be to hold my tongue and let he alone just as we be go away he catch up a saw that be lie in the garden and spoil the tree with it i do believe he do this just for the love of mischief or maybe partly to spite I because i have tell he not to steal all the apricot he would not let I have one for my share though i do not think i could have eat it if he have i be so much frightened and so surprised at he for steal all you fruit he besides order I not to tell what he have do and bully I a great deal about it till at last i get away from he i be too much afraid to tell you for a good while but i could not bear that you should think i have be so very wicked and at last i make up my mind to tell you exactly how it be i know that i have be very wrong continue tom and that if it have not be for I the apricot would not have be steal i can not be more sorry than i be and now that you have hear all ned will you forgive I and try not to think as badly of I as i deserve ned say he be glad to hear tom have have no more share in the affair and then hold out he hand to tom he assure he of he entire forgiveness indeed tom he add i forgave you in my heart long ago i be sure you do rejoin tom warmly or you would not have be so kind to I o ned you can not think how unhappy it make I when i recollect how often i have be tease and ill-natured to you notwithstanding you good-nature to I say no more about that reply ned you have not be tease or ill-natured lately we shall i hope always be good friend for the future when tom be go ned related this conversation to he grandmother i think she observe when he conclude that all tom 's sin in this matter come from break the tenth commandment if he have not first covet the apricot he would not have be tempt to steal they through earnestly desire what do not belong to he he be lead not only to commit a great sin himself but to be the means of lead a fellow-creature into sin also fred morri would not have think of rob the apricot-tree have not tom put it into he head in the bible we be frequently charge not to lead we brother into sin and heavy punishment be denounce against he who shall cause another to do evil i use to think grandmother observe ned that the tenth commandment must be the least important of all i do not suppose there could be any very great harm in merely wish for what belong to another person but i shall never think so in future several week pass away and the weather begin to grow cold and winterly ned could not help sigh when he see he grandmother suffer from the cold and recollect that she have no cloak to keep she warm and would have none all the winter he sometimes sigh too as he look at the apricot-tree whose branch be now dead and withering and so do tom both the boy agree that it have better be cut down and take away entirely how i wish exclaim tom that we have another to put in its place so do i rejoin ned but apricot-trees i believe be very dear to buy a gardener my father use to work for and who be now dead give I this i fear there be no chance of we ever get another how i do wish i be rich cry tom i would give you a apricot-tree and all manner of thing besides i should like to be as rich as we squire best but it would do to be as rich as farmer tomkyn oh if i have only half as many sheep and pig and cow and haystack as he have how happy i should be do not you wish you have some of the squire 's or farmer tomkyn 's riches ned no reply ned i do not because we ought not to wish for other people 's thing he then tell tom all that he could remember of what he grandmother have say to he about the sin of covet what do not belong to we and that do so besides break one commandment be very likely to lead to the breaking of other also but ask tom how be it possible to help longing sometimes for thing we have not get and yet see other people have we may not say ned 's grandmother who have come out to call the boy in to tea and have overhear the latter part of they conversation we may not perhaps be always able to prevent covetous or envious thought from enter we mind but we should directly endeavor to drive they away and pray to god to make we contented with ` that state of life in which it have please he to place we ' ` be content with such thing as ye have ' say st paul and again speaking of himself he tell we ' i have learn in whatever state i be therewith to be content ' besides tom the rich be not always happy they have a great many care and anxiety that we know nothing of you can not have forget what trouble farmer tomkyn be in last spring when so many of he cattle die of the distemper and he be afraid he should lose the rest it be true the squire can afford to have always a grand dinner to sit down to but of what use be that when he be and have be for year in such a bad state of health that the choicest dainty afford he no pleasure do not you think tom that if you be in he place you would gladly give all the fine clothes dainty food and wealth that you possess to be strong and hearty again even though you have only a poor cottage to live in and a crust of bread to eat yes reply tom that i would i be sure we be all resume the old woman too apt i fear to think more of the blessing and comfort we want or fancy we want than of those we already possess we forget that c those among we who have least have far more than they deserve ' what you say grandmother observe ned put I in mind of some verse in one of watt 's hymn that i learn by heart a little while ago may i say they do so my dear reply he grandmother and ned repeat the follow verse : -- not more than other i deserve yet god have give I more for i have food while other starve or beg from door to door while some poor wretch scarce can tell where they may lay they head i have a home wherein to dwell and rest upon my bed while other early learn to swear and curse and lie and steal lord i be teach thy name to fear and do thy holy will be these thy favor day by day to I above the rest then let I love thee more than they and try to serve thee best they be very pretty verse indeed say he grandmother when ned have finish and i be glad that you remember they at the right time the day after this conversation tom tell ned that he should not be able to go home with he when work be over that evening because he uncle be come it be frosty and nothing could be do in the garden so when ned have mend a rail in the little wicket gate that be break and have have he tea read the bible get by heart a column-of spelling and say it to he grandmother he sit down on a stool near the fire and amuse himself by go on with a stock he have begin to knit how thankful i be to you for have teach I to knit say he because it be something pleasant to do when i be in-door of a winter 's evening just as ned leave off speak a knock be hear at the cottage door he run to open it and be rather surprise to see tom and with he a well-dressed pleasant-looking man whom he do not remember to have see before this be my

behavior that i be quite ready to give he a trial he tell I that he have to thank you ned for he improvement that he have learn from you example to be steady and industrious and to try to correct he
