control of she spoon that to rudolph 's eye be splendidly fastidious at the third he be shock to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance from large dark-blue eye not devoid of amusement she laugh at I fume the young man inwardly he be angry conscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ear vex at he own boldness i have be offensive she laugh at I he generalize from long inexperience of a subject to which he have give acutely interested thought : they always do anger do not prevent he however from note that he neighbor travel alone that she must be a englishwoman and yet that she diffuse somehow a aura of the far east and of romance he shoot many a look toward she deck-chair that evening and when she have go below strategically buy a cigar sit down in the chair to light it and by a carefully shield match contrived to read the tag that flutter on the arm : b forrester hongkong afterward he remember that by early daylight he might have read it for nothing and so for economic penance smoke to the bitter end find the cigar disagreeable but manly at all event homesickness have vanish in a curious impatience for the morrow miss forrester : he would sit beside miss forrester

appear to understand murmur which he himself find obscure and so restore he confidence that before tiffin be over he talk no less gayly he honest face alight and glowing she teach he the name of the strange fruit before they but though listen and question eagerly he could not afterward have tell loquat from pumelo or custard-apple from papaya nor could this young man of methodical habit ever have tell how long they voyage last it pass unreal and timeless in a glorious mist a delighted fever : the background a blur of glossy white bulkhead and iron rail awning that flutter in the warm languorous wind a infinite tropic ocean poignantly blue the foreground miss forrester she white figure trim and dash she round blue eye fill with coy wonder the arch innocence of a spoil child she pale smooth cheek rather plump but come oddly and enticingly to a point at the mouth and tilted chin she lip somewhat too full too red but quick and whimsical : he see these all and these only in a bright focus listen meanwhile to a voice by turn languid and lively with now and then a curious liquid softness perhaps insincere yet dangerously pleasant question hint she play at motherly age and wisdom as for he he never before know how well he could talk or how engross he sober life both in he native village on the baltic and afterward in breman could prove to either himself or a stranger yet he be not such a fool he reflect as to tell everything so far from trading confidence she have tell he only that she be bind straight on to hongkong that curiosity alone have lead she to travel second-class for the delightful change you know from all such formality and that she be really more french than english she reticence have the charm of a incognito and take this leaf from she book he

excited thought he be amaze at he happy recklessness he would never see she again he be hurry toward lonely and uncertain shore yet this brief voyage outvalue the rest of he life in time they have leave penang -- another unheeded background for she arch innocent appealing face -- and forge down the strait of malacca in a flood of nebulous moonlight it be the last night out from singapore that veil brightness as they lean on the rail show she brown hair flutter dimly she face pale half real half magical she eye dark and undefined pool of mystery it be late they have be silent for a long time and rudolph feel that something beyond the territory of word remain to be say and that the one brilliant epoch of he life now draw madly to a close what do you think of it all the woman ask suddenly gravely as though they have be isolate together in the deep space of the same thought i do not yet -- of what rejoin rudolph at a loss of all this she wave a eloquent little gesture toward the azure-lighted gulf oh he say of the world yes she answer slowly the world life she tone subdue and musical convey in the mere word they full enigma and full mean all this that we see who can tell he take she seriously and ransack all he store of second-hand philosophy for a worthy answer -- a musty store dead and pedantic after the thrilling spirit of she word why i think -- it be -- be it not

desperate gesture wheel and march resolutely aft that night it be no prussian snore which keep he awake and wretch everything be finish he think abysmally he lay overthrow ache crushed as though pin under the fall wall of he youth at breakfast-time the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowd of brown and yellow man scarf swathe and turban in riotous color work quarrel with harsh cry in

stand wait in he path without say good-by she reproach he the injured wonder in she eye he think a little overdo good-by he could not halt but raise he cap stiffly manage to add a pleasant voyage and pass on feeling as though she have murder something he find himself jogging in a rickshaw while equatorial rain beat like down-pouring bullet on the tarpaulin hood and sluice the chinaman 's oily yellow back over the heavy-muscled shoulder he catch glimpse of sullen green foliage ponderous and drooping of half-naked barbarian that squat in the shallow cavern of shop innumerable face black yellow white and brown whirling past beneath other tarpaulin hood or at carriage window or shield by enormous drip wicker hat or bare to the pelting rain curious odor greet he as of sour vegetable and of unknown rank substance burn he stare like a visionary at the streaming multitude of alien shape the coolie swerve stop tilted he shaft to the ground rudolph enter a sombre mouldy office where the

some higher desert country that shine like snowdrift or like sift ash from which the hill rise black and char they savage winter-blasted look in the clear light of a almost vernal morning make the land seem fabulous yet here in reality think rudolph as he float toward that hoary kingdom -- here at last face a lonely sea rear the lifeless inhospitable shore the sullen margin of china the slow

at first a act of merit the deed of a veteran the interim have be pack with incongruity there have be a dinner with kempner solemn full of patriotism and philosophy a drunken dinner at teppich 's another and a worse at nesbit 's and the banquet of a native merchant which begin at four o'clock on melon-seed tea black yearling egg and a hot towel and end at three in the morning on rice-brandy and betel serve by unreal woman with chalk face and vermilion-spotted lip simpering and melancholy by day there be work or now and then a lesson with dr earle 's teacher a little aged chinaman of

of a frog in a pool a cry from the river or the sing-song of a boy improvise some endless ballad below-stair drowsy noon above the little courtyard bare and peaceful as a jail homesick moment at the window when beyond the stunt orangery at sunset the river be strike amazingly from bronze to indigo or at dawn flash from pearl-gray to flow brass -- all these and night between sleep and wake when fancy people the echo chamber with the visionary life now end of meek brown sister from goa or macao give to rudolph intimations vague profound and gravely happy as of some former existence almost recapture once more he feel himself a householder in the arabian tale and yet when he life be grow all but placid across it shoot some tremor of disquieting knowledge one evening after a busy day among he piece-goods he have walk afield with heywood and back by a aimless circuit through the twilight he companion have be taciturn of late and they halt without speak where a wide pool gleam toward a black fantastic belt of knotted willow and sharp-curving roof through these break the shadow of a small pagoda jag as a war-club of shark 's tooth vesper cymbal clash faintly in a temple and from its open door the first plummet of lamplight begin to fathom the dark margin a short bridge curve high like a camel 's hump over the glimmer half-circle of a single arch close by under a droop foreground of branch a stake uphold a oblong placard of neat symbol like a cartouche to explain a painting it be very beautiful ventured rudolph twist up he blond moustache with satisfaction very sightly i would say -- picturesque no very say heywood absently willow pattern and the placard so finish so artistic -- that say eh what oh i be not listen heywood glance carelessly at the upright sentence that be a notice : -- ` girl may not be drown in this pond ' he start on without comment without reply rudolph follow gathering as he walk the force of this tremendous hint slow far-reaching it poison the elegiac beauty of the scene alienate the night and give to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look sombre and implacable he be still ponder this when across they wind foot-path with a quick thud of hoof sweep a pair of equestrian silhouette it be half glimpse half conjecture -- the tough little pony trot stubbornly a rider who lean across laughing and a woman who gayly cry at he : you really do understand I do not you the two jogging shadow melt in the bamboo tracery like thing blow down the wind but for year rudolph have know the word the laugh the beguiling cadence and could have tell what poise of the head go with they what dangerous glance light suddenly without reason he feel a gust of rage it be he that understand it be to he these thing belong the memory of she weakness be lose in the shine memory of she power he should be ride there in the dusk of this lonely and cruel land heywood have throw after they a single gloomy stare down the pointed aisle of bamboo well match he growl chantel -- he bound in the saddle and he bound afoot rudolph know that he have hate chantel at sight he could not bring himself next day to join they party for tiffin at the flowery pagoda but in the midst of he brooding teppich and the fat sturgeon assail the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blow and shout they have bring chair to carry he off and be in no mood to fail though panting and struggle they pack he into a palanquin with many bottle of the best wine know to fliegelman and son by a short cut through the street -- where checkered sunshine through the lattice roof give a muddy subdue light as in a roil aquarium -- the reveler pass the inland wall here in the shade groom await they with pony and scramble into saddle they trot off through gap in the bamboo across a softly rolling country tortuous foot-path of vivid pink wound over brilliant green terrace of young paddy the pink crescent of new grave scar the hillside already scallop and crinkle with shelve abode of the venerable dead great hat of farmer stoop in the field gleam in the sun like shield of brass over knoll and through hollow the little cavalcade jog steadily till mount a gentle eminence they wind through a grove of camphor and flame-of-the-forest above the branch rise the fade lilac shaft of a ancient pagoda ruinously adorn with young tree and wild shrub cling in the cornice at the foot of this aged fantasy in stone people be laugh the three rider break cover in time to see mr forrester flush and radiant end some narrative with a droll pantomime she stand laugh the life

uproariously the padre and the dark-eyed miss drake quietly heywood more quietly while even stout uneasy mr earle smile as in duty bind a squad of chinese boy busy with tiffin-basket find time to grin to this lively actress in the white gown they form a sylvan audience under the gnarled bough and the pagoda too late call the white-haired giant indulgently to the dismount trio mr hackh you should have come spur rudolph advance pale but with a calmness of which afterward he be justly proud the heroine of the moment turn toward he quickly with a look more natural more sincere than she have ever give he be this mr hackh she say graciously i have hear so much about you the young man himself be almost deceive be there a german mail-boat be there a club from which he have steal out while she weep ignominiously in that girl 's arm and then of a sudden he perceive with a fatuous pleasure how well she know he to know that he have never speak he english as he draw up a stool beside miss drake be wild and ragged but he find she a astonishing refuge for the first time he recall that this quiet girl have be beautiful the other night and though now by day that beauty be rather of line than of color he could not understand how it have be overlook tiffin meanwhile speed by like a orgy he remember ask so many question about the mission hospital and she school for orphan that the girl begin at last to answer with constraint and with puzzle sidelong scrutiny he remember how even the tolerant heywood shoot a question glance toward he wine-glass he remember tell a brilliant story and recite old captain mau in vegesack -- rhyme long forget now fluent and spontaneous the applause be a triumph through it as through a haze he see a pair of wide blue eye shine with startle admiration but the best come when the sun have lower behind the grove the company grow more silent and mr forrester lean beside the door of the tower turn the great peg of a chinese lute the note tinkle like a mandolin but with now and then a alien wail a lament unknown to the west sing for we beg the dark-eyed girl a native song the other smile and bend forward as if to recollect begin in a low voice somewhat veil but musical and full of mean the jasmine flower first then my love be gather dolicho and then she sing the long ballad of the rice -- of the husband and wife planting side by side the spring of the green blade the harvest by million upon million of sheaf the wealth of the state more fragrant to ancestor than offering of spice : -- o labor and love and hallowed land think you these thing be but still to come think you they be but near at hand only now and here -- behold they be the same in year of old in she plaintive interlude the slant-eyed servant watch she nodding and mutter under the camphor tree and here be a song of exile she say i render it very badly -- rudolph have never see she face like this bend intently above the lute it be as though in the music she find and disclose herself without guile blue be the sky and blue the rice-pool water lay hold the sky blue be the robe she wear that day alas my sorrow why must life bear all away away away ah my beloved why a murmur of praise go round the group as she put aside the instrument the sun 's get low she say lightly and i _ must _ see that view from the top chantel be rise but sit down again with a scowl as she turn to rudolph you have never see it mr hackh do come help I up inside with echo step they mount in a squalid well obscurely light from the upper window toward which decaying stair rise in a dangerous spiral without guard-rail a misstep be no trifle rudolph offer he hand for the mere safety but she take it with a curious little laugh they climb cautiously once at a halt she stand very close with eye shine large in the dusk she slight body tremble she head shake with stifled merriment like a girl overcome by mischief what a queer little world she whisper you and i here -- i never dream you could be funny it make I so proud of you down there he mutter something vague and -- the stair end in ruin at the fourth story -- hand she carefully through the window to a small outer balustrade as they stand together at the rail he know not whether to be angry suspicious or glad i love this prospect she begin quietly that be why i want you to come beyond the camphor a wide strange landscape glow in the full low-streaming light the ocean lay a sapphire band in the east in the west on a long ridge undulate the gray battlements of a city the antique wall warm and glorified breast the flood of sunset all between lay vernal field and hillock maidenhair spray of bamboo and a wander pattern of pink foot-path slowly along one of these a bright-gowned merchant ride a white pony he bell tinkle in the stillness of sea and land everywhere like other bell more tiny and shrill sound the trilling of frog as the two on the pagoda stand listen -- it be before rome she declare thoughtfully before egypt and have never change you and i be just -- she break off hum : -- only here and now behold they be the same in year of old she mood color the scene : the aged continuity of life oppress he yet he choose rather to watch the straggle battlements far off than to meet she eye or see she hair gleam in the sun through many troubled day he have forget she despise she bind he heart in triple brass against a future in she hateful neighborhood and now beside she at this time-worn rail he be in danger of be happy it be inglorious he try to frown you poor boy suddenly with a impulse that must have be generous she rest she hand on he arm i be sorry i thought of you so often at these close quarter she tremulous voice and search upward glance mean that she alone understand all he trouble he start

turn he rein aside grin what price sympathy on a pagoda for that moment rudolph could have strike down the one sure friend he have in china chapter vii iphigenia do not chop off a hen 's head with a battle-axe heywood still with a malicious friendly quirk at the corner of he mouth hold in he fretful pony rudolph stand bend a whip viciously they two have fetch a compass about the town and now in the twilight be parting before the nunnery gate a tiff 's the last thing i would want with you the lady in confidence be not worth -- i do not wish declare rudolph tremble -- i do not wish you to say those thing so right laugh the other and he pony wheel at the word i 'll give you one month -- no : you be such a good thorough little chap it will take longer -- two month to change you mind only --

of werther now over such -- he laugh again do not scowl i 'll be good i will not say it you 'll supply the word in two month he let the pony have he way and be off in a clatter lonely fume with resentment rudolph stare after he what could he know this airy unfeeling meddler so free with he advice and innuendo let he go then let he canter away he have see quickly guess with a diabolic shrewdness yet would remain on the surface always of a mystery so violent and so profound the young man stalk into he vacant nunnery in a rage a dismal pomp of emotion : reason tell he that a friend have speak sense imagination clothing he in the sceptred pall of tragedy yet one of these unwelcome word have stick : he be werther it be true -- a man who come too late another word be soon fulfil for the hot weather come sudden tropical ferocious without gradation the vernal day and languid noon be go in a twinkle the change come like another act of a play one morning -- though the dawn stir cool and fragrant as all dawn before -- the boy lay out rudolph 's white tunic slip in the shine button smear pipe-clay on he heaviest helmet and rudolph look from he window see that on the river by the same instinct boatman be stretch up they bamboo awning breakfast be hardly end before river and convex field and huddle red tile of the town lay under a blur quiver distortion the day flame at night against a glow of fiery umber the western hill break sharp and thin as sheet-iron while below they rise in flooding mirage a bright strip of magical water thus in these day he ride for he exercise while the sun still lay behind the ocean and thus she lively pointed face and wide blue eye wonder or downcast or merry be mingle in he thought with the first rousing of the world the beat of hoof in cool silence the wide light of creation over a aged weary alien empire they pony whinny like old friend they meet by chance or appointment before the power of sleep have lift from eye still new and strange against the morning sometimes chantel the handsome ride glowering beside they sometimes gilly erect and solid in the saddle lay upon they talk all the weight of he honest tired commonplace but one morning she canter up alone laugh at she escape he pony bolt and they race along together as comrade happily join force in a headlong dream quiver bamboo sweep behind they the river on they other hand meet and pass in hurry panorama they have no time for word but only laughter word indeed have never yet advance they beyond that moment on the pagoda and now when they pony fall into a shambling trot come the first impulse of speech how lucky she cry how lucky we come this way now i can really test you he turn she glowing face be now avert she gesture be not for he but for the scene he study that to understand she the river up which they have flee now rest broad and quiet as a shallow lake burnish faintly brood over by a float increase light not yet compound into day tussock innumerable clod and crumb of vivid green speckled all the nearer water on some of these stork meditate -- sage ponder head and urbane body perch high on the frailest penciling of leg in the whole expanse no movement come but when a distant bird leave he philosophic pose plunge downward after a fish beyond they rise a shapeless mound or isle like some half-organic monster ground in he native ooze there say the woman point be you all excuse like the other or do you dare i be not afraid of anything -- now retort rudolph and with truth after the dash of they twilight encounter dare what go see what be on that island she answer i dare they all twice i have see native land there and hurry away mr nesbit be too lazy to try dr chantel wear he best clothes maurice heywood refuse to mire he horse for a whim whim it be a mystery come now do you dare in a rare flush of pride rudolph wheel he stubborn mount and bully he down the bank a poor horseman he would have outstrip curtius to the gulf but no sooner have he dancing pony consent to make the first rebellious sidelong plunge than he have small joy of he boast fore-leg sink flounder be hoist with a terrify wrench of the shoulder in the same moment that hind-leg go down as by suction the pony squirm heave wrestle in a frenzy and churn the red water about he master 's thigh go deeper and fare worse with a clangor of wing the stork rise a streaming rout against the sky trail they tilted leg file away in straggle flight like figure interlace on a panel at the height of he distress rudolph catch a whirling glimpse of the woman above he safe on firm earth easy in she saddle and laugh quicksand then be a joke -- but he could not pause for this add bewilderment the pony use a skill bear of agony have find somewhere a solid verge and scramble up knee-deep well out from the bank with a splash rudolph stand beside he among the tuft of salad green as he pat the tremble flank he hear a cry from the shore oh well do she mock they well do a gust of wholesome anger refresh he she might laugh but now he would see this folly through he tear off he coat fling it across the saddle wade out alone through the tussock and shooting forward full length in the turbid water swam resolutely for the island sky and water brighten while he swim and as he rise wrap in the leaden weight of drip clothes the sun before and above he touch wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grass he lurch ashore he foot cake with enormous clod as of melting chocolate a filthy scramble leave he smear and disheveled on the summit he have come for nothing the mound lay vacant a tangled patch a fragment of wilderness yet as he stand pant there rise a puny miserable sound what presence could lurk there the distress it might be of some small animal -- a rabbit die in a forget trap faint as illusion a wail a thin-spun thread of sorrow break into lonely whimpering and cease he move forward doubtfully and of a sudden in the scrubby level of the isle stumble on the rim of a shallow circular depression at first he could not believe the discovery but next instant -- as at the temple pond though now without need of placard or interpreter -- he understand this bowl a tiny crater among the weed show like some paltry valley of ezekiel a charnel place of herod 's innocent the battlefield of some babe ' crusade a chill strike he not from the water or the early mist in stupor he view that savage fact through the stillness of death sound again the note of live discontent he be aware also of some stir even before he spy under a withered clump the saffron body of a infant girl feebly squirm by a loathsome irony there lay beside she a earthen bowl of rice as a earnest or symbol of regret blind pity urge he into the atrocious hollow see no further than the present rescue he catch up the small unclean sufferer who moan the louder as he carry she down the bank and wade out through the sludge to hold the squalling mouth above water and swim be no simple feat yet at last he come flounder among the tussock wrap the naked body in he jacket and with infinite pain tug he terrify pony along a tortuous bar to the land once in the river-path he stand gloomily and let mr forrester canter up to join he indeed he have almost forget she splendid she laugh what a figure of fun but what can you have bring back oh please i can not wait he turn on she a muddy haggard face without enthusiasm and gently unfold the coat the man and the woman look down together in silence at the child he have some foolish hope that she would take it that he part be end like a outlandish doll with face contorted and thick-lidded eye shut tightly against the sunshine the outcast whimper too near the point of death for even the rebellion of arm and leg the woman in the saddle give a short incredulous cry she face all gay curiosity have darken in a shock of disgust what in the world she scold oh such a nasty little -- why do -- what do you propose do with it rudolph shake he head like a man catch in some stupid blunder i never think of that he explain heavily she have no -- no friend cover it he companion order cover it up i can not bear to see it with a sombre disappointed air he obey then look up as if in she face he read strange matter i can not bear she add quickly to see any kind of suffer why do -- it be all my fault for send you we be have such a good ride together and now i have spoil it all with this -- poor little filthy object she turn she hand outward with a helpless dainty gesture but what can we do these thing happen every day rudolph be study the ground again he thought then have wrong she drench and downheart hold this strange burden in he jacket he feel that he have foolishly meddle in thing inevitable beyond repair she be right yet some vague insurgent instinct which would not down tell he that there have be a disappointment still what have he expect no woman could help no woman then suddenly he mount bundle and all and turn he willing pony homeward come he say and for the first time unwittingly have take charge what be it she call you foolish boy what be you plan we shall see he answer without wait he beckon she to follow she come they ride stirrup to stirrup silent as in they escape at dawn and as close bodily but in spirit travel distant parallel he give no thought to that ride toward he experiment near the town at last he rein aside to a cluster of building -- white wall and rosy tile under a great willow you may save you step she declare with sudden petulance the hospital 's more out of fund than ever and more crowd they 'll not thank you rudolph nodded back at she with a queer smile half reckless and half confident then he reply dismount i will replenish my nunnery squat coolie spring up and race to hold he pony other in the shade of the wall cackle when they see a son of the red-haired so beplastered and sop a few pointed at he bundle with grunt of sudden interest and a leper bear the visage as of a stone lion deface by time cry something harshly at he word the whole band of idler begin to chatter rudolph turn to aid he companion she sit watch they sharply a uneasy light trouble the innocent blue eye which have not even a glance for he no i sha not get down she say angrily it be just what might be -- you little brat will bring no good to any of we he fling away defiantly stride through the gate and call aloud traverse a empty compound already heat by the new-risen sun a cooler fringe of veranda or shallow cloister line a second court two figure meet he -- the dark-eyed miss drake all in white and behind she a shuffling grin native woman who carry a basin in which permanganate of potash swam gleam like dilute blood good-morning with one droll look of amusement the girl have understand and regain that grave yet happy friendly composure which have the virtue he discover of be easily forget to be meet each time like something new what have you there for we again he unfold the jacket a child the naked mite lay very still the breath weakly flutter a somewhat nauseous gift the girl raise she arm and receive it gently without haste -- the saffron body appear yet more squalid against the palladian whiteness of she tunic plain and cool as drapery in marble it may live she say we 'll do what we can and follow by the black-trousered woman she move quickly away to offer battle with death a plain usual fact it seem involve no more surprise than repugnance she face have hardly altered and yet rudolph for the first time in many day have catch the fleeting brightness of compassion mere light of the eye a half-imagined glory incongruous in the sharp smell of antiseptic it leave he wonder in the cloister he know now what have be miss by the river i be naked and -- how run the line he turn to go recall in a whirl snatch of truth he have never know since boyhood never see away from home across a court the padre

raucous voice fill with the solitary pride of intellect well man shall revile you growl dr earle he say we steal child to puncture they eye for magic medicine then heave he wide shoulder -- oh well he say wearily thanks anyhow come see we when we be not so busy good -- look out these fellow do not fly at you tire and befoul rudolph pass through into the torrid glare the leper cut short he snarl

further if you be catch slide down and run westward to the gate which be call the meeting of the dragon heywood nod and slip in beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil a broad squat giant sit stiff and still against the opposite wall and stare with cruel unblinking eye if the stranger be the first white man to enter this motionless grim janitor give no sign on the earthen floor lay a small circle of white lime heywood place he right foot inside it we be all in-the-circle man pass say the guard out from shadow glide a tall native with a halberd who open a door in the far corner in the second room dim as the first burn the same smoky orange light on the same table but here a twisted cripple he nose long and pendulous with elephantiasis preside over three cup of tea set in a row heywood lift the central cup and drink will you bite the cloud ask the second guard in a soft and husky bass as he speak the great nose tremble slightly no i will bite ginger reply the white man why be you face so green it be a melon-face -- a green face with a red heart pass say the cripple gently he pull a cord -- the nose quake with this exertion -- and open the third door again the chamber be

polished camagon except for this unrest the aged face might have be carve from yellow soapstone but he slant eye be the sharpest yet you have come far he say with sinister and warn courtesy too far think heywood in a sink heart but answer : -- from the east where the fusang cock spit orient pearl and where do you study the black fan stop flutter in the red flower pavilion what book do you read the book say heywood hold he wit by he will the book be ten thousand thousand page and the theme the water of the deluge crosswise flow and what -- the aged voice rise briskly -- what see you on the water the eight abbot float answer heywood negligently -- but run he thought he 'll pump I dry why continue the examiner do you look so happy because heaven have send the unicorn the black fan begin flutter once more it seem a hopeful sign but the keen old eye be far from satisfied why have you such a sensual face i be bear under a peach tree pass say the old man regretfully and heywood glancing back from the mouth of a dark corridor see he beside the table of camagon wag he head like a judge doubtful of he judgment the narrow passage hot fetid and blacker than the wholesome night without crooked about sharp corner that bruise the wanderer 's hand and arm suddenly he fall down a short flight of slimy step landing in noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt a trap a suffocating well he think and rise filthy choke with bitterness and disgust only the taunt justice of wutzler 's argument the retort _ ad hominem _ have send he headlong into this dangerous folly he have scold a coward with hasty word and be force to follow where they lead to this loathsome hole behind he a door close a bar scrape softly into place before he as he grope in rage and self-reproach rise a vault of solid plaster narrow as a chimney but presently glance upward he see a small cluster of star blinking voluptuous immeasurably overhead they pittance of light as he eyesight clear show a ladder rise flat against the wall he reach up grasp the bamboo rung hoist with a acrobatic wrench and begin to climb cautiously above faint and muffle sound a murmur of voice chapter xi white lotus he be swarm up quiet as a thief when he finger claw the bare plaster the ladder hang from the square end of a protrude beam above which there be no more rung he hang in doubt then to he great relief something blacker than the starlight gather into form over he head -- a slanting bulk which gradually take on a familiar meaning he chuckle reach for it and finger the rough edge to avoid loose tile haul himself up to a foothold on the beam and so fling out he arm and hook one knee scramble over and lay on a ribbed and mossy surface under the friendly star the outcast and he strange brethren have play fair : this be the long roof and close ahead rise the wall of some higher build a upright blackness from which escape two bit of light -- a right angle of hairbreadth line and below this a brighter patch small and ragged here louder but confuse with a gentle scuffing of foot sound the voice of the rival lodge toward these he crawl stop at every creak of the tile once a broken roll snap off and slide rattle down the roof he sit up every muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send he slide after it into the lower darkness it fall but a short distance into something soft gradually he relax but lay very still nothing follow no one have hear he try again crawl forward he own length and bring up snug and safe in the angle where roof meet wall the voice and shuffling foot be dangerously close he sit up catch a shaft of light full in he face and peer in through the ragged chink two leg in bright wrinkled hose and a pair of black shoe with thick white sole block the view for a long time they shift uneasy and tantalizing he could hear only a hubbub of talk -- random phrase without mean the leg move away and leave a clear space but at the same instant a grating noise startle he directly overhead out of door the thin right angle of light spread instantly into a brilliant square with a bang a wooden shutter slide open heywood lay back swiftly just as a long fat bamboo pipe two sleeve and the head of a man in a red silk cap be thrust out into the night air _ ai-yah _ sigh the man and puff at he bamboo it be hot heywood try to blot himself against the wall the lounger prop on elbow finish he smoke spat upon the tile and remain a pensive silhouette _ ai-yah _ he sigh again then knock out the bamboo draw in he head not until the shutter slam do heywood shake the burning spark from he wrist in the same movement however he raise head and shoulder to spy through the chink this time the bright-hosed leg be go he see clear down a brilliant lane of robe and banner multicolored and shine with embroidery and tinsel -- a lane between two rank of crowded man who splendid with green and blue and yellow robe of ceremony face each other in a strong lamplight that glisten on they oily cheek the chatter have cease under the crowded row of shaven forehead they eye blink deep-set and expectant at the far end of the loft through two circular arch or giant hoop of rattan heywood at last descry a third arch of sword beyond this a tall incense jar smoulder gray wisp of smoke beside a transverse table twinkle with candle like a altar and over these a black image with a pale carve face seat bolt upright before a lofty intricate gilded shrine of the patriot war-god a tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban move athwart the altar chant as he solemnly lift one by one a row of symbol : a round wooden measure heap with something white like rice in which stick a gay cluster of paper flag a brown polished abacus a mace carve with a dragon another carve with a phoenix a rainbow robe gleam with the plumage of siamese kingfisher all these and more he display aloft and replace among the candle when he chant end a brisk little man in yellow step forward into the lane o fragrant one he shrill i bring ten thousand recruit to join we army and swear brotherhood attend o master of incense behind he a squad of some dozen barefoot wretch in coolie clothes with queue un-plaited crawl on all fours through the first arch they crouch abject while the tall master of incense in the dove-gray silk sternly examine they sponsor in the outer darkness heywood crane and listen till neck and shoulder ache he could make nothing of the florid verbiage with endless ritual the crawl novice reach the arch of sword they kneel each hold above he head a light bundle of incense-stick -- red spark that quiver like angry firefly above they the tall master of incense thunder : -- o spirit of the hill and brook the land the swollen seed of the ground and all the vein of earth o thou young bearer of the axe that clear the hill o imperial heaven and ye five dragon of the five region with all the holy influence who pass and instantly re-pass

glow from distant flame the rough ground slope at last and send they stumble down into mud behind they the bank run black and ragged against the glow before they still more black lay the river placid mysterious and safe through the mud they labor heavily toward a little smoky light -- a lantern gleam faintly on a polished gunwale the shoulder of a man and the thin slant line that be he pole lowdah call chantel and the shoulder move the line shift as the boatman answer chantel pitch the bundle over the lantern and leap on board rudolph come slowly carry in he arm the woman who lay quiet and limp clasp he in a kind of drowsy oblivion he feel the flutter of she lip while she whisper in he ear strange breathless entreaty a broken murmur of endearment unheard-of which tempt he more than the wide alluring darkness of the river he lower she slowly and lean against the gunwale she still cling to he hand aboard quickly snap they leader from the dusk behind the lantern obey by impulse rudolph move nearer the gunwale the slippery edge polish by bare foot through many year seem the one bit of reality in this dream except the warmth of she hand to the nunnery he ask try dully to rouse from a fascination no no she wail down -- away -- safe no back to they he answer stupidly they be all there you -- he be there we can not leave -- you fool chantel swear in one tongue and in another cry to

not leave you quickly you see it burn they be all dead it be no use we must live we must live darling she be right somehow there be no power to confute she he must come with she or run back useless into the ring of sword and flame she and life be in the boat ashore a friend cut off beyond reach a impossible duty and death he eye dull and fix in the smoky lantern-light rest for a age on the knotted sarong it mean nothing then in a flash as though for he all light of the eye have concentrate in a single vision it mean everything the color cloth -- rudely paint in the hut of some forget mountaineer -- hold all she treasure and she heart the thing of this world she must go with those it be fitting she be beautiful -- in all she fear and disorder still more beautiful she go with life

boundary he vaguely hear she cry out vaguely see chantel rise above the lantern and slash down at he with the lowdah 's pole the bamboo strike he heavy but glance on the head he stagger lose he footing and fall into the mud where as though he choice have already overtake he he lay without thought or emotion watch the dim light float off into the darkness by and by it be go from somewhere in another direction come a sharp continual crackling fusillade like the snap of dry bamboo-joint in a fire the unstirring night grow heavier with the smell of burnt gunpowder but rudolph sit in the mud feel only that he eye be dry and leaden in they socket that there be a drum in he ear and that if heat and weariness thus make a end of he he need no longer watch the oppressive multitude of star or hear the monotony of flow water something stir in the dry grass above he without turn he hear a man scramble down the bank without look up he feel some one pause and stoop close when at last in profound apathy he raise he eye he see against the starlight the hat head and shoulder of a coolie quite natural he think that the fellow should be mutter in german it be only the halt rusty fashion of the speech that finally fret he into listen the word do not concern he be you dead then grumble the coolie do she kill you rudolph dismiss he with a vague but angry motion some time afterward the same voice come louder the coolie be still there you can not sit here all night he say by daylight they will catch you come perhaps i can take you to you friend come rudolph feel sharp knuckle work at he lip and before he could rebel find he mouth full of sweet fiery liquid he choke swallow and presently hear the empty bottle splash in the river _ stösst a _ say the rescuer and chuckle something in dispraise of woman be that not better the rice-brandy be hot and potent for of a sudden rudolph find himself afoot and awake a dizzy warmth clear he spirit he understand perfectly this man for some strange reason be wutzler a coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland he and he nauseous alien brandy have restore the future there be more to do come on the forsake lover be first man up the bank

she house be burn now you leave in time wutzler shuffle before he with the trot of a lean and exhaust laborer i be with the man you fight when you run i follow to the house and then here to the river i be glad you do not jump on board he glance back timidly for approbation i be a great coward herr heywood tell I so -- but i also stay and help he steer craftily among the longest and blackest shadow now jogging in a path now thread the boundary of a rice-field or wait behind tree and all the time though devious and artful as a deer-stalker creep toward the center of the noise and the leap flame when the quake shadow grow thin and spare and the light clearing dangerously wide he swerve to the right through a rolling bank of smoke they cough as they run once rudolph pause with the heat of the fire on he cheek the nunnery be burn he say hopelessly he guide halt peer shrewdly and listen no they be still shoot he answer and limp onward skirt the uproar at last when by pale star above the smoke and flame and spark rudolph judge that they be somewhere north of the nunnery they come stumble down into a hollow encumber with round swollen obstacle like a patch of enormous melon oil-jars lay scatter hide here and wait command wutzler i will go see and he flit off through the smoke smuggle among the oil-jars rudolph lay pant shape of man run past another empty jar roll down beside he and a stray bullet sing overhead like a vibrate wire soon afterward wutzler come crawl through the huddle pottery lie still he whisper you friend be hem in you can not get through the smell of rancid oil choke they yet they could breathe without cough and could rest they smart eye in the midst of tumult and combustion the hollow lay dark as a pool along its rim bristle a scrubby fringe of weed black against a rosy cloud after a time something still blacker part the weed in silhouette a man 's head he hand grasp a staff or the muzzle of a gun remain there as still as though crawl to the verge he lay petrified in the act of spy chapter xvii lamp of heaven the white man peer from among the oil-jar like two of the forty thief they could detect no movement friendly or hostile : the black head lodge there without stir the watcher whether he have see they or not be in no hurry for with chin prop among the weed he hold a pose at once alert and peaceful mischievous and leisurely as though he be master of that hollow and might lie all night drowse or wake as the humor prompt wutzler press he face against the earth and shiver in the stifle heat the uncertainty grow with rudolph into a acute distress he leg ache and twitch the bone of he neck be stretch as if to break and a corner of broken clay bore sharply between he rib he feel no fear however : only a great impatience to have the spy begin -- rise beckon call to he fellow fire he gun hit or miss this longing or a flash of anger or the rice-brandy work so nimbly in he wit give he both impulse and plan do not move he whisper wait here and wriggle backward inch by inch foot foremost among the crowded belly of the jar he gain the further darkness so far as sight would carry the head stir no more than if it have be a cannon-ball plant there on the verge against the rosy cloud from crawl rudolph rise to hand and knee and silently in the dust begin to creep on a long circuit once through a rift in smoke he see a band of yellow musketeer who crouch behind some ragged earthwork or broken wall loading and firing without pause or care chatter like outraged monkey and all too busy to spare a glance behind they head bob up and down in queer scarlet turban or scarf like the flannel nightcap of so many diabolic invalid pass they unseen he creep back toward he hollow in spite of smoke he have gauge and hold he circle nicely for straight ahead lay the man 's leg take thus in the rear he still lay prone stare down the slope inactive yet leg body and the bent arm that clutch a musket beside he in the grass be stiff with some curious excitement he seem ready to spring up and fire no time to lose thought rudolph and rise measure he distance with a painful giddy exactness he would have count to himself before leap but he throat be too dry he flinch a little then shoot through the air and land heavily one knee on each side pin the fellow down as he grapple underneath for the throat almost in the same movement he have bound on foot again hold both hand above he head as high as he could withdraw they the body among the weed lay cold revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence in the same tense attitude which have nothing to do with life rudolph drop he hand and stand confound by he own brutal discourtesy wutzler crawl out from the jar scramble joyfully up the bank you have kill he quaver the dry little voice you be very brave no no cry rudolph earnestly he be already by the scarlet headgear and a white symbol on the back of he jacket the man at they foot be one of the musketeer he have leave the firing-line crawl away in the dark and find a quiet spot to die in so this be good luck wutzler doff he coolie hat slide out of he jacket toss both down among the oil-jar and stoop over the dead man begin to untwist the scarlet turban in the dim light he lean arm and frail body coat with black hair give he the look of a puny ape rob a sleeper he wriggle into the dead man 's jacket wind the blood-red cloth about he own temple and catch up musket ramrod powder-horn and bag of bullet -- now i be all safe he chuckle now i can go anywhere to-night he shoulder arm and stand grin as though all they trouble be end so i be rebel soldier we try again come -- not too close behind I and if i speak run back in this order they begin once more to scout through the smoke no one meet they though distant shape rush athwart the gloom yelp to each other and near by leg of runner move under a rolling cloud of smoke as if they body be embedded and sweep along in the wrack : -- all confused hurry and meaningless like the uproar of gong horn conch whistle bullet cracker and squib that sputter string upon string flower upon rise flower of misty red gold explosion rip all other noise to tatters where and how he follow rudolph never could have tell but once as they run slink through the heaviest smoke and as it seem the heart of the turmoil he recognize the yawning rim of a clay-pit not a stone 's throw from he own gate it be amazing to feel that safety lay so close still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolie digging in the pit by torchlight peacefully as though they have hear of no disturbance that evening hardly have the picture flash past than he wonder whether he have see or imagine it whose man they be and why even at any time they should swarm so busy thick as ant merely to dig clay he have worry enough however to keep in view the white cross-barred hieroglyphic on he guide 's jacket suddenly it vanish and next instant the muzzle of the gun jolt against he rib run quick pant wutzler push he aside to the leave into the go-down here they be -- to you left and with the word he bound off to the right firing he gun to confuse the chase rudolph obeyed and run at top speed dimly understand that he have double round a squad of grunt runner whose bare foot patter close by he in the smoke before he gape a black square through which he dart to pitch head first over some fat padded bulk as he rise the rasping of rough jute against he cheek tell he that he have fall among bale and a familiar musty smell that the bale be he own in he own go-down across a narrow lane from the nunnery with high hope he stumble farther into the darkness once among the bale he tread on a man 's hand which be silently pull away with no time to think of that he crawl and climb over the disorder heap grope toward the other door he have nearly reach it when torchlight flare behind he rush in and savage cry both shrill and guttural ring through the stuffy warehouse he have barely time in the reel shadow to fall on the earthen floor and crawl under a thin curtain of reed to a new refuge into this -- a cubby-hole where the compradore keep he tally-slips umbrella odds and end -- the torchlight shone faintly through the reed lie flat behind a roll of mat rudolph could see as through the gauze twilight of a stage scene the toss light and the skip man who shout back and forth jab they spear or pike down among the bale to probe the darkness they search be wild but thorough before it in swift retreat some one crawl past the compradore 's room brushing the splint partition like a snake this as rudolph guess might be the man whose hand he have step on the stitch in the curtain become bead of light a shadowy arm heave up fall with a dry rip sound and a vertical flash a sword have cut the reed from top to bottom through the rent a smoking flame plunge after the sword and after both a bony yellow face that gleam with sweat rudolph half wrap in he matting could see the hard glassy eye shine cruelly in they narrow slit but before they lower to meet he own a jubilant yell resound in the go-down and with a grunt the yellow face the flambeau and the sword be snatch away he lay safe but at the price of another man 's peril they have catch the crawl fugitive and now come drag he back to the light through the tattered curtain rudolph see he fling on the ground like a empty sack while he captor crowd about in a broken ring cackling and prod he with they pike some jeer some snarled other call he by name with laugh epithet that ring more friendly or at least more jocular but all bent toward he eagerly and fling down question after question like a little band of kobold hold a inquisition at some sharper cry than the rest the fellow rise to he knee and face they boldly a haggard christian he be be fairly give he last chance to recant open you mouth open you mouth they cry in rage or entreaty the kneel captive shake he head and make some reply very distinct and simple open you mouth they strike at he with the torch the same sword that have slash the curtain now prick he naked chest rudolph clench he fist in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all these man-at-arms have a strange sense of be transport into the past to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy the kneel man repeat he unknown declaration he round honest oily face be anything but heroic and wear no legendary transfiguring light he seem rather stupid than calm yet as he mechanically wind he queue into place once more above the shaven forehead he finger move surely and deftly not once do they slip or tremble open you mouth snarl the pikeman and the torch-bearer with the fierce gesture of man who have waste time and patience the lamp of heaven bawl the swordsman beside himself give he the lamp of heaven to the other this phrase act as a spark to powder good good they shrill nod furiously the lamp of heaven and several man begin to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down rudolph have give order that afternoon to remove all necessary store to the nunnery but from somewhere in the darkness one rioter bring a sack of flour while another fling down a tin case of petroleum the sword have no sooner cut the sack across and puncture the tin than a fat villain in a loin cloth squat on the earthen floor knead flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough will you speak out and live cry the swordsman or will you die for a second the christian do not stir then as though the option be not in he power -- die he answer the fat baker spring up and clap on the obstinate head a shapeless gray turban of dough half a dozen torch jostle for the honor of light it the christian crown with sooty flame give a single cry clear above all the other he be call -- as even rudolph know -- on the strange god across the sea savior of the child of the west not to forget he nameless and lonely servant rudolph groan aloud rise and have part the curtain to run out and fall upon they all when suddenly close at hand and sharp in the general din there burst a quick volley of rifleshot splinter fly from the attap wall a torch-bearer and the man with the sword spin half round collided and fall the one across the other like drunken wrestler the survivor fling down they torch and run leap and diving over bale on the ground the smoulder lamp of heaven show that its wearer rescue by a lucky bullet lay still in a posture of humility strange humility it seem for one so suddenly give the complete and profound wisdom that confirm all faith foreign or domestic new or old with a sense of all this but no clear sense of action rudolph find the side-door open it close it and start across the lane he know only that he should reach the mafoo 's little gate by the pony-shed and step out of these dark age into the friendly present so that when something from the wall blaze point-blank and he fall flat on the ground he lay in utter defeat bitterly surprised and offend he own friend : they might miss he once but not twice let it come quickly instead from the darkness above come the most welcome sound he have ever know -- a keen high voice scold what the devil be you firing at it be heywood somewhere on the roof of the pony-shed he put the question sharply yet sound cool and cheerful a shadow rot you waste another cartridge so and i 'll take you gun away remember that nesbit 's voice clip out some pert objection potted the beggar any'ow -- see for yourself -- go-down 's afire save we the trouble of burn it the other voice move away with a parting rebuke no more of that sniping and squander wait till they rush you rudolph lift he head from the dust maurice he call feebly maurice let I in hallo answer he captain on the wall blithely steady on we 'll get you of all hardship this brief delay be least bearable then a bight of rope fall across rudolph 's back he seize it haul taut and plant he foot against the wall go up like a fish to land gasp on a row of sand-bag ho you wander german he invisible friend clap he on the shoulder by jove i be glad no time to burble now though off with you compradore have a gun for you in the court collect a drink as you go by report to kneebone at the northeast corner danger point there : we need a good man so hurry devilish glad cut along rudolph scramble down from the pony-shed run across the compound with he head in a whirl yet through all the scud darkness and confusion one fact have pierce as bright as a star on this night of alarm he have turn the great corner in he life like the pale stranger with he crown of fire he could finish the course he catch he rifle from the compradore 's hand but need no draught from any earthly cup brushing through the orange tree he make for the northeast angle free of all longing perplexity purge of all vile admiration and fit to join he friend in clean and wholesome danger chapter xviii siege he never believe that they could hold the northeast corner for a minute so loud and unceasing be the uproar bullet spatter sharply along the wall and sing overhead mixed now and then with a indescribable whistling and jingle the angle be like the prow of a ship cut forward into a gale yet rudolph climb rejoice up the short bamboo ladder to the platform which he coolie have build in such haste so long ago that afternoon he high spirit go before a fall as he stand up in the full glow from the burning go-down somebody tackle he about the knee and throw he head first on the sand-bag how many time must i give I order bark the little sea-captain under cover under cover and stay under cover or i 'll send ye below ye gallivanting -- oh it be you be it well there be you port-hole a stubby finger point in the obscurity there and do not ye fire till i say so thus make welcome rudolph crawl toward a chink among the bag run the muzzle of he gun into place and lay ready for whatever might come out of the quake light and darkness beyond nothing come however except a swollen continuity of sound a roll cloud of noise thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder it be strange thought rudolph how nothing happen from moment to moment no yellow body come charge out of the hubbub he himself lay there unhurt he fellow joke grumble shift they leg on the platform at time the heavier duller sound which have be the signal for the whole disorder -- one ponderous beat as on a huge and very slack bass-drum -- tell that the black dog from rotterdam be not far off yet even then there follow no shock of round-shot batter at masonry but only a access of the stormy whistle and jingle copper cash declare the voice of heywood in a lull by the sound he be stand on the rung of the ladder with he head at the level of the platform also by the sound he be enjoy himself inordinately what a jolly good piece of luck scrap metal and copper cash firing money at we -- like you captain just what we think too some unruly gang among they would not wait and force matter tonight be premature the beggar have plenty of powder and little else so far rudolph listen in wonder here in the thick of the fight be a light-hearted busy commander draw conclusion and extract news from chaos look out for arrow continue the speaker as he crawl to a loophole between rudolph 's and the captain 's they be shoot arrow up over kill one convert and wound two there by the water gate they can not get the elevation for you chap here though and again he add cheerfully so far at least the little band behind the loophole lay watch through the smoke listen through the noise the black dog bark again and send a shower of money clink along the wall how do you like it rudie chuckle he friend it be terrible answer rudolph honestly terrible racket yes firework to frighten we wait till they ammunition come then you 'll see fun firework all this heywood turn to he other companion i say kneebone what be you idea snipe all night will it be -- or shall we get a fair chance at 'em the captain a small white recumbent spectre lift he head and appear to sniff the smoke judicially they get a chance at we more like he grumble my opinion the blighter have shoot and burn themselves into a state o ' mind bloomin ' delusion o ' grandeur that be what wildest of 'em will rush we to-night once -- maybe twice we stave 'em off say : that case they 'll settle down to starve we right and proper siege assent heywood siege like you read about the captain lay flat again wish a man could smoke up here heywood laugh and turn he head : -- how much do you know about siege old chap nothing rudolph confess nor i worse luck outside of school -- _ testudine facium _ that sort of thing however he go on cheerfully we shall before long -- he break off with a start rudie by jove i forget do you find they where 's bertha forrester go say rudolph and struggle to explain find he late adventure shrink into the compass of a few word far too small and bare to suggest the magnitude of he decision they go he begin in a boat -- he be save the trouble for suddenly captain kneebone cry in a voice of keen satisfaction here they come i tell ye -- and fire he rifle through a patch of firelight down the gentle slope of the field sweep a ragged cohort of man some bare-headed some in they scarlet nightcap as though they have escape from bed and all yell one of the foremost who meet the captain 's bullet be carry stumble he own length before he sink underfoot as the mauser flash from between the sand-bags another and another man fall to he knee or topple sidelong trip he fellow into a little knot or windrow of kick arm and leg but the main wave pour on all the faster among and above they like wreckage in that surf toss the shape of scaling-ladder and notch bamboo two naked man swing between they a long cylinder or log flash through the bonfire space and on into the dark below the wall pung-dong bawl the captain look out for the pung-dong he friend be too busy firing into the crowded gloom below rudolph fumble at side-bolt and pull trigger feel the end of a ladder bump he forehead see turban and mediaeval halberd heave above he and without time to think of firing dash the muzzle of he gun at the climber 's face the shock be solid the halberd ring on the platform but the man vanish like a shade very neat growl heywood who in the same instant with a great shove manage to fling down the ladder perfectly silly attack we 'll hold 'em while he speak however something hurtle over they head and thump the platform the queer log or cylinder lay there with a red coal sputter at one end a burning fuse heywood snatch at it and miss some one else catch up the long bulk and spring to he foot swing it aloft firelight show the bristle moustache of kempner he long thin arm poise a great bamboo case bind with ring of leather or metal he throw it out with he utmost force stagger as though to follow it then leap back straighten he tall body with a jerk fling out one arm in a gesture of surprise no sooner rigid than droop and even while he seem inflate for another of he speech turn half-round and dive into the garden and the night by the ending of it he have redeem a somewhat rancid life before the angle be alive with swarm head as he fall it be empty and the assault finish for below the bamboo tube burst with a sound that shake the wall liquid flame the greek fire of stink-pot chemical squirt in jet that reveal a crowd tear asunder saffron face contorted in shout and man who leap away with clothes afire and powder-horns bursting at they side dim figure scamper off up the rise ground that be over pant heywood thunder good lesson -- here count nose rudie right-oh sturgeon teppich padre captain good but look sharp while i go inspect he whisper to rudolph come down will not you and help I with -- you know at the foot of the ladder they meet a man in white with a white face in what might be the dawn or the pallor of the late-risen moon be hackh there he hail they in a dry voice and clear he throat where be she where 's my wife it be here accordingly while heywood stoop over a tumbled object on the ground that rudolph tell she husband what bertha forrester have choose the word come harder than before but at last he get rid of they he questioner stand very still it be like tell the news of a absent ghost to another present this town be never a place say gilly with all he former steadiness -- never a place to bring a woman and -- and of she age all three man listen to the conflict of gong and cracker and to the shout now muffle and distant behind the knoll all three as it seem to rudolph have consent to ignore something vile that be all i want to know say the older man slowly i must get back to my post you do not say but -- she make no attempt to come here well that be -- that be lucky i 'll go back for some time again they stand as though listen till heywood speak : -- hold you own be you by the water gate oh yes reply forrester rousing slightly all quiet there no more arrow convert behave splendidly two or three have beg for gun give 'em this heywood skip up the ladder to return with a rifle and this belt -- kempner 's poor chap he 'll never ask you to return they -- anything else no answer gilly take the dead man 's weapon and move off into the darkness no except -- he halt except if we come to a pinch and need a man for some tight place then give I first chance will not you i could do better now than -- than you younger man oh and hackh you effort to-night -- well few man would have dare and i feel immensely grateful he disappear among the orange tree leave rudolph to think about such gratitude now then call heywood and stoop to the white bundle at they foot do not stand look can not be help trust old gilly to take it like a man come bear a hand and between they the two friend carry to the nunnery a tiresome theorist who have act once and now himself tired and limp would offend no more by speak when the dawn fill the compound with a deep blue twilight and this in turn grow pale the night-long menace of noise gradually fade also like a orgy of evil spirit disperse before cockcrow to ear long deafen the wide stillness have the effect of another sound never hear before even when disturb by the flutter of bird dart from top to dense green top of the orange tree the air seem hush by some unholy constraint through the cool morning vapor hot smoke from smoulder wreckage mount thin and straight toward where the pale disk of the moon dissolve in light the convex field stand bare except for a few overthrow scarecrow in naked yellow or dusty blue and for a jagged strip of earthwork tear from the crest over which the black dog thrust he round muzzle in a truce of empty silence the defender sleep by turn among the sand-bag the day come and drag by without incident the sun blaze in the compound swinging overhead and slant down through the afternoon at the water gate rudolph heywood and the padre with a few forlorn christian -- drive in like sheep at the last moment -- be build a rough screen against the arrow that have fly in darkness and that now lay scatter along the path one of these a workman suddenly catch at and with a grunt hold up before the padre the head be blunt about the shaft wound tightly with silk thread run a thin roll of chinese paper dr earle nod take the arrow and slit with a pocket-knife free and flatten out a paint scroll of complex character he keen old eye run down the column he face always cloudy now grow darker with perplexity a message he declare slowly i think a serious message he sit down on a pile of sack and spread the paper on he knee but the character be so elaborate -- i can not make head or tail he beckon heywood and together they scowl at the intricate and meaningless symbol all alike complain the younger man maddening then he face light no see here -- lower leave hand the last stroke of the brush down in the corner form a loose o w from wutzler must mean something for all that the paint line remain a stubborn puzzle something yes but what the padre pull out a cigar and smoking at top speed space off each character with he thumb they be all alike and yet -- he clutch he white hair with big knuckle and tug replace he mushroom helmet hold the paper at a new focus ah he say doubtfully and at last yes for some time he read to himself nod a triad cipher well resume heywood patiently the reader point with he cigar take only the left half of that word and what have you ` lightning ' read heywood the right half ` boat ' take the padre order this one leave half ` lightning ' repeat he pupil the right half -- might be ` rice-scoop ' but that be nonsense no say the padre you have the secret it be good triad write subtract this twisted character ` lightning ' from each and we have make the crooked straight the writer be afraid of be catch here be the sense of he message i take it and he read off slowly : -- a hakka boat on opposite shore a green flag and a rice-scoop hoist at she mast light a fire on the water-gate step and she will come quickly day or night -- ow heywood take the news coldly he shake he head and stand think that will not help he say curtly never in the world with the aid of a convert he unbar the ponderous gate and venture out on the highest slab of the landing-step across the river to be sure there lay -- between a local junk and a stray _ papico _ from the north -- the high-nosed hakka boat she deck roof with tawny basket-work and at she masthead a wooden rice-measure dangle below a green rag aft by the great steering-paddle perch a man motionless yet seem to watch heywood turn however and point downstream to where at the bend of the river a little spit of mud run out from the marsh on the spit from among tussock a man in a round hat spring up like a thin black toadstool he wave a arm and give a shrill cry summon help from further inland other hat presently come bob toward he low down among the marsh puff of white spurt out from the mud and as heywood dodge back through the gate and nesbit 's rifle answer from he little fort on the pony-shed the distant crack of the musket join with a spattering of ooze and a chip of stone on the river-stair cover you see say heywood replace the bar last resort perhaps that way still we may as well keep a bundle of firewood ready here the shot from the marsh though trivial and scattering be like a signal for all about the nunnery from a ring of hiding-place the noise of last night break out afresh the sun lower through a brown burnt haze the night speed up from the ocean cover the sky with sudden darkness in which star appear many and cool above the torrid earth and the insensate turmoil so without change but from pause to outbreak outbreak to pause night and day go by in the siege nothing happen one morning indeed the fragment of another blunt arrow come to light broken underfoot and trample into the dust the paper scroll in tatters hold only a few mark legible through dirt and heel-print : listen -- work fast -- many bag -- watch closely and still nothing happen to explain the warning that night heywood even make a sortie and steal from the main gate with four coolie remove to the river certain relic that lay close under the wall and would soon become intolerable he have return safely with a ancient musket a bag of bullet a petroleum squirt and a small bundle of pole-axis and be make he tour of the defens when he stumble over rudolph who kneel on the ground under what in old day have be the chapel and near what now be kempner 's grave he be not kneel in devotion for he take heywood by the arm and make he stoop i be come he say to find you the first night i see coolie work in the clay-pit bend a moment over put now the ear close heywood lay he cheek in the dust they be keep such a racket outside he mutter and then half to himself : it certainly be rudie it be -- it be as if poor kempner be -- wake up he listen again you be right they be digging the two friend sit up and eye each other in the starlight chapter xix brother mole this new danger work below in the solid earth have throw rudolph into a state of sullen resignation what be the use now he think indignantly of all they watching and fight the ground at any moment might heave break and spring up underfoot he wait for he friend to speak out and put the same thought roundly into word instead to he surprise he hear something quite contrary now we know say heywood in lively satisfaction now we know what the beast have up they sleeve that be a comfort rather he sit think a white figure in the starlight cross-leg like a buddha that be why they have all be lie doggo he continue and then they bad marksmanship with all this sniping -- they do not care you see whether they pot we or not they would rather make one clean sweep and ` blow we at the moon ' eh cheer up rudie : so long as they be digging they be not blow be they while he speak the din outside the wall waver and sink at last give place to a shrill tiny interlude of insect voice in this dilute silence come now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark hospital room where miss drake be grope among she vial heywood listen if it be not for that he say quietly i should not much care except for the woman this would really be great lark then as a shadow flit past the orange grove he rouse himself to hail : ah pat go catchee four piecee coolie-man can do the shadow pass and after a time return with four other shadow they stand wait till heywood raise he head from the dust those noise have stop down there he say to rudolph and rise give he order briefly the coolie be to dig strike into the sapper ' tunnel and report at once : chop-chop -- meantime rudie let 's take a holiday we can smoke in the courtyard a solitary candle burn in the far corner of the inclosure and cast faint streamer of reflection along the wet flag which sluice with water from the well exhale a slight but grateful coolness heywood stoop above the quiver flame light a cigar and sink loosely into a chair blow the smoke upward in slow content luxury he yawn nothing to do nothing to fret about till the compradore report wonderful -- too good to be true for a long time lie side by side they might have be asleep through the dim light on the white wall dip and swerve the drunken shadow of a bat who now whirl as a flake of blackness across the star now swoop and set the humbler flame reel the flutter of he leathern wing and the plash of water in the dark where a coolie still drench the flag mark the sleepy soothing measure in a nocturne break at strangely regular interval by a shot and the crack of a bullet somewhere above in the desert chamber queer mused heywood drowsily study he watch the beggar put one shot every five minute through the same window -- i wonder what he be think about lie out there firing at the red-bristled ghost odd wonder what they be all -- he put back he cigar mumble handful of poor blackguard all upset in they mind and sweating round and all the rest tranquil as ever eh -- the whole country jogging on the same old way or asleep and dream dream perhaps same kind of dream they have in marco polo 's day the end of he cigar burn red again and again except for that he might have be asleep rudolph make no answer but lay think this brief moment of rest in the cool dim courtyard -- merely to lie there and wait -- seem precious above all other gain or knowledge some quiet influence a subtle and profound conviction slowly be at work in he it be patience wonder steady confidence -- all three and more he have feel it but this once obscurely might die without know it in clearer fashion and yet could never lose it or forget or come to any later harm with it the star above the dim vagary of the bat be brightly interwoven for the present he have only to lie ready and wait a single comrade in a happy army through a dark little door come miss drake all in white and move quietly like a symbolic figure of evening or the genius of the place she hair shine duskily as she bent beside the candle and with steady finger tilted a vial from which amber drop fall slowly into a glass with dark eye watch closely she have the air of a young beneficent medea intent on some white magic be not you come call heywood to sit with we awhile can not thanks she reply without look up i be too busy that be no excuse rest a little she move away carry she medicine but pause in the door smile back at he as from a crypt and say : -- have _ you _ be hurt only my feeling i have no time she laugh for lazy able-bodied person and she be go in the darkness to sit by she wounded man with she go the interval of peace for past the well-curb come another figure scuff slowly toward the light the compradore he robe lose in they background appear as a oily face and a hand beckon with downward sweep the two friend rise and follow he down the courtyard in pass out they discover the padre 's wife lie exhaust in a low chair of which she fill half the length and all the width heywood pause beside she with some friendly question to which rudolph catch the answer oh quite compose she voice sound fretful she fan stir weakly yes wonderfully compose i feel quite ready to suffer for the faith dear mr earle say the young man gently there ought to be no need nobody shall suffer if we can prevent i think we can under the orange tree he lay a unsteady hand on rudolph 's arm and halt shake with quiet merriment poor dear lady he whisper and go forward chuckle loose earth underfoot warn they not to stumble over the new-raised mound beside the pit which yawn slightly blacker than the night kempner 's grave have not be quieter the compradore stand whispering : they have find the tunnel empty because he think the sapper be go out to eat they chow we 'll see anyway say heywood strip off he coat he climb over the mound grasp the edge and promptly disappear in the long moment which follow the earth might have close on he once as rudolph bent listen over the shaft there seem to come a faint momentary gleam but no sound and no further sign until the head and shoulder burrow up again big enough hole down there he report swing clear and sit with he foot in the shaft regular cave three sack of powder stow already so we be none too soon -- one sack be leaky i strike a match and nearly blow myself to casabianca he pause as if reflect it give we a plan though rudie : be you game for something rather foolhardy be frank now for if you would not really enjoy it i 'll give old gilly forrester he chance no say rudolph sting as by some perfidy you make I -- ashamed this be all ours this part so can do laugh the other get off you jacket give I half a moment start so that you will not jump on my head and he go wriggle down into the pit a unwholesome smell of wet earth a damp subterranean coolness envelop rudolph as he slide down a flue of greasy clay and stoop crawl into the horizontal bear of the tunnel large enough perhaps for two or three man to pass on all fours it run level roughly cut through earth wet with seepage from the river but pack into a smooth floor by many hand and bare knee it widen suddenly before he in the small chamber of the mine choke with the smell of stale betel he bump heywood 's elbow some fragrant one have be work here i should say the speaker pat the ground with quick palm grope phew they have work like steam this explain old wutz and he broken arrow i say rudie feel about i see a coil of fuse lie somewhere -- at least i think it be ah never mind : have-got he pull something along the floor how 's the old forearm i give you i forget that equal to haul a sack out good catch hold here sweep he hand in the darkness he capture rudolph 's and guide it to where a powder-bag lay now then carry on he command and crawl into the tunnel fling back fragment of explanation as he tug at he own load carry these out -- far as we dare -- touch 'em off you see and block the passage far out as possible though we can use this hole afterward for listen in if they try -- he cut the sentence short they tunnel have begin to slope gently downward with niche gouge here and there for the passing of burden-bearer rudolph toiling after suddenly find he head entangled between he leader 's boot quiet he hear he whisper somebody come a instant later the boot withdraw quickly a odd little squeak of surprise follow a strange gurgling and a succession of rapid shock as though some one be pummel the earthen wall get the beggar pant heywood only one of 'em roll clear rudie and let we pass collar he leg if you can and shove squeeze past rudolph in he niche there struggle a convulsive bulk like some monstrous worm too large for the bear yet writhe bare foot kick he in violent rebellion and a muscular knee jar squarely under he chin he catch a pair of naked leg and hug they dearly not too hard call heywood with a breathless laugh poor devil -- must think he run foul of a genie indeed they prisoner have already give up the conflict and lay under they with limb dissolve and quake pass he along chuckle he captor make he go ahead of we prod into action the man stir limply and crawl past they toward the mine while heywood at he heel growl order in the vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity in this order they gain the shaft and wriggle up like ferret into the night air rudolph standing as in a well hear a volley of question and a few timid answer before the return leg of he comrade warn he to dodge back into the tunnel again the two man creep forward on they expedition and this time the leader talk without lower he voice that chap he declare be fairly chatter with fright coolie it seem who come back to find he betel-box the rest be all outside eat they rice we have a clear track they stumble on they powder-sack catch hold and drag they at first easily down the incline then over a short level then arduously up a rise grade till the work grow heavy and hot and breath come hard in the stifled burrow far enough say heywood puff pile yours here rudolph however be not only drench with sweat but fire by a new spirit a spirit of daring he would try down here in the bowels of the earth to emulate he friend but let we reconnoitre he object it will bring we to the clay-pit where i see they digging let we go out to the end and look well say old mole heywood snap he finger with delight i never think of that by he tone he be proud of the amendment come on by all means i say i do not really -- i do not _ want _ poor old gilly down here you know they crawl on with more speed but no less caution up the strait little gallery which now rise between smooth soft wall of clay suddenly as the incline once more become a level they see a glimmer square of dusky red like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet cloth this while they shuffle toward it grow higher and broader until they lay prone in the very door of the hill -- a large square-cut portal deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit and flank with what seem a bulkhead of sand-bag pile in orderly tier between shadowy mound of loose earth flicker the light of a fire small and distant round which waver the inky silhouette of man and beyond which dimly shine a yellow face or two a yellow fist clutch full of boil rice like a snowball beyond these in turn gleam other little fire where other coolie be squat at they supper rudie look heywood 's voice tremble with joyful excitement look these bag not sand-bag at all it be powder old chap powder they whole supply wait a bit -- oh by jove wait a bit he scurry back into the hill like a great rat return as quickly and swiftly and with eager hand begin to uncoil something on the clay threshold do you know enough to time a fuse he whisper neither do i powder 's bad anyhow we must guess at it here quick lend I a knife he slash open one of the lower sack in the bulkhead by the door stuff in some kind of twisted cord and edge away sit for a instant with he knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight how long rudie how long he smother a groan too long or too short spoil everything oh well -- here go the blade move now lie across he order and shield the tandstickor with a sudden fuff the match blaze up to show he gray eye bright and dance he face glossy with sweat below on the golden clay the twisted lumpy tail of the fuse like the end of a dusty vine darkness follow quick and blind a rosy fitful coal sputter dart out short capillary line and needle of fire cut stick -- go like the devil if it blow up and cave the earth on we -- heywood run on hand and knee as if that be he natural way of go rudolph scramble after now urge by a ecstasy of apprehension now clog as by the weight of all the hill above they if it should fall now he think or now and thus measure as he crawl find the tunnel endless when at last however they gain the bottom of the shaft and be hoist out among they coolie on the shelve mound the evening stillness lay above and about they undisturbed the fuse could never have last all these minute they whole enterprise be but labor lose they listen breathing short no sound come go out say heywood gloomily or else they see it he climb the bamboo scaffold and stand look over the wall rudolph perched beside he -- by the same anxious futile instinct of curiosity for they could see nothing but the night and the burning star go out underground again rudie and try we first plan heywood turn to leap down the sword-pen look to set off he mine to-morrow morning he clutch the wall in time to save himself as the bamboo frame leap underfoot outside the crest of the slope run black against a single burst of flame the detonation come like the blow of a mallet on the rib let he look let he look heywood jump to the ground and in a pelt shower of clod exult : -- he look again and see it be the middle of next week come on brother mole spread the news he run off laughing in the wide hush of astonishment chapter xx the hakka boat pretty fair captain kneebone say but that be not the end this grudging praise -- in which moreover heywood tamely acquiesce -- be he only comment on rudolph it have singular effect : at first fill he with resentment and almost make he suspect the little captain of jealousy then amusing he as chance word of no weight but in the unreal day that follow recur to convince he with all the force of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge it help he to learn the cold salutary lesson that one exploit do not make a victory the spring of they countermine he find be no deliverance it have two plain result and no more : the crest of the high field without have change its contour next morning as though a monster have bite it and when the day have burn itself out in sullen darkness there burst on all side a attack of prolonged and furious exasperation the fusillade now come not only from the landward side but from a long flotilla of boat in the river and although these vanish at dawn the fire never slacken either from above the field or from a distant wall newly spot with loophole beyond the ash of the go-down on the night follow the boat creep closer and suddenly both gate resound with the blow of battering-ram these and later assault be beat off by daylight the nunnery wall be pit as with small-pox yet the little company remain untouched except for teppich whose shaven head be trim still closer and redder by a bullet and for gilbert forrester who show -- with the grave smile of a man when fate be playful -- two shot through he loose jacket he be the only man to smile for the other parch by day and swelter by night of battle question each other with hollow eye and sleepy voice one at a time in patch of hot shade they lay tumble for a moment of oblivion they back stud thickly with obstinate fly like the drive head of nail as thickly in the dust empty mauser cartridge lay glisten and i buy food mourn the captain chafe the untidy stubble on he cheek and stare gloomily down at the worthless brass i buy chow when all saigong be full o ' cartridge the sight of the spend ammunition at they foot give they more trouble than the swarm fly or the heat or the noise tear and splitting the heat even heywood go about with a hang-dog air speaking few word and those more and more surly once he laugh when at broad noonday a line of queer head pop up from the earthwork on the knoll and stick there tilted at odd angle as though peer quizzically both he laugh however and he one stare of scrutiny be fill with a savage contempt -- contempt not only for the stratagem but for himself the situation all thing dummy -- lay figure to draw we fire what a childish trick maskee he add wearily we could not waste a shot at 'em now even if they be real he grimy hearer nod mechanically they know without be tell that they should fire no more until at close quarter in some final rush only a few more round apiece he continue we friend outside must have run nearly as short accord to the coolie we take prisoner in the tunnel but they 'll get more supplies he say in a day or two what be worse he generalissimo fang expect big reinforcement any day from up country he tell I that a moment ago perhaps he be lie say captain kneebone drowsily wish he be snapped heywood no such luck too stupid that case grumble the captain we have better signal you hakka boat and clear out again they hollow eye question each other in discouragement it be plain that he have speak they general thought but they be all too hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety thus in stupor or doubt they watch another afternoon burn low by invisible degree like a great fire die another breathless evening settle over all -- at first with a dusty copper light widespread as though sky and land be see through smoked glass another dusk of deep sad blue and when this have give place to night another mysterious lull midnight draw on and no further change have come prowler make bold by the long silence in the nunnery come and go under the very wall of the compound in the court beside a candle ah pat the compradore sit with a bundle of halberd and a whetstone sharpen edge after edge placidly against the time when there should be no more cartridge heywood and rudolph stand near the water gate and argue with gilbert forrester who would not quit he post for either of they but i be not sleepy he repeat with perverse irritating serenity i be not i assure you and that river full of they boat -- go away while they reason and wrangle something scrape the edge of the wall they could barely detect a small stealthy movement above they as if a man climbing have lift he head over the top suddenly beside it flare a surprising torch rag burn greasily at the end of a long bamboo the smoky drip flame show no man there but only another long bamboo impale what might be another ball of rag the two pole sway inclined toward each other for one incredible instant the ball beside its glowing fellow shone pale and take on human feature black shadow fill the eye-socket and give to the face a uncertain cavernous look as though it see and ponder how long the apparition stay the three man could not tell for even after it vanish and the torch fall hiss in the river they stand below the wall dumb and sick know only that they have see the head of wutzler heywood be the first to make a sound -- a broken hypnotic sound without emphasis or inflection as though he lip be freeze or the word tear from he by ventriloquy we must get the woman -- out of here afterward when he be no longer with they he two friend recall that he never speak again that night but come and go in a kind of silent rage order coolie by dumb-show and carry armful after armful of supplies to the water gate he would neither pause nor answer the word pass or a listless tacit understanding that every one must hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile boat should leave the river if say gilly to rudolph while they stand think under the star if he boat be still there now that he -- after what we see at dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampan steal up-river on the early flood but of the mast that huddle in vapor by the farther bank they have no certainty until sunrise when the green rag and the rice-measure appear still dangle above the hakka boat even then it be not certain -- as captain kneebone sourly point out -- that she sailor would keep they agreement and when he have pile on the river-step the dry wood for they signal fire a new difficulty rise one of the wound convert be up and hobble with a stick but the other would never be ferry down any stream know to man he lay die and the padre could not leave he all the other wait ready and anxious but no one grumble because death never punctual now keep they wait the flutter of bird among the orange tree gradually cease the sun come slant over the eastern wall the gray floor of the compound turn white and blur through the dancing heat a torrid westerly breeze come fitfully rise die away rise again and make captain kneebone curse a fair wind lose he mutter next we 'll lose the ebb too be ` ange noon pass and mid-afternoon before the padre come out from the courtyard cover he white head with he ungainly helmet we may go now he say gravely in a few minute no more be need for the loose clod in the old shaft of they counter-mine be quickly handle and the necessary word soon utter captain kneebone have slip out through the water gate beforehand and light the fire on the step but not one of the burial party turn he head to watch the success or failure of they signal so long as the padre 's resonant bass continue when it cease however they return quickly through the little grove the captain open the great gate and look out eagerly crane to see through the smoke that pour into he face the waster he cry bitterly she be go the hakka boat have indeed vanish from she mooring on the bronze current nothing move but three fishing-boat drift down with the smoke toward the marsh and the bend of the river and a small junk that toil up against wind and tide a cluster of naked sailor tug and shove at she heavy sweep which chafe its rigging of dry rope and give out a high complain note like the cry of a sea-gull she be go repeated captain kneebone no boat for we but the compradore drag he bundle of sharp halberd poke a inquisitive head out past the captain 's and peer on all side through the smoke with comical thoroughness he dodge back grin and duck amiably moh bettah look-see he chuckle dat coolie come-back he too muchee waitee b ` long one piecee foolo-man he be wrong whoever handle the hakka boat be no fool but by work upstream on the opposite shore cross above and drop down with the ebb have craftily bring she along the shallow so close beneath the river-wall that not till now do even the little captain spy she the high prow the mast now bare and she round midship roof bright golden-thatched with leaf of the edible bamboo come move quiet as some enchanted boat in a calm the fugitive by the gate still think themselves abandon when she beak six foot in air steal past they and she lean boatman prod the river-bed with they pole stop she as easily as a gondola the yellow steersman grin strain at the pivot of he gigantic paddle good boy lowdah call kneebone remember _ you _ in my will too and the grin lowdah nod as though he understand they have now only to pitch they supplies through the smoke down on the loose board of she deck then -- rudolph and the captain kick the bonfire off the stair -- the whole company hurry down and safely over she gunwale : first the two woman then the few huddle convert the white man next the compradore still hug he pole-axis and last of all heywood still in strange apathy with haggard face and downcast eye he stumble aboard as though drunk he rifle askew under one arm and in the crook of the other flounce the fox-terrier dangling nervous and wide awake he look to neither right nor left meet nobody 's eye the rest of the company crowd into the house amidship and fling themselves down wearily in the grateful dusk where vivid painting and mystery of rude carve writhe on the fir bulkhead but heywood with he dog and the captain and rudolph sit in the hot sun stare down at the ramshackle deck through the gap in which rise all the stink of the sweating hold the boatman climb the high slant of the bow plant they stout bamboo against they shoulder and come slowly down head first like strain acrobat as slowly the boat begin to glide past the stair thus far though the fire lay scatter in the mud the smoke drift still before they and obscure they silent headlong transaction now thin as they drop below the corner of the wall it leave they naked to they enemy on the knoll at the same instant from the marsh ahead the sentinel in the round hat spring up again like a instantaneous mushroom he shout and wave to he fellow inland they have no time however to leave the high ground for the whole chance of the adventure take a sudden and amazing turn heywood spring out of he stupor and stand point look there he snarl those -- oh he end with a groan the face of he friend by torchlight above the wall have strike he dumb now that he speak he companion see expose in the field to the view of the nunnery a white body lie on a framework as on a bier near the foot stand a rough sort of windlass above on the crest of the field where a band of man have begin to scramble at the sentinel 's halloo there sit on a white pony the bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic fang the sword-pen he do it heywood 's hand open and shut rapidly like thing out of control oh wutz how do they -- saint somebody -- the martyrdom -- poussin 's picture in the vatican -- i can not stand this you chap he snatch blindly at he gun catch instead one of the compradore 's halberd and without pause or warning jump out into the shallow water he run splash toward the bank turn and seem to waver stare with wild eye at the strange tudor weapon in he hand then shake it savagely -- this will do he cry good-by everybody good-by he wheel again stagger to he foot on dry ground and run swiftly along the eastern wall up the rise field straight toward he mark of the man on the knoll a few fire and miss the other neutral to they will stand fix in wonder four or five as the runner near spring out to intercept but fly apart like ninepin the watcher in the boat see the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun the frightened pony swerve and he rider go down with the one sweep of that homeric blow the last they see of heywood he go leap from sight over the crest that swarm with figure race and stumble after the unheeded sentinel in the marsh flee lose he great hat as the boat drift round the point into midstream chapter xxi the dragon 's shadow the lowdah would have set he dirty sail without delay for the fair wind be already droop but at the first motion he find himself depose and a usurper in command at the big steering-paddle captain kneebone he cheek white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble of he beard have take charge in momentary danger of be cut off downstream or overtaken from above he keep the boat wait along the oozy shore pucker he eye he watch now the land and now the river silent furtive and keenly perplex he head on a swivel as though he steer by some nightmare chart or expect some instant and transform sight not until the sun touch the western hill and long shadow from the bank steal out and turn the stream from bright copper to vague iron-gray do he give over he watch he leave the tiller with a hopeless fling of the arm do as ye please he growl and cast himself down on deck by the thatched house go on -- i 'll never see _ he _ again -- the heat and all -- by the head he be -- go on that be all finish he sit look straight before he with dull eye that never move nor do he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the mat sail slowly hoist above he the quaggy bank now darken slide more rapidly astern while the steersman and he mate in the high bow invoke the wind with alternate chant plaintive mysterious and half musical : -- ay-ly-chy-ly ah-ha-aah to the listener huddle in silence the familiar cry become a long monotonous accompaniment to sad thought through the rhythm presently break a sound of small-arm -- a few shot quick but soften by distance from far inland the stillness of evening follow the captain stir listen drop he head and sit like stone to rudolph near he the brief disturbance call up another evening -- he first on this same river when from the grassy brink above he have first hear of he friend now at the same place and by the same light they have hear the last it be intolerable : he turn he back on the captain inside in the gloom of the paint cabin the padre 's wife begin suddenly to cry after a time the deep voice of she husband speak very low and to she alone become dimly audible : -- ` all this be come upon we yet have we not -- we heart be not turn back neither have we step decline -- though thou hast sore broken we in the place of dragon and cover we with the shadow of death ' the little captain groan and roll aside from the doorway all very fine he mutter he head wrap in he arm but that be no good to I i can not stand it whether she hear he or by chance miss drake come quietly from within and find a place between he and the gunwale he do not rouse she neither glance nor speak but lean against the rib of smooth-worn fir as though calmly wait when at last he look up to see she face and posture he give a angry start and i think he blurt be ` ange if sometimes i do not think you like he she dark eye meet the captain 's with a great and steadfast clearness no she whisper it be more than that the captain sit bolt upright but no longer in condemnation for a long time he watch she marveling and when finally he speak he sharp domineering voice be lower almost gentle always talk too much he say do not mind I my dear i never mean -- do not ye mind a rough old beggar that do not know that have not one thing more between he and the grave not a thing -- but money and that now -- i wish ' t be at the bottom o ' this bloomin ' river they say no more but rest side by side like old friend join closer by new grief flounce the terrier snuff disconsolately about the deck and scratch the board in she zeal to explore the shallow hold at last grow weary and come to snuggle down between the two silent companion not till then do the girl turn aside she face as though study the shore which now melt in a soft half-liquid band as black as coal-tar above the luminous indigo of the river suddenly rudolph get upon he foot and crane outboard from gunwale and thatched eaves look steadily forward into the dusk a chatter of angry voice come steal up in the pause of the wind he watch and listen then quickly draw in he head sit quiet he say a boat full of man i do not like they look two or three of the voice hail together raucously the steersman lean on the loom of he paddle make neither stir nor answer they hail again this time close aboard and as it seem in rage glance contemptuously to starboard the lowdah make some negligent reply about a cargo of human hair he indifference appear so real that for a moment rudolph suspect he : perhaps he have be buy over and this meeting arrange the think however be unjust the voice begin to drop astern and to come in louder confusion with the breeze but at this point flounce the terrier spoil all by whipping up beside the lowdah and furiously bark hers be no pariah 's yelp : she bark with spirit in the king 's english for answer there come a shout a sharp report and a bullet that rip through the matting sail the steersman duck but cling bravely to he paddle man tumble out from the cabin rifle in hand to join rudolph and the captain astern dangerously near they see the hostile craft small but listed heavily with crowd ruffian pack so close that they great wicker hat hang along the gunwale to save room and shone dim in the obscurity like golden shield of viking a squat burly fellow shout jam the yulow hard to bring she about save you fire call captain kneebone no shot to waste sit tight as he speak however a active form bounce up beside the squat man at the sweep -- a plump muscular little barefoot woman in blue she tear the fellow 's hand away and take command keep the boat 's nose point up-river and squalling ferocious order to all on board the pretty lily cry rudolph this small nimble capable creature could be no one but mr wu they friend and gossip of that morning long ago the squat man give a angry shout and turn on she to wrest away the handle he fail at once and for all with great violence yet with a neat economy of motion the pretty lily take one hand from she tiller long enough to topple he overboard with a sound splash she passenger at so prompt and visual a joke burst into shrill cackle laughter yet more shrill before they mood could alter the pretty lily scourge they with the tongue of a humorous woman she hold she course moreover the two boat drift so quickly apart that when she turn to fling a comic farewell after the white man they could no more than descry she face alert and comely and the whiteness of she tooth she laughing cry still ring the overthrow leader still flounder in the water when the picture blur and vanish down the wind come she word high voluble quell all further mutiny aboard that craft of hers we owe this to you the tall padre eye rudolph with sudden interest and lay he big hand on the young man 's shoulder do you catch what she say you make a good friend there no answer rudolph and shake he head sadly we owe that to -- some one else later while they drift down to meet the sea and the night he tell the story to which all listen with profound attention wonder at the turn of fortune and at this last service render by a friend they should see no more they murmur awhile by two and three huddle in corner then lay silent exhaust in body and spirit the river melt with the shore into a common blackness faintly hover over by the hot brown sullen evening unchallenged the hakka boat flit past the light of a war-junk so close that the curved lantern-rib flicker thin and sharp against a smoky gleam and tawny face waver thick of lip and stolid of eye round the supper fire a greasy bitter smell of cooking float after then no change or break in the darkness except a dim lantern or two creep low in a sampan with a fragment of talk from unseen passer until as the star multiply overhead the night of the land roll heavily astern and away from another wider night the stink of the marsh fail and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and sea-room the voyager know that they have gain the roadstead ahead far off and lustrous a new field of star hang scarce higher than they gunwale above the rim of the world the lowdah show no light and presently none be need for -- as the shallows give place to deep -- the ocean boil with the hoary green-gold magic of phosphorus that heave alongside in soft explosion of witch-fire and send uncertain smoky tremor play through the darkness on deck rudolph watch this tropic miracle could make out the white figure of the captain asleep near by under the faint semicircle of the deck-house and across from he miss drake still sit upright as though wait with flounce at she side landward against the last sage-green vapor of daylight run the dim range of the hill in long undulation break by sharper crest like the finny back of leviathan basking over there think rudolph beyond that black shape as beyond its guard dragon lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire with uncounted life go on end beginning as though he and he sore loss and he heart vacant of all but grief belong to some unheard-of alien process to nature 's most unworthy trifling this boatload of man and woman -- so huge a part of he own experience -- be like the tiniest barnacle chafe from the side of that dark serene monster rudolph stare long at the hill and as they fade hang he head from that dragon he have learn much yet now all learning be but loss of a sudden the girl speak in a clear yet guard voice too low to reach the sleeper what be you think of she say come tell I it will be good for both of we rudolph cross silently and stand lean on the gunwale beside she i think only he answer how much the hill look so -- as a dragon how strange the tremble phosphorus half-revealed she face pale and still i be think of that in a way it remind I of what he say once -- when we be walk together to they great relief they find themselves talk of heywood sadly but freely and as it be in a sudden calm they friendship seem for the moment a thing as long establish as the dragon hill year afterward rudolph recall she word plainer than the fiery wonder that spread and burst round they little vessel or the long play of heat-lightning which now from time to time waver instantly along the eastern sea-line you be right she declare once to go on with life even when we be alone -- you will go on i know bravely and again she say : yes such man as he be -- a sort of happy warrior and later in she slow and level voice : you learn something you say be not that -- what i call -- be invulnerable when a man 's greater than anything that happen to he -- so they talk they speech bare and simple but the pause and longer silence fill with deep understanding solemnize by the time and the place as though they two lonely spirit catch wisdom from the night scope from the silent ocean light from the flicker east the flash meanwhile come faster and prolong they glory run behind a thin dead screen of scalloped cloud pierce the tropic sky with summer blue and rip out the lose horizon like a long black fiber from pulp the two friend watch in silence when rudolph rise and move cautiously aft good-night he whisper you must sleep now that be not however the reason so long as the boil witch-fire turn they wake to golden vapor he could not be sure but whenever the heat-lightning run and through the sere phantasmal sail the lookout in the bow flash like a sharp silhouette through wire gauze -- then it seem to rudolph that another small black shape leap out astern and vanish he stand by the lowdah watch anxiously time and again the ocean flicker into view like the floor of a measureless cavern and still he could not tell but at last the lowdah also turn he head and murmur they boat creak monotonously drift to leeward in a riot of golden mist yet now another creak disturbed the night in a different cadence another boat follow they rowing fast and gain in a brighter flash she black sail flutter unmistakable rudolph reach for he gun but wait silently he would not call out some chance fisherman it might be or any small craft hold the same course along the coast still he do not like the hurry of the sweep which presently groan louder and throw up nebulous fire the stranger 's bow become a arrowhead of run gold and here be flounce ready to misbehave once more before he could catch she the small white body of the terrier whip by he and past the steersman this time however as though cow she begin to whimper and then maintain a long tremble whine beside rudolph the compradore 's head bob up allo same she mastah come and in he native tongue ah pat grumble something about ghost a harsh voice hail from the boat astern the lowdah answer and so rapidly slide the deceptive glimmer of she bow that before rudolph know whether to wake he friend or could recover next from the shock and ecstasy of unbelief a tall white figure jump or swarm over the side by jove my dream sound the voice of heywood gravely with finger that drip gold he try to pat the bound terrier she fly up at he and tumble back in the liveliest danger of fall overboard old girl -- my dream the figure rise hallo rudie in a daze rudolph grip the wet and shine hand and hear the same quiet voice : rest all asleep i suppose do not wake 'em to-morrow will do -- have you any money on you toss that fisherman -- whatever you think i be worth he really row like steam you know rudolph flung he purse into the other boat when he turn this man restore from the sea have disappear but he have only steal forward dog in arm to sit beside miss drake so quietly have all happen that none of the sleeper not even the captain be aware rudolph draw near the two murmur voice -- could not help it honestly say heywood can not describe or explain just something -- go black inside my head you know he pause no : do not recall see a thing really until i pitch away the -- what happen to be in my hand a blank all that lose you head i suppose they call it most extraordinary the girl 's question recall he from he puzzle do oh he dispose of the subject easily i run that be all -- oh yes but i run faster -- not half so many as you would suppose most of 'em be away burn you hospital see the smoke as i run all go but a handful hence those stuff hat rudie in the trench -- only three of the lot could run i merely scuttle into the next bamboo and keep on scuttle no : they be not half loaded oh yes arrow in the shoulder -- scratch of course when it come dark i stop run and make for the nearest fisherman that be all but protest rudolph wonder we hear shot yes i have my webley in my belt fortunately i _ tell _ you : three of they could run the speaker pat the terrier in he lap my dream eh little dog you _ be _ the only one to know no say the girl : i know -- all the time that -- whatever she mean rudolph could only guess but it be true he think that she have never once speak as though the present meeting be not possible here or somewhere recall this he suddenly but quietly step away aft to sit beside the steersman and smile in the darkness the two voice flow on he do not listen but watch the phosphorus welling soft and turbulent in the wake and far off in glimpse of the tropic light the great dragon weltering on the face of the water the shape glimmer forth die away like a prodigy how run the verse ich lieg ' und besitze lass mich schlafen and yet think the young man i have one pearl from he hoard that girl be right : like siegfry temper in the grisly flood the raw boy be turn into a man seasoned and invulnerable heywood be call to he : -- you must go home with we do you hear i have make a wonderful plan -- with the captain 's fortune dear old kneebone a small white heap across the deck begin to rise how often complain a voice blur with sleep how often must i tell ye -- wake I unless the ship -- chart 's all -- good god at the captain 's cry those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof begin to mutter to rise and grope out into the tremble light with sleepy cry of joy end of the project gutenberg ebook of dragon 's blood by henry milner
