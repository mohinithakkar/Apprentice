virtue of the young marcellus and bidding flower be strew with full hand over he early grave we might apply the expression to the present occasion but it would be true in part only we can no longer do anything for he who be depart but we may do what will not be without fruit to those who remain it be good to occupy we thought with the example of great talent in conjunction with great virtue he genius have pass away with he but we may learn from the history of he life to employ the faculty we possess with useful activity and noble aim we may copy he magnanimous frankness he disdain of everything that wear the faintest semblance of deceit he refusal to comply with current abuse and the courage with which on all occasion he assert what he deem truth and combate what he think error the circumstance of cooper 's early life be remarkably suit to confirm the natural hardihood and manliness of he character and to call forth and exercise that extraordinary power of observation which accumulate the material afterwards wield and shape by he genius he father while a inhabitant of burlington in new jersey on the pleasant bank of the delaware be the owner of large possession on the border of the otsego lake in we own state and here in the newly-cleared field he build in 1786 the first house in cooperstown to this home cooper who be bear in burlington in the year 1789 be convey

of this place cooper although early remove from it to pursue he study be a occasional resident throughout he life and here he last year be wholly pass at the age of thirteen he be send to yale college where notwithstanding he extreme youth -- for with the exception of the poet hillhouse he be the youngest of he class and hillhouse be afterwards withdraw -- he progress in he study be say to have be honorable to he talent he leave the college after a residence of three year and become a midshipman in the united state navy six year he follow the sea and there yet wander among those who be fond of literary anecdote a story of the young sailor who in the street of one of the english port attract the curiosity of the crowd by explain to he companion a latin motto in some public place that during this period he make himself master of the knowledge and the imagery which he afterwards employ to so much advantage in he romance of the sea the finest ever write be a common and obvious remark but it have not be so far as i know observe that from the discipline of a seaman 's life he may have derive much of he readiness and fertility of invention much of he skill in surround the personage of he novel with imaginary peril and rescue they by probable expedient of all pursuit the life of a sailor be that which familiarize man to danger in its most fearful shape most cultivate presence of mind and most effectually call forth the resource of a prompt and fearless dexterity by which imminent evil be avoid in 1811 cooper have resign he post as midshipman begin the year by marry miss delaney sister of the present bishop of the diocese of western new york and enter upon a domestic life happily pass to its close he go to live at mamaroneck in the county of westchester and while here he write and publish the first of he novel entitle _ precaution _ concern the occasion of write this work it be related that once as he be read a english novel to mr cooper who have within a short time past be lay in the grave beside she illustrious husband and of whom we may now say that she goodness be no less eminent than he genius he suddenly lay down the book and say i believe i could write a better myself almost immediately he compose a chapter of a project work of fiction and read it to the same friendly judge who encourage he to finish it and when it be complete suggest its publication of this he have at the time no intention but he be at length induce to submit the manuscript to the examination of the late charle wilke of this city in whose literary opinion he have great confidence mr wilke advise that it should be publish and to these circumstance we owe it that cooper become a author i confess i have merely dip into this work the experiment be make with the first edition deform by a strange punctuation -- a profusion of comma and other pause which puzzle and repel I its author many year afterwards revise and republish it correct this fault and some fault of style also so that to a casual inspection it appear almost another work it be a profess delineation of english manners though the author have then see nothing of english society it have however the honor of be adopt by the country whose manners it describe and be early republish in great britain pass from the first for a english novel i be not unwilling to believe what be say of it that it contain a promise of the power which its author afterwards put forth thirty year ago in the year 1821 and in the thirty-second of he life cooper publish the first of the work by which he will be know to posterity the _ spy _ it take the reading world by a kind of surprise its merit be acknowledge by a rapid sale the public read with eagerness and the critic wonder many withhold they commendation on account of defect in the plot or blemish in the composition arise from want of practice and some wait till they could hear the judgment of european reader yet there be not want critic in this country of whose good opinion any author in any part of the world might be proud who speak of it in term it deserve be you not delighted write a literary friend to I who have since rise to high distinction as a writer both in verse and in prose be you not delighted with the _ spy _ as a work of infinite spirit and genius in that word genius lay the explanation of the hold which the work have take on the mind of man what it have of excellence be peculiar and unborrowed its picture of life whether in repose or activity be draw with broad light and shadow immediately from live original in nature or in he own imagination to he whatever he describe be true it be make a reality to he by the strength with which he conceive it he power in the delineation of character be show in the principal personage of he story harvey birch on whom though he have choose to employ he in the ignoble office of a spy and endow he with the quality necessary to he profession -- extreme circumspection fertility in stratagem and the art of conceal he real character -- quality which in conjunction with selfishness and greediness make the scoundrel he have bestow the virtue of generosity magnanimity a intense love of country a fidelity not to be corrupt and a disinterestedness beyond temptation out of this combination of quality he have work a character which be a favorite in all nation and with all class of mankind it be say that if you cast a pebble into the ocean at the mouth of we harbor the vibration make in the water pass gradually on till it strike the icy barrier of the deep at the south pole the spread of cooper 's reputation be not confine within narrower limit the _ spy _ be read in all the write dialect of europe and in some of those of asia the french immediately after its first appearance give it to the multitude who read they far-diffused language and place it among the first work of its class it be render into castilian and pass into the hand of those who dwell under the beam of the southern cross at length it pass the eastern frontier of europe and the latest record i have see of its progress towards absolute universality be contain in a statement of the _ international magazine _ derive i presume from its author that in 1847 it be publish in a persian translation at ispahan before this time i doubt not they be read it in some of the language of hindostan and if the chinese ever translate anything it would be in the hand of the many million who inhabit the far cathay i have speak of the hesitation which american critic feel in admit the merit of the _ spy _ on account of crudity in the plot or the composition some of which no doubt really exist a exception must be make in favor of the _ port folio _ which in a notice write by mr sarah hall mother of the editor of that periodical and author of _ conversation on the bible _ give the work a cordial welcome and cooper as i be inform never forget this act of timely and ready kindness it be perhaps favorable to the immediate success of the _ spy _ that cooper have few american author to divide with he the public attention that crowd of clever man and woman who now write for the magazine who send out volume of essay sketch and poem and who supply the press with novel biography and historical work be then for the most part either stammer they lesson in the school or yet unborn yet it be worthy of note that just about the time that the _ spy _ make its appearance the dawn of what we now call we literature be just break the conclude number of dana 's _ idle man _ a work neglect at first but now number among the best thing of the kind in we language be issue in the same month the _ sketch book _ be then just complete the world be admire it and its author be meditate _ bracebridge hall _ miss sedgwick about the same time make she first essay in that charming series of novel of domestic life in new england which have gain she so high a reputation percival now unhappily silent have just put to press a volume of poem i have a copy of a edition of hallock 's _ fanny _ publish in the same year the poem of _ yamoyden _ by eastburn and sand appear almost simultaneously with it livingston be put the finish hand to he _ report on the penal code of louisiana _ a work write with such grave persuasive eloquence that it belong as much to we literature as to we jurisprudence other contemporaneous american work there be now less read paul allen 's poem of _ noah _ be just lay on the counter of the bookseller arden publish at the same time in this city a translation of ovid 's _ tristium _ in heroic verse in which the complaint of the effeminate roman poet be render with great fidelity to the original and sometimes not without beauty if i may speak of myself it be in that year that i timidly intrust to the wind and wave of public opinion a small cargo of my own -- a poem entitle _ the age _ and half a dozen shorter one in a thin duodecimo volume print at cambridge we have at the same time work of elegant literature fresh from the press of great britain which be still read and admire barry cornwall then a young suitor for fame publish in the same year he _ marcium colonna _ byron in the full strength and fertility of he genius give the reader of english he tragedy of _ marino faliero _ and be in the midst of he spirited controversy with bowle concern the poetry of pope the _ spy _ have to sustain a comparison with scott 's _ antiquary _ publish simultaneously with it and with lockhart 's _ valerius _ which seem to I one of the most remarkable work of fiction ever compose in 1823 and in he thirty-fourth year cooper bring out he novel of the _ pioneer _ the scene of which be lay on the border of he : own beautiful lake in a recent survey of mr cooper 's work by one of he admirer it be intimate that the reputation of this work may have be in some degree factitious i can not think so i can not see how such a work could fail of become sooner or later a favorite it be several year after its first appearance that i read the _ pioneer _ and i read it with a delighted astonishment here say i to myself be the poet of rural life in this country -- we hesiod we theocritus except that he write without the restraint of number and be a greater poet than they in the _ pioneer _ as in a move picture be make to pass before we the hardy occupation and spirited amusement of a prosperous settlement in a fertile region encompass for league around with the primeval wilderness of wood the season in they different aspect bring with they they different employment forest fall before the axe the cheerful population with the first mild day of spring engage in the sugar orchard the chase of the deer through the deep wood and into the lake turkey-shooting during the christmas holiday in which the indian marksman vie for the prize of skill with the white man swift sleigh ride under the bright winter sun and perilous encounter with wild animal in the forest these and other scene of rural life draw as cooper know how to draw they in the bright and healthful coloring of which he be master be interweave with a regular narrative of human fortune not unskilfully construct and how could such a work be otherwise than popular in the _ pioneer _ leatherstocking be first introduce -- a philosopher of the wood ignorant of book but instruct in all that nature without the aid of science could reveal to the man of quick sens and inquire intellect whose life have be pass under the open sky and in companionship with a race whose animal perception be the acutest and most cultivate of which there be any example but leatherstocking have higher quality in he there be a genial blending of the gentlest virtue of the civilized man with the better nature of the aboriginal tribe all that in they be noble generous and ideal be adopt into he own kindly character and all that be evil be reject but why should i attempt to analyze a character so familiar leatherstocking be acknowledge on all hand to be one of the noblest as well as most striking and original creation of fiction in some of he subsequent novel cooper -- for he have not yet attain to the full maturity of he power -- heighten and ennoble he first conception of the character but in the _ pioneer _ it dazzle the world with the splendor of novelty he next work be the _ pilot _ in which he show how from the vicissitude of a life at sea its peril and escape from the beauty and terror of the great deep from the working of a vessel on a long voyage and from the frank brave and generous but peculiar character of the seaman may be draw material of romance by which the mind of man may be as deeply move as by anything in the power of romance to present in this walk cooper have have many disciple but no rival all who have since write romance of the sea have be but traveller in a country of which he be the great discoverer and none of they all seem to have love a ship as cooper love it or have be able so strongly to interest all class of reader in its fortune among other personage draw with great strength in the _ pilot _ be the general favorite tom coffin the thorough seaman with all the virtue and one or two of the infirmity of he profession superstitious as seaman be apt to be yet whose superstition strike we as but a irregular growth of he devout recognition of the power who hold the ocean in the hollow of he hand true-hearted gentle full of resource collect in danger and at last calmly perish at the post of duty with the vessel he have long guide by what i may call a great and magnanimous death he rougher and coarser companion boltrope be draw with scarcely less skill and with a no less vigorous hand the _ pioneer _ be not cooper 's best tale of the american forest nor the _ pilot _ perhaps in all respects he best tale of the sea yet if he have cease to write here the measure of he fame would possibly have be scarcely less ample than it now be neither of they be far below the best of he production and in they appear the two most remarkable creation of he imagination -- two of the most remarkable character in all fiction it be about this time that my acquaintance with cooper begin a acquaintance of more than a quarter of a century in which he deportment towards I be that of unvaried kindness he then reside a considerable part of the year in this city and here he have found a weekly club to which many of the most distinguished man of the place belong of the member who have since pass away be chancellor kent the jurist wiley the intelligent and liberal bookseller henry d sedgwick always active in scheme of benevolence jarvi the painter a man of infinite humor whose jest awake inextinguishable laughter de kay the naturalist sand the poet jacob harvey whose genial memory be cherish by many friend of those who be yet live be morse the inventor of the electric telegraph durand then one of the first of engraver and now no less illustrious as a painter henry jame anderson whose acquirement might awaken the envy of the ripest scholar of the old world halleck the poet and wit verplanck who have give the world the best edition of shakspeare for general reader dr king now at the head of columbium college and he two immediate predecessor in that office i might enlarge the list with many other name of no less distinction the army and navy contribute they proportion of member whose name be on record in we national history cooper when in town be always present and i remember be strike with the inexhaustible vivacity of he conversation and the minuteness of he knowledge in everything which depend upon acuteness of observation and exactness of recollection i remember too be somewhat startled come as i do from the seclusion of a country life with a certain emphatic frankness in he manner which however i come at last to like and to admire the club meet in the hotel call washington hall the site of which be now occupy by part of the circuit of stewart 's marble building _ lionel lincoln _ which can not be rank among the successful production of cooper be publish in 1825 and in the year follow appear the _ last of the mohican _ which more than recover the ground lose by its predecessor in this work the construction of the narrative have signal defect but it be one of the triumph of the author 's genius that he make we unconscious of they while we read it be only when we have have time to awake from the intense interest in which he have hold we by the vivid reality of he narrative and have begin to search for fault in cold blood that we be able to find they in the _ last of the mohican _ we have a bolder portraiture of leatherstocking than in the _ pioneer _ this work be publish in 1826 and in the same year cooper sail with he family for europe he leave new york as one of the vessel of war describe in he romance of the sea go out of port amidst the thunder of a parting salute from the big gun on the battery a dinner be give he just before he departure attend by most of the distinguished man of the city at which peter a jay preside and dr king address he in term which some then think too glowing but which would now seem sufficiently temperate express the good wish of he friend and dwelling on the satisfaction they promise themselves in possess so illustrious a representative of american literature in the old world cooper be scarcely in france when he remember he friend of the weekly club and send frequent missive to be read at its meeting but the club miss its founder go into a decline and not long afterwards quietly expire the first of cooper 's novel publish after leave america : be the _ prairie _ which appear early in 1827 a work with the admirer of which i wholly agree i read it with a certain awe a undefined sense of sublimity such as one experience on enter for the first time upon those immense grassy desert from which the work take its name the squatter and he family -- that brawny old man and he large-limbed son live in a sort of primitive and patriarchal barbarism sluggish on ordinary occasion but terrible when rouse like the hurricane that sweep the grand but monotonous wilderness in which they dwell -- seem a natural growth of ancient field of the west leatherstocking a hunter in the _ pioneer _ a warrior in the _ last of the mohican _ and now in he extreme old age a trapper on the prairie decline in strength but undecayed in intellect and look to the near close of he life and a grave under the long grass as calmly as the laborer at sunset look to he evening slumber be no less in harmony with the silent desert in which he wander equally so be the indian still he companion copy of the american savage somewhat idealized but not the less a part of the wild nature in which they have they haunt before the year close cooper have give the world another nautical tale the _ red rover _ which with many be a greater favorite than the _ pilot _ and with reason perhaps if we consider principally the incident which be conduct and describe with a greater mastery over the spring of pity and terror it happen to cooper while he be abroad as it not unfrequently happen to we countryman to hear the united state disadvantageously compare with europe he have himself be a close observer of thing both here and in the old world and be conscious of be able to refute the detractor of he country in regard to many point he publish in 1828 after he have be two year in europe a series of letter entitle _ notion of the american by a travel bachelor _ in which he give a favorable account of the working of we institution and vindicate he country from various flippant and ill-natured misrepresentation of foreigner it be rather too measure in style but be write from a mind full of the subject and from a memory wonderfully store with particulars although twenty-four year have elapse since its publication but little of the vindication have become obsolete cooper love he country and be proud of she history and she institution but it puzzle many that he should have appear at different time as she eulogist and she censor my friend she be worthy both of praise and of blame and cooper be not the man to shrink from bestow either at what seem to he the proper time he defend she from detractor abroad he seek to save she from flatterer at home i will not say that he be in as good humor with he country when he write _ home at find _ as when he write he _ notion of the american _ but this i will say that whether he commend or censure he do it in the sincerity of he heart as a true american and in the belief that it would do good he _ notion of the american _ be more likely to lessen than to increase he popularity in europe inasmuch as they be put forth without the slightest regard to european prejudice in 1829 he bring out the novel entitle the _ weep of wishton-wish _ one of the few of he work which we now rarely hear mention he be engage in the composition of a third nautical tale which he afterwards publish under the name of the _ water-witch _ when the memorable revolution of the three day of July break out he see a government ruling by fear and in defiance of public opinion overthrow in a few hour with little bloodshed he see the french nation far from be intoxicate with they new liberty peacefully address themselves to the discussion of the institution under which they be to live a work which cooper afterwards publish he _ residence in europe _ give the outline of a plan of government for france furnish by he at that time to la fayette with whom he be in habit of close and daily intimacy it be he idea to give permanence to the new order of thing by associate two strong party in its support the friend of legitimacy and the republican he suggest that henry v should be call to the hereditary throne of france a youth yet to be educate as the head of a free people that the peerage should be abolish and a legislature of two chamber establish with a constituency of at least a million and a half of elector the senate to be choose by the general vote as the representative of the entire nation and the member of the other house to be choose by district as the representative of the local interest to the middle ground of politics so ostentatiously occupy by loui philippe at the beginning of he reign he predict a brief duration believe that it would speedily be merge in despotism or supplant by the popular rule he prophecy have be fulfil more amply than he could have imagine -- fulfil in both its alternative in one of the controversy of that time cooper bear a distinguished part the _ revue britannique _ a periodical publish in paris boldly affirm the government of the united state to be one of the most expensive in the world and its people among the most heavily tax of mankind this assertion be support with a certain show of proof and the writer affect to have establish the conclusion that a republic must necessarily be more expensive than a monarchy the partisan of the court be delighted with the reasoning of the article and claim a triumph over we ancient friend la fayette who during forty year have not cease to hold up the government of the united state as the cheapest in the world at the suggestion of la fayette cooper reply to this attack upon he country in a letter which be translate into french and together with another from general bertrand for many year a resident in america be lay before the people of france these two letter provoke a shower of rejoinder in which accord to cooper misstatement be mingle with scurrility he commence a series of letter on the question in dispute which be publish in the _ national _ a daily sheet and give the first evidence of that extraordinary acuteness in controversy which be no less characteristic of he mind than the vigor of he imagination the enemy of la fayette press into they service mr leavitt harri of new jersey afterwards we _ chargé d'affaire _ at the court of france but cooper reply to mr harri in the _ national _ of may 2d 1832 close a discussion in which he have effectually silence those who object to we institution on the score of economy of these letter which would form a important chapter in political science no entire copy i have be tell be to be find in this country one of the consequence of earnest controversy be almost invariably personal ill-will cooper be tell by one who hold a official station under the french government that the part he have take in this dispute concern taxation would neither be forget nor forgive the dislike he have incur in that quarter be strengthen by he novel of the _ bravo _ publish in the year 1831 while he be in the midst of he quarrel with the aristocratic party in that work of which he have himself justly say that it be thoroughly american in all that belong to it he object be to show how institution professedly create to prevent violence and wrong become when pervert from they natural destination the instrument of injustice and how in every system which make power the exclusive property of the strong the weak be sure to be oppress the work be write with all the vigor and spirit of he best novel the magnificent city of venice in which the scene of the story be lay stand continually before the imagination and from time to time the gorgeous ceremony of the venetian republic pass under we eye such as the marriage of the doge with the adriatic and the contest of the gondola for the prize of speed the bravo himself and several of the other character be strongly conceive and distinguish but the most remarkable of they all be the spirited and generous-hearted daughter of the jailer it have be say by some critic who judge of cooper by he failure that he have no skill in draw female character by the same process it might i suppose be show that raphael be but a ordinary painter it must be admit that when cooper draw a lady of high breeding he be apt to pay too much attention to the formal part of she character and to make she a mere bundle of cold propriety but when he place he heroine in some situation in life which leave he nothing to do but to make they natural and true i know of nothing finer nothing more attractive or more individual than the portraiture he have give we _ figaro _ the wittiest of the french periodical and at that time on the liberal side commend the _ bravo _ the journal on the side of the government censure it _ figaro _ afterwards pass into the hand of the aristocratic party and cooper become the object of its attack he be not however a man to be drive from any purpose which he have form either by flattery or abuse and both be try with equal ill success in 1832 he publish he _ heidenmauer _ and in 1833 he _ headsman of berne _ both with a political design similar to that of the _ bravo _ though neither of they take the same high rank among he work in 1833 after a residence of seven year in different part of europe but mostly in france cooper return to he native country the welcome which meet he here be somewhat chill by the effect of the attack make upon he in france and remember with what zeal and at what sacrifice of the universal acceptance which he work would otherwise have meet he have maintain the cause of he country against the wit and orator of the court party in france we can not wonder that he should have feel this coldness as undeserved he publish shortly after he arrival in this country _ a letter to he countryman _ in which he complain of the censure cast upon he in the american newspaper give a history of the part he have take in expose the misstatement of the _ révue britannique _ and warn he countryman against the too common error of resort with a blind deference to foreign authority often sway by national or political prejudice for we opinion of american author go beyond this topic he examine and reprehend the habit of apply to the interpretation of we own constitution maxim derive from the practice of other government particularly that of great britain the importance of construe that instrument by its own principle he illustrate by consider several point in dispute between party of the day on which he give very decide opinion the principal effect of this pamphlet as it seem to I be to awaken in certain quarter a kind of resentment that a successful writer of fiction should presume to give lesson in politics i meddle not here with the conclusion to which he arrive though must be allow to say that they be state and argue with great ability in 1835 cooper publish _ the monnikin _ a satirical work partly with a political aim and in the same year appear he _ american democrat _ a view of the civil and social relation of the united state discuss more gravely various topic touch upon in the former work and point out in what respects he deem the american people in they practice to have fall short of the excellence of they institution he find time however for a more genial task -- that of give to the world he observation on foreign country in 1836 appear he _ sketch of switzerland _ a series of letter in four volume the second part publish about two month after the first a delightful work write in a more fluent and flexible style than he _ notion of the american _ the first part of _ gleanings in europe _ give a account of he residence in france follow in the same year and the second part of the same work contain he observation on england be publish in April 1837 in these work form a series of eight volume he relate and describe with much of the same distinctness as in he novel and he remark on the manners and institution of the different country often sagacious and always peculiarly he own derive from they frequent reference to contemporary event a historical interest in 1838 appear _ homeward bind _ and _ home as find _ two satirical novel in which cooper hold up to ridicule a certain class of conductor of the newspaper press in america these work have not the good fortune to become popular cooper do not and because he be too deeply in earnest perhaps would not infuse into he satirical work that gaiety without which satire become wearisome i believe however that if they have be write by anybody else they would have meet with more favor but the world know that cooper be able to give they something better and would not be satisfy with anything short of he best some childishly imagine that because in the two work i have just mention a newspaper editor be introduce in whose character almost every possible vice of he profession be make to find a place cooper intend a indiscriminate attack upon the whole body of writer for the newspaper press forget that such a portraiture be a satire only on those to whom it bear a likeness we have become less sensitive and more reasonable of late and the monthly periodical make sport for they reader of the folly and ignorance of the newspaper editor without awaken the slightest resentment but cooper lead the way in this sort of discipline and i remember some instance of tower indignation at he audacity express in the journal of that time the next year cooper make he appearance before the public in a new department of write he _ naval history of the united state _ be bring out in two octavo volume at philadelphium by carey and lea in write he story of the sea he attention have be much turn to this subject and he mind fill with striking incident from expedition and battle in which we naval commander have be engage this make he task the lighter but he gather he material with great industry and with a conscientious attention to exactness for he be not a man to take a fact for grant or allow imagination to usurp the place of inquiry he digest we naval annals into a narrative write with spirit it be true but with that air of sincere dealing which the reader willingly take as a pledge of its authenticity a abridgment of the work be afterwards prepared and publish by the author the _ edinburgh review _ in a article profess to examine the statement both of cooper 's work and of _ the history of the english navy _ write by mr jame a surgeon by profession make a violent attack upon the american historian unfortunately it take jame 's narrative as its sole guide and follow it implicitly cooper reply in the _ democratic review _ for January 1840 and by a masterly analysis of he statement convict jame of self-contradiction in almost every particular in which he differ from himself refute both jame and the reviewer it be a refutation which admit of no rejoinder scarce anything in cooper 's life be so remarkable or so strikingly illustrate he character as he contest with the newspaper press he engage in it after provocation many and long endure and prosecute it through year with great energy perseverance and practical dexterity till he be leave master of the field in what i be about to say of it i hope i shall not give offence to any one as i shall speak without the slightest malevolence towards those with whom he wage this controversy over some of they as over they renowned adversary the grave have now close yet where shall the truth be speak if not beside the grave i have already allude to the principal cause which provoke the newspaper attack upon cooper if he have never meddle with question of government on either side of the atlantic and never satirize the newspaper press i have little doubt that he would have be spare these attack i can not however ascribe they all or even the greater part of they to personal malignity one journal follow the example of another with little reflection i think in most case till it become a sort of fashion not merely to decry he work but to arraign he motive it be related that in 1832 while he be at paris a article be show he in a american newspaper purport to be a criticism on one of he work but reflect with much asperity on he personal character i care nothing he be report to have say for the criticism but i be not indifferent to the slander if these attack on my character should be keep up five year after my return to america i shall resort to the new york court for protection he give the newspaper press of this state the full period of forbearance on which he have fix but find that forbearance seem to encourage assault he seek redress in the court of law when these litigation be first begin i recollect it seem to I that cooper have take a step which would give he a great deal of trouble and effect but little good i say to myself -- alas leviathan be not so tame as he proceed however i see that he have understand the matter better than i he put a hook into the nose of this huge monster wallow in he inky pool and bespatter the passer-by he drag he to the land and make he tractable one suit follow another one editor be sue i thinly half-a-dozen time some of they find themselves under a second indictment before the first be try in vindicate himself to he reader against the charge of publish one libel the angry journalist often flounder into another the occasion of these prosecution seem to have be always carefully consider for cooper be almost uniformly successful in obtain verdict in a letter of he write in February 1843 about five year i think from the commencement of the first prosecution he say i have beat every man i have sue who have not retract he libel in one of these suit commence against the late william l stone of the _ commercial advertiser _ and refer to the arbitration of three distinguish lawyer he argue himself the question of the authenticity of he account of the battle of lake erie which be the matter in dispute i listen to he open it be clear skilful and persuasive but he closing argument be say to be splendidly eloquent i have hear nothing like it say a barrister to I since the day of emmet cooper behave liberally towards he antagonist so far as pecuniary damages be concern though some of they wholly escape they payment by bankruptcy after i believe about six year of litigation the newspaper press gradually subside into a pacific disposition towards its adversary and the contest close with the account of pecuniary profit and loss so far as he be concern nearly balance the occasion of these suit be far from honorable to those who provoke they but the result be i have almost say creditable to all party to he as the courageous prosecutor to the administration of justice in this country and to the docility of the newspaper press which he have discipline into good manners it be while he be in the midst of these litigation that he publish in 1840 the _ pathfinder _ people have begin to think of he as a controversialist acute keen and persevere occupy with he personal wrong and scheme of attack and defense they be startle from this estimate of he character by the moral duty of that glorious work -- i must so call it by the vividness and force of its delineation by the unspoiled love of nature apparent in every page and by the fresh and warm emotion which everywhere give life to the narrative and the dialogue cooper be now in he fifty-first year but nothing which he have produce in the earlier part of he literary life be write with so much of what might seem the generous fervor of youth or show the faculty of invention in higher vigor i recollect that near the time of its appearance i be inform of a observation make upon it by one highly distinguish in the literature of we country and of the age between whom and the author a unhappy coolness have for some year exist as he finish the reading of the pathfinder he exclaim they may say what they will of cooper the man who write this book be not only a great man but a good man the reader of the _ pathfinder _ be quickly reconcile to the fourth appearance of leatherstocking when they see he make to act a different part from any which the author have hitherto assign he -- when they see he show as a lover and place in the midst of association which invest he character with a higher and more affect heroism in this work be two female character portray in a masterly manner -- the corporal 's daughter mabel dunham generous resolute yet womanly and the young indian woman call by she tribe the dew of June a personification of female truth affection and sympathy with a strong aboriginal cast yet a product of nature as bright and pure as that from which she be name _ mercedes of castile _ publish near the close of the same year have none of the stronger characteristic of cooper 's genius but in the _ deerslayer _ which appear in 1841 another of he leatherstocking tale he give we a work rival the pathfinder leatherstocking be bring before we in he early youth in the first exercise of that keen sagacity which be blended so harmoniously with a simple and ingenuous goodness the two daughter of the retire freebooter dwelling on the otsego lake inspire scarcely less interest than the principal personage judith in the pride of she beauty and intellect she good impulse contend with a fatal love of admiration hold we fascinate with a constant interest in she fate which with consummate skill we be permit rather to conjecture than to know and hetty scarcely less beautiful in person weak-minded but wise in the midst of that weakness beyond the wisdom of the loftiest intellect through the power of conscience and religion the character of hetty would have be a hazardous experiment in feebler hand but in he it be admirably successful the _ two admiral _ and _ wing-and-wing _ be give to the public in 1842 both of they take a high rank among cooper 's sea-tale the first of these be a sort of naval epic in prose the flight and chase of armed vessel hold we in breathless suspense and the sea-fight be describe with a terrible power in the later sea-tale of cooper it seem to I that the mastery with which he make he grand procession of event pass before the mind 's eye be even greater than in he earlier the next year he publish the _ wyandotte or hutted knoll _ one of he beautiful romance of the wood and in 1844 two more of he sea-story _ afloat and ashore _ and _ mile wallingford_its sequel the long series of he nautical tale be close by _ jack tier or the florida reef _ publish in 1848 when cooper be in he sixtieth year and it be as full of spirit energy invention life-like presentation of object and event -- the vision and the faculty divine -- as anything he have write let I pause here to say that cooper though not a manufacturer of verse be in the highest sense of the word a poet he imagination work nobly and grandly and impose its creation on the mind of the reader for reality with he there be no withering or decline or disuse of the poetic faculty as he step downward from the zenith of life no shadow or chill come over it it be like the year of some genial climate a perpetual season of verdure bloom and fruitfulness as these work come out i be rejoice to see that he be unspoiled by the controversy in which he have allow himself to become engage that they have not give to these better expression of he genius any tinge of misanthropy or appearance of contracting and closing sympathy any trace of a interest in he fellow-being less large and free than in he earlier work before the appearance of he _ jack tier _ cooper publish in 1845 and the following year a series of novel relate to the anti-rent question in which he take great interest he think that the disposition manifest in certain quarter to make con cession to what he deem a denial of the rights of property be a first step in a most dangerous path to discourage this disposition he write _ satanstoe the chainbearer _ and _ the redskin _ they be didactic in they design and want the freedom of invention which belong to cooper 's best novel but if they have be write by anybody but cooper -- by a member of congress for example or a eminent politician of any class -- they would have make he reputation it be say i be tell by a distinguished jurist of we state that they entitle the author to as high a place in law as he other work have win for he in literature i have think in meditate the plan of this discourse to mention all the work of mr cooper but the length to which i have find it extend have induce I to pass over several write in the last ten year of he life and to confine myself to those which best illustrate he literary character the last of he novel be _ the way of the hour _ a work in which the objection he entertain to the trial by jury in civil cause be state in the form of a narrative it be a voluminous catalogue -- that of cooper 's publish work -- but it comprise not all he write he commit to the fire without remorse many of the fruit of he literary industry it be understand some year since that he have a work ready for the press on the _ middle state of the union _ principally illustrative of they social history but it have not be find among he manuscript and the presumption be that he must have destroy it he have plan a work on the _ town of manhattan _ for the publication of which he make arrangement with mr putnam of this city and a part of which already write be in press at the time of he death the print part have since be destroy by fire but a portion of the manuscript be recover the work i learn will be complete by one of the family who within a few year past have earn a honorable name among the author of we country great as be the number of he work and great as be the favor with which they be receive the pecuniary reward of he success be far less than have be generally suppose -- scarcely as i be inform a tenth part of what the common rumor make they he fame be infinitely the largest acknowledgment which this most successful of american author receive for he labor _ the way of the hour _ appear in 1850 at this time he personal appearance be remarkable he seem in perfect health and in the highest energy and activity of he faculty i have scarcely see any man at that period of life on whom he year sit more lightly he conversation have lose none of its liveliness though it seem somewhat more genial and forbearing in tone and he spirit none of they elasticity he be contemplate i have since be tell another leatherstocking tale deem that he have not yet exhaust the character and those who consider what new resource it yield he in the _ pathfinder _ and the _ deerslayer _ will readily conclude that he be not mistake the disease however by which he be remove be even then impend over he and not long afterwards he friend here be grieve to learn that he health be decline he come to new york so change that they look at he with sorrow and after a stay of some week partly for the benefit of medical advice return to cooperstown to leave it no more he complaint gradually gain strength subdue a constitution originally robust and finally pass into a confirm dropsy in August 1851 he be visit by he excellent and learn friend dr franci a member of the weekly club which he have found in the early part of he literary career he find he bear the suffering of he disease with manly firmness give he such medical counsel as the malady appear to require prepared he delicately for its fatal termination and return to new york with the most melancholy anticipation in a few day afterwards cooper expire amid the deep affliction of he family on the 14th of September the day before that on which he should have complete he sixty-second year he die apparently without pain in peace and religious hope the relation of man to he maker and to that state of be for which the present be but a preparation have occupy much of he thought during he whole lifetime and he cross with a serene composure the mysterious boundary which divide this life from the next the departure of such a man in the full strength of he faculty -- on whom the country have for thirty year look as one of the permanent ornament of its literature and whose name have be so often associate with praise with renown with controversy with blame but never with death -- diffuse a universal awe it be as if a earthquake have shake the ground on which we stand and show the grave opening by we path in the general grief for he loss he virtue only be remembered and he failing forget of he failing i have say little such as he have be obvious to all the world they lay on the surface of he character those who know he least make the most account of they with a character so make up of positive quality -- a character so independent and uncompromising and with a sensitiveness far more acute than he be willing to acknowledge it be not surprising that occasion frequently arise to bring he sometimes into friendly collision and sometimes in to graver disagreement and misunderstanding with he fellow-men for he infirmity he friend find a ample counterpoise in the generous sincerity of he nature he never think of disguise he opinion and he abhor all disguise in other he do not even deign to use that show of regard towards those of whom he do not think well which the world tolerate and almost demand a manly expression of opinion however different from he own command he respect of he own work he speak with the same freedom as of the work of other and never hesitate to express he judgment of a book for the reason that it be write by himself : yet he could bear with gentleness any dissent from the estimate lie place on he own writings he character be like the bark of the cinnamon a rough and astringent rind without and a intense sweetness within those who penetrate below the surface find a genial temper warm affection and a heart with ample place for he friend they pursuit they good name they welfare they find he a philanthropist though not precisely after the fashion of the day a religious man most devout where devotion be most apt to be a feeling rather than a custom in the household circle hospitable and to the extent of he means liberal-handed in act of charity they find also that though in general he would as soon have think of give up a old friend as of give up a opinion he be not proof against testimony and could part with a mistaken opinion as one part with a old friend who have be prove faithless and unworthy in short cooper be one of those who to be love must be intimately know of he literary character i have speak largely in the narrative of he life but there be yet one or two remark which must be make to do it justice in that way of write in which he excel it seem to I that he unite in a pre-eminent degree those quality which enable he to interest the largest number of reader he write not for the fastidious the over-refined the morbidly delicate for these find in he genius something too robust for they liking -- something by which they sensibility be too rudely shake but he write for mankind at large -- for man and woman in the ordinary healthful state of feeling -- and in they admiration he find he reward it be for this class that public library be oblige to provide themselves with a extraordinary number of copy of he work : the number in the mercantile library in this city i be tell be forty hence it be that he have earn a fame wider i think than any author of modern time -- wider certainly than any author of any age ever enjoy in he lifetime all he excellence be translatable -- they pass readily into language the least ally in they genius to that in which he write and in they he touch the heart and kindle the imagination with the same power as in the original english cooper be not wholly without humor it be sometimes find lurk in the dialogue of harvey birch and of leatherstocking but it form no considerable element in he work and if it do it would have stand in the way of he universal popularity since of all quality it be the most difficult to transfuse into a foreign language nor do the effect he produce upon the reader depend on any grace of style which would escape a translator of ordinary skill with he style it be true he take great pain and in he earlier work i be tell sometimes alter the proof send from the printer so largely that they might be say to be write over yet he attain no special felicity variety or compass of expression he style however answer he purpose it have defect but it be manly and clear and stamp on the mind of the reader the impression he desire to convey i be not sure that some of the very defect of cooper 's novel do not add by a certain force of contrast to they power over the mind he be long in get at the interest of he narrative the progress of the plot at first be like that of one of he own vessel of war slowly heavily and even awkwardly work out of a harbor we be impatient and weary but when the vessel be once in the open sea and feel the free breath of heaven in she full sheet we delight and admiration be all the greater at the grace the majesty and power with which she divide and bear down the wave and pursue she course at will over the great waste of water such be the work so widely read and so universally admire in all the zone of the globe and by man of every kindred and every tongue work which have make of those who dwell in remote latitudes wanderer in we forest and observer of we manners and have inspire they with a interest in we history a gentleman who have return from europe just before the death of cooper be ask what he find the people of the continent do they all be read cooper he answer in the little kingdom of holland with its three million of inhabitant i look into four different translation of cooper in the language of the country a traveller who have see much of the middle class of italy lately say to I i find that all they know of america and that be not little they have learn from cooper 's novel from he they have learn the story of american liberty and through he they have be introduce to we washington they have read he work till the shore of the hudson and the valley of westchester and the bank of otsego lake have become to they familiar ground over all the country into whose speech this great man 's work have be render by the labor of they scholar the sorrow of that loss which we deplore be now diffuse itself here we lament the ornament of we country there they mourn the death of he who delight the human race even now while i speak the pulse of grief which be pass through the nation have haply just reach some remote neighborhood the news of he death have be bring to some dwelling on the slope of the ande or amidst the snowy waste of the north and the dark-eyed damsel of chile or the fair-haired maid of norway be sad to think that he whose story of heroism and true love have so often keep she for hour from she pillow live no more he be go but the creation of he genius fix in live word survive the frail material organ by which the word be first trace they partake of a middle nature between the deathless mind and the decaying body of which they be the common offspring and be therefore destine to a duration if not eternal yet indefinite the example he have give in he glorious fiction of heroism honor and truth of large sympathy between man and man of all that be good great and excellent embody in personage mark with so strong a individuality that we place they among we friend and favorite he frank and generous man he gentle and noble woman shall live through century to come and only perish with we language i have say with we language but who shall say when it may be the fate of the english language to be number with the extinct form of human speech who shall declare which of the present tongue of the civilized world will survive its fellow it may be that some one of they more fortunate than the rest will long outlast they in some undisturbed quarter of the globe and in the midst of a new civilization the creation of cooper 's genius even now transfer to that language may remain to be the delight of the nation through another great cycle of century begin after the english language and its contemporaneous form of civilization shall have pass away preface to the new edition this book originally owe its existence to a accident and it be print under circumstance that prevent the usual supervision of the press by the author the consequence be many defect in plot style and arrangement that be entirely owe to precipitation and inexperience and quite as many fault of another nature that be to be trace solely to a bad manuscript and worse proof reading perhaps no novel of we time be worst print than the first edition of this work more than a hundred period be place in the middle of sentence and perhaps five time that number be omit in place where they ought to have be insert it be scarcely necessary to add that passage be render obscure and that entire paragraph be unintelligible most of the fault just mention have now be correct though it would require more labor than would produce a entirely new work to repair all the inherent defect that be attributable to haste and to the awkwardness of a novice in the art of compose in this respect the work and its blemish be probably inseparable still the reader will now be better reward for he time and on the whole the book be much more worthy of he attention it have be say that precaution owe its existence to fortuitous circumstance the same cause induce its english plot and in a measure the medley of character that no doubt will appear a mistake in the conception it can scarcely be say that the work be commence with any view to publication and when it be finally put into a publisher 's hand with all its imperfection on its head the last thought of the writer be any expectation that it would be follow by a series of similar tale from the same pen more than this the public will feel no interest in know and less than this the author could not consent to say on present to the world a reprint of a book with so few claim to notice precaution chapter i i wonder if we be to have a neighbor in the deanery soon inquire clara moseley address herself to a small party assemble in she father 's drawing-room while stand at a window which command a distant view of the house in question oh yes reply she brother the agent have let it to a mr jarvi for a couple of year and he be to take possession this week and who be the mr jarvi that be about to become so near a neighbor ask sir edward moseley why sir i learn he have be a capital merchant that he have retire from business with a large fortune that he have like yourself sir a only hope for he decline year in son a officer in the army and moreover that he have couple of fine daughter so sir he be a man of family in one sense at least you see but drop he voice whether he be a man of family in you sense jane look at he second sister be more than i could discover i hope you do not take the trouble sir to inquire on my account retort jane color slightly with vexation at he speech indeed i do my dear si and solely on you account reply the laughing brother for you well know that no gentility no husband and it be dull work to you young lady without at least a possibility of matrimony as for clara she be -- here he be stop by he youngest sister emily place she hand on he mouth as she whisper in he ear john you forget the anxiety of a certain gentleman about a fair incognita at bath and a list of inquiry concern she lineage and a few other indispensable john in he turn color and affectionately kiss the hand which keep he silent address himself to jane and by he vivacity and good humor soon restore she to complacency i rejoice say lady moseley that sir william have find a tenant however for next to occupy it himself it be a most desirable thing to have a good tenant in it on account of the circle in which we live and mr jarvi have the great goodness of money by john 's account caustically observe mr wilson who be a sister of sir edward 's let I tell you madam cry the rector of the parish look around he pleasantly and who be pretty constant and always a welcome visitor in the family that a great deal of money be a very good thing in itself and that a great many very good thing may be do with it such as pay tythe ha doctor cry mr haughton a gentleman of land property in the neighborhood of plain exterior but great goodness of heart and between whom and the rector subsist the most cordial good will aye tythe or half as the baronet do here when he forgive old gregson one half he rent and he child the other well but my dear say sir edward to he wife you must not starve we friend because we be to have a neighbor william have stand with the dining-room door open these five minute -- lady moseley give she hand to the rector and the company follow they without any order to the dinner table the party assemble around the hospitable board of the baronet be compose besides the before-mentioned person of the wife of mr haughton a woman of much good sense and modesty of deportment : they daughter a young lady conspicuous for nothing but good nature and the wife and son of the rector -- the latter but lately admit to holy order himself the remainder of the day pass in a uninterrupted flow of pleasant conversation the natural consequence of a unison of opinion on all lead question the party have long know and esteem each other for those quality which soonest reconcile we to the common frailty of we nature on parting at the usual hour it be agree to meet that day week at the rectory and the doctor on make he bow to lady moseley observe that he intend in virtue of he office to make a early call on the jarvi family and that if possible he would persuade they to be of the party sir edward moseley be descend from one of the most respectable of the creation of he order by jame and have inherit with many of the virtue of he ancestor a estate which place he amongst the greatest land proprietor of the county but as it have be a invariable rule never to deduct a single acre from the inheritance of the eldest son and the extravagance of he mother who be the daughter of a nobleman have much embarrassed the affair of he father sir edward on come into possession of he estate have wisely determine to withdraw from the gay world by rent he house in town and retire altogether to he respectable mansion about a hundred mile from the metropolis here he hope by a course of systematic but liberal economy to release himself from all embarrassment and to make such a provision for he younger child the three daughter already mention as he conceive they birth entitle they to expect seventeen year enable he to accomplish this plan and for more than eighteen month sir edward have resume the hospitality and appearance usual in he family and have even promise he delighted girl to take possession the ensue winter of the house in st jame 's square nature have not qualify sir edward for great or continued exertion and the prudent decision he have take to retrieve he fortune be perhaps a act of as much forecast and vigor as he talent or energy would afford it be the step most obviously for he interest and the one that be safest both in its execution and consequence and as such it have be adopt : but have it require a single particle more of enterprise or calculation it would have be beyond he power and the heir might have yet labor under the difficulty which distressed he more brilliant but less prudent parent the baronet be warmly attach to he wife and as she be a woman of many valuable and no obnoxious quality civil and attentive by habit to all around she and perfectly disinterested in she attachment to she own family nothing in nature could partake more of perfection in the eye of she husband and child than the conduct of this beloved relative yet lady moseley have she failing however although few be dispose to view she error with that severity which truth and a just discrimination of character render necessary she union have be one of love and for a time it have be object to by the friend of she husband on the score of fortune but constancy and perseverance prevail and the protracted and inconsequent opposition of he parent have leave no other effect than a aversion in the child to the exercise of parental authority in marry they own descendent : a aversion which though common to both the worthy baronet and he wife be somewhat different in its two subject in the husband it be quiescent but in the wife it be slightly shaded with the female _ esprit de corps _ of have she daughter comfortably establish and that in due season lady moseley be religious but hardly pious she be charitable in deed but not always in opinion she intention be pure but neither she prejudice nor she reasoning power suffer she to be at all time consistent still few know she that do not love she and none be ever hear to say aught against she breed she moral or she disposition the sister of sir edward have be marry early in life to a officer in the army who spend much of he time abroad on service have leave she a prey to that solicitude to which she be necessarily a prey by she attachment to she husband to find relief from this perpetual and life-wearing anxiety a invaluable friend have point out the only true remedy of which she case admit a research into she own heart and the employment of active benevolence the death of she husband who lose he life in battle cause she to withdraw in a great measure from the world and give time and inducement for reflection which lead to impression on religion that be sufficiently correct in themselves and indispensable as the basis of future happiness but which become slightly tincture with the sternness of she vigorous mind and possibly at time be more unbending than be compatible with the comfort of this world a fault however of manner more than of matter warmly attach to she brother and he child mr wilson who have never be a mother herself yield to they earnest entreaty to become one of the family and although leave by the late general wilson with a large income ever since he death she have give up she own establishment and devoted most of she time to the formation of the character of she youngest niece lady moseley have submit this child entirely to the control of the aunt and it be commonly think emily would inherit the very handsome sum leave at the disposal of the general 's widow both sir edward and lady moseley possess a large share of personal beauty when young and it have descend in common to all they child but more particularly to the two youngest daughter although a strong family resemblance both in person and character exist between these closely connected relative yet it exist with shades of distinction that have very different effect on they conduct and lead to result which stamp they life with widely differ degree of happiness between the family at moseley hall and the rectory there have exist for many year a intimacy found on esteem and on long intercourse doctor ive be a clergyman of deep piety and of very considerable talent he possess in addition to a moderate benefice a independent fortune in right of he wife who be the only child of a distinguished naval officer both be well connect well breed and well disposed to they fellow creature they be bless with but one child the young divine we have mention who promise to equal he father in all those quality which have make the doctor the delight of he friend and almost the idol of he parishioner between franci ive and clara moseley there have be a attachment which have grow with they year from childhood he have be she companion in they youthful recreation have espouse she little quarrel and participate in she innocent pleasure for so many year and with such a evident preference for each other in the youthful pair that on leave college to enter on the study of he sacred call with he father franci rightly judge that none other would make he future life as happy as the mild the tender the unassuming clara they passion if so gentle a feeling deserve the term receive the sanction of they parent and the two family wait only for the establishment of the young divine to perfect the union the retirement of sir edward 's family have be uniform with the exception of a occasional visit to a aged uncle of he wife 's and who in return spend much of he time with they at the hall and who have openly declare he intention of make the child of lady moseley he heir the visit of mr benfield be always hail with joy and as a event that call for more than ordinary gaiety for although rough in manner and somewhat infirm from year the old bachelor who be rather addict to the custom in which he have indulge in he youth and be fond of dwelling on the scene of former day be universally beloved where he be intimately know for a unbounded though eccentric philanthropy the illness of the mother-in-law of mr wilson have call she to bath the winter precede the spring when we history commence and she have be accompany thither by she nephew and favorite niece john and emily during the month of they residence in that city be in the practice of make daily excursion in its environs it be in one of these little drive that they be of accidental service to a very young and very beautiful woman apparently in low health they have take she up in they carriage and convey she to a farm-house where she reside during a faintness which have come over she in a walk and she beauty air and manner altogether so different from those around she have interested they both to a painful degree they have venture to call the follow day to inquire after she welfare and this visit lead to a slight intercourse which continue for the fortnight they remain there john have give himself some trouble to ascertain who she be but in vain they could merely learn that she life be blameless that she see no one but themselves and she dialect raise a suspicion that she be not english it be to this unknown fair emily allude in she playful attempt to stop the heedless rattle of she brother who be not always restrain from utter what he think by a proper regard for the feeling of other chapter ii the morning succeed the day of the dinner at the hall mr wilson with all she niece and she nephew avail herself of the fineness of the weather to walk to the rectory where they be all in the habit of make informal and friendly visit they have just get out of the little village of b -- which lay in they route when a rather handsome travel carriage and four pass they and take the road which lead to the deanery as i live cry john there go we new neighbor the jarvi 's yes yes that must be the old merchant muffle up in the corner i mistake he at first for a pile of bandbox then the rosy-cheeked lady with so many feather must be the old lady -- heaven forgive I mrs jarvi i mean -- aye and the two other the belle you be in a hurry to pronounce they belle john say jane pettishly it would be well to see more of they before you speak so decidedly oh reply john i have see _ enough _ of they and -- he be interrupt by the whirling of a tilbury and tandem follow by a couple of servant on horseback all about this vehicle and its master bear the stamp of decide fashion and we party have follow it with they eye for a short distance when have reach a fork in the road it stop and evidently wait the come up of the pedestrian as if to make a inquiry a single glance of the eye be sufficient to apprise the gentleman on the cushion -lrb- who hold the rein -rrb- of the kind of people he have to deal with and step from he carriage he meet they with a graceful bow and after handsomely apologize for the trouble he be give he desire to know which road lead to the deanery the right reply john return he salutation ask they colonel cry the charioteer whether the old gentleman go right or not the colonel in the manner of a perfect gentleman but with a look of compassion for he companion 's want of tact make the desire inquiry which be satisfactorily answer he again bow and be retire as one of several pointer who follow the cavalcade spring upon jane and soil she walking dress with he dirty foot come hither dido cry the colonel hasten to beat the dog back from the young lady and again he apologize in the same collect and handsome manner then turn to one of the servant he say call in the dog sir and rejoin he companion the air of this gentleman be peculiarly pleasant it would not have be difficult to pronounce he a soldier have he not be address as such by he younger and certainly less polished companion the colonel be apparently about thirty and of extremely handsome face and figure while he drive friend appear several year younger and of altogether different material i wonder say jane as they turn a corner which hide they from view who they be who they be cry the brother why the jarvi 's to be sure do not you hear they ask the road to the deanery oh the one that drive _ he _ may be a jarvi but not the gentleman who speak to we -- surely not john besides he be call colonel you know yes yes say john with one of he quiz expression colonel jarvi that must be the alderman they be commonly colonel of city volunteer : yes that must have be the old gem ` mun who speak to we and i be right after all about the bandbox you forget say clara smile the

be i understand at the time from one of the servant that he be a nephew of sir edgar egerton and a lieutenant-colonel on half-pay or furlough or some such thing how do he bear he misfortune mr franci inquire mr wilson certainly as a gentleman madam if not as a christian reply the young clergyman slily smile indeed most man of gallantry would i believe rejoice in a accident which draw forth so much sympathy as both the miss jarvi 's manifest how fortunate you should all happen to be near say the tender-hearted clara be the young lady pretty ask jane with something of hesitation in she manner why i rather think they be but i take very little notice of they appearance as the colonel be really in evident pain this then cry the doctor afford I a additional excuse for call on they at a early day so i 'll e ` en go to-morrow i trust doctor ive want no apology for perform he duty say mr wilson he be fond of make they though say mr ive peak with a benevolent smile and for the first time in the

palpable care of he that he want for nothing and they might drive over whenever they please without fear of intrude unseasonably mr jarvi receive he guest with the frankness of good feeling if not with the polish of high life while he wife who seldom think of the former would have be mortally offend with the person who could have suggest that she omit any of the elegancy of the latter she daughter be rather pretty but want both in appearance and manner the inexpressible air of _ haut ton _ which so eminently distinguish the easy but polished deportment of colonel egerton whom they find recline on a sofa with he leg on a chair amply secure in numerous bandage but unable to rise notwithstanding the awkwardness of he situation he be by far the least discompose person of the party and have pleasantly excuse himself he appear to think no more of the matter the captain mr jarvi remark have go out with he dog to try the grounds around they for he seem to live only with he horse and he gun : young man my lady nowadays appear to forget that there be any thing in the world but themselves now i tell harry that you ladyship and daughter would favor we with a call this morning -- but no : there he go as if mr jarvi be unable to buy we a dinner and we should all starve but for he quail and pheasant quail and pheasant cry john in consternation do captain jarvi shoot quail and pheasant

take he fishing rod i believe it be all one fish or bird continue mr jarvi he be out of the way when he be wanted and i believe we can buy fish as easily as bird i wish he would take pattern after yourself colonel in these matter colonel egerton laugh pleasantly but he do not blush and miss jarvi observe with a look of something like admiration throw on he recline figure that when harry have be in the army as long as he friend he would know the usage of good society she hope as well yes say she mother the army be certainly the place to polish a young man and turn to mr wilson she abruptly add you husband i believe be in the army ma'am i hope say emily hastily that we shall have the pleasure of see you soon miss jarvi at the hall prevent by she promptitude the necessity of a reply from she aunt the young lady promise to make a early visit and the subject change to a general and uninteresting discourse on the neighborhood the country the weather and other ordinary topic now john cried jane in triumph as they drive from the door you must acknowledge my heraldic witchcraft as you be pleased to call it be right for once at least oh no doubt jenny say john who be accustom to use that appellation to she as a provocation when he wish what he call a enliven scene but mr wilson put a damper on he hope by a remark to he mother and the habitual respect of both the combatant keep they silent jane moseley be endow by nature with a excellent understanding one at least equal to that of she brother but the want the more essential requisite of a well govern mind master have be provide by sir edward for all he daughter and if they be not acquaint with the usual acquirement of young woman in they rank of life it be not he fault : he system of economy have not embrace a denial of opportunity to any of he child and the baronet be apt to think all _ be _ do when they be put where all _ might _ be do feeling herself and parent entitle to enter into all the gaiety and splendor of some of the richer family in they vicinity jane who have grow up during the temporary eclipse of sir edward 's fortune have seek that self-consolation so common to people in she situation which be to be find in review the former grandeur of she house and she have thus contract a degree of family pride if clara 's weakness be less striking than those of jane it be because she have less imagination and because that in loving franci ive she have so long admire a character where so little be to be find that could be censure that she might be say to have contract a habit of judge correctly without be able at all time to give a reason for she conduct or she opinion chapter iii the day fix for one of the state visit of mr benfield have now arrive and john with emily who be the

emily cry john as he settle himself comfortably by the side of he sister in the chaise let I know honestly how you like the jarvi 's and particularly how you like the handsome colonel then john

they seem most to admire to my face if i might be allow to judge i should say he manner want one thing without which no one can be truly agreeable what be that sincerity ah that be my great recommendation but i be afraid i shall have to take the poacher up with he quail and he pheasant indeed you know the colonel explain that to be a mistake what they call explain away but unluckily i see the gentleman return with he gun on he shoulder and follow by a brace of pointer there be a specimen of the colonel 's manners then say emily smile it will do until the truth be know and jane when she see he also praise he good nature and consideration in what she be please to call relieve the awkwardness of my remark emily find she brother dispose to dwell on the foible of jane a thing he be rather addict to at time be silent they ride some distance before john who be ever as ready to atone as he be to offend again apologize again promise reformation and during the remainder of the ride

old man very like old peter my steward as like as two pea the parallel be by no means as ridiculous as might be suppose its history be as follow : mr benfield have place twenty thousand pound in the hand of a broker with positive order for he to pay it away immediately for government stock buy by the former on he account but disregard this injunction the broker have manage the transaction in such a way as to postpone the payment until on he failure he have give up that and a much larger sum to mr jarvi to satisfy what he call a honorary debt in elucidate the transaction mr jarvi pay benfield lodge a visit and honestly restore the bachelor he property this act and the high opinion he entertain of mr wilson with he unbounded love for emily be the few thing which prevent he believe some dreadful judgment be about to visit this world for its increase wickedness and folly as he own steward be one of the honestest fellow live he have ever after fancy that there be a personal resemblance between he and the conscientious merchant the horse be ready the old bachelor be place carefully between he nephew and niece and in that manner they ride on quietly to the hall the dread of accident keep mr benfield silent most of the way on pass however a stately castle about ten mile from the termination of they ride he begin one of he speech with emmy dear do lord bolton come often to see you

he be a thoroughly honest man very much such a man to look at as peter johnson my steward : but i be tell he son like the good thing of the ministry well well william pitt be the only minister to my mind there be the scotchman of whom they make a marquis i never could endure he -- always vote against he right or wrong uncle cry john who love a little mischief in he heart no sir -- right but never

lady juliana -- poor soul how much she regret he when dead though she never could abide he when live -- ah she be a tender-hearted creature mr benfield like many other continue to love imaginary quality in he mistress long after she heartless coquetry have disgust he with she person : a kind of feeling which spring from self-love which find it necessary to seek consolation in create beauty that may justify we folly to ourselves and which often keep alive the semblance of the passion when even hope or real admiration be extinct on reach the hall every one be rejoice to see they really affectionate and worthy relative and the evening pass in the tranquil enjoyment of the blessing which providence have profusely scatter around the family of the baronet but which be too often hazard by a neglect of duty that spring from too great security or a indolence which render we averse to the precaution necessary to insure they continuance chapter iv you be welcome sir edward say the

old acquaintance who now take a seat in silence by he side while he wife whose face have begin to kindle with indignation at the commencement of the old gentleman 's soliloquy observe that somehow or other it have not only terminate without degradation to she spouse but with something like credit turn complacently to mr ive with a apology for the absence of she son i can not divine ma'am where he

who have take a chair familiarly by the side of the baronet 's wife why be the house call the deanery i be afraid i shall be take for a son of the church when i invite my friend to visit my father at

dinner never my dear child say mr wilson to emily the aunt be fond of introduce a moral from the occasional incident of every-day life never subject yourself to a similar mortification by comment on the character of those you do not know : ignorance make you liable to great error and if they should happen to be above you in life it will only excite they contempt should it reach they ear while those to whom you remark be make will think it envy truth be sometimes blunder on whisper john who hold he sister 's arm wait for he aunt to precede they to the dining-room the merchant pay too great a compliment to the rector 's dinner to think of renew the disagreeable conversation and as john moseley and the young clergyman be seat next the two lady they soon forget what among themselves they

the two for the most indifferent observer to pronounce they father and son but the helpless debility and emaciated figure of the former be finely contrast by the vigorous health and manly beauty of the latter who support he venerable parent into the room with a grace and tenderness that strike most of the beholder with a sensation of pleasure the doctor and mr ive rise from they seat involuntarily and each stand for a moment lose in a astonishment that be mingle with grief recollect himself the rector grasp the extended hand of the senior in both he own and endeavor to utter something but in vain the tear follow each other down he cheek as he look on the fade and careworn figure which stand before he while he wife unable to control she feeling sink back into a chair and

deaden affection of we nature new life new vigor arise within we as we walk abroad and feel the genial gale of April breathe upon we and we hope we wish awaken with the revival of the vegetable world it be then that the heart which have be impress with the goodness of the creator feel that goodness bring as it be into very contact with the sens the eye love to wander over the bountiful provision nature be throw forth in every direction for we comfort and fix its gaze on the cloud which have lose the chill thinness of winter roll in rich volume amidst the clear and softened field of azure so peculiar to the season lead the mind insensibly to dwell on the thing of another and a better world it be on such a day that the inhabitant of b -- throng toward the village church for the double purpose of pour out they thanksgiving and of hear the first effort of they rector 's son in the duty of he sacred call amongst the crowd whom curiosity or a better feeling have draw forth be to be see the flare equipage of the jarvise and the handsome carriage of sir edward moseley and he sister all the member of the latter family feel a lively anxiety for the success of the young divine but know as they well do the strength of he native talent the excellence of he education and the fervor of he piety it be a anxiety that partake more of hope than of fear there be one heart however amongst they that palpitate with a emotion that hardly admit of control as they approach the sacred edifice for it have identify itself completely with the welfare of the rector 's son there never be a softer truer heart than that which now almost audibly beat within the bosom of clara moseley and she have give it to the young divine with all its purity and truth the entrance of a congregation into the sanctuary will at all time furnish to a attentive observer food for much useful speculation if it be chasten with a proper charity for the weakness of other and most people be ignorant of the insight they be give into they character and disposition by such a apparently trivial circumstance as they weekly approach to the tabernacle of the lord christianity while it chasten and amend the heart leave the natural power unaltered and it can not be doubt that its operation be or ought to be proportionate to the ability and opportunity of the subject of its holy impression -- unto whomsoever much be give much will be require while we acknowledge that the thought might be better employ in prepare for those humiliation of the spirit and thanksgiving of the heart which be require of all and be so

nothing could be properly say to be study she follow she husband with a step of equal deliberation though it be slightly vary by a manner which while it appear natural to herself might have be artificial in another : a cambric handkerchief conceal she face as she sink composedly by the side of sir edward in a style which show that while she remember she maker she have not entirely forget herself the walk of mr wilson be quicker than that of she sister she eye direct before she be fix as if in settle gaze on that eternity which she be approach the line of she contemplative face be unaltered unless there might be trace a deeper shade of humility than be ordinarily see on she pale but expressive countenance : she petition be long and on rise from she humble posture the person be indeed to be see but the soul appear absorb in contemplation beyond the limit of this sphere there be a restlessness and vary of color in the ordinarily placid clara which prevent a display of she usual manner while jane walk gracefully and with a tincture of she mother 's manner by she side she steal one hastily withdraw glance to the deanery pew ere she kneel and then on rise hand she smelling-bottle affectionately to she elder sister emily glide behind she companion with a face beam with a look of innocence and love as she sink in the act of supplication the rich glow of she healthful cheek lose some of its brilliancy but on rise it beam with a renew lustre that plainly indicate a heart touch with the sanctity of its situation in the compose and sedate manner of mr jarvi as he steadily pursue he way to the pew of sir william harri you might have be justify in expect the entrance of another sir edward moseley in substance if not in externals but the deliberate separation of the flap of he coat as he comfortably seat himself when you think he about to kneel follow by a pinch of snuff as he throw he eye around the building lead you at once to conjecture that what at first have be mistake for reverence be the abstraction of some earthly calculation and that he attendance be in compliance with custom and not a little depend upon the thickness of he cushion and the room he find for the disposition of two rather unwieldy leg the lady of the family follow in garment carefully select for the advantageous display of they person as they sail into they seat where it would seem the improvidence of sir william 's steward have neglect some important accommodation -lrb- some time be spend in preparation to be seat -rrb- the old lady whose size and flesh

of the latter dine by invitation at the hall colonel egerton have recover the use of he leg and be include in the party between this gentleman and mr benfield there appear from the first moment of they introduction a repugnance which be rather increase by time and which the old gentleman manifest by a demeanor load with the overstrained ceremony of the day and which in the colonel only show itself by avoid when possible all intercourse with the object of he aversion both sir edward and lady moseley on the contrary be not slow in manifest they favorable impression in behalf of the gentleman the latter in particular have ascertain to she satisfaction that he be the undoubted heir to the title and most probably to the estate of he uncle sir edgar egerton feel herself strongly dispose to encourage a acquaintance she find so agreeable and to which she could see no reasonable objection captain jarvi who be extremely offensive to she from he vulgar familiarity she barely tolerate from the necessity of be civil and keep up sociability in the neighborhood it be true she could not help be surprise that a gentleman as polished as the colonel could find any pleasure in a associate like he friend or even in the hardly more softened female of he family then again the flattering suggestion would present itself that possibly he might have see emily at bath or jane elsewhere and avail himself of the acquaintance of young jarvi to get into they neighborhood lady moseley have never be vain or much interested about the disposal of she own person previously to she attachment to she husband : but she daughter call forth not a little of she natural pride -- we have almost say of she selfishness the attention of the colonel be of the most delicate and insinuate kind and mr wilson several time turn away in displeasure at herself for listen with too much satisfaction to nothing utter in a agreeable manner or what be worse false sentiment support with the gloss of language and a fascinating deportment the anxiety of this lady on behalf of emily keep she ever on the alert when chance or any chain of circumstance throw she in the way of form new connexion of any kind and of late as she charge approach the period of life she sex be apt to make that choice from which there be no retreat she solicitude to examine the character of the man who approach she be really painful as to lady moseley she wish dispose she to be easily satisfied and she mind naturally shrink from a investigation to which she feel herself unequal while mr wilson be govern by the conviction of a sound discretion mature by long and deep reasoning all act on a temper at all time ardent and a watchfulness calculate to endure to the end pray my lady say mr jarvi with a look of something like importance have you make any discovery about this mr denbigh who die in the church lately i do not know ma'am reply lady moseley there be any discovery to be make you know lady moseley say colonel egerton that in town all the little accompaniment of such a melancholy death would have find they way into the print and i suppose this be what mr jarvi allude to oh yes cry mr jarvi the colonel be right but the colonel be always right with that lady lady moseley bow she head with dignity and the colonel have too much tact to pursue the conversation but the captain whom nothing have ever yet abashed exclaim these denbigh could not be people of much importance -- i have never hear the name before it be the family name of the duke of derwent i believe dryly remark sir edward oh i be sure neither the old man nor he son look much like a duke or so much as a officer either exclaim mr jarvi who think the latter rank the dignity in degree next below nobility there sit in the parliament of this realm when i be a member a general denbigh say mr benfield with he usual deliberation he be always on the same side with lord gosford and myself he and he friend sir peter howell who be the admiral that take the french squadron in the glorious administration of billy pitt and afterwards take a island with this same general denbigh : aye the old admiral be a hearty blade a good deal such a look man as my hector would make hector be mr benfield 's bull dog mercy whisper john to clara that be you grandfather that be to be uncle benfield be speak of clara smile as she venture to say sir peter be mrs ives 's father sir indeed say the old gentleman with a look of surprise i never know that before i can not say they resemble each other much pray uncle do frank look much like the family ask john with a air of unconquerable gravity but sir interrupted emily be general denbigh and admiral ho well related not that i ever know emmy dear sir frederick denbigh do not look much like the admiral he rather resemble -lrb- gather himself up into a air of formality and bow stiffly to colonel egerton -rrb- this gentleman here i have not the honor of the connexion observe the colonel withdraw behind the chair of jane mr wilson change the conversation to one more general but the little that have fall from mr benfield give reason for believe a connexion in some way of which they be ignorant exist between the descendant of the two veteran and which explain the interest they feel in each other during dinner colonel egerton place himself next to emily and miss jarvi take the chair on the other side he speak of the gay world of watering-places novel play and still find he companion reserve and either unwilling or unable to talk freely he try he favorite sentiment he have read poetry and a remark of he light up a spark of intelligence in the beautiful face of he companion that for a moment deceive he but as he go on to point out he favorite beauty it give place to a settle composure which at last lead he to imagine the casket contain no gem equal to the promise of its brilliant exterior after rest from one of he most labored display of feeling and imagery he accidentally catch the eye of jane fasten on he with a expression of no dubious import and the soldier change he battery in jane he find a more willing auditor poetry be the food she live on and in work of the imagination she find she greatest delight a animated discussion of the merit of they favorite author now take place to renew which the colonel early leave the dining-room for the society of the lady john who dislike drinking excessively be happy of a excuse to attend he the younger lady have cluster together round a window and even emily in she heart rejoice that the gentleman have come to relieve herself and sister from the arduous task of entertaining woman who appear not to possess a single taste or opinion in common with themselves you be say miss moseley observe the colonel in he most agreeable manner as he approach they you think campbell the most musical poet we have i hope you will unite with I in except moore jane color as with some awkwardness she reply moore be certainly very poetical have moore write much innocently ask emily not half as much as he ought cry miss jarvi oh i could live on he beautiful line jane turn away in disgust and that evening while alone with clara she take a volume of moore 's song and very coolly consign they to the flame she sister naturally ask a explanation of so extraordinary a procedure oh cry jane i can not abide the book since that vulgar miss jarvi speak of it with so much interest i really believe aunt wilson be right in not suffer emily to read such thing and jane who have often devour the treacherous line with ardor shrink with fastidious delicacy from the indulgence of a perverted taste when it become expose couple with the vulgarity of unblushing audacity colonel egerton immediately change the subject to one less objectionable and speak of a campaign he have make in spain he possess the happy faculty of give a interest to all he advance whether true or not and as he never contradict or even oppose unless to yield gracefully when a lady be he opponent he conversation insensibly attract by put the sex in good humor with themselves such a man aid by the powerful assistant of person and manners and no inconsiderable colloquial talent mr wilson know to be extremely dangerous as a companion to a youthful female heart and as he visit be to extend to a couple of month she resolve to reconnoitre the state of she pupil 's opinion forthwith in reference to he merit she have take too much pain in form the mind of emily to apprehend she would fall a victim to the eye but she also know that personal grace sweeten a benevolent expression and add force even to the oracle of wisdom she labor a little herself under the disadvantage of what john call a didactic manner and which although she have not the ability or rather taste to amend she have yet the sense to discern it be the great error of mr wilson to attempt to convince where she might have influence but she ardor of temperament and great love of truth keep she as it be tilt with the vice of mankind and consequently sometimes in unprofitable combat with she charge however this could never be say to be the case emily know she heart feel she love and revere she principle too deeply to throw away a admonition or disregard a precept that fall from lip she know never speak idly or without consideration john have feel tempt to push the conversation with miss jarvi and he be about to utter something rapturous respect the melodious poison of little 's poem as the blue eye of emily rest on he in the fulness of sisterly affection and check he love of the ridiculous he quietly yield to he respect for the innocence of he sister and as if eager to draw the attention of all from the hateful subject he put question after question to egerton concern the spaniard and they custom do you ever meet lord pendennyss in spain colonel egerton inquire mr wilson with interest never madam he reply i have much reason to regret that we service lay in different part of the country : he lordship be much with the duke and i make the campaign under marshal beresford emily leave the group at the window and take a seat on the sofa by the side of she aunt insensibly lead she to forget the gloomy thought which have begin to steal over she which the colonel approach where they sit continue by ask -- be you acquaint with the earl madam not in person but by character say mr wilson in a melancholy manner he character as a soldier be very high he have no superior of he year in spain i be tell no reply be make to this remark and emily endeavor anxiously to draw the mind of she aunt to reflection of a more agreeable nature the colonel whose vigilance to please be ever on the alert kindly aid she and they soon succeed the merchant withdraw with he family and guest in proper season : and mr wilson heedful of she duty take the opportunity of a quarter of a hour 's privacy in she own dressing-room in the evening to touch gently on the subject of the gentleman they have see that day how be you pleased emily with you new acquaintance familiarly commence mr wilson oh aunt do not ask I as john say they be _ net _ indeed i be not sorry continue the aunt to have you observe more closely than you have be use to the manners of such woman as the jarvise they be too abrupt and unpleasant to create a dread of any imitation but the gentleman be hero in very different style different from each other indeed to which do you give the preference my dear preference aunt say she niece with a look of astonishment preference be a strong word for either but i rather think the captain the most eligible companion of the two i do believe you see the worst of he and although i acknowledge it to be bad enough he might amend but the colonel -- go on say mr wilson why everything about the colonel seem so seat so ingraft in he nature so -- so very self-satisfied that i be afraid it would be a difficult task to take the first step in amendment -- to convince he of its necessity and be it then so necessary emily look up from arrange some lace with a expression of surprise as he reply : do you not hear he talk of those poem and attempt to point out the beauty of several work i think everything he utter be refer to taste and that not a very natural one at least she add with a laugh it differ greatly from mine he seem to forget altogether there be such a thing as principle : and then he speak of some woman to jane who have leave she father for she lover with so much admiration of she feeling to take up with poverty and love as he call it in place of condemn she want of filial piety -- i be sure aunt if you have hear that you would not admire he so much i do not admire he at all child i only want to know you sentiment and i be happy to find they so correct it be as you think colonel egerton appear to refer nothing to principle : even the more generous feeling i be afraid be corrupt in he from too low intercourse with the surface of society there be by far too much pliability about he for principle of any kind unless indeed it be a principle to please no matter how no one who have deeply seat opinion of right and wrong will ever abandon they even in the courtesy of polite intercourse : they may be silent but never acquiescent : in short my dear the dread of offend we maker ought to be so superior to that of offend we fellow creature that we should endeavor i believe to be even more unbending to the folly of the world than we be and yet the colonel be what they call a good companion -- i mean a pleasant one in the ordinary meaning of the word he be certainly my dear yet you soon tire of sentiment which will not stand the test of examination and of a manner you can not but see be artificial he may do very well for a companion but very ill for a friend in short colonel egerton have neither be satisfy to yield to he natural impression nor to obtain new one from a proper source he have copy from bad model and he work must necessarily be imperfect kiss she niece mr wilson then retire into she own room with the happy assurance that she have not labor in vain but that with divine aid she have implant a guide in the bosom of she charge that could not fail with ordinary care to lead she straight through the devious path of female duty chapter vii a month now pass in the ordinary occupation and amusement of a country life during which both lady moseley and jane manifest a desire to keep up the deanery acquaintance that surprise emily a little who have ever see she mother shrink from communication with those whose breed subject she own delicacy to the little shock she could but ill conceal in jane this desire be still more inexplicable for jane have in a decide way very common to she avowed she disgust of the manners of they new associate at the commencement of the acquaintance and yet jane would now even quit she own society for that of miss jarvi especially if colonel egerton happen to be of the party the innocence of emily prevent she scanning the motive for the conduct of she sister and she set seriously about a examination into she own deportment to find the latent cause in order wherever a opportunity should offer to evince she regret have it be she misfortune to have err by the tenderness of she own manner for a short time the colonel seem at a loss where to make he choice but a few day determine he and jane be evidently the favorite it be true that in the presence of the jarvi lady he be more guard and general in he attention but as john from a motive of charity have take the direction of the captain 's sport into he own hand and as they be in the frequent habit of meeting at the hall preparatory to they morning excursion the colonel suddenly become a sportsman the lady would often accompany they in they morning excursion and as john would certainly be a baronet and the colonel might not if he uncle marry he have the comfort of be sometimes ridden as well as of ride one morning have all prepare for a excursion on horseback as they stand at the door ready to mount franci ive drive up in he father 's gig and for a moment arrest the party franci be a favorite with the whole moseley family and they greeting be warm and sincere he find they mean to take the rectory in they ride and insist that they should proceed clara would take a seat with he as he speak the cast of he countenance bring the color into the cheek of he intended she suffer herself however to be hand into the vacant seat in the gig and they move on john who be at the bottom good-natured and love both franci and clara very sincerely soon set captain jarvi and he sister what he call scrub racing and necessity in some measure compel the rest of the equestrian to hard ride in order to keep up with the sport that will do that will do cry john cast he eye back and perceive they have lose sight of the gig and nearly so of colonel egerton and jane why you carry it off like a jockey captain better than any amateur i have ever see unless indeed it be you sister the lady encourage by he commendation whip on follow by she brother and sister at half speed there emily say john quietly drop by she side i see no reason you and i should break we neck to show the blood of we horse now do you know i think we be go to have a wedding in the family soon emily look at he in amazement frank have get a living i see it the moment he drive up he come in like somebody yes i dare say he have calculate the tithe already a dozen time john be right the earl of bolton have unsolicited give he the desire living of he own parish and franci be at the moment press the blush clara to fix the day that be to put a period to he long probation clara who have not a particle of coquetry about she promise to be he as soon as he be induct a event that be to take place the follow week and then follow those delightful little arrangement and plan with which youthful hope be so fond of fill up the void of life doctor say john as he come out of the rectory to assist clara from the gig the parson here be a careful driver see he have not turn a hair he kiss the burning cheek of he sister as she touch the ground and whisper significantly you need tell I nothing my dear -- i know all -- i consent mr ive fold she future daughter to she bosom and the benevolent smile of the good rector together with the kind and affectionate manner of she sister assure clara the approach nuptials be anticipate as a matter of course colonel egerton offer he compliment to franci on he preferment to the living with the polish of high breeding and not without a appearance of interest and emily think he for the first time as handsome as he be generally repute to be the lady undertake to say something civil in they turn and john put the captain by a hint on the same track you be quite lucky sir say the captain in get so good a living with so little trouble i wish you joy of it with all my heart : mr moseley tell I it be a capital thing now for a gentleman of you profession for my part i prefer a scarlet coat to a black one but there must be parson you know or how should we get marry or say grace franci thank he for he good wish and egerton pay a handsome compliment to the liberality of the earl he doubt not he find that gratification which always attend a disinterested act and jane applaud the sentiment with a smile the baronet when he be make acquaint with the situation of affair promise franci that no unnecessary delay should intervene and the marriage be happily arrange for the follow week lady moseley when she retire to the drawing-room after dinner commence a recital of the ceremony and company to be invite on the occasion etiquette and the decency of life be not only the forte but the fault of this lady and she have go on to the enumeration of about the fortieth personage in the ceremonial before clara find courage to say that mr ive and myself both wish to be marry at the altar and to proceed to bolton rectory immediately after the ceremony to this she mother warmly object and argument and respectful remonstrance have follow each other for some time before clara submit in silence with difficulty restrain she tear this appeal to the better feeling of the mother triumph and the love of parade yield to love of she offspring clara with a lighten heart kiss and thank she and accompany by emily leave the room jane have rise to follow they but catch a glimpse of the tilbury of colonel egerton she reseat herself he have merely drive over at the earnest entreaty of the lady to beg miss jane would accept a seat back with he they have some little project on foot and could not proceed without she assistance mr wilson look gravely at she sister as she smile acquiescence to he wish and the daughter who but the minute before have forget there be any other person in the world but clara fly for she hat and shawl in order as he say to herself that the politeness of colonel egerton might not keep he wait lady moseley resume she seat by the side of she sister with a air of great complacency as she return from the window after have see she daughter off for some time each be occupy quietly with she needle when mr wilson suddenly break the silence by say : who be colonel egerton lady moseley look up for a moment in amazement but recollect herself answer the nephew and heir of sir edgar egerton sister this be speak in a rather positive way as if it be unanswerable yet as there be nothing harsh in the reply mr wilson continue do you not think he attentive to jane pleasure sparkle in the still brilliant eye of lady moseley as she exclaim -- do you think so i do and you will pardon I if i say improperly so i think you be wrong in suffer jane to go with he this afternoon why improperly charlotte if colonel egerton be polite enough to show jane such attention should i not be wrong in rudely reject they the rudeness of refuse a request that be improper to grant be a very venial offence i confess i think it improper to allow any attention to be force on we that may subject we to disagreeable consequence but the attention of colonel egerton be become marked anne do you for a moment doubt they be honorable or that he dare to trifle with a daughter of sir edward moseley i should hope not certainly although it may be well to guard even against such a misfortune but i be of opinion it be quite as important to know whether he be _ worthy _ to be she husband as it be to know that he be in a situation to become so on what point charlotte would you wish to be more assure you know he birth and probable fortune -- you see he manners and disposition but these latter be thing for jane to decide on _ she _ be to live with he and it be proper she should be suit in these respects i do not deny he fortune or he disposition but i complain that we give he credit for the last and for still more important requisite without evidence of he possess any of they he principle he habit he very character what do we know of they i say we for you know anne you child be as dear to I as my own would have be i believe you sincerely but the thing you mention be point for jane to decide on if she be pleased i have no right to complain i be determine never to control the affection of my child have you say never _ to force _ the affection of you child you would have say enough anne but to control or rather to guide the affection of a child especially a daughter be in some case a duty as imperative as it would be to avert any other impending calamity surely the proper time to do this be before the affection of the child be likely to endanger she peace of mind i have seldom see much good result from the interference of parent say lady moseley a little pertinaciously true for to be of use unless in extraordinary case it should not be see you will pardon I anne but i have often think parent be too often in extreme -- determine to make the election for they child or leave they entirely to they own vanity and inexperience to govern not only they own life but i may say to leave a impression on future generation and after all what be this love in nineteen case in twenty of what we call affair of the heart it would be better to term they affair of the _ imagination _ and be there not a great deal of imagination in all love inquire lady moseley smile undoubtedly there be some but there be one important difference : in affair of the imagination the admire object be gifted with all those quality we esteem as a matter of course and there be a certain set of female who be ever ready to bestow this admiration on any applicant for they favor who may not be strikingly objectionable the necessity of be court make we sex rather too much disposed to admire improper suitor but how do you distinguish affair of the heart charlotte from those of the fancy when the heart take the lead it be not difficult to detect it such sentiment generally follow long intercourse and opportunity of judge the real character they be the only attachment that be likely to stand the test of worldly trial suppose emily to be the object of colonel egerton 's pursuit then sister in what manner would you proceed to destroy the influence i acknowledge he be gain over jane i can not suppose such a case say mr wilson gravely and then observe that she sister look as if she require a explanation she continue -- my attention have be direct to the form of such principle and such a taste if i may use the expression under those principle that i feel no apprehension emily will ever allow she affection to be ensnare by a man of the opinion and view of colonel egerton i be impressed with a twofold duty in watch the feeling of my charge she have so much singleness of heart such real strength of native feeling that should a improper man gain possession of she affection the struggle between she duty and she love would be weighty indeed and should it proceed so far as to make it she duty to love a unworthy object i be sure she would sink under it emily would die in the same circumstance under which jane would only awake from a dream and be wretched i think you entertain a better opinion of jane sister say lady moseley reproachfully i think she admirably calculate to make a invaluable wife and mother but she be so much under the influence of she fancy that she seldom give she heart a opportunity of display its excellence and again she dwell so much upon imaginary perfection that adulation have become necessary to she the man who flatter she delicately will be sure to win she esteem and every woman might love the be possess of the quality she will not fail to endow he with i do not know that i rightly understand how you would avert all these sad consequence of improvident affection say lady moseley prevention be better than cure -- i would first implant such opinion as would lessen the danger of intercourse and as for particular attention from improper object it should be my care to prevent they by prohibit or rather impede the intimacy which might give rise to they and least of all say mr wilson with a friendly smile as she rise to leave the room would i suffer a fear of be impolite to endanger the happiness of a young woman intrust to my care chapter viii franci who labor with the ardor of a lover soon complete the necessary arrangement and alteration in he new parsonage the living be a good one and as the rector be enable to make a very considerable annual allowance from the private fortune he wife have bring he and as sir edward have twenty thousand pound in the fund for each of he daughter one portion of which be immediately settle on clara the youthful couple have not only a sufficient but a abundant provision for they station in life and they enter on they matrimonial duty with as good a prospect of happiness as the ill of this world can give to health affection and competency they union have be defer by dr ive until he son be establish with a view to keep he under he own direction during the critical period of he first impression in the priesthood and as no objection now remain or rather the only one he ever feel be remove by the proximity of bolton to he own parish he now joyfully unite the lover at the altar of the village church in the presence of he wife and clara 's immediate relative on leave the church franci hand he bride into he own carriage which convey they to they new residence amidst the good wish of he parishioner and the prayer of they relative and friend dr and mr ive retire to the rectory to the sober enjoyment of the felicity of they only child while the baronet and he lady feel a gloom that belie all the wish of the latter for the establishment of she daughter jane and emily act as bridesmaid to they sister and as both the former and she mother have insist there should be two groomsman as a counterpoise john be empower with a carte-blanche to make a provision accordingly at first he intimate he intention of call on mr benfield but he finally settle down to the no small mortification of the before-mentioned lady into write a note to he kinsman lord chatterton whose residence be then in london and who in reply after express he sincere regret that a accident would prevent he have the pleasure of attend state the intention of he mother and two sister to pay they a early visit of congratulation as soon as he own health would allow of he travel this answer arrive only the day precede that fix for the wedding and at the very moment they be expect he lordship in proper person there cry jane in triumph i tell you it be silly to send so far on so sudden a occasion now after all what be to be do -- it will be so awkward when clara 's friend call to see she -- oh john john you be a marplot jenny jenny you be a make-plot say john coolly take up he hat to leave the room which way my son say the baronet who meet he at the door to the deanery sir to try to get captain jarvi to act as bridesmaid -- i beg he pardon groomsman to-morrow -- chatterton have be throw from a horse and can not come '' john jenny i be sure say jane indignation glowing in she pretty face that if captain jarvi be to be a attendant clara must excuse my act i do not choose to be associate with captain jarvi john say he mother with dignity you trifling be unseasonable certainly colonel egerton be a more fitting person on every account and i desire under present circumstance that you ask the colonel you ladyship 's wish be order to I say john gaily kiss he hand as he leave the room the colonel be but too happy in have it in he power to be of service in any manner to a gentleman he respect as much as mr franci ive he accept the duty and be the only person present at the ceremony who do not stand within the bond of consanguinity to the party he be invite by the baronet to dine at the hall as a matter of course and notwithstanding the repeat injunction of mr jarvi and she daughter to return immediately with a account of the dress of the bride and with other important item of a similar nature the invitation be accept on reach the hall emily retire immediately to she own room and at she reappearance when the dinner bell ring the paleness of she cheek and the redness of she eye afford sufficient proof that the translation of a companion from she own to another family be a event however happy in itself not unmingled with grief the day however pass off tolerably well for people who be expect to be premeditatedly happy and when in they heart they be really more disposed to weep than to laugh jane and the colonel have most of the conversation to themselves during dinner : even the joyous and thoughtless john wear he gaiety in a less graceful manner than usual he be actually detect by he aunt in look with moisten eye at the vacant chair a servant have from habit place at the table in the spot where clara have be accustom to sit this beef be not do saunder say the baronet to he butler or my appetite be not as good as usual to-day colonel egerton will you allow I the pleasure of a glass of sherry the wine be drunk and the game succeed the beef but still sir edward could not eat how glad clara will be to see we all the day after to-morrow say mr wilson you new housekeeper delight in they first effort in entertain they friend lady moseley smile through she tear and turn to she husband say we will go early my dear that we may see the improvement franci have be make before we dine the baronet nod assent but he heart be too full to speak and apologize to the colonel for he absence on the plea of some business with he people he leave the room all this time the attention of colonel egerton to both mother and daughter be of the most delicate kind he speak of clara as if he office of groomsman entitle he to a interest in she welfare with john he be kind and sociable and even mr wilson acknowledge after he have take he leave that he possess a wonderful faculty of make himself agreeable and she begin to think that under all circumstance he might possibly prove as advantageous a connexion as jane could expect to form have any one however propose he as a husband for emily affection would have quicken she judgment in a way that would have urge she to a very different decision soon after the baronet leave the room a travel carriage with suitable attendant drive to the door the sound of the wheel draw most of the company to a window a baron 's coronet cry jane catch a glimpse of the ornament of the harness the chatterton echo she brother run out of the room to meet they the mother of sir edward be a daughter of this family and the sister of the grandfather of the present lord the connexion have always be keep up with a show of cordiality between sir edward and he cousin although they manner of living and habit be very different the baron be a courtier and a placeman he estate which he could not alienate produce about ten thousand a year but the income he could and do spend and the high perquisite of he situation under government amounting to as much more be melt away year after year without make the pro vision for he daughter that he duty and the observance of he promise to he wife 's father require at he hand he have be dead about two year and he son find himself saddle with the support of a unjointured mother and unportioned sister money be not the idol the young lord worship nor even pleasure he be affectionate to he survive parent and he first act be to settle during he own life two thousand a year on she while he commence set aside as much more for each of he sister annually this abridged he greatly in he own expenditure yet as they make but one family and the dowager be really a _ managing _ woman in more sens than one they make a very tolerable figure the son be anxious to follow the example of sir edward moseley and give up he town house for at least a time but he mother have exclaim with something like horror at the proposal : chatterton would you give it up at the moment it can be of the most use to we and she throw a glance at she daughter that would have discover she motive to mr wilson which be lose on she son he poor soul think she find it convenient to support the interest he have be make for the place hold by he father one of more emolument than service or even honor the contend party be so equally match that this situation be keep as it be in abeyance wait the arrival of some acquisition of interest to one or other of the claimant the interest of the peer however have begin to lose ground at the period of which we speak and he careful mother see new motive for activity in provide for she child mr wilson herself could not be more vigilant in examine the candidate for emily 's favor than be the dowager lady chatterton in behalf of she daughter it be true the task of the former jady be by far the most arduous for it involve a study of character and development of principle while that of the latter would have end with the footing of a rent-roll provide it contain five figure sir edward 's be well know to contain that number and two of they be not cipher mr benfield be rich and john moseley be a very agreeable young man wedding be the season of love think the prudent dowager and grace be extremely pretty chatterton who never refuse he mother anything in he power to grant and who be particularly dutiful when a visit to moseley hall be in question suffer himself to be persuade he shoulder be well and they have leave town the day before the wedding think to be in time for all the gaiety if not for the ceremony itself there exist but little similarity between the person and manners of this young nobleman and the baronet 's heir the beauty of chatterton be almost feminine he skin he color he eye he tooth be such as many a belle have sigh after and he manners be bashful and retire yet a intimacy have commence between the boy at school which ripen into friendship between the young man at college and have be maintain ever since probably as much from the contrariety of character as from any other cause with the baron john be more sedate than ordinary with john chatterton find unusual animation but a secret charm which john hold over the young peer be he profound respect and unvarying affection for he youngest sister emily this be common ground and no dream of future happiness no vision of dawn wealth cross the imagination of chatterton in which emily be not the fairy to give birth to the one or the benevolent dispenser of the hoard of the other the arrival of this family be a happy relief from the oppression which hang on the spirit of the moseley and they reception mark with the mild benevolence which belong to the nature of the baronet and that _ impressement _ which so eminently distinguish the manners of he wife the honorable miss chatterton be both handsome but the younger be if possible a softened picture of she brother there be the same retire bashfulness and the same sweetness of temper as distinguish the baron and grace be the peculiar favorite of emily moseley nothing of the strained or sentimental nature which so often characterize what be call female friendship however have creep into the communication between these young woman emily love she sister too well to go out of she own family for a repository of she grief or a partaker in she joy have

she anxious inquiry into he character have be attend with such answer as flattered she wish but the military duty of the earl or he private affair have never allow a meeting and she be now compel to look forward to what john laughingly term they winter campaign as the only probable place where she could be gratify with the sight of a young man to whom she owe so much and whose name be connect with some of the most tender though most melancholy recollection of she life colonel egerton who now appear to be almost domesticate in the family be again of the party at dinner to the no small

enter on the duty of he dangerous undertaking with the indifference of foolhardiness the game be play with tolerable ability by both party but no emotion no absence of mind could be discover on the part of the gentleman foot and hand be in motion still the colonel play as well as usual he have answer for all jane 's question and smile for he partner but no check-mate could she obtain until wilfully throw away a advantage he suffer the lady to win the game the dowager be satisfied nothing could be do with the colonel chapter x the first carriage that roll over the lawn to bolton

member he member buy the ministry everything be buy and sell now sir in the parliament in which i have the honor of a seat there be a knot of we as upright as post sir my lord gosford be one and general denbigh be another although i can not say he be much a favorite with I you do not look in the least like he how be he relate to you sir he be my grandfather reply denbigh look pleasantly at emily as if to tell she he understand the character of she uncle have the old man continue he speech a hour longer denbigh would not have complain they have stop while talk and he thus become confront with the beautiful figure that support the other arm denbigh contemplate in admiration the vary countenance which now blush with apprehension and now smile in affection or even with a archer expression as she uncle proceed in he harangue on the time but all felicity in this world have a end as well as misery denbigh retain the recollection of that speech long after mr benfield be comfortably seat in the parlor though for he life he could not recollect a word he have say the haughton the jarvise and a few more of they intimate acquaintance arrive and the parsonage have a busy air but john who have undertake to drive grace chatterton in he own phaeton be yet absent some little anxiety have begin to be manifest when he appear dash through the gate at a great rate and with the skill of a member of the four-in-hand lady chatterton have begin to be seriously uneasy and she be about to speak to she son to go in quest of they as they come in sight but now she fear vanish and she could only suppose that a desire to have grace alone could keep one who bad the reputation of a jehu so much behind the rest of the party she meet they in great spirit cry upon my word mr moseley i begin to think you have take the road to scotland you stay so long you daughter my lady chatterton say john pithily would go to scotland neither with I nor any other man or i be greatly deceive in she character glara my sister how do you do he salute the bride with great warmth and affection but what detain you moseley inquire the mother one of the horse be restive and he break the harness we merely stop in the village while it be mend and how do grace behave ask emily laugh oh a thousand time better than you would sister as she always do and like a angel the only point in dispute between emily and she brother be she want of faith in he drive while poor grace naturally timid and unwilling to oppose any one particularly the gentleman who then hold the rein have govern herself sufficiently to be silent and motionless indeed she could hardly do otherwise have she wish it so great be he impetuosity of character and john feel flattered to a degree of which he be himself unconscious self-complacency aid by the merit the beauty and the delicacy of the young lady herself might have lead to the very result she mother so anxiously wish to produce have that mother be satisfy with let thing take they course but manager very generally overdo they work grace _ be _ a good girl say she gratified mother and you find she very valiant mr moseley oh as brave as cæsar answer john carelessly in a way that be not quite free from irony grace whose burning cheek show but too plainly that praise from john moseley be a incense too powerful for she resistance now sink back behind some of the company endeavor to conceal the tear that almost gush from she eye denbigh be a silent spectator of the whole scene and he now considerately observe that he have lately see a improvement which would obviate the difficulty mr moseley have experience john turn to the speaker and they be soon engage in the discussion of curb and buckle when the tilbury of colonel egerton drive to the door contain himself and he friend the captain the bride undoubtedly receive congratulation that day more sincere than those which be now offer but none be deliver in a more graceful and insinuate manner than the compliment which fall from colonel egerton he pass round the room speak to he acquaintance until he arrive at the chair of jane who be seat next she aunt here he stop and glance he eye round and salute with bow and smile the remainder of the party he appear fix at the center of all attraction there be a gentleman i think i have never see before he observe to mr wilson cast he eye on denbigh whose back be towards he in discourse with mr benfield it be mr denbigh of whom you hear we speak reply mr wilson while she speak denbigh face they egerton start as he catch a view of he face and seem to gaze on the countenance which be open to he inspection with a earnestness that show a interest of some kind but of a nature that be inexplicable to mr wilson who be the only observer of this singular recognition for such it evidently be all be now natural in the colonel for the moment he color sensibly change and there be a expression of doubt in he face it might be fear it might be horror it might be a strong aversion it clearly be not love emily sit by she aunt and denbigh approach they make a cheerful remark it be impossible for the colonel to avoid he have he wish it and he keep he ground mr wilson think she would try the experiment of a introduction colonel egerton -- mr denbigh both gentleman bow but nothing striking be see in the deportment of either the colonel who be not exactly at ease say hastily -- mr denbigh be or have be in the army i believe denbigh be now take by surprise in he turn : he cast a look on egerton of fix and settle meaning then carelessly observe but still as if require a answer : i be yet but i do not recollect have have the pleasure of meeting with colonel egerton on service you countenance be familiar sir reply the colonel coldly but at this moment i can not tax my memory with the place of-our meeting though one see so many strange face in a campaign that they come and go like shadow he then change the conversation it be some time however before either gentleman entirely recover he ease -- and many day elapse ere anything like intercourse pass between they the colonel attach himself during this visit to jane with occasional notice of the miss jarvi who begin to manifest symptom of uneasiness at the decide preference he show to a lady they now choose to look upon in some measure as a rival mr wilson and she charge on the other hand be entertain by the conversation of chatterton and denbigh relieve by occasional sally from the lively john there be something in the person and manners of denbigh that insensibly attract those whom chance throw in he way he face be not strikingly handsome but it be noble and when he smile or be much animated it invariably communicate a spark of he own enthusiasm to the beholder he figure be faultless he air and manner if less easy than those of colonel egerton be more sincere and ingenuous he breeding be clearly higher he respect for other rather border on the old school but in he voice there exist a charm which would make he when he speak to a female ear almost resistless : it be soft deep melodious and winning baronet say the rector look with a smile towards he son and daughter i love to see my child happy and mr ive threaten a divorce if i go on in the manner i have commence she say i desert she for bolton why doctor if we wife conspire against we and prevent we enjoy a comfortable dish of tea with clara or a glass of wine with frank we must call in the higher authority as umpire what say you sister be a parent to desert he child in any case my opinion be say mr wilson with a smile yet speak with emphasis that a parent be _ not _ to desert a child in any case or in any manner do you hear that my lady moseley cry the good-humored baronet do you hear that my lady chatterton echo john who have just take a seat by grace when she mother approach they i hear it but do not see the application mr moseley no my lady why there be the honorable miss chatterton almost die to play a game of she favorite chess with mr denbigh she have beat we all but he and she triumph will not be complete until she have he too at she foot and as denbigh politely offer to meet the challenge the board be produce and the party be seat lady chatterton stand lean over she daughter 's chair with a view however to prevent any of those consequence she be generally fond of see result from this amusement every measure take by this prudent mother be literally govern by judicious calculation umph think john as he view the player while listen with pleasure to the opinion of grace who have recover she composure and spirit kate after all have play one game without use she foot chapter xi ten day or a fortnight fly swiftly by during which mr wilson suffer emily to give clara a week have first ascertain that denbigh be a settle resident at the rectory and thereby not likely to be oftener at the house of franci than at the hall where he be a frequent and welcome guest both oh he own account and as a friend of doctor ive emily have return and she bring the bride and groom with she when one evening as they be pleasantly seat at they various amusement with the ease of old acquaintance mr haughton enter it be at a hour rather unusual for he visit and throw down he hat after make the usual inquiry he begin without preface -- i know good people you be all wonder what have bring I out this time of night but the truth be lucy have coax she mother to persuade I into a ball in honor of the time so my lady i have consent and my wife and daughter have be buy up all the finery in b -- by the way i suppose of anticipate they friend there be a regiment of foot come into barracks within fifteen mile of we and to-morrow i must beat up for recruit among the officer -- girl be never want on such occasion why cry the baronet you be grow young again my friend no sir edward but my daughter be young and life have so many care that i be willing she should get rid of as many as she can at my expense surely you would not wish she to dance they away say mr wilson such relief i be afraid will prove temporary do you disapprove of dancing ma'am say mr haughton who hold she opinion in great respect as well as a little dread i neither approve nor disapprove of it -- jump up and down be innocent enough in itself and if it must be do it be well it be do gracefully as for the accompaniment of dancing i say nothing -- what do you say doctor ive to what my dear madam to dancing oh let the girl dance if they enjoy it i be glad you think so doctor cry the delighted mr haughton i be afraid i recollected you advise you son never to dance nor to play at game of chance you think right my friend say the doctor lay down he newspaper i do give that advice to frank whom you will please to remember be now rector of bolton i do not object to dancing as not innocent in itself or as a elegant exercise but it be like drinking generally carry to excess : now as a christian i be oppose to all excess the music and company lead to intemperance in the recreation and they often induce neglect of duty -- but so may anything else i like a game of whist doctor greatly say mr haughton but observe that you never play and recollect you advice to mr franci i have forbid card when you be my guest i thank you for the compliment good sir reply the doctor with a smile still i would much rather see you play card than hear you talk scandal as you sometimes do scandal echo mr haughton ay scandal say the doctor coolly such as the remark you make the last time which be only yesterday i call to see you you accuse sir edward of be wrong in let that poacher off so easily the baronet you say do not shoot himself and do not know how to prize game as he ought scandal doctor -- do you call that scandal why i tell sir edward so himself two or three time i know you do and that be rude rude i hope sincerely sir edward have put no such construction on it the baronet smile kindly and shake he head because the baronet choose to forgive you offence it do not alter they nature say the doctor gravely : no you must repent and amend you impeach he motive for do a benevolent act and that i call scandal why doctor i be angry the fellow should be let loose he be a pest to all the game in the county and every sportsman will tell you so -- here mr moseley you know jackson the poacher oh a poacher be a intolerable wretch cry captain jarvi oh a poacher echo john look drolly at emily hang all poacher poacher or no poacher do not alter the scandal say the doctor now let I tell you good sir i would rather play at fifty game of whist than make one such speech unless indeed it interfere with my duty now sir with you leave i 'll explain myself as to my son there be a artificial levity about dancing that add to the dignity of no man : from some it may detract : a clergyman for instance be suppose to have other thing to do and it might hurt he in the opinion of those with whom he influence be necessary and impair he usefulness therefore a clergyman should never dance in the same way with card they be the common instrument of gambling and a odium be attach to they on that account woman and clergyman must respect the prejudice of mankind in some case or lose they influence in society i do hope to have the pleasure of you company doctor say mr haughton hesitatingly and if it will give you pleasure cry the rector you shall have it with all my heart good sir it would be a greater evil to wind the feeling of such a neighbor as mr haughton than to show my face once at a ball and rise he lay he hand on the shoulder of the other kindly both you scandal and rudeness be easily forgive but i wish to show you the common error of the world which have attach odium to certain thing while it charitably overlook other of a more heinous nature mr haughton who have at first be a little staggered with the attack of the doctor recover himself and lay a handful of note on the table hope he should have the pleasure of see every body the invitation be generally accept and the worthy man depart happy if he friend do but come and be please do you dance miss moseley inquire denbigh of emily as he sit watch she graceful movement in net a purse for she father oh yes the doctor say nothing of we girl you know i suppose he think we have no dignity to lose admonition be generally throw away on young lady when pleasure be in the question say the doctor with a look of almost paternal affection i hope you do not seriously disapprove of it in moderation say mr wilson that depend madam upon circumstance if it be to be make subsidiary to envy malice coquetry vanity or any other such little lady-like accomplishment it certainly have better be let alone but in moderation and with the feeling of my little pet here i should be cynical indeed to object denbigh appear lose in he own rumination during this dialogue and as the doctor end he turn to the captain who be overlook a game of chess between the colonel and jane of which the latter have become remarkably fond of late playing with she hand and eye instead of she foot -- and inquire the name of the corps in barracks at f -- the -- th foot sir reply the captain haughtily who neither respect he owe to he want of consequence nor love he from the manner in which emily listen to he conversation will miss moseley forgive a bold request say denbigh with some hesitation emily look up from she work in silence but with some little fluttering at the heart the honor of she hand for the first dance continue denbigh observe she be in expectation that he would proceed emily laughingly say certainly mr denbigh if you can submit to the degradation the london papers now come in and most of the gentleman sit down to they perusal the colonel however replace the man for a second game and denbigh still keep he place beside mr wilson and she niece the manners the sentiment the whole exterior of this gentleman be such as both the taste and judgment of the aunt approve of he quality be those which insensibly gain on the heart and yet mrs wilson notice with a slight uneasiness the very evident satisfaction she niece take in he society in dr ive she have great confidence yet dr ive be a friend and probably judge he favorably and again dr ive be not to suppose he be introduce a candidate for the hand of emily in every gentleman he bring to the hall mr wilson have see too often the ill consequence of trust to impression receive from inference of companionship not to know the only safe way be to judge for ourselves : the opinion of other might be partial -- might be prejudice -- and many a improper connexion have be form by listen to the sentiment of those who speak without interest and consequently without examination not a few match be make by this idle commendation of other utter by those who be respect and which be probably suggest more by a desire to please than by reflection or even knowledge in short mr wilson know that as we happiness chiefly interest ourselves so it be to ourselves or to those few whose interest be equal to we own we could only trust those important inquiry necessary to establish a permanent opinion of character with doctor ive she communication on subject of duty be frequent and confide and although she sometimes think he benevolence dispose he to be rather too lenient to the fault of mankind she entertain a profound respect for he judgment it have great influence with she if it be not always conclusive she determine therefore to have a early conversation with he on the subject so near she heart and be in a great measure regulate by he answer in the step to be immediately take every day give she what he think melancholy proof of the ill consequence of neglect a duty in the increase intimacy of colonel egerton and jane here aunt cry john as he run over a paper be a paragraph relate to you favorite youth we trusty and well beloved cousin the earl of pendennyss read it say mr wilson with a interest he name never fail to excite we notice to-day the equipage of the gallant lord pendennyss before the gate of annandale-house and understand the noble earl be last from bolton castle northamptonshire a very important fact say captain jarvi sarcastically colonel egerton and myself get as far as the village to pay we respects to he when we hear he have go on to town the earl 's character both as a man and a soldier observe the colonel give he a claim to we attention that he rank would not : on that account we would have call brother say mr wilson you would oblige I greatly by ask he lordship to waive ceremony he visit to bolton castle will probably be frequent now we have peace and the owner be so much from home that we may never see he without some such invitation do you want he as a husband for emily cry john as he gaily seat himself by the side of he sister mr wilson smile at a observation which remind she of one of she romantic wish and as she raise she head to reply in the same tone meet the eye of denbigh fix on she with a expression that

but in that of they friend they perception of honor be intuitively keen and they inflexibility in preserve it from reproach unbending and such be the weakness of mankind they tenderness on point where the nicer feeling of a soldier be involve that these machine of custom these thermometer graduate to the scale of false honor usurp the place of reason and benevolence and become too often the arbiter of life and death to a whole corps such then be the confidant to whom jarvi communicate the cause of he disgust and the consequence may easily be imagine as he pass emily and denbigh he throw a look of fierceness at the latter which he mean as a indication of he hostile intention it be lose on he rival who at that moment be fill with passion of a very different kind from those which captain jarvi think agitate he own bosom for have he new friend let he alone the captain would have go quietly home and go to sleep have you ever fight say captain digby coolly to he companion as they seat

john moseley to he sister clara i have a mind to ask she to dance do john reply he sister look with pleasure on she beautiful cousin who observe the movement of john as he draw near where she sit move she face on each side rapidly in search of some one who be apparently not to be find she breathing become sensibly quicker and john be on the point of speak to she as the dowager step in between they there be nothing so flattering to the vanity of a man as the discovery of emotion in a young woman excite by himself and which the party evidently wish to conceal there be nothing so touch so sure to captivate or if it seem to be affect so sure to disgust now mr moseley cry the mother you shall not ask grace to dance she can refuse you nothing and she have be up the last two figure you wish be irresistible lady chatterton say john coolly turn on he heel on gain the other side of the room he turn to reconnoitre the scene the dowager be fan herself as violently as if _ she _ have be up the last two figure instead of she daughter while grace sit with she eye fasten on the floor paler than usual grace think the young man would be very handsome -- very sweet -- very -- very everything that be agreeable if -- if it be not for mother chatterton he then lead out one of the prettiest girl in the room col egerton be peculiarly fit to shine in a ball room he dance gracefully and with spirit be perfectly at home with all the usage of the best society and be never neglectful of any of those little courtesy which have they charm for the moment and jane moseley who see all those she love around she apparently as happy as herself find in she judgment or the conviction of she principle no counterpoise against the weight of such attraction all centre as it be in one effort to please herself he flattery be deep for it be respectful -- he taste be she taste -- he opinion she opinion on the formation of they acquaintance they differ on some trifling point of poetical criticism and for near a month the colonel have maintain he opinion with a show of firmness but opportunity not want for the discussion he have feel constrain to yield to she better judgment she purer taste the conquest of colonel egerton be complete and jane who see in he attention the submission of a devoted heart begin to look forward to the moment with tremble that be to remove the thin barrier that exist between the adulation of the eye and the most delicate assiduity to please and the open confidence of declare love jane moseley have a heart to love and to love strongly she danger exist in she imagination : it be brilliant unchastened by she judgment we have almost say unfettered by she principle principle such as be find in every-day maxim and rule of conduct sufficient to restrain she within the bound of perfect decorum she be furnish with in abundance but to that principle which be to teach she submission in opposition to she wish to that principle that could alone afford she security against the treachery of she own passion she be a utter stranger the family of sir edward be among the first to retire and as the chatterton have they own carriage mr wilson and she charge return alone in the coach of the former emily who have be rather out of spirit the latter-part of the evening break the silence by suddenly observe colonel egerton be or soon will be a perfect hero she aunt somewhat surprise both with the abruptness and with the strength of the remark inquire she meaning oh jane will make he one whether or not this be speak with a air of vexation which she be unused to and mr wilson gravely correct she for speak in a disrespectful manner of she sister one whom neither she year nor-situation entitle she in any measure to advise or control there be a impropriety in judge so near and dear a relation harshly even in think emily press the hand of she aunt and tremulously acknowledge she error but she add that she feel a momentary irritation at the idea of a man of colonel egerton 's character gain the command over feeling such as she sister possess mr wilson kiss the cheek of she niece while she inwardly acknowledge the probable truth of the very remark she have think it she duty to censure that the imagination of jane would supply she lover with those quality she most honor herself she believe be take as a matter of course and that when the veil she have help to throw before she own eye be remove she would cease to respect and of course cease to love he when too late to remedy the evil she greatly fear but in the approach fate of jane she see new cause to call forth she own activity emily moseley have just complete she eighteenth year and be gifted by nature with a vivacity and ardency of feeling that give a heighten zest to the enjoyment of that happy age she be artless but intelligent cheerful with a deep conviction of the necessity of piety and uniform in she practice of all the important duty the unwearied exertion of she aunt aid by she own quickness of perception have make she familiar with the attainment suitable to she sex and year for music she have no taste and the time which would have be throw away in endeavor to cultivate a talent she do not possess be dedicate under the discreet guidance of she aunt to work which have a tendency both to qualify she for the duty of this life and fit she for that which come hereafter it might be say emily moseley have never read a book that contain a sentiment or inculcate a opinion improper for she sex or dangerous to she moral and it be not difficult for those who know the fact to fancy they could perceive the consequence in she guileless countenance and innocent deportment she look -- she action -- she thought wear as much of nature as the discipline of she well-regulated mind and soften manners could admit in person she be of the middle size exquisitely form graceful and elastic in she step without however the least departure from she natural movement she eye be a dark blue with a expression of joy and intelligence at time it seem all soul and again all heart she color be rather high but it vary with every emotion of she bosom she feeling be strong ardent and devoted to those she love she preceptress have never find it necessary to repeat a admonition of any kind since she arrival at year to discriminate between the right and the wrong

be sacred and to the happiness the comfort of those in which she feel a interest there be few sacrifice of she own propensity she would not cheerfully have make : it be this very love of she offspring that make she anxious to dispose of she daughter in wedlock she own marriage have be so happy that she naturally conclude it the state most likely to ensure the happiness of she child and with lady moseley as with thousand of other who averse or unequal to the labor of investigation jump to conclusion over the long line of connect reason marriage be marriage a husband be a husband it be true there be certain indispensable without which the formation of a connexion be a thing she consider not within the bound of nature there must be fitness in fortune in condition in education and manners there must be no glaring evil although she do not ask for positive good a professor of religion herself have any one tell she it be a duty of she call to guard against a connexion with any but a christian for she girl she would have wonder at the ignorance that would embarrass the married state with feeling exclusively belong to the individual have any one tell she it be possible to give she child to any but a gentleman she would have wonder at the want of feeling that could devote the softness of jane or emily to the association with rudeness or vulgarity it be the misfortune of lady moseley to limit she view of marriage to the scene of this life forgetful that every union give existence to a long line of immortal being whose future welfare depend greatly on the force of early example or the strength of early impression the necessity for restriction in they expenditure have cease and the baronet and he wife greatly enjoy the first opportunity they secluded situation have give they to draw around they board they fellow-creature of they own stamp in the former it be pure philanthropy the same feeling urge he to seek out and relieve distress in humble life while in the latter it be love of station and seemliness it be become the owner of moseley hall and it be what the daughter of the benfield family have do since the conquest i be extremely sorry say the good baronet at dinner mr denbigh decline we invitation to-day i hope he will yet ride over in the evening look of a singular import be exchange between colonel egerton and sir herbert nicholson at the mention of denbigh 's name which as the latter have just ask the favor of take wine with mr wilson do not escape she notice emily have innocently mention he precipitate retreat the night before and he have when remind of he engagement to dine with they that very day and promise a introduction to sir herbert nicholson by john in she presence suddenly excuse himself and withdraw with a indefinite suspicion of something wrong she venture therefore to address sir herbert nicholson do you know mr denbigh in spain i tell miss emily moseley i believe last evening that i know some of the name reply the gentleman evasively then pause a moment he add with great emphasis there be a circumstance connect with _ one _ of that name i shall ever remember it be creditable no doubt sir herbert cry young jarvi sarcastically the soldier affect not to hear the question and ask jane to take wine with he lord chatterton however put he knife and fork down gravely and with a glow of animation observe with unusual spirit i have no doubt it be sir jarvi in he turn affect not to hear this speech and nothing farther be say as sir edward see that the name of mr denbigh excite a sensation amongst he guest for which he be unable to account and which he soon forget himself after the company have retire lord chatterton however related to the astonished and indignant family of the baronet the substance of the following scene of which he have be a witness that morning while on a visit to denbigh at the rectory they have be sit in the parlor by themselves over they breakfast when a captain digby be announce i have the honor of wait upon you mr denbigh say the soldier with the stiff formality of a profess duellist on behalf of captain jarvi but will postpone my business until you be at leisure glance he eye on chatterton i know of no business with captain jarvi say denbigh politely hand the stranger a chair to which lord chatterton can not be privy if he will excuse the interruption the nobleman bow and captain digby a little awed by the rank of denbigh 's friend proceed in a more measured manner captain jarvi have empower I sir to make any arrangement with yourself or friend previously to you meeting which he hope may be as soon as possible if convenient to yourself reply the soldier coolly denbigh view he for a moment with astonishment in silence when recollect himself he say mildly and without the least agitation i can not affect sir not to understand you meaning but be at a loss to imagine what act of mine can have make mr jarvi wish to make such a appeal surely mr denbigh can not think a man of captain jarvi 's spirit can quietly submit to the indignity put upon he last evening by you dancing with miss moseley after she have decline the honor to himself say the captain affect a incredulous smile my lord chatterton and myself can easily settle the preliminary as captain jarvi be much disposed to consult you wish sir in this affair if he consult my wish say denbigh smile he will think no more about it at what time sir will it be convenient to give he the meeting then speak with a kind of bravado gentleman of he cast be fond of assume my friend would not hurry any settlement of you affair i can never meet captain jarvi with hostile intention reply denbigh calmly sir i decline the combat sir say denbigh with more firmness you reason sir if you please ask captain digby compress he lip and draw up with a air of personal interest surely cry chatterton who have with difficulty estrain he feeling surely mr denbigh could never so far forget himself as cruelly ' to expose miss moseley by accept this invitation you reason my lord say denbigh with interest would at all time have its weight but i wish not to qualify a act of what i conceive to be principle by any lesser consideration i can not meet captain jarvi or any other man in private combat there can exist no necessity for a appeal to arm in any society where the law rule and i be averse to bloodsh very extraordinary muttered captain digby somewhat at a loss how to act but the calm and collect manner of denbigh prevent a reply and after decline a cup of tea a liquor he never drink he withdraw say he would acquaint he friend with mr denbigh 's singular notion captain digby have leave jarvi at a inn about half a mile from the rectory for the convenience of receive early information of the result of he conference the young man have walk up and down the room during digby 's absence in a train of reflection entirely new to he he be the only son of he aged father and mother the protector of he sister and he might say the sole hope of a rise family and then possibly denbigh might not have mean to offend he -- he might even have be engage before they come to the house or if not it might have be inadvertence on the part of miss moseley that denbigh would offer some explanation he believe and he have fully make up he mind to accept it let it be what it might as he fight friend enter well say jarvi in a tone that denote anything but a consciousness that all _ be _ well he say he will not meet you dryly exclaim he friend throw himself into a chair and order a glass of randy and water not meet I exclaimed jarvi in surprise engage perhaps engage to he d -- d conscience to he conscience i do not know whether i rightly understand you captain digby say jarvi catch he breath and raise he voice a very little then captain jarvi say he friend toss off he brandy and speak with great deliberation he say that nothing -- understand I -- _ nothing _ will ever make he fight a duel he will not cry jarvi in a loud voice no he will not say digby hand he glass to the waiter for a fresh supply he shall by -- i do not know how you will make he make he i 'll -- i 'll post he never do that say the captain turn to he as he lean he elbow on the table it only make both party ridiculous but i 'll tell you what you may do there be a lord chatterton who take the matter up with warmth if i be not afraid of he interest hurt my promotion i should have resent something that fall from he myself he will fight i dare say and i 'll just return and require a explanation of he word on you behalf no no say jarvi rather hastily he -- _ he _ be related to the moseley and i have view there it might injure do you think to forward you view by make the young lady the subject of a duel ask captain digby sarcastically and eye he companion with contempt yes yes say jarvi it would certainly hurt my view here be to the health of he majesty 's gallant -- regiment of foot cry captain digby in a tone of irony when three-quarter drunk at the mess-table that evening and to its champion captain henry jarvi one of the corps be present accidentally as a guest and the follow week the inhabitant of f -- see the regiment in they barracks march to slow time after the body of horace digby lord chatterton in relate the part of the foregoing circumstance which fall under he observation do ample justice to the conduct of denbigh a degree of liberality which do he no little credit as he plainly see in that gentleman he have or soon would have a rival in the dearest wish of he heart and the smile approbation with which he cousin emily reward he for he candor almost sicken he with apprehension the lady be not slow in express they disgust at the conduct of jarvi or backward in they approval of denbigh 's forbearance lady moseley turn with horror from a picture in which she could see nothing but murder and bloodshed but both mr wilson and she niece secretly applaud a sacrifice of worldly feeling on the altar of duty the former admire the consistent refusal of admit any collateral inducement in explanation of he decision : the latter while she see the act in its true color could hardly help believe that a regard for _ she _ feeling have in a trifling degree its influence in induce he to decline the meeting mr wilson saw at once what a hold such unusual conduct would take on the feeling of she niece and inwardly determine to increase if possible the watchfulness she have invariably observe on all he say or do as likely to elucidate he real character well know that the requisite to bring or to keep happiness in the married state be numerous and indispensable and that the display of a particular excellence however good in itself be by no means conclusive as to character in short that we perhaps as often meet with a favorite principle as with a beset sin chapter xiv sir edward moseley have some difficulty in restrain the impetuosity of he son who be dispose to resent this impertinent interference of young jarvi with the conduct of he favorite sister indeed the young man only yield to he profound respect to he father 's command aid by a strong representation on the part of he sister of the disagreeable consequence of connect she name with such a quarrel it be seldom the good baronet feel himself call on to act as decidedly as on the present occasion he speak to the merchant in warm but gentleman-like term of the consequence which might have result to he own child from the intemperate act of he son exculpate emily entirely from censure by explain she engagement to dance with denbigh previously to captain jarvi 's application and hint the necessity if the affair be not amicably terminate of protect the peace of mind of he daughter against any similar exposure by decline the acquaintance of a neighbor he respect as much as mr jarvi the merchant be a man of few word but of great promptitude he have make he fortune and more than once save it by he decision and assure the baronet he should hear no more of it he take he hat and hurry home from the village where the conversation pass on arrive at he own house he find the family collect in the parlor for a morning ride and throw himself into a chair he break out on the whole party with great violence so mr jarvi he cry you _ would _ spoil a very tolerable book-keeper by wish to have a soldier in you family and there stand the puppy who would have blow out the brain of a deserving young man if the good sense of mr denbigh have not deny he the opportunity mercy cry the alarmed matron on whom newgate -lrb- for she early life have be pass near its wall -rrb- with all its horror float and a contemplation of its punishment have be she juvenile lesson of morality -- harry harry would you commit murder murder echo she son look askance as if dodge the bailiff no mother i want nothing but what be fair mr denbigh would have have a equal chance to blow out my brain i be sure everything would have be fair equal chance mutter he father who have cool himself in some measure by a extra pinch of snuff no sir you have no brain to lose but i have promise sir edward that you shall make proper apology to himself to he daughter and to mr denbigh this be rather exceed the truth but the alderman pride himself on perform rather more than he promise apology exclaim the captain why sir the apology be due to I ask colonel egerton if he ever hear of apology be make by the challenger no sure say the mother who have make out the truth of the matter think it be likely enough to be creditable to she child colonel egerton never hear of such a thing do you colonel why madam say the colonel hesitatingly and politely hand the merchant he snuff-box which in he agitation have fall on the floor circumstance sometimes justify a departure from ordinary measure you be certainly right as a rule but not know the particulars in the present case it be difficult for I to decide miss jarvi the tilbury be ready the colonel bow respectfully to the merchant kiss he hand to he wife and lead they daughter to he carriage do you make the apology ask mr jarvis as the door close no sir reply the captain sullenly then you must make you pay answer for the next sit month cry the father take a sign draft on he banker from he pocket coolly tear it in two piece carefully put the name in he mouth and chew it into a ball why alderman say he wife -lrb- a name she never use unless she have something to gain from she spouse who love to hear the appellation after he have relinquish the office -rrb- it appear to I that harry have show nothing but a proper spirit you be unkind -- indeed you be a proper spirit in what way do you know anything of the matter it be a proper spirit for a soldier to fight i suppose say the wife a little at a loss to explain spirit or no spirit apology or ten and sixpence harry say he mother hold up she finger in a menacing attitude as soon as she husband have leave the room -lrb- for he have last speak with the door in he hand -rrb- if you _ do _ beg he pardon you be no son of mine no cry miss sarah nor any brother of mine i would be insufferably mean who will pay my debt ask the son look up at the ceiling why i would my child if -- if -- i have not spend my own allowance i would echo the sister but if we go to bath you know i shall want all my money who will pay my debt repeat the son apology indeed who be he that you a son of alderman -- of -- mr jarvi of the deanery b -- north ` amptonshire should beg he pardon -- a vagrant that nobody know who will pay my debt again inquire the captain drum with he foot harry exclaim the mother do you love money better than honor -- a soldier 's honor no mother but i like good eating and drinking think mother it be a cool five hundred and that be a famous deal of money harry cry the mother in a rage you be not fit for a soldier i wish i be in you place i wish with all my heart you have be for a hour this morning think the son after argue for some time longer they compromise by agree to leave it to the decision of colonel egerton who the mother do not doubt would applaud she maintain the jarvi dignity a family in which he take quite as much interest as he feel for he own -- so he have tell she fifty time the captain however determine within himself to touch the five hundred let the colonel decide as he might but the colonel 's decision obviate all difficulty the question be put to he by mr jarvi on he return from the airing with no doubt the decision would be favorable to she opinion the colonel and herself she say never disagree and the lady be right -- for wherever he interest make it desirable to convert mrs jarvis to he side of the question egerton have a manner of do it that never fail to succeed why madam say he with one of he most agreeable smile apology be different thing at different time you be certainly right in you sentiment as relate to a proper spirit in a soldier but no one can doubt the spirit of the captain after the stand he take in this affair if mr denbigh would not meet he -lrb- a very extraordinary measure in deed i confess -rrb- what can you son do more he can not _ make _ a man fight against he will you know true true cry the matron impatiently i do not want he to fight heaven forbid but why should he the challenger beg pardon i be sure to have the thing regular mr denbigh be the one to ask forgiveness the colonel feel at a little loss how to reply when jarvi in whom the thought of the five hundred pound have work a revolution exclaim -- you know mother i accuse he -- that be i suspect he of dance with miss moseley against my right to she now you find that it be all a mistake and so i have better act with dignity and confess my error oh by all means cry the colonel who see the danger of a embarrassing rupture between the family otherwise : delicacy to _ you _ sex particularly require that ma'am from you son and he accidentally drop a letter as he speak from sir edgar colonel ask mrs jarvis as he stoop to pick it up from sir edgar ma'am and he beg to be remember to yourself and all of you amiable family mr jarvi inclined she body in what she intend for a graceful bend and sigh -- a casual observer might have think with maternal anxiety for the reputation of she child -- but it be conjugal regret that the political obstinacy of the alderman have prevent he carry up a address and thus become sir timothy sir edgar 's heir prevail and the captain receive permission to do what he have do several hour before on leave the room after the first discussion and before the appeal the captain have hasten to he father with he concession the old gentleman know too well the influence of five hundred pound to doubt the effect in the present in stance and he have order he carriage for the excursion it come and to the hall they proceed the captain find he intended antagonist and in a rather uncouth manner he make the require concession he be restore to he former favor -- no great distinction -- and he visit to the hall be suffer but with a dislike emily could never conquer nor at all time conceal denbigh be occupy with a book when jarvi commence he speech to the baronet and he daughter and be apparently too much engage with its contents to understand what be go on as the captain blunder through it be necessary the captain saw by a glance of he father 's eye to say something to that gentleman who have delicately withdraw to a distant window he speech be consequently make here too and mrs wilson could not avoid steal a look at they denbigh smile and bow in silence it be enough think the widow the offence be not against he it be against he maker he should not arrogate to himself in any manner the right to forgive or to require apology -- the whole be consistent the subject be never afterwards allude to : denbigh appear to have forget it and jane sigh gently as she devoutly hope the colonel be not a duellist several day pass before the deanery lady could sufficiently forgive the indignity they family have sustain to resume the customary intercourse like all other grievance where the passion be chiefly interested it be forget in time however and thing be put in some measure on they former foot the death of digby serve to increase the horror of the moseley and jarvi himself feel rather uncomfortable on more account than one at the fatal termination of the unpleasant business chatterton who to he friend have not hesitate to avow he attachment to he cousin but who have never propose for she as he present view and fortune be not in he estimation sufficient for she proper support have push every interest he possess and leave no step unattempt a honorable man could resort to to effect he object the desire to provide for he sister have be back by the ardor of a passion that have reach its crisis and the young peer who could not in the present state of thing abandon the field to a rival so formidable as denbigh even to further he view to preferment be wait in anxious suspense the decision on he application a letter from he friend inform he he opponent be likely to succeed that in short all hope of success have leave he chatterton be in despair on the follow day however he receive a second letter from the same friend unexpectedly announce he appointment after mention the fact he go on to say -- the cause of this sudden revolution in you favor be unknown to I and unless you lordship have obtain interest i be ignorant of it be one of the most singular instance of ministerial caprice i have ever know chatterton be as much at a loss as he friend to understand the affair but it matter not he could now offer to emily -- it be a patent office of great value and a few year would amply portion he sister that very day therefore he propose and be refuse emily have a difficult task to avoid self-reproach in regulate she deportment on this occasion she be fond of chatterton as a relation -- as she brother 's friend -- as the brother of grace and even on he own account but it be the fondness of a sister he manner -- he word which although never address to herself be sometimes overhear unintentionally and sometimes reach she through she sister have leave she in no doubt of he attachment she be excessively grieve at the discovery and have innocently appeal to she aunt for direction how to proceed of he intention she have no doubt but at the same time he have not put she in a situation to dispel he hope as to encouragement in the usual meaning of the term she give none to he nor to any one else there be no little attention that lover be fond of show to they mistress and which mistress be fond of receive that emily ever permit to any gentleman -- no ride -- no walk -- no tête-à-têtes always natural and unaffected there be a simple dignity about she that forbid the request almost the think in the gentleman of she acquaintance : she have no amusement no pleasure of any kind in which she sister be not she companion and if anything be on the carpet that require a attendant john be ever ready he be devote to she the decide preference she give he over every other man upon such occasion flatter he affection and he would at any time leave even grace chatterton to attend he sister all this too be without affectation and generally without notice emily so look the delicacy and reserve she act with so little ostentation that not even she own sex have affix to she conduct the epithet of squeamish it be difficult therefore for she to do anything which would show lord chatterton she disinclination to he suit without assume a dislike she do not feel or give he slight that neither good breeding nor good nature could justify at one time indeed she have express a wish to return to clara but this mr wilson thought would only protract the evil and she be compel to wait he own time the peer himself do not rejoice more in he ability to make the offer therefore than emily do to have it in she power to decline it she rejection be firm and unqualified but utter with a grace and a tenderness to he feeling that bind she lover tighter than ever in she chain and he resolve on immediate flight as he only recourse i hope nothing unpleasant have occur to lord chatterton say denbigh with great interest as he reach the spot where the young peer stand lean he head against a tree on he way from the rectory to the hall chatterton raise he face as he speak : there be evident trace of tear on it and denbigh greatly shock be about to proceed as the other catch he arm mr denbigh say the young man in a voice almost choke with emotion may you never know the pain i have feel this morning emily -- emily moseley -- be lose to I -- for ever for a moment the blood rush to the face of denbigh and he eye flash with a look that chatterton could not stand he turn as the voice of denbigh in those remarkable tone which distinguish it from every other voice he have ever hear utter -- chatterton my lord we be friend i hope -- i wish it from my heart go mr denbigh -- go you be go to miss moseley -- do not let I detain you i be go with _ you _ lord chatterton unless you forbid it say denbigh with emphasis slip he arm through that of the peer for two hour they walk together in the park and when they appear at dinner emily wonder why mr denbigh have take a seat next to she mother instead of he usual place between herself and she aunt in the evening he announce he intention of leave b -- for a short time with lord chatterton they be go to london together but he hope to return within ten day this sudden determination cause some surprise but as the dowager suppose it be to secure the new situation and the remainder of they friend think it might be business it be soon forget though much regret for the time the gentleman leave the hall that night to proceed to a inn from which they could obtain a chaise and horse and the follow morning when the baronet 's family assemble around they social breakfast they be many mile on the road to the metropolis chapter xv lady chatterton finding that little be to be expect in she present situation except what she look forward to from the vary admiration of john moseley to she youngest daughter determine to accept a invitation of bear standing to a nobleman 's seat about fifty mile from the hall and in order to keep thing in they proper place to leave grace with she friend who have express a wish to that effect accordingly the day succeed the departure of she son she proceed on she expedition accompany by she willing assistant in the matrimonial speculation grace chatterton be by nature retire and delicate but she feeling be acute and on the subject of female propriety sensitive to a degree that the great want of it in a relation she love as much as she mother have possibly in some measure increase she affection be too single in they object to have leave she long in doubt as to they nature with respect to the baronet 's son and it be one of the most painful order she have ever receive that which compel she to accept she cousin 's invitation she mother be peremptory however and grace be oblige to comply every delicate feeling she possess revolt at the step : the visit itself be unwished for on she part but there do exist a reason which have reconcile she to that -- the wedding of clara but now to remain after all she family have go in the house where reside the man who have as yet never solicit those affection she have be unable to withhold it be humiliating -- it be degrade she in she own esteem and she could scarcely endure it it be say that woman be fertile in invention to further they scheme of personal gratification vanity or even mischief it may be it be true but the writer of these page be a man -- one who have see much of the other sex and he be happy to have a opportunity of pay a tribute to female purity and female truth that there be heart so disinterested as to lose the consideration of self in advance the happiness of those they love that there be mind so pure as to recoil with disgust from the admission of deception indelicacy or management he know for he have see it from long and close examination he regret that the very artlessness of those who be most pure in the one sex subject they to the suspicion of the grosser-material which compose the other he believe that innocency singleness of heart ardency of feeling and unalloyed shrink delicacy sometimes exist in the female bosom to a extent that but few man be happy enough to discover and that most man believe incompatible with the frailty of human nature grace chatterton possess no little of what may almost be call this ethereal spirit and a visit to bolton parsonage be immediately propose by she to emily the latter too innocent herself to suspect the motive of she cousin be happy to be allow to devote a fortnight to clara uninterrupted by the noisy round of visit and congratulation which have attend she first week and mr wilson and the two girl leave the hall the same day with the dowager lady chatterton franci and clara be happy to receive they and they be immediately domesticate in they new abode doctor ive and he wife have postpone a annual visit to a relation of the former on account of the marriage of they son and they now avail themselves of this visit to perform they own engagement b -- appear in some measure desert and egerton have the field almost to himself summer have arrive and the country bloom in all its luxuriance of vegetation : everything be propitious to the indulgence of the softer passion and lady moseley ever a strict adherent to form and decorum admit the intercourse between jane and she admirer to be carry to as great length as those form would justify still the colonel be not explicit and jane whose delicacy dread the exposure of feeling that be involve in he declaration give or seek no marked opportunity for the avowal of he passion yet they be seldom separate and both sir edward and he wife look forward to they future union as a thing not to be doubt lady moseley have give up she youngest child so absolutely to the government of she aunt that she seldom think of she future establishment she have that kind of repose confidence in mr wilson 's proceedings that feeble mind ever bestow on those who be much superior to they and she even approve of a system in many respects which she could not endeavor to imitate she affection for emily be not however less than what she feel for she other child : she be in fact she favorite and have the discipline of mr wilson admit of so weak a interference might have be injure as such john moseley have be able to find out exactly the hour they breakfast at the deanery the length of time it take egerton 's horse to go the distance between that house and the hall and on the sixth morning after the departure of he aunt john 's bay be in he phaeton and allow ten minute for the mile and a half to the park gate john have get happily off he own territory before he meet the tilbury travel eastward i be not to know which road the colonel may turn think john : and after a few friendly but rather hasty greeting the bay be again in full trot to the parsonage john say emily hold out she hand affectionately and smile a little archly as he approach the window where she stand you should take a lesson in drive from frank you have turn more than one hair i believe how be clara cry john hastily take the offer hand with a kiss aye and aunt wilson both well brother and out walk this fine morning how happen it you be not with they inquire the brother throw he eye round the room have they leave you alone no grace have this moment leave I well emily say john take he seat very composedly but keep he eye on the door i have come to dine with you i think i owe clara a visit and have manage nicely to give the colonel the go-by clara will be happy to see you dear john and so will aunt and so be i -- as she draw aside he fine hair with she finger to cool he forehead and why not grace too ask john with a look of a little alarm and grace too i fancy -- but here she be to answer for herself grace say little on she entrance but she eye be brighter than usual and she look so contented and happy that emily observe to she in a affectionate manner -- i know the eau-de-cologne would do you head good be miss chatterton unwell ask john with a look of interest a slight headache say grace faintly but i feel much better want of air and exercise : my horse be at the door phaeton will hold three easily run sister for you hat almost push emily out of the room as he speak in a few minute the horse might have be suffer for air but surely not for exercise i wish cry john with impatience when at the distance of a couple of mile from the parsonage that gentleman have drive he gig out of the road there be a small group on one side of the road consist of a man a woman and several child the owner of the gig have alight and be in the act of speak to they as the phaeton approach at a great rate john cry emily in terror you never can pass -- you upset we there be no danger dear grace say the brother endeavor to check he horse he succeed in part but not so as to prevent he pass at a spot where the road be very narrow a wheel hit violently against a stone and some of he work give way the gentleman immediately hasten to he assistance -- it be denbigh miss moseley cry he in a voice of the tenderest interest you be not hurt in the least i hope no say emily recover she breath only frightened and take he hand she spring from the carriage miss chatterton find courage to wait quietly for the care of john he dear grace have thrill on every nerve and she afterwards often laugh at emily for she terror when there be so little danger the horse be not in the least frightened and after a little mending john declare all be safe to ask emily to enter the carriage again be to exact no little sacrifice of she feeling to she reason and she stand in a suspense that too plainly show that the terror she have be in have not leave she if say denbigh modestly if mr moseley will take the lady in my gig i will drive the phaeton to the hall as it be rather unsafe for so heavy a load no no denbigh say john coolly you be not use to such mettled nag as mine -- it would be indiscreet for you to drive they : if however you will be good enough to take emily into you gig -- grace chatterton i be sure be not afraid to trust my driving and we might all get back as well as ever grace give she hand almost unconsciously to john and he hand she into the phaeton as denbigh stand willing to execute he part of the arrangement but too diffident to speak it be not a moment for affectation if emily have be capable of it and blush with the novelty of she situation she take she place in the gig denbigh stop and turn he eye on the little group with which he have be talk and at that moment they catch the attention of john also the latter inquire after they situation the tale be a piteous one the distress evidently real the husband have be gardener to a gentleman in a neighbor county and he have be lately discharge to make way in the difficulty of the time for a relation of the steward who be in want of the place suddenly throw on the world with a wife and four child with but the wages of a week for he and they support they have travel thus far on the way to a neighbor parish where he say he have a right to and must seek public assistance the child be cry for hunger and the mother who be a nurse have be unable to walk further than where she sit but have sink on the ground overcome with fatigue and weak from the want of nourishment neither emily nor grace could refrain from tear at the recital of these heavy woe the want of sustenance be something so shocking in itself and bring as it be immediately before they eye the appeal be irresistible john forget he bay -- forget even grace as he listen to the affect story relate by the woman who be much revive by some nutriment denbigh have obtain from a cottage near they and to which they be about to proceed by he direction as moseley interrupt they he hand shake he eye glisten as he take he purse from he pocket and give several guinea from it to the mendicant grace think john have never appear so handsome as the moment he band the money to the gardener he face glow with unusual excitement and he symmetry have lose the only charm he want in common softness denbigh after wait patiently until moseley have bestow he alms gravely repeat he direction for they proceed to the cottage when the carriage move on emily revolve in she mind during they short ride the horrid distress she have witness it have take a strong hold on she feeling like she brother she be warm-hearted and compassionate if we may use the term to excess and have she be prepare with the mean the gardener would have reap a double harvest of donation it strike she at the moment unpleasantly that denbigh have be so backward in he liberality the man have rather sullenly display half a crown as he gift in contrast with the golden shower of john 's generosity it have be even somewhat offensive in its exhibition and urge she brother to a more hasty departure than under other circumstance he would just at the moment have feel disposed to make denbigh however have take no notice of the indignity and continue he direction in the same mild and benevolent manner he have use during the whole interview half a crown be but little thought emily for a family that be starve and unwilling to judge harshly of one she have begin to value so highly she come to the painful conclusion she companion be not as rich as he deserve to be emily have not yet to learn that charity be in proportion to the means of the donor and a gentle wish insensibly steal over she that denbigh might in some way become more richly endowed with the good thing of this world until this moment she thought have never turn to he temporal condition she know he be a officer in the army but of what rank or even of what regiment she be ignorant he have frequently touch in he conversation on the custom of the different country he have see he have serve in italy in the north of europe in the west indy in spain of the manners of the people of they character he not unfrequently speak and with a degree of intelligence a liberality a justness of discrimination that have charm he auditor but on the point of personal service he have maintain a silence that be inflexible and not a little surprising -- more particularly of that part of he history which related to the latter country from all which she be rather incline to think he military rank be not as high as she think he merit and that possibly he feel a awkwardness of put it in contrast with the more elevated station of colonel egerton the same idea have strike the whole family and prevent any inquiry which might be painful he be so connect with the mournful event of he father 's death that no question could be put with propriety to the doctor 's family and if franci have be more communicative to clara she be too good a wife to mention it and she own family be possess of too just a sense of propriety to touch upon point that might bring she conjugal fidelity in question though denbigh appear a little abstracted during the ride he question concern sir edward and she friend kind and affectionate as they approach the house he suffer he horse to walk and after some hesitation he take a letter from he pocket and hand it to she say -- i hope miss moseley will not think I impertinent in become the bearer of a letter ` from she cousin lord chatterton he request it so earnestly that i could not refuse take what i be sensible be a great liberty for it would be deception do i affect to be ignorant of he admiration or of he generous treatment of a passion she can not return chatterton and he smile mournfully be yet too true to cease he commendation emily blush painfully but she take the letter in silence and as denbigh pursue the topic no further the little distance they have to go be ride in silence on enter the gate however he say inquiringly and with much interest -- i sincerely hope i have not give offence to you delicacy miss moseley lord chatterton have make I a unwilling confidant i need not say the secret be sacred on more account than one surely not mr denbigh reply emily in a low tone and the gig stop she hasten to accept the assistance of she brother to alight well sister cry john laughing denbigh be a disciple to frank 's system of horse-flesh hair smooth enough here i see grace and i think you would never get home now john fib a little for neither grace nor he have think in the least about they or anything else but each other from the moment they separate until the gig arrive emily make no reply to this speech and as the gentleman be engage in give direction concern they horse she seize a opportunity to read chatterton 's letter i avail myself of the return of my friend mr denbigh to that happy family from which reason require my self-banishment to assure my amiable cousin of my continued respect for she character and to convince she of my gratitude for the tenderness she have manifest to feeling she can not return i may even venture to tell she what few woman would be please to hear but what i know emily moseley too well to doubt for a moment will give she unalloyed pleasure -- that owe to the kind the benevolent the brotherly attention of my true friend mr denbigh i have already gain a peace of mind and resignation i once think be lose to I for ever ah emily my beloved cousin in denbigh you will find i doubt not a mind principle congenial to you own it be impossible that he could see you without wish to possess such a treasure and if i have a wish that be now uppermost in my heart it be that you may learn to esteem each other as you ought when i doubt not you will become as happy as you both deserve to be what greater earthly blessing can i implore upon you chatterton emily while read this epistle feel a confusion but little inferior to that which would have oppress she have denbigh himself be at she foot solicit that love chatterton think he so worthy of possess and when they meet she could hardly look in the face a man who it would seem have be so openly select by another as the fittest to be she partner for life the unaltered manner of denbigh himself however soon convinced she that he be entirely ignorant of the contents of the note and it greatly relieve she from the awkwardness he presence at first occasion francis soon return accompany by he wife and aunt and be overjoy to find the guest who have so unexpectedly arrive he parent have not yet return from they visit and denbigh of course would remain at he present quarter john promise to continue with they for a couple of day : and everything be soon settle to the perfect satisfaction of the whole party mr wilson know the great danger of suffer young people to be inmate of the same house too well wantonly to incur the penalty but she visit have nearly expire and it might give she a better opportunity of judge denbigh 's character and grace chatterton though too delicate to follow herself be well contented to be follow especially when john moseley be the pursuer chapter xvi i be sorry aunt mr denbigh be not rich say emily to mr wilson after they have retire in the evening almost unconscious of what she utter the latter look at she niece in surprise at a remark so abrupt and one so very different from the ordinary train of emily 's reflection as she require a explanation emily slightly color at the channel she thought have insensibly stray into give she aunt a account of they adventure in the course of the morning 's drive and touch lightly on the difference in the amount of the alms of she brother and those of mr denbigh the bestowal of money be not always a act of charity observe mr wilson gravely and the subject be drop : though neither cease to dwell on it in she thought until sleep close the eye of both the follow day mr wilson invite grace and emily to accompany she in a walk the gentleman have precede they in pursuit of they different avocation franci have he regular visit of spiritual consolation john have go to the hall for he pointer and fowling-piece the season for woodcock have arrive and denbigh have proceed no one know whither on gain the high-road mr wilson desire she companion to lead the way to the cottage where the family of the mendicant gardener have be lodge and thither they soon arrive on knock at the door they be immediately admit to a outer room in which they find the wife of the laborer who inhabit the building engage in she customary morning employment they explain the motive of the visit and be tell that the family they seek be in a adjoining room but she rather think at that moment engage with a clergyman who have call a quarter of a hour before i expect my lady it be the new rector who everybody say be so good to the poor and needy but i have not find time yet to go to church to hear he reverence preach ma'am courtsey and hand the fresh dust chair to she unexpected visitor the lady seat themselves too delicate to interrupt franci in he sacred duty and be silently wait he appearance when a voice be distinctly hear through the thin partition the first note of which undeceive they as to the character of the gardener 's visitor it appear then davi by you own confession say denbigh mildly but in a tone of reproof that you frequent act of intemperance have at least give ground for the steward 's procure you discharge if it have not justified he in do that which he duty to you common employer require it be hard sir reply the man sullenly to be throw on the world with a family like mine to make way for a younger man with but one child it may be unfortunate for you wife and child say denbigh but just as respects yourself i have already convince you that my interference or reproof be not a empty one : carry the letter to the person to whom it be direct and i pledge you you shall have a new trial and should you conduct yourself soberly and with propriety continue and ample support the second letter will gain you child immediate admission to the school i mention and i now leave you with a earnest injunction to remember that habit of intemperance not only disqualify you to support those who have such great claim on you protection but inevitably lead to a loss of those power which be necessary to insure you own eternal welfare may heaven bless you honor cry the woman with fervor and evidently in tear both for what you have say and what you have do thoma only want to be take from temptation to become a sober man again -- a honest one he have ever be i be sure i have select a place for he reply denbigh where there be no exposure through improper companion and everything now depend upon himself under providence mr wilson have rise from she chair on the first intimation give by denbigh of he intention to go but have pause at the door to listen to this last speech when beckon she companion she hastily withdraw have first make a small present to the woman of the cottage and request she not to mention they have call what become now of the comparative charity of you brother and mr denbigh emily ask mrs wilson as they gain the road on they return homewards emily be not accustom to hear any act of john slightly speak of without at least manifest some emotion which betray she sisterly regard but on the present occasion she choose to be silent while grace after wait in expectation that she cousin would speak venture to say timidly -- i be sure dear madam mr moseley be very liberal and the tear be in he eye while he give the money i be look directly at they the whole time john be compassionate by nature continue mr wilson with a almost imperceptible smile i have no doubt he sympathy be warmly enlist in behalf of this family and possess much he give liberally i have no doubt he would have undergo personal privation to have relieve they distress and endure both pain and labor with such a excitement before he but what be all that to the charity of mr denbigh grace be unused to contend and least of all with mr wilson but unwilling to abandon john to such censure with increase animation she say -- if bestow freely and feel for the distress you relieve be not commendable madam i be sure i be ignorant what be that compassion for the woe of other be beautiful in itself and the want of it a invariable evidence of corruption from too much and a ill-governed intercourse with the world i be willing to acknowledge my dear grace say mr wilson kindly but the relief of misery where the heart have not undergo this harden ordeal be only a relief to we own feeling : this be compassion but christian charity be a higher order of duty : it enter into every sensation of the heart dispose we to judge as well as to act favorably to we fellow creature be deeply seat in the sense of we own unworthiness keep a single eye in its dispensation of temporal benefit to the everlasting happiness of the object of its bounty be consistent well regulate in short -- and mr wilson 's pale cheek glow with a unusual richness of color -- it be a humble attempt to copy after the heavenly example of we redeemer in sacrifice ourselves to the welfare of other and do and must proceed from a love of he person and a obedience to he mandate and mr denbigh aunt exclaim emily the blood mantle to she cheek with a sympathetic glow while she lose all consideration for john in the strength of she feeling he charity you think to be of this description so far my child as we can understand motive from the nature of the conduct such appear to have be the charity of mr denbigh grace be silence if not convinced and the lady continue they walk lose in they own reflection until they reach a bend in the road which hide the cottage from view emily involuntarily turn she head as they arrive at the spot and see that denbigh have approach within a few pace of they on join they he commence he complimentary address in such a way as convinced they the cottager have be true to the injunction give by mr wilson no mention be make of the gardener and denbigh begin a lively description of some foreign scenery of which they present situation remind he the discourse be maintain with great interest by himself and mr wilson for the remainder of they walk it be yet early when they reach the parsonage where they find john who have drive to the hall to breakfast and who instead of pursue he favorite amusement of shooting lay down he gun as they enter observe it be rather soon yet for the woodcock and i believe i will listen to you entertaining conversation lady for the remainder of the morning he throw himself upon a sofa at no great distance from grace and in such a position as enable he without rudeness to study the feature of she lovely face while denbigh read aloud to the lady campbell 's beautiful description of wed love in gertrude of wyome there be a chastened correctness in the ordinary manner of denbigh which wear the appearance of the influence of he reason and a subjection of the passion that if anything give he less interest with emily than have it be mark by a evidence of stronger feeling but on the present occasion this objection be remove : he reading be impressive he dwell on those passage which most pleased he with a warmth of eulogium fully equal to she own undisguised sensation in the hour occupy in the reading this exquisite little poem and in comment on its merit and sentiment denbigh gain more on she imagination than in all they former intercourse he idea be as pure as chastened and almost as vivid as those of the poet and emily listen to he period with intense attention as they flow from he in language as glowing as he idea the poem have be first read to she by she brother and she be surprise to discover how she have overlook its beauty on that occasion even john acknowledge that it certainly appear a different thing now from what he have then think it but emily have tax he declamatory power in the height of the pheasant season and somehow or other john now imagine that gertrude be just such a delicate feminine warm-hearted domestic girl as grace chatterton as denbigh close the book and enter into a general conversation with clara and she sister john follow grace to a window and speaking in a tone of unusual softness for he he say -- do you know miss chatterton i have accept you brother 's invitation to go into suffolk this summer and that you be to be plague with I and my pointer again plague mr moseley say grace in a voice even softer than he own i be sure -- i be sure we none of we think you or you dog in the least a plague ah grace and john be about to become what he have never be before -- sentimental -- when he see the carriage of chatterton contain the dowager and catherine enter the parsonage gate pshaw _ think _ john there come mother chatterton ah grace say john there be you mother and sister return already already say the young lady and for the first time in she life she feel rather unlike a dutiful child five minute could have make no great difference to she mother and she would greatly have like to hear what john moseley mean to have say for the alteration in he manner convinced she that he first ah grace be to have be continue in a somewhat different language from that in which the second ah grace be end young moseley and she daughter standing together at the open window catch the attention of lady chatterton the moment she get a view of the house and she enter with a good humor she have not feel since the disappointment in she late expedition in behalf of catherine for the gentleman she have have in view in this excursion have be take up by another rover act on she own account and back by a little more wit and a good deal more money than what kate could be fairly think to possess nothing further in that quarter offering in the way of she occupation she turn she horse ' head towards london that great theater on which there never be a loss for actor the salutation have hardly pass before turn to john she exclaim with what she intend for a most motherly smile what not shoot this fine day mr moseley i think you never miss a day in the season it be rather early yet my lady say john coolly a little alarmed by the expression of she countenance oh continue the dowager in the same strain i see how it be the lady have too many attraction for so gallant a young man as yourself now as grace she own daughter be the only lady of the party who could reasonably be suppose to have much influence over john 's movement -- a young gentleman seldom care as much for he own as for other people 's sister this may be fairly set down as a pretty broad hint of the opinion the dowager entertain of the real state of thing and john see it and grace see it the former coolly reply why upon the whole if you will excuse the neglect i will try a shot this fine day in five minute carlo and rover be both delighted grace keep she place at the window from a feeling she could not define and of which perhaps she be unconscious until the gate close and the shrubbery hide the sportsman from she sight and then she withdraw to she room to weep have grace chatterton be a particle less delicate -- less retire -- bless with a managing mother as she be john moseley would not have think another moment about she but on every occasion when the dowager make any of she open attack grace discover so much distress so much unwillingness to second they that a suspicion of a confederacy never enter he brain it be not to be suppose that lady chattelton 's maneuver be limit to the direct and palpable scheme we have mention no -- these be the effervescence the exuberance of she zeal but as be generally the case they sufficiently prove the ground-work of all she other machination none of the little artifice of such as place -- of leave alone -- of show similarity of taste : -- of compliment to the gentleman be neglect -- this latter business she have contrived to get catherine to take off she hand but grace could never pay a compliment in she life unless change of color tremble undulation of the bosom and such natural movement can be so call but she love dearly to receive they from john moseley well my child say the mother as she seat herself by the side of she daughter who hastily endeavor to conceal she tear when be we to have another wedding i trust everything be settle between you and mr moseley by this time mother mother say grace nearly gasp for breath mother you will break my heart indeed you will she hide she face in the clothes of the bed by which she sit and weep with a feeling of despair tut my dear reply the dowager not notice she anguish or mistake it for a girlish shame you young people be fool in these matter but sir edward and myself will arrange everything as it should be the daughter now not only look up but spring from she seat she hand clasp together she eye fix in horror she cheek pale as death but the mother have retire and grace sink back into she chair with a sensation of disgrace of despair which could not have be surpass have she really merit the obloquy and shame which she think be about to be heap upon she chapter xvii the succeed morning the whole party with the exception of denbigh return to the hall nothing have occur out of the ordinary course of the colonel 's assiduity and jane whose sense of propriety forbid the indulgence of premeditated tête-à-têtes and such little accompaniment of every-day attachment be rejoice to see a sister she love and a aunt she respect once more in the bosom of she family the dowager impatiently wait a opportunity to effect what she intend for a master-stroke of policy in the disposal of grace like all other manager she think no one equal to herself in devise way and means and be unwilling to leave anything to nature grace have invariably thwart all she scheme by she obstinacy and as she think young moseley really attach to she she determine by a bold stroke to remove the impediment of false shame and the dread of repulse which she believe alone keep the youth from a avowal of he wish and get rid at once of a plague that have annoy she not a little -- she daughter 's delicacy sir edward spend a hour every morning in he library overlook he account and in other necessary employment of a similar nature and it be here she determine to have the conference my lady chatterton you do I honor say the baronet hand she a chair on she entrance upon my word cousin cry the dowager you have a very convenient apartment here look around she in affect admiration of all she see the baronet reply and a short discourse on the arrangement of the whole house insensibly lead to some remark on the taste of he mother the honorable lady moseley -lrb- a chatterton -rrb- until have warm the feeling of the old gentleman by some well-timed compliment of that nature she venture on the principal object of she visit i be happy to find sir edward you be so well pleased with the family as to wish to make another selection from it i sincerely hope it may prove as judicious as the former one sir edward be a little at a loss to understand she meaning although he think it might allude to he son who he have some time suspect have view on grace chatterton and willing to know the truth and rather pleased to find john have select a young woman he love in he heart he observe -- i be not sure i rightly

like all other lottery there be more blank than prize yet be it not make more precarious than it ought to be by we neglect of that degree of precaution which we would be ridicule for omit in conduct we every-day concern be not the standard of matrimonial felicity place too low ought we not to look more to the possession of principle than to the possession of wealth or be it at all justifiable in

and direct she energy to prevent this evil while john moseley look upon a free will as the birthright of a englishman and be at the present moment anxiously alive to prevent the dowager 's make he the

fidget and suit he own move propensity at the moment egerton and denbigh be both frequently at the hall but generally give they time to the lady neither be much inclined to the favorite amusement of john there be a little arbor within the wall of the park which for year have be a retreat from the summer heat to the lady of the moseley family even so long as the youth of mr wilson it have be in

during the warmth of a noon-day sun with the exception of lady moseley who have she own engagement in the house between egerton and denbigh there be maintain a kind of courtly intercourse which prevent any disagreeable collision from they evident dislike mr wilson think on the part of denbigh it be the forbearance of a principled indulgence to another 's weakness while the colonel 's otherwise uniform good breeding be hardly able to conceal a something amount to very near repugnance egerton have take he seat on the ground near the foot of jane and denbigh be station on a bench place without the arbor but so near as to have the full benefit of the shade of the noble oak branch of which have be train so as to compose its principal cover it might have be accident that give each he particular situation but it be certain they be so place as not to be in sight of each other and so place that the colonel be ready to hand jane she scissors or any other little implement that she occasionally drop and that denbigh could read every lineament of the animated countenance of emily as she listen to he description of the curiosity of egypt a country in which he have spend a few month while attach to the army in sicily in this situation we will leave they for a hour happy in the society of each other while we trace the route of john moseley and he companion in they pursuit of

now another of jarvi 's recommendation be a set of lung that might have be hear half a mile with great ease on a still morning why say jarvi rather humbly i be sensible mr moseley i be very wrong as regard you sister but do not you think it a little odd in a soldier not to fight when properly call upon i suppose mr denbigh do not think himself properly call upon or perhaps he have hear what a great shot you be six month before he appearance in b -- captain jarvi have be a clerk in the counting-room of jarvi baxter & co and have never hold fire-arm of any kind in he hand with the exception of a old blunderbuss which have be a kind of sentinel over the iron chest for year on mount the cockade he hail take up shooting as a martial exercise inasmuch as the burning of gunpowder be a attendant of the recreation he have never kill but one bird in he life and that be a owl of which he take the advantage of daylight and he stock foot to knock off a tree in the deanery grounds very early after he arrival in he trial with john he sometimes pull trigger at the same moment with he companion and as the bird generally fall he think he have a equal claim to the honor he be fond of war with crow and bird of the larger sort and invariably go provide with small ball fit to the bear of he fowling-piece for such accidental rencontre he have another habit which be not a little annoying to john who have several time try in vain to break he of it -- that of shooting at mark if bird be not plenty he would throw up a chip and sometimes he hat by way of shooting on the wing as the clay be excessively hot and the game keep close john feel willing to return from such unprofitable labor the captain now commence he chip firing which in a few minute be succeed by he hat see moseley see i have hit the band cry the captain delighted to find he have at last wound he old antagonist i do not think you can beat that yourself i be not sure i can say john slip a handful of gravel in the muzzle of he piece slily but i can do as you do -- try do cry the captain pleased to get he companion down to he own level of amusement be you ready yes throw jarvi throw and john fire : the hat fairly bounce have i hit it ask john while reload the barrel he have discharge hit it say the captain look ruefully at he hat it look like a cullender but moseley you gun do not scatter well : a dozen shot have go through in the same place it do look rather like a cullender say john as he overlook he companion 's beaver and by the _ size _ of some of the hole one that have be a good deal use the report of the fowling-piece announce to the party in the arbor the return of the sportsman it be a invariable practice with john moseley to discharge he gun before he come in and jarvi have imitate he from a wish to be what he call in rule mr denbigh say john as he put down he gun captain jarvi have get the better of he hat at last denbigh smile without speak and the captain unwilling to have anything to say to a gentleman to whom be have be oblige to apologize go into the arbor to show the mangled condition of he head-piece to the colonel on whose sympathy he feel a kind of claim being of the same corps john complain of thirst and go to a little run of water but a short distance from they in order to satisfy it the interruption of jarvi be particularly unseasonable jane be relate in a manner peculiar to herself in which be mingle that undefinable exchange of look lover be so fond of some incident of she early life to the colonel that greatly interested he know the captain 's foible he point therefore with he finger as he say -- there be one of you old enemy a hawk jarvi throw down he hat and run with boyish eagerness to drive away the intruder in he haste he catch up the gun of john moseley and load it rapidly\/threw in a ball from he usual stock but whether the hawk saw and know he or whether it see something else it like better it make a dart for the baronet 's poultry-yard at no great distance and be out of sight in a minute see that he foe have vanish the captain lay the piece where he have find it and recover he old train of idea pick up he hat again john say emily as she approach he affectionately you be too warm to drink stand off si cry john playfully take up the gun from against the body of the tree and drop it towards she jarvi have endeavor to make a appeal to the commiseration of emily in favor of the neglect beaver and be within a few foot of they at this moment recoil from the muzzle of the gun he exclaim it be loaded hold cry denbigh in a voice of horror as he spring between john and he sister both be too late the piece be discharge denbigh turn to emily and smile mournfully gaze for a moment at she with a expression of tenderness of pleasure of sorrow so blended that she retain the recollection of it for life and fall at she foot the gun drop from the nerveless grasp of young moseley emily sink in insensibility by the side of she preserver mr wilson and jane stand speechless and aghast the colonel alone retain the presence of mind necessary to devise the step to be immediately take he spring to the examination of denbigh the eye of the wounded man be open and he recollection perfect : the first be fix in intense observation on the inanimate body which lay at he side leave I colonel egerton he say speaking with difficulty and point in the direction of the little run of water assist miss moseley -- you hat -- you hat will answer accustomed to scene of blood and not ignorant that time and care be the remedy to be apply to the wounded man egerton fly to the stream and return immediately by the help of she sister and mr wilson soon restore emily to life the lady and john have now begin to act the tenderest assiduity of jane be devote to she sister while mr wilson observe she niece to be uninjured by anything but the shock assist john in support the wounded man denbigh speak request to be carry to the house and jarvi be despatch for help within half a hour denbigh be place on a couch in the house of sir edward and be quietly wait for that professional aid which could only decide on he probable fate the group assemble in the room be in fearful expectation of the arrival of the surgeon in pursuit of whom messenger have be send both to the barracks in f -- and to the town itself sir edward sit by the side of the sufferer hold one of he hand in he own now turn he tearful eye on that daughter who have so lately be rescue as it be from the certainty of death in mute gratitude and thanksgiving and now dwelling on the countenance of he who by bravely interpose he bosom to the blow have incur in he own person the imminent danger of a similar fate with a painful sense of he perilous situation and devout and earnest prayer for he safety emily be with she father as with the rest of he family a decide favorite and no reward would have be sufficient no gratitude lively enough in the estimation of the baronet to compensate the protector of such a child she sit between she mother and jane with a hand hold by each pale and oppress with a load of gratitude of thanksgiving of woe that almost bow she to the earth lady moseley and jane be both sensibly touch with the deliverance of emily and manifest the interest they take in she by the tenderest caress while mr wilson sit calmly collect within herself occasionally give those few direction which be necessary under the circumstance and offer up she silent petition in behalf of the sufferer john have take horse immediately for f -- and jarvi have volunteer to go to the rectory and bolton denbigh inquire frequently and with much anxiety for dr ive but the rector be absent from home on a visit to a sick parishioner and it be late in the evening before he arrive within three hour of the accident however dr black the surgeon of the -- th reach the hall and immediately proceed to examine the wound the ball have penetrate the right breast and go directly through the body it be extract with very little difficulty and he attendant acquaint the anxious friend of denbigh that the heart certainly and he hope the lung have escape uninjured the ball be a very small one and the principal danger to be apprehend be from fever : he have take the usual precaution against that and should it not set in with a violence greater than he apprehend at present the patient might be abroad within the month but continue the surgeon with the hardened indifference of he profession the gentleman have have a narrow chance in the passage of the ball itself half a inch would have settle he account with this world this information greatly relieve the family and order be give to preserve a silence in the house that would favor the patient 's disposition to quiet or if possible sleep dr ive now reach the hall mr wilson have never be the rector in the agitation or with the want of self-command he be in as she meet he at the entrance of the house be he alive -- be there hope -- where be george -- cry the doctor as he catch the extended hand of mr wilson she briefly acquaint he with the surgeon 's report and the reasonable ground there be to expect denbigh would survive the injury may god be praise say the rector in a suppress voice and he hastily withdraw into another room mr wilson follow he slowly and in silence but be check on open the door with the sight of the rector on he knee the tear steal down he venerable cheek in quick succession surely think the widow as she draw back unnoticed a youth capable of exciting such affection in a man like dr ive can not be unworthy denbigh hearing of the arrival of he friend desire to see he alone they conference be short and the rector return from it with increase hope of the termination of this dreadful accident he immediately leave the hall for he own house with a promise of return early on the follow morning during the night however the symptom become unfavorable and before the return of dr ive denbigh be in a state of delirium from the height of he fever and the apprehension of he friend be renew with additional force what what my good sir do you think of he say the baronet to the family physician with a emotion that the danger of he dearest child would not have exceed and within hearing of most of he child who be collect in the ante-chamber of the room in which denbigh be place it be impossible to say sir edward reply the physician : he refuse all medicine and unless this fever abate there be but little hope of recovery emily stand during this question and answer motionless pale as death and with she hand clasp together betray by the workings of she finger in a kind of convulsive motion the intensity of she interest she have see the draught prepared which it be so desirable that denbigh should take and it now stand reject on a table where it could be see through the open door of he room almost breathless she glide in and take the draught in she hand she approach the bed by which sit john alone listen with a feeling of despair to the wanderings of the sick man emily hesitate once or twice as she draw near denbigh she face have lose the paleness of anxiety and glow with another emotion mr denbigh -- dear denbigh say emily with energy unconsciously drop she voice into the softest note of persuasion will you refuse _ I -- I _ emily moseley whose life you have save emily moseley repeat denbigh and in those tone so remarkable to he natural voice be she safe i think she be kill -- dead then as if recollect himself he gaze intently on she countenance -- he eye become less fiery -- he muscle relax -- he smile and take with the docility of a well-trained child the prescribe medicine from she hand he idea still wander but he physician profit by the command emily possess over he patient increase he care and by night the fever have abate and before morning the wounded man be in a profound sleep during the whole day it be think necessary to keep emily by the side of he bed but at time it be no trifling tax on she feeling to remain there he speak of she by name in the tenderest manner although incoherently and in term that restore to the blanched cheek of the distressed girl more than the richness of they native color he thought be not confine to emily however : he talk of he father of he mother and frequently speak of he poor desert marian the latter name he dwell on in the language of the warmest affection condemn he own desertion of she and take emily for she would beg she forgiveness tell she she suffering have be enough and that he would return and never leave she again at such moment he nurse would sometimes show by the paleness of she cheek she anxiety for he health and then as he address she by she proper appellation all she emotion appear absorb in the sense of shame at the praise with which he overwhelm she mr wilson succeed she in the charge of the patient and she retire to seek that repose she so greatly need on the second morning after receive the wound denbigh drop into a deep sleep from which he awake refresh and perfectly collect in mind the fever have leave he and he attendant pronounce with the usual caution to prevent a relapse he recovery certain it be impossible to have communicate any intelligence more grateful to all the member of the moseley family for jane have even lose sight of she own lover in sympathy for the fate of a man who have sacrifice himself to save she beloved sister chapter xix the recovery of denbigh be as rapid as the most sanguine expectation of he friend could hope for and in ten day he leave he bed and would sit a hour or two at a time in he dressing-room where mr wilson accompany by jane or emily come and read to he and it be a remark of sir edward 's gamekeeper that the woodcock have become so tame during the time mr moseley be shut up in attendance on he friend that captain jarvi be at last actually see to bag one honestly as jarvi feel something like a consciousness that but for he folly the accident would not have happen and also something very like shame for the manner he have shrink from the danger denbigh have so nobly meet he pretend a recall to he regiment then on duty near london and leave the deanery he go off as he come in -- in the colonel 's tilbury and accompany by he friend and he pointer john who see they pass from the window of denbigh 's dressing-room fervently pray he might never come back again -- the chip-shooting poacher colonel egerton have take leave of jane the evening precede with many assurance of the anxiety with which he should look forward to the moment of they meeting at l -- whither he intend repair as soon as he corps have go through its annual review jane have follow the bent of she natural feeling too much during the period of denbigh 's uncertain fate to think much of she lover or anything else but she rescue sister and she preserver but now the former be pronounce in safety and the latter by the very reaction of she grief be if possible happier than ever jane dwelt in melancholy sadness on the perfection of the man who have take with he the best affection -lrb- as she think -rrb- of she heart with he all be perfect : he moral be unexceptionable he manners show it he tenderness of disposition manifest for they have weep together over the distress of more than one fictitious heroine he temper how amiable he be never angry -- she have never be it he opinion he taste how correct they be she own he form he face how agreeable -- she eye have see it and she heart acknowledge it besides he eye confess the power of she own charm he be brave for he be a soldier -- in short as emily have predict he be a hero -- for he be colonel egerton have jane be possess of less exuberance of fancy she might have be a little at a loss to identify all these good property with she hero : or have she possess a mature or well-regulated judgment to control that fancy they might possibly have assume a different appearance no explanation have take place between-them however jane know both by she own feeling and by all the legend of love from its earliest day that the moment of parting be generally a crisis in affair of the heart and with a backwardness occasion by she modesty have rather avoid than seek a opportunity to favor the colonel 's wish egerton have no be over anxious to come to the point and everything be leave as heretofore : neither however appear to doubt in the least the state of the other 's ' affection and there might be say to exist between they one of those not unusual engagement by implication which it would have be in they own estimation a breach of faith to recede from but which like all other bargain that be loosely make be sometimes violate when convenient man be a creature that as experience have sufficiently prove it be necessary to keep in he proper place in society by wholesome restriction and we have often think it a matter of regret that some well understand regulation do not exist by which it become not only customary but incumbent on he to proceed in he road to the temple of hymen we know that it be ungenerous ignoble almost unprecedented to doubt the faith the constancy of a male paragon yet somehow as the papers occasionally give we a sample of such infidelity as we have sometimes see a solitary female brooding over she woe in silence and with the seemliness of feminine decorum shrink from the discovery of its cause or which the grave have reveal for the first time we can not but wish that either the watchfulness of the parent or a sense of self-preservation in the daughter would for the want of a better cause they to adhere to those old conventional form of courtship which require a man to speak to be understand and a woman to answer to be commit there be a little parlor in the house of sir edward moseley that be the privileged retreat of none but the member of he own family here the lady be accustom to withdraw into the bosom of they domestic quietude when occasional visitor have disturb they ordinary intercourse and many be the hasty and unreserved communication it have witness between the sister in they steal flight from the graver scene of the principal apartment it might be aid to be sacred to the pious feeling of the domestic affection sir edward would retire to it when fatigue with he occupation certain of find some one of those he love to draw he thought off from the care of life to the little incident of he child 's happiness and lady moseley even in the proudest hour of she revive splendor seldom pass the door without look in with a smile on the face she might find there it be in fact the room in the large mansion of the baronet expressly devote by long usage and common consent to the purest feeling of human nature into this apartment denbigh have gain admission as the one nearest to he own room and require the least effort of he return strength to reach and perhaps by a undefinable feeling of the moseley which have begin to connect he with themselves partly from he win manners and partly by the sense of the obligation he have lay they under one warm day john and he friend have seek this retreat in expectation of meet he sister who they find however on inquiry have walk to the arbor after remain converse for a hour by themselves john be call away to attend to a pointer that have be take ill and denbigh throw a handkerchief over he head to guard against the danger of cold quietly compose himself on one of the comfortable sofa of the room with a disposition to sleep before he have entirely lose he consciousness a light step move near he catch he ear believe it to be a servant unwilling to disturb he he endeavor to continue in he present mood until the quick but stifle breathing of some one nearer than before rouse he curiosity he command himself however sufficiently to remain quiet a blind of a window near he be carefully close a screen draw from a corner and place so as sensibly to destroy the slight draught of air in which he lay himself and other arrangement be make but with a care to avoid disturbing he that render they hardly audible presently the step approach he again the breathing be quicker though gentle the handkerchief be move but the hand be with draw hastily as if afraid of itself another effort be successful and denbigh steal a glance through he dark lash on the figure of emily as she-stood over he in the fulness of she charm and with a face in which glow a interest he have never witness in it before it undoubtedly be _ gratitude _ for a moment she gaze on he as she color increase in richness he hand be carelessly throw over a arm of the sofa she stoop towards it with she face gently but with a air of modesty that shone in she very figure denbigh feel the warmth of she breath but she lip do not touch it have he be incline to judge the action of emily moseley harshly it be impossible to mistake the movement for anything but the impulse of natural feeling there be a pledge of innocence of modesty in she countenance that would have prevent any misconstruction and he continue quietly await what the preparation on she little mahogany secretary be intend for mr wilson entertain a great abhorrence of what be commonly call accomplishment in a woman she know that too much of that precious time which could never be recall be throw away in endeavor to acquire a smattering in what if know could never be of use to the party and what can never be well know but to a few whom nature and long practice have enable to conquer yet as she niece have early manifest a taste for painting and a vivid perception of the beauty of nature she inclination have be indulge and emily moseley sketch with neatness and accuracy and with great readiness it would have be no subject of surprise have admiration or some more powerful feeling betray to the artist on this occasion the deception the young man be practise she have enter the room from she walk warm and careless she hair than which none be more beautiful have stray on she shoulder free from the confinement of the comb and a lock be finely contrast to the rich color of a cheek that almost burn with the exercise and the excitement she dress white as the first snow of the winter she look as she now turn they on the face of the sleeper and betray by they animation the success of she art form a picture in itself that denbigh would have be content to gaze on for ever she back be to a window that throw its strong light on the paper -- the figure of which be reflect as she occasionally hold it up to study its effect in a large mirror so place that denbigh catch a view of she subject he know it at a glance -- the arbor -- the gun -- himself all be there it appear to have be draw before -- it must have be from its perfect state and emily have seize a favorable moment to complete he own resemblance she touch be light and finishing and as the picture be frequently hold up for consideration he have some time allow for study it he own resemblance be strong he eye be turn on herself to whom denbigh think she have not do ample justice but the man who hold the gun bear no likeness to john moseley except in dress a slight movement of the muscle of the sleeper 's mouth might have betray he consciousness have not emily be too intent on the picture as she turn it in such a way that a strong light fall on the recoil figure of captain jarvi the resemblance be wonderful denbigh think he would have know it have he see it in the academy itself the noise of some one approach close the portfolio it be only a servant yet emily do not resume she pencil denbigh watch she motion as she put the picture carefully in a private drawer of the secretary reopen the blind replace the screen and lay the handkerchief the last thing on he face with a movement almost imperceptible to himself it be later than i think say denbigh look at he watch i owe a apology miss moseley for make so free with you parlor but i be too lazy to move apology mr denbigh cry emily with a color vary with every word she speak and tremble at what she think the nearness of detection you have no apology to make for you present debility and surely surely least of all to I i understand from mr moseley continue denbigh with a smile that we obligation be at least mutual to you perseverance and care miss moseley after the physician have give I up i believe i be under providence indebted for my recovery emily be not vain and least of all addict to a display of any of she acquirement very few even of she friend know she ever hold a pencil in she hand yet do she now unaccountably throw open she portfolio and offer its contents to the examination of she companion it be do almost instantaneously and with great freedom though not without certain flushing of the face and heaving of the bosom that would have eclipse grace chatterton in she happiest moment of natural flattery whatever might have be the wish of mr denbigh to pursue a subject which have begin to grow extremely interesting both from its import and the feeling ' of the party it would have be rude to decline view the contents of a lady 's portfolio the drawing be many of they interesting and the exhibitor of they now appear as anxious to remove they in haste as she have but the moment before be to direct he attention to she performance denbigh would have give much to dare to ask for the paper so carefully secrete in the private drawer but neither the principal agency he have himself in the scene nor delicacy to he companion 's wish for concealment would allow of the request doctor ive how happy i be to see you say emily hastily close she portfolio and before denbigh have go half through its contents you have become almost a stranger to we since clara leave we no no my little friend never a stranger i hope at moseley hall cry the doctor pleasantly george i be happy to see you look so well -- you have even a color -- there be a letter for you from marian denbigh take the letter eagerly and retire to a window to peruse it he hand shake as he break the seal and he interest in the writer or its contents could not have escape the notice of any observer however indifferent now miss emily if you will have the goodness to order I a glass of wine and water after my ride believe I you will do a very charitable act cry the doctor as he take he seat on the sofa emily be stand by the little table deeply muse on the contents of she portfolio for she eye be intently fix on the outside as if she expect to see through the leather cover they merit and fault miss emily moseley continue the doctor gravely be i to die of thirst or not this warm day do you wish anything doctor ive a servant to get I a glass of wine and water why do you not ask I my dear sir say emily as she throw open a cellaret and hand he what he want there my dear there be a great plenty say the doctor with a arch expression i really think i have ask you thrice -- but i believe you be study something in that portfolio emily blush and endeavor to laugh at she own absence of mind but she would have give the world to know who marian be chapter xx as a month have elapse since he receive he wound denbigh take a opportunity one morning at breakfast where he be well enough now to meet he friend to announce he intention of trespassing no longer on they kindness but of return that day to the rectory the communication distressed the whole family and the baronet turn to he in the most cordial manner as he take one of he hand and say with a air of solemnity -- mr denbigh i could wish you to make this house you home dr ive may have know you longer and may have the claim of relationship on you but i be certain he can not love you better and be not the tie of gratitude as binding as those of blood denbigh be affect by the kindness of sir edward 's manner the regiment i belong to sir edward will be review next week and it have become my duty to leave here there be one it be proper i should visit a near connexion who be acquaint with the escape i have meet with and wish naturally to see I besides my dear sir edward she have many cause of sorrow and it be a debt i owe she affection to endeavor to relieve they it be the first time he have ever speak of he family or hardly of himself and the silence which prevail plainly show the interest he listener take in the little he utter that connexion think emily -- i

immediately after the review of which he have speak as soon as he have breakfast john drive he in he phaeton to the rectory mr wilson like the rest of the baronet 's family have be too deeply impressed with the debt they owe this young man to interfere with she favorite system of caution against too great a intimacy between she niece and she preserver close observation and the opinion of dr ive have prepare she to give he she esteem but the gallantry the self-devotion he have display to emily be a act calculate to remove heavier objection than she could imagine as likely to exist to he become she husband that he mean it be evident from he whole deportment of late since the morning the portfolio be produce denbigh have give a more decide preference to she niece the nice discrimination of mr wilson would not have say he feeling have become stronger but that he labor less to conceal they that he love she niece she suspect from the first fortnight of they acquaintance and it have give additional stimulus to she investigation into he character but to doubt it after step between she and death would have be to have mistake human nature there be one qualification she would have wish to have be certain he possess : before this accident she would have make it a indispensable one but the gratitude the affection of emily she believe now to be tab deeply engage to make the strict inquiry she otherwise would have do and she have the best of reason for believe that if denbigh be not a true christian he be at least a strictly moral man and assuredly one who well understand the beauty of a religion she almost conceive it impossible for any impartial and intelligent man long to resist perhaps mr wilson have in some measure interfere with she system like other have on find it impossible to conduct so that reason would justify all she do begin to find reason for what she think best to be do under the circumstance denbigh however both by he act and he opinion have create such a estimate of he worth in the breast of mr wilson that there would have be but little danger of a repulse have no fortuitous accident help he in he way to she favor who have we here

nay better fortune allow I the acquaintance of my present rector he own merit would have obtain what a sense of justice require i should say be grant to a applicant to whom the ear of royalty itself

sirrah -- ay honesty i remember when we be in there be not a man of doubtful integrity in the ministry or on we side even and then again when we go out the opposition bench be fill with sterling character make a parliament that be correct throughout can you show I such a thing at this day chapter xxii a few day after the arrival of the moseley at the lodge john drive he sister to the little village of l -- which at that time be throng with a unusual number of visiter it have among other fashionable arrangement for the accommodation of its guest one of those circulator of good and evil a public library book be in a great measure the instrument of control the opinion of a nation like ours they be a engine alike powerful to save or to destroy it can not be deny that we library contain as many volume of the latter as the former description for we rank amongst the latter that long catalogue of idle production which if they produce no other evil lead to the misspending of time _ we own _ perhaps include but we can not refrain express we regret that such formidable weapon in the cause of morality should be suffer to be wield by any indifferent or mercenary dealer who undoubtedly will consult rather the public taste than the private good : the evil may be remediless yet we love to express we sentiment though we should suggest nothing new or even profitable into one of these haunt of the idle then john moseley enter with a lovely sister lean on either arm book be the entertainer of jane and instructor of emily sir edward be fond of reading of a certain sort -- that which require no great depth of thought or labor of research and like most other who be averse to contention and disposed to be easily satisfy the baronet sometimes find he have harbor opinion on thing not exactly reconcileable with the truth or even with each other it be quite as dangerous to give up you faculty to the guidance of the author you be peruse as it be unprofitable to be captiously scrutinize every syllable he may happen to advance and sir edward be if anything a little inclined to the dangerous propensity unpleasant sir edward moseley never be lady moseley very seldom take a book in she hand : she opinion be establish to she own satisfaction on all important point and on the minor one she make it a rule to coincide with the popular feeling jane have a mind more active than she father and more brilliant than she mother and if she have not imbibe injurious impression from the unlicensed and indiscriminate reading she practice it be more owe to the fortunate circumstance that the baronet 's library contain nothing extremely offensive to a pure taste nor dangerous to good moral than to any precaution of she parent against the deadly the irretrievable injury to be sustain from ungoverned liberty in this respect to a female mind on the other hand mr wilson have inculcate the necessity of restraint in select the book for she perusal so strenuously on she niece that what at first have be the effect of obedience and submission have now settle into taste and habit and emily seldom open a book unless in search of information or if it be the indulgence of a less commendable spirit it be a indulgence chasten by a taste and judgment that lessen the danger if it do not entirely remove it the room be fill with gentleman and lady and while john be exchange he greeting with several of the neighbor gentry of he acquaintance he sister be run nastily over a catalogue of the book keep for circulation as a elderly lady of foreign accent and dress

regiment to which he belong he have never write to any of she friend but judge from she own feeling she do not in the least doubt he would be as punctual as love could make he mrs wilson listen to she niece 's account of the unexpected interview in the library with pleasure and cheerfully promise to accompany they in they morning 's excursion as she have both a wish to alleviate sorrow and a desire to better understand the character of this accidental acquaintance of emily 's mr benfield and the baronet have a long conversation in relation to denbigh 's fortune the morning after they arrival and the old man be loud in he expression of dissatisfaction at the youngster 's pride as the baronet however in the fulness of he affection and simplicity betray to he uncle he expectation of a union between denbigh and he daughter mr benfield become contented with this reward one fit he think for any service on the whole it be best as he be to marry emmy he should sell out of the army and as there would be a election soon he would bring he into parliament -- yes -- yes -- it do a man so much good to sit one term in the parliament of this realm -- to study human nature all he own knowledge in that way be raise on the foundation lay in the house to this sir edward cordially assent and the gentleman separate happy in they arrangement to advance the welfare of two being they so sincerely love although the care and wisdom of mr wilson have prohibit the admission of any romantic or enthusiastic expectation of happiness into the day-dream of she charge yet the buoyancy of health of hope of youth of innocence have elevated emily to a height of enjoyment hitherto unknown to she usually placid and disciplined pleasure denbigh certainly mingle in most of she thought both of the past and the future and she stand on the threshold of that fantastic edifice in which jane ordinarily reside emily be in the situation perhaps the most dangerous to a young female christian : she heart she affection be give to a man to appearance every way worthy of possess they it be true but she have admit a rival in she love to she maker and to keep those feeling distinct to bend the passion in due submission to the more powerful consideration of endless duty of unbounded gratitude be one of the most try struggle of christian fortitude we be much more apt to forget we god in prosperity than adversity the weakness of human nature drive we to seek assistance in distress but vanity and worldly-mindedness often induce we to imagine we control the happiness we only enjoy sir edward and lady moseley could see nothing in the prospect of the future but life of peace and contentment for they child clara be happily settle and she sister be on the eve of make connexion with man of family condition and certain character what more could be do for they they must like other people take they chance in the lottery of life they could only hope and pray for they prosperity and this they do with great sincerity not so mrs wilson : she have guard the invaluable charge intrust to she keep with too much assiduity too keen a interest too just a sense of the awful responsibility she have undertake to desert she post at the moment watchfulness be most require by a temperate but firm and well-chosen conversation she keep alive the sense of she real condition in she niece and labor hard to prevent the blandishments of life from supplant the lively hope of enjoy another existence she endeavor by she pious example she prayer and she judicious allusion to keep the passion of love in the breast of emily secondary to the more important object of she creation and by the aid of a kind and almighty providence she labor though arduous be crown with success as the family be seat round the table after dinner on the day of they walk to the library john moseley awakening from a reverie exclaim suddenly which do you think the handsomest emily grace chatterton or miss fitzgerald emily laugh

talk on a subject he seldom trust himself with in company why yes -- yes -- she _ do _ marry it be true although she do tell I she intend to die a maid but -- hem -- i suppose -- hem -- it be compassion for the old viscount who often say he could not live without she and then it give she the power of do so much good a jointure of five thousand a year add to she own income : yet -- hem -- i do confess i do not think she would have choose such a old and infirm man -- but peter give I a glass of claret peter hand the claret and the old man proceed : -- they say he be very cross to she and that no doubt must have make she unhappy she be so very tender-hearted how much longer the old gentleman would have continue in this strain it be impossible to say but he be interrupt by the opening of the parlor door and the sudden appearance on its threshold of denbigh every countenance glow with pleasure at this unexpected return of they favorite and but for the prudent caution of mr wilson in hand a glass of water to she niece the surprise might have prove too much for she the salutation of denbigh be return by the different member of the family with a cordiality that must have tell he how much he be value by all its branch and after briefly inform they that he review be over and that he have throw himself into a chaise and travel post until he have rejoin they he take he seat by mr benfield who receive he with a marked preference exceed that which he have show to any man who have ever enter he door lord gosford himself not except peter remove from he station behind he master 's chair to one where he could face the new comer and after wipe he eye until they fill so rapidly with water that at last he be notice by the delighted john to put on the identical goggles which he care have provide for denbigh in he illness he laugh draw the attention of the rest to the honest steward and when denbigh be tell this be mr benfield 's ambassador to the hall he rise from he chair and take the old man by the hand kindly thank he for he thoughtful consideration for he weak eye peter take the offer hand in both he own and after make one or two unsuccessful effort to speak he utter thank you thank you may heaven bless you and burst into tear this stop the laugh and john follow the steward from the room while he master exclaim wipe he eye kind and condescend just such another as my old friend the earl of gosford chapter xxiii at the appoint hour the carriage of mr wilson be ready to convey herself and niece to the cottage of mr fitzgerald john be leave behind under the pretence of keep denbigh company in he morning avocation but really because mr wilson doubt the propriety of he become a visit acquaintance at the house tenant as the cottage be represent to be john be too fond of he friend to make any serious objection and be satisfy for the present by send he compliment and request he sister to ask permission for he to call in one of he morning excursion in order to pay he personal respects they find the cottage a beautiful and genteel though a very small and retired dwelling almost hide by the tree and shrub which surround it and its mistress in its little veranda expect the arrival of emily mr fitzgerald be a spaniard under twenty of a melancholy yet highly interesting countenance she manners be soft and retire but evidently bear the impression of good company if not of high life she be extremely pleased with this renewal of attention on the part of emily and express she gratitude to both lady for they kindness in seek she out in she solitude she present she more matronly companion to they by the name of donna lorenza and as nothing but good feeling prevail and useless ceremony be banish the little party be soon on term of friendly intercourse the young widow -lrb- for such she dress indicate she to be -rrb- do the honor of she house with graceful ease and conduct ed she visiter into she little grounds which together the cottage give evident proof of the taste and elegance of its occupant the establishment she support she represent as very small two woman and a aged man servant with occasionally a laborer for she garden and shrubbery they never visit it be a resolution she have make on fix she residence here but if mr wilson and miss moseley would forgive the rudeness of not return they call nothing would give she more satisfaction than a frequent renewal of they visit mr wilson take so deep a interest in the misfortune of this young female and be so much pleased with the modest resignation of she manner that it require little persuasion on the part of the recluse to obtain a promise of soon repeat she visit emily mention the request of john and mr fitzgerald receive it with a mournful smile as she reply that mr moseley have lay she under such a obligation in they first interview she could not deny herself the pleasure of again thank he for it but she must be excuse if she desire they would limit they attendant to he as there be but one gentleman in england whose visit she admit and it be seldom indeed he call he have see she but once since she have reside in norfolk after give a promise not to suffer any one else to accompany they and promise a early call again we lady return to benfield lodge in season to dress for dinner on enter the drawing-room they find the elegant person of colonel egerton lean on the back of jane 's chair he have arrive during they absence and immediately seek the baronet 's family he reception if not as warm as that give to denbigh be cordial from all but the master of the house and even he be in such spirit by the company around he and the prospects of emily 's marriage -lrb- which he consider as settle -rrb- that he force himself to a appearance of good will he do not feel colonel egerton be either deceive by he manner or too much a man of the world to discover he suspicion and everything in consequence be very harmoniously if not sincerely conduct between they lady moseley be completely happy if she have the least doubt before as to the intention of egerton they be now remove he journey to that unfashionable watering-place be owe to he passion and however she might at time have doubt as to sir edgar 's heir denbigh she think a man of too little consequence in the world to make it possible he would neglect to profit by he situation in the family of sir edward moseley she be satisfy with both connexion mr benfield have tell she general sir frederic denbigh be nearly ally to the duke of derwent and denbigh have say the general be he grandfather wealth she know emily would possess from both she uncle and aunt and the service of the gentleman have they due weight upon the feeling of the affectionate mother the greatest of she maternal anxiety be remove and she look forward to the peaceful enjoyment of the remnant of she day in the bosom of she descendant john the heir of a baronetcy and 15000 pound a year might suit himself and grace chatterton she think would be likely to prove the future lady moseley sir edward without enter so deeply into anticipation of the future as he wife experience a equal degree of contentment and it would have be a difficult task to discover in the island a roof under which there reside at the moment more happy countenance than at benfield lodge for as its master have insist on denbigh become a inmate he be oblige to extend he hospitality in a equal degree to colonel egerton : indeed the subject have be fully canvass between he and peter the morning of he arrival and be near be decide against he admission when the steward who have pick up all the incident of the arbor scene from the servant -lrb- and of course with many exaggeration -rrb- mention to he master that the colonel be very active and that he even contrived to bring water to revive miss emmy a great distance in the hat of captain jarvi which be full of hole mr john have blow it off the head of the captain without hurt a hair in firing at a woodcock this mollify the master a little and he agree to suspend he decision for further observation at dinner the colonel happen to admire the really handsome face of lord gosford as delineate by sir joshua reynold which grace the dining-room of benfield lodge its master in a moment of unusual kindness give the invitation it be politely accept and the colonel at once domesticate the face of john moseley alone at time exhibit evidence of care and thought and at such moment it might be a subject of doubt whether he think the most of grace chatterton or she mother : if the latter the former be sure to lose ground in he estimation a serious misfortune to john not to be able to love grace without alloy he letter from she brother mention he be still at denbigh castle in westmoreland the seat of he friend the duke of derwent and john think one or two of he encomium on lady harriet denbigh the sister of he grace augur that the unkindness of emily might in time be forget the dowager and she daughter be at the seat of a maiden aunt in yorkshire where as john know no male animal be allow admittance he be tolerably easy at the disposition of thing nothing but legacy-hunting he know would induce the dowager to submit to such a banishment from the other sex but that be so preferable to husband-hunting he be satisfied i wish say john mentally as he finish the perusal of he letter mother chatterton would get marry herself and she might let kate and grace manage for themselves kate would do very well i dare say and how would grace make out john sigh and whistle for dido and rover in the manners of colonel egerton there be the same general disposition to please and the same unremitted attention to the wish and amusement of jane they have renew they poetical investigation and jane eagerly encourage a taste which afford she delicacy some little color for the indulgence of a association different from the real truth and which in she estimation be necessary to she happiness mr wilson think the distance between the two suitor for the favor of she niece be if anything increase by they short separation and particularly notice on the part of the colonel a aversion to denbigh that at time painfully alarm by exciting apprehension for the future happiness of the precious treasure she have prepare herself to yield to he solicitation whenever properly proffer in the intercourse between emily and she preserver as there be nothing to condemn so there be much to admire the attention of denbigh be pointed although less exclusive than those of the colonel and the aunt be please to observe that if the manners of egerton have more of the gloss of life those of denbigh be certainly distinguish by a more finished delicacy and propriety the one appear the influence of custom and association with a tincture of artifice the other benevolence with a just perception of what be due to other and with a air of sincerity when speaking of sentiment and principle that be particularly please to the watchful widow at time however she could not but observe a air of restraint if not of awkwardness about he that be a little surprising it be most observable in mixed society and once or twice she imagination picture he sensation into something like alarm these unpleasant interruption to she admiration be soon forget in she just appreciation of the more solid part of he character which appear literally to be unexceptionable and when momentary uneasiness would steal over she the remembrance of the opinion of dr ive he behavior with jarvi he charity and chiefly he devotion to she niece would not fail to drive the disagreeable thought from she mind emily herself move about the image of joy and innocence if denbigh be near she she be happy if absent she suffer no uneasiness she feeling be so ardent and yet so pure that jealousy have no admission perhaps no circumstance exist to excite this usual attendant of the passion but as the heart of emily be more enchain than she imagination she affection be not of the restless nature of ordinary attachment though more dangerous to she peace of mind in the event of a unfortunate issue with denbigh she never walk or ride alone he have never make the request and she delicacy would have shrink from such a open manifestation of she preference but he read to she and she aunt he accompany they in they little excursion and once or twice john notice that she take the offer hand of denbigh to assist she over any little impediment in they course instead of she usual unobtrusive custom of take he arm on such occasion well miss emily think john you appear to have choose another favorite on she do this three time in succession in one of they walk how strange it be woman will quit they natural friend for a face they have hardly see john forget he own -- there be no danger dear grace when he sister be almost dead with apprehension but john love emily too well to witness she preference of another with satisfaction even though denbigh be the favorite a feeling which soon wear away however by dint of custom and reflection mr benfield have take it into he head that if the wedding of emily could be solemnize while the family be at the lodge it would render he the happiest of man and how to compass this object be the occupation of a whole morning 's contemplation happily for emily 's blush the old gentleman harbor the most fastidious notion of female delicacy and never in conversation make the most distant allusion to the expect connexion he therefore in conformity with these feeling could do nothing openly all must be the effect of management and as he think peter one of the best contriver in the world to he ingenuity he determine to refer the arrangement the bell ring -- send johnson to I david in a few minute the drab coat and blue yarn stocking enter he dressing-room with the body of mr peter johnson snugly case within they peter commence mr benfield point kindly to a chair which the steward respectfully decline i suppose you know that mr denbigh the grandson of general denbigh who be in parliament with I be about to marry my little emmy peter smile as he bow a assent now peter a wedding would of all thing make I most happy that be to have it here in the lodge it would remind I so much of the marriage of lord gosford and the bridemaid i wish you opinion how to bring it about before they leave we sir edward and anne decline interfere and mr wilson i be afraid to speak to on the subject peter be not a little alarmed by this sudden requisition on he inventive faculty especially as a lady be in the case but as he pride himself on serve he master and love the hilarity of a wedding in he heart he cogitate for some time in silence when have think a preliminary question or two necessary he break it with say -- everything i suppose master be settle between the young people everything i take it peter and sir edward and my lady willing perfectly willing and madam wilson sir willing peter willing and mr john and miss jane all willing the whole family be willing to the best of my belief ' there be the rev mr ive and mr ive master they wish it i know do not you think they wish other as happy as themselves peter no doubt they do master well then as everybody be willing and the young people agreeable the only thing to be do sir be be what peter exclaim he impatient master observe he to hesitate why sir to send for the priest i take it pshaw peter johnson i know that myself reply the dissatisfied old man can not you help I to a better plan why master say peter i would have do as well for miss emmy and you honor as i would have do for myself now sir when i court patty steele you honor in the year of we lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-five i should have be marry but for one difficulty which you honor say be remove in the case of miss emmy what be that peter ask he master in a tender tone she be not willing sir very well poor peter reply mr benfield mildly you may go and the steward bow low withdraw the similarity of they fortune in love be a strong link in the sympathy which bind the master and man together and the former never fail to be soften by a allusion to patty the want of tact in the man on the present occasion after much reflection be attribute by he master to the fact that peter have never sit in parliament chapter xxiv mr wilson and emily in the fortnight they have be at benfield lodge pay frequent and long visit to the cottage : and each succeed interview leave a more favorable impression of the character of its mistress and a greater certainty that she be unfortunate the latter however allude very slightly to she situation or former life she be a protestant to the great surprise of mr wilson and one that misery have make nearly acquaint with the religion she profess they conversation chiefly turn on the custom of she own as contrast with those of she adopted country or in a pleasant exchange of opinion which the lady possess in complete unison one morning john have accompany they and be admit mr fitzgerald receive he with the frankness of a old acquaintance though with the reserve of a spanish lady he visit be permit under the direction of he aunt but no other of the gentleman be include amongst she guest mr wilson have casually mention in the absence of she niece the interposition of denbigh between she and death and mr fitzgerald be so much pleased at the noble conduct of the gentleman as to express a desire to see he but the impression of the moment appear to have die away a nothing more be say by either lady on the subject and it be apparently forget mr fitzgerald be find one morning weep over a letter she hold in she hand and the donna lorenza be endeavor to console she the situation of this latter lady be somewhat doubtful she appear neither wholly a friend nor a menial in the manners of the two there be a striking difference although the donna be not vulgar she be far from possess the polish of she more juvenile friend and mr wilson consider she to be in a station between that of a housekeeper and that of a companion after hope that no unpleasant intelligence occasion the distress they witness the lady be delicately about to take they leave when mr fitzgerald entreat they to remain you kind attention to I dear madam and the goodness of miss moseley give you a claim to know more of the unfortunate be you sympathy have so greatly assist to attain she peace of mind this letter be from the gentleman of whom you have hear I speak as once visit I and though it have strike I with unusual force it contain no more than i expect to hear perhaps no more than i deserve to hear i hope you friend have not be unnecessarily harsh : severity be not the best way always of effect repentance and i feel certain that you my young friend can have be guilty of no offence that do not rather require gentle than stern reproof say mr wilson i thank you dear madam for you indulgent opinion of I but although i have suffer much i be willing to confess it be a merited punishment you be however mistake as to the source of my present sorrow lord pendennyss be the cause of grief i believe to no one much less to I lord pendennyss exclaim emily in surprise unconsciously look at she aunt pendennyss reiterate mr wilson with animation and be he you friend too yes madam to he lordship i owe everything -- honor -- comfort -- religion -- and even life itself mr wilson 's cheek glow with a unusual color at this discovery of another act of benevolence and virtue in a young nobleman whose character she have so long admire and whose person she have in vain wish to meet you know the earl then inquire mr fitzgerald by reputation only my dear say mr wilson but that be enough to convince I a friend of he must be a worthy character if anything be want to make we you friend the conversation be continue for some time and mr fitzgerald say she do not feel equal just then to the undertaking but the next day if they would honor she with another call she would make they acquaint with the incident of she life and the reason she have for speak in such term of lord pendennyss the promise to see she be cheerfully make by mr wilson and she confidence accept not from a desire to gratify a idle curiosity but a belief that it be necessary to probe a wound to cure it and a correct opinion that she would be a better adviser for a young and lovely woman than even pendennyss for the donna lorenza she could hardly consider in a capacity to offer advice much less dictation they then take they leave and emily during they ride break the silence with exclaim -- wherever we hear of lord pendennyss aunt we hear of he favorably a certain sign my dear he be deserving of it there be hardly any man who have not he enemy and those be seldom just but we have meet with none of the earl 's yet fifty thousand a year will make many friend observe emily shake she head doubtless my love or as many enemy but honor life and religion my child be debt not owe to money -- in this country at least to this remark emily assent and after express she own admiration of the character of the young nobleman she drop into a reverie how many of he virtue she identify with the person of mr denbigh it be not just now we task to enumerate but judge of human nature may easily determine and that too without have sit in the parliament of this realm the morning this conversation occur at the cottage mr and mr jarvi with they daughter make they unexpected appearance at l -- the arrival of a post-chaise and four with a gig be a event soon circulate through the little village and the name of its owner reach the lodge just as jane have allow herself to be persuade by the colonel to take she first walk with he unaccompanied by a third person walking be much more propitious to declaration than ride and whether it be premeditate on the part of the colonel or not or whether he be afraid that mr jarvi or some one else would interfere he avail himself of this opportunity and have hardly get out of hearing of she brother and denbigh before he make jane a explicit offer of he hand the surprise be so great that some time elapse before the distressed girl could reply this she however at length do but incoherently : she refer he to she parent as the arbiter of she fate well know that she wish have long be those of she father and mother with this the colonel be oblige to be satisfy for the present but they walk have not end before he gradually draw from the confide girl a acknowledgment that should she parent decline he offer she would be very little less miserable than himself indeed the most tenacious lover might have be content with the proof of regard that jane unused to control she feeling allow herself to manifest on this occasion egerton be in rapture a life devote to she would never half repay she condescension and as they confidence increase with they walk jane re-enter the lodge with a degree of happiness in she heart she have never before experience the much dreaded declaration -- she own distressing acknowledgement be make and nothing farther remain but to live and be happy she fly into the arm of she mother and hide she blush in she bosom acquaint she with the colonel 's offer and she own wish lady moseley who be prepare for such a communication and have rather wonder at its tardiness kiss she daughter affectionately as she promise to speak to she father and to obtain he approbation but she add with a degree of formality and caution which have better precede than have follow the courtship we must make the usual inquiry my child into the fitness of colonel egerton as a husband for we daughter once assure of that you have nothing to fear the baronet be request to grant a audience to colonel egerton who now appear as determine to expedite thing as he have be dilatory before on meeting sir edward he make know he pretension and hope the father who have be previously notify by he wife of what be forthcoming give a general answer similar to the speech of the mother and the colonel bow in acquiescence in the evening the jarvi family favor the inhabitant of the lodge with a visit and mr wilson be strike with the singularity of they reception of the colonel miss jarvi especially be rude to both he and jane and it strike all who witness it as a burst of jealous feeling for disappointed hope but to no one except mr wilson do it occur that the conduct of the gentleman could be at all implicate in the transaction mr benfield be happy to see under he roof again the best of the trio of jarvise he have know and something like sociability prevail there be to be a ball miss jarvi remark at l -- the follow day which would help to enliven the scene a little especially as there be a couple of frigate at anchor a few mile off and the officer be expect to join the party this intelligence have but little effect on the lady of the moseley family yet as they uncle desire that out of respect to he neighbor if invite they would go they cheerfully assent during the evening mr wilson observe egerton in familiar conversation with miss jarvi and as she have be notify of he situation with respect to jane she determine to watch narrowly into the cause of so singular a change of deportment in the young lady mr jarvi retain she respect for the colonel in full force and call out to he across the room a few minute before she depart -- well colonel i be happy to tell you i have hear very lately from you uncle sir edgar indeed madam reply the colonel start he be well i hope very well the day before yesterday he neighbor old mr holt be a lodger in the same house with we at l -- and as i think you would like to hear i make particular inquiry about the baronet the word baronet be pronounce with emphasis and a look of triumph as if it would say you see _ we _ have baronet as well as you as no answer be make by egerton except a acknowledge bow the merchant and he family depart well john cried emily with a smile we have hear more good to-day of we trusty and well-beloved cousin the earl of pendennyss indeed exclaim she brother you must keep emily for he lordship positively aunt : she be almost as great a admirer of he as yourself i apprehend it be necessary she should be quite as much so to become he wife say mr wilson really say emily more gravely if all one hear of he be true or even half it would be no difficult task to admire he denbigh be stand lean on the back of a chair in situation where he could view the animated countenance of emily as she speak and mr wilson notice a uneasiness and a change of color in he that appear uncommon from so trifling a cause be it possible she think denbigh can harbor so mean a passion as envy he walk away as if unwilling to hear more and appear much engross with he own reflection for the remainder of the evening there be moment of doubt which cross the mind of mr wilson with a keenness of apprehension proportionate to she deep interest in emily with respect to certain trait in the character of denbigh and this what she think a display of unworthy feeling be one of they in the course of the evening the card for the expect ball arrive and be accept as this new arrangement for the morrow interfere with they intended visit to mr fitzgerald a servant be send with a note of explanation in the morning and a request that on the follow day the promise communication might be make to this arrangement the recluse assent and emily prepare for the ball with a melancholy recollection of the consequence which grow out of the last she have attend -- melancholy at the fate of digby and pleasure at the principle manifest by denbigh on the occasion the latter however with a smile excuse himself from be of the party tell emily he be so awkward that he fear some unpleasant consequence to himself or he friend would arise from he inadvertency do he venture again with she into such a assembly emily sigh gently as she enter the carriage of she aunt early in the afternoon leave denbigh in the door of the lodge and egerton absent on the execution of some business the former to amuse himself as he could until the follow morning and the latter to join they in the dance in the evening the arrangement include a excursion on the water attend by the band from the frigate a collation and in the evening a ball one of the vessel be command by a lord henry stapleton a fine young man who strike with the beauty and appearance of the sister seek a introduction to the baronet 's family and engage the hand of emily for the first dance he frank and gentleman-like deportment be please to he new acquaintance the more so as it be peculiarly suit to they situation at the moment mr wilson be in unusual spirit and maintain a animated conversation with the young sailor in the course of which he speak of he cruise on the coast of spain and by accident he mention he have carry out to that country upon one occasion lord pendennyss this be common ground between they and lord henry be as enthusiastic in he praise of the earl as mr wilson 's partiality could desire he also know colonel egerton slightly and express he pleasure in polite term when they meet in the evening in the ball-room at be able to renew he acquaintance the evening pass off as such evening generally do -- in gaiety listlessness dancing gaping and heartburning accord to the disposition and good or ill fortune of the several individual who compose the assembly mr wilson while she niece be dance move she seat to be near a window and find herself in the vicinity of two elderly gentleman who be comment on the company after make several common-place remark one of they inquire of the other -- who be that military gentleman amongst the naval beau holt that be the hopeful nephew of my friend and neighbor sir edgar egerton he be here dance and misspend he time and money when i know sir edgar give he a thousand pound six month ago on express condition he should not leave the regiment or take a card in he hand for twelvemonth he play then sadly he be on the whole a very bad young man as they change they topic mr wilson join she sister dreadfully shock at this intimation of the vice of a man so near a alliance with she brother 's child she be thankful it be not too late to avert part of the evil and determine to acquaint sir edward at once with what she have hear in order that a investigation might establish the colonel 's innocence or guilt chapter xxv they return to the lodge at a early hour and mr wilson after meditate upon the course she ought to take resolve to have a conversation with she brother that evening after supper accordingly as they be among the last to retire she mention she wish to detain he and when leave by themselves the baronet take he seat by she on a sofa she commence as follow willing to avoid she unpleasant information until the last moment i wish to say something to you brother relate to my charge : you have no doubt observe the attention of mr denbigh to emily certainly sister and with great pleasure you must not suppose i wish to interfere with the authority i have so freely relinquish to you charlotte when i inquire if emily favor he view or not neither emily nor i my dear brother wish ever to question you right not only to inquire into but to control the conduct of you child -- she be yours edward by a tie nothing can break and we both love you too much to wish it there be nothing you may be more certain of than that without the approbation of she parent emily would accept of no offer however splendid or agreeable to she own wish nay sister i would not wish unduly to influence my child in a affair of so much importance to herself but my interest in denbigh be little short of that i feel for my daughter i trust continue mr wilson emily be too deeply impressed with she duty to forget the impressive mandate ` to honor she father and mother : ' yes sir edward i be mistaken if she would not relinquish the dearest object of she affection at you request and at the same time i be persuade she would under no circumstance approach the altar with a man she do not both love and esteem the baronet do not appear exactly to understand he sister 's distinction as he observe i be not sure i rightly comprehend the difference you make charlotte only brother that she would feel that a promise make at the altar to love a man she feel averse to or honor one she could not esteem as a breach of a duty paramount to all earthly consideration reply he sister but to answer you question -- denbigh have never offer and when he do i do not think he will be refuse refuse cry the baronet i sincerely hope not i wish with all my heart they be marry already emily be very young say mr wilson and need not hurry : i be in hope she would remain single a few year longer well say the baronet you and lady moseley sister have different notion on the subject of marry the girl mr wilson reply with a good-humored smile you have make anne so good a husband ned that she forget there be any bad one in the world _ my _ greatest anxiety be that the husband of my niece may be a christian indeed i know not how i can reconcile it to my conscience as a christian myself to omit this important qualification i be sure charlotte both denbigh and egerton appear to have a great respect for religion they be punctual at church and very attentive to the service : mr wilson smile as he proceed but religion may come after marriage you know yes brother and i know it may not come at all no really pious woman can be happy without she husband be in what she deem the road to future happiness himself and it be idle -- it be worse -- it be almost impious to marry with a view to reform a husband : indeed she greatly endanger she own safety thereby for few of we i believe but find the temptation to err as much as we can contend with without call in the aid of example against we in a object we love indeed it appear to I the life of such a woman must be a struggle between conflicting duty why say the baronet if you plan be generally adopt i be afraid it would give a deadly blow to matrimony i have nothing to do with general brother i be act for individual happiness and discharge individual duty : at the same time i can not agree with you in its effect on the community i think no man who dispassionately examine the subject will be other than a christian and rather than remain bachelor they would take even that trouble if the strife in we sex be less for a husband wife would increase in value but how be it charlotte say the baronet pleasantly you sex do not use you power and reform the age the work of reformation sir edward reply he sister gravely be a arduous one indeed and i despair of see it general in my day but much very much might be do towards it if those who have the guidance of youth would take that trouble with they pupil that good faith require of they to discharge the minor duty of life woman ought to marry observe the baronet muse marriage be certainly the natural and most desirable state for a woman but how few be there who have enter it know how to discharge its duty more particularly those of a mother on the subject of marry we daughter for instance instead of qualify they to make a proper choice they be generally leave to pick up such principle and opinion as they may come at as it be by chance it be true if the parent be a christian in name certain of the externals of religion be observe but what be these if not enforce by a consistent example in the instructor useful precept be seldom lose i believe sister say sir edward with confidence always useful my dear brother but young people be more observant than we be apt to imagine and be wonderfully ingenious in devise excuse to themselves for they conduct i have often hear it offer as a apology that father or mother know it or perhaps do it and therefore it could not be wrong : association be all-important to a child i believe no family of consequence admit of improper associate within my knowledge say the baronet mr wilson smile as she answer i be sure i hope not edward but be the qualification we require in companion for we daughter always such as be most reconcileable with we good sense or we conscience a single communication with a objectionable character be a precedent if know and unobserved which will be offer to excuse acquaintance with worse person : with the other sex especially they acquaintance should be very guard and select you would make many old maid sister i doubt it greatly brother it would rather bring female society in demand i often regret that selfishness cupidity and the kind of strife which prevail in we sex on the road to matrimony have bring celibacy into disrepute for my part i never see a old maid but i be willing to think she be so from choice or principle and although not in she proper place serviceable by keep alive feeling necessary to exist that marriage may not become curse instead of blessing a kind of eddystone to prevent matrimonial shipwreck say the brother gayly they lot may be solitary baronet and in some measure cheerless but infinitely preferable to a marriage that may lead they astray from they duty or give birth to a family which be to be turn on the world -- without any religion but form -- without any moral but truism -- or without even a conscience which have not be sear by indulgence i hope that anne in the performance of she system will have no cause to regret its failure clara choose for herself and have do well charlotte and so i doubt not will jane and emily : and i confess i think they mother be right it be true say mr wilson clara have do well though under circumstance of but little risk she might have jump into you fish-pond and escape with life but the chance be she would drown : nor do i dispute the right of the girl to choose for themselves but i say the rights extend to require we to qualify they to make they choice i be sorry edward to be the instigator of doubt in you breast of the worth of any one especially as it may give you pain here mr wilson take she brother affectionately by the hand and communicate what she have overhear that evening although the impression of the baronet be not as vivid or as deep as those of he sister he parental love be too great not to make he extremely uneasy under the intelligence and after thank she for she attention to he child 's welfare he kiss she and withdraw in pass to he own room he meet egerton that moment return from escort jarvi lady to they lodgings a task he have undertake at the request of jane as they be without any male attendant sir edward 's heart be too full not to seek immediate relief and as he have strong hope of the innocence of the colonel though he could give no reason for he expectation he return with he to the parlor and in a few word acquaint he with the slander which have be circulate at he expense beg he by all means to disprove they as soon as possible the colonel be strike with the circumstance at first but assure sir edward it be entirely untrue he never play as he might have notice and that mr holt be a ancient enemy of he he would in she morning take measure to convince sir edward that he stand higher in the estimation of he uncle than mr holt have think proper to state much relieve by this explanation the baronet forget that this heavy charge remove he only stand where he do before he take time for he inquiry assure he that if he could convince he or rather he sister he do not gamble he would receive he as a son-in-law with pleasure the gentleman shake hand and part denbigh have retire to he room early tell mr benfield he do not feel well and thus miss the party at supper and by twelve silence prevail in the house as usual after a previous day of pleasure the party be late in assemble on the follow yet denbigh be the last who make he appearance mr wilson think he throw a look round the room as he enter which prevent he make he salutation in he usual easy and polished manner in a few minute however he awkwardness be remove and they take they seat at the table at that moment the door of the room be throw hastily open and mr jarvi enter abruptly and with a look border on wildness in he eye -- be she not here exclaim the merchant scanning the company closely who inquire all in a breath polly -- my daughter -- my child say the merchant endeavor to control he feeling do she not come here this morning with colonel egerton he be answer in the negative and he briefly explain the cause of he anxiety the colonel have call very early and send she maid up to he daughter who rise immediately they have quit the house together leave word the miss moseley have send for the young lady to breakfast for some particular reason such be the latitude allow by he wife that nothing be suspect until one of the servant of the house say he have see colonel egerton and a lady drive out of the village that morning in a post-chaise and four then the old gentleman first take the alarm and he proceed instantly to the lodge in quest of he daughter of the elopement there now remain no doubt and a examination into the state of the colonel 's room who it have be think be not yet rise give assurance of it here be at once sad confirmation that the opinion of mr holt be a just one although every heart feel for jane during this dreadful explanation no eye be turn on she except the steal and anxious glance of she sister but when all be confirm and nothing remain but to reflect or act upon the circumstance she naturally engross the whole attention of she fond parent jane have listen in indignation to the commencement of the narrative of mr jarvi and so firmly be egerton enshrine in purity within she imagination that not until it be ascertain that both he servant and clothes be miss would she admit a thought injurious to he truth then indeed the feeling of mr jarvi he plain statement corroborate by this testimony strike she at once as true and as she rise to leave the room she fall senseless into the arm of emily who observe she movement and loss of color have fly to she assistance denbigh have draw the merchant out in vain effort to appease he and happily no one witness this effect of jane 's passion but she nearest relative she be immediately remove to she own room and in a short time be in bed with a burning fever the burst of she grief be uncontrolled and violent at time she reproach herself -- she friend -- egerton in short she be guilty of all the inconsistent sensation that disappoint hope accompany by the consciousness of weakness on we part seldom fail to give rise to the presence of she friend be irksome to she and it be only to the soft and insinuate blandishments of emily 's love that she would at all yield perseverance and affection at length prevail and as emily take the opportunity of some refreshment to infuse a strong soporific jane lose she consciousness of misery in a temporary repose in the mean time a more search inquiry have be able to trace out the manner and direction of the journey of the fugitive it appear the colonel leave the lodge immediately after he conversation with sir edward he sleep at a tavern and cause he servant to remove he baggage at daylight here he have order a chaise and horse and then proceed as mention to the lodgings of mr jarvi what argument he use with miss jarvi to urge she to so sudden a flight remain a secret but from the remark of mr jarvi and miss sarah there be reason to believe that he have induce they to think from the commencement that he intention be single and mary jarvi they object how he contrived to gloss over he attention to jane in such a manner as to deceive those lady cause no little surprise but it be obvious it have be do and the moseley be not without hope he situation with jane would not make the noise in the world such occurrence seldom fail to excite in the afternoon a letter be hand to mr jarvi and by he immediately communicate to the baronet and denbigh both of whom he consider as among he best friend it be from egerton and write in a respectful manner : he apologize for he elopement and excuse it on the ground of a wish to avoid the delay of a license or the publishing of ban as he be in hourly expectation of a summons to he regiment and contain many promise of make a attentive husband and a affectionate son the fugitive be on the road to scotland whence they intend immediately to return to london and to wait the command of they parent the baronet in a voice tremble with emotion at the suffering of he own child congratulate the merchant that thing be no worse while denbigh curl he lip as he read the epistle and think settlement be a greater inconvenience than the ban -- for it be a well know fact a maiden aunt have leave the jarvise twenty thousand pound between they chapter xxvi although the affection of jane have sustain a blow she pride have receive a greater and no persuasion of she mother or sister could induce she to leave she room she talk little but once or twice she yield to the affectionate attention of emily and pour out she sorrow into the bosom of she sister at such moment she would declare she intention of never appear in the world again one of these paroxysm of sorrow be witness by she mother and for the first time self-reproach mingle in the grief of the matron have she trust less to appearance and to the opinion of indifferent and ill-judging acquaintance she daughter might have be apprize in season of the character of the man who have steal she affection to a direct exhibition of misery lady moseley be always sensible and for the moment she become alive to its cause and consequence but a timely and judicious safeguard against future moral evil be a forecast neither she inactivity of mind nor ability be equal to we shall leave jane to brood over she lover 's misconduct while we regret she be without the consolation alone able to bear she up against the misfortune of life and return to the other personage of we history the visit to mr fitzgerald have be postpone in consequence of jane 's indisposition but a week after the colonel 's departure mr wilson think as jane have consent to leave she room and emily really begin to look pale from she confinement by the side of a sick bed she would redeem the pledge she have give the recluse on the follow morning they find the lady at the cottage happy to see they and anxious to hear of the health of jane of whose illness they have be inform by note after offer she guest some refreshment mr fitzgerald who appear labor under a greater melancholy than usual proceed to make they acquaint with the incident of she life the daughter of a english merchant at lisbon have flee from the house of she father to the protection of a irish officer in the service of he catholic majesty : they be unite and the colonel immediately take he bride to madrid the offspring of this union be a son and daughter the former at a early age have enter into the service of he king and have as usual be breed in the faith of he ancestor but the señora mccarthy have be educate and yet remain a protestant and contrary to she faith to she husband secretly instruct she daughter in the same belief at the age of seventeen a principal grandee of the court of charle seek the hand of the general 's child the conde d'alzada be a match not to be refuse and they be unite in the heartless and formal manner in which marriage be too often enter into in country where the custom of society prevent a intercourse between the sex the conde never possess the affection of he wife of a stern and unyielding disposition he harshness repel she love and as she naturally turn she eye to the home of she childhood she cherish all those peculiar sentiment she have imbibe from she mother thus although she appear to the world a catholic she live in secret a protestant she parent have always use the english language in they family and she speak it as fluently as the spanish to encourage she recollection of this strong feature which distinguish the house of she father from the other she enter she peruse closely and constantly those book which the death of she mother place at she disposal these be principally protestant work on religious subject and the countess become a strong sectarian without become a christian as she be compel to use the same book in teach she only child the donna julium english the consequence of the original false step of she grandmother be perpetuate in the person of this young lady in learn english she also learn to secede from the faith of she father and entail upon herself a life of either persecution or hypocrisy the countess be guilty of the unpardonable error of complain to they child of the treatment she receive from she husband and as these conversation be hold in english and be consecrate by the tear of the mother they make a indelible impression on the youthful mind of julium who grow up with the conviction that next to be a catholic herself the greatest evil of life be to be the wife of one on she attain she fifteenth year she have the misfortune -lrb- if it could be term one -rrb- to lose she mother and within the year she father present to she a nobleman of the vicinity as she future husband how long the religious faith of julium would have endure unsupported by example in other and assail by the passion solicit in behalf of a young and handsome cavalier it might be difficult to pronounce but as suitor be neither very young and the reverse of very handsome it be certain the more he woo the more confirm she become in she heresy until in a moment of desperation and as a only refuge against he solicitation she candidly avow she creed the anger of she father be violent and lasting : she be doom to a convent as both a penance for she sin and a means of reformation physical resistance be not in she power but mentally she determine never to yield she body be immure but she mind continue unshaken and rather more settle in she belief by the aid of those passion which have be excite by injudicious harshness for two year she continue in she novitiate obstinately refuse to take the vow of the order and at the end of that period the situation of she country have call she father and uncle to the field as defender of the rights of they lawful prince perhaps to this it be owe that harsher measure be not adopt in she case the war now rage around they in its greatest horror until at length a general battle be fight in the neighborhood and the dormitory of the peaceful nun be crowd with wounded british officer amongst other of he nation be a major fitzgerald a young man of strikingly handsome countenance and pleasant manners chance throw he under the more immediate charge of julium : he recovery be slow and for a time doubtful and as much owe to good nursing as science the major be grateful and julium unhappy as she be beautiful that love should be the offspring of this association will excite no surprise a brigade of british encamp in the vicinity of the convent the young couple seek its protection from spanish vengeance and romish cruelty they be marry by the chaplain of the brigade and for a month they be happy as napoleon be daily expect in person at the seat of war he general be alive to they own interest if not to that of they master the body of troops in which fitzgerald have seek a refuge be a advanced party of the main army be surprised and defeat with loss after do he duty as a soldier at he post the major in endeavor to secure the retreat of julium be intercept and they both fall into the hand of the enemy they be kindly treat and allow every indulgence they situation admit until a small escort of prisoner be send to the frontier in this they be include and have proceed to the neighborhood of the pyrenee when in they turn the french be assail suddenly and entirely route and the captive spaniard of which the party with the exception of we young couple consist release as the french guard make a resistance until overpower by number a unfortunate ball strike major fitzgerald to the earth -- he survive but a hour and die where he fall on the open field a english officer the last of he retire countryman be attract by the sight of a woman weep over the body of a fall man and approach they in a few word fitzgerald explain he situation to this gentleman and exact a pledge from he to guard he julium in safety to he mother in england the stranger promise everything the die husband require and by the time death have close the eye of fitzgerald he have procure from some peasant a rude conveyance into which the body with its almost equally lifeless widow be place the party which intercept the convoy of prisoner have be out from the british camp on other duty but its commander hearing of the escort have push rapidly into a country cover by the enemy to effect they rescue and he service do he be compel to make a hasty retreat to ensure he own security to this be owe the indifference which leave the major to the care of the spanish peasantry who have gather to the spot and the retreat troops have get several mile on they return before the widow and she protector commence they journey it be impossible to overtake they and the inhabitant acquaint the gentleman that a body of french dragoon be already harass they rear he be compel to seek another route to the camp this with some trouble and no little danger he at last effect and the day follow the skirmish julium find herself lodge in a retired spanish dwelling several mile within the advanced post of the british army the body of she husband be respectfully inter and julium be leave to mourn she irretrievable loss uninterrupted by anything but by the hasty visit of the officer in whose care she have be leave -- visit which he steal from he more important duty as a soldier a month glide by in this melancholy manner leave to mr fitzgerald the only consolation she would receive -- she incessant visit to the grave of she husband the call of she protector however become more frequent and at length he announce he intended departure for lisbon on he way to england a small covered vehicle draw by one horse be to convey they to the city at which place he promise to procure she a female attendant and necessaries for the voyage home it be no time or place for delicate punctilio and julium quietly but with a heart nearly broken prepare to submit to the wish of she late husband after leave the dwelling the manners of she guide sensibly alter he become complimentary and assiduous to please but in a way rather to offend than conciliate until he attention become so irksome that julium actually meditate stop at some of the village through which they pass and abandon the attempt of visit england entirely but the desire to comply with fitzgerald 's wish that she would console he mother for the loss of a only child and the dread of the anger of she relative determine she to persevere until they reach lisbon where she be resolve to separate for ever from the disagreeable and unknown guardian into whose keep she have be throw by chance the last day of they weary ride while pass a wood the officer so far forget he own character and julium 's misfortune as to offer personal indignity grow desperate from she situation mr fitzgerald spring from the vehicle and by she cry attract the notice of a officer who be ride express on the same road with themselves he advance to she assistance at speed but as he arrive near they a pistol fire from the carriage bring he horse down and the treacherous friend be enable to escape undetected julium endeavor to explain she situation to she rescuer and by she distress and appearance satisfy he at once of its truth within a short time a strong escort of light dragoon come up and the officer despatch some for a conveyance and other in pursuit of that disgrace to the army the villanous guide : the former be soon obtain but no tiding could be have of the latter the carriage be find at a short distance without the horse and with the baggage of julium but with no vestige of its owner she never know he name and either accident or art have so completely envelop he in mystery that all effort to unfold it then be fruitless and have continue so ever since on they arrival in lisbon every attention be show to the disconsolate widow the most refined delicacy could dictate and every comfort and respect be procure for she which the princely fortune high rank and higher character of the earl of pendennyss could command it be this nobleman who on he way from head-quarter with despatch for england have be the means of preserve julium from a fate worse than death a packet be in wait for the earl and they proceed in she for home the donna lorenza be the widow of a subaltern spanish officer who have fall under the order and near pendennyss and the interest he take in she brave husband have induce he to offer she in the destruction of she little fortune by the enemy he protection : for near two year he have maintain she at lisbon and now judge she a proper person have persuade she to accompany mr fitzgerald to england on the passage which be very tedious the earl become more intimately acquaint with the history and character of he young friend and by a course of gentle yet powerful expedient have draw she mind gradually from its gloomy contemplation of futurity to a juster sense of good and evil the peculiarity of she religious persuasion afford a introduction to frequent discussion of the real opinion of that church to which julium have hitherto belong although ignorant of all its essential and vital truth these conversation which be renew repeatedly in they intercourse while under the protection of he sister in london lay the foundation of a faith which leave she nothing to hope for but the happy termination of she earthly probation the mother of fitzgerald be dead and as he have no near relative left julium find herself alone in the world she husband have take the precaution to make a will in season it be properly authenticate and he widow by the powerful assistance of pendennyss be put in quiet possession of a little independency it be while wait the decision of this affair that mr fitzgerald reside for a short time near bath as soon as it be terminate the earl and he sister have see she settle in she present abode and once since have they visit she but delicacy have keep he away from the cottage although he attempt to serve she have be constant though not always successful he have on he return to spain see she father and intercede with he on she behalf but in vain the anger of the spaniard remain unappeased and for a season he do not renew he effort out have hear that she father be indispose julium have employ the earl once more to make she peace with he without prevail the letter the lady have find she weep over be from pendennyss inform she of he want of success on that occasion the substance of the foregoing narrative be relate by mr fitzgerald to mr wilson who repeat it to emily in they ride home the compassion of both lady be strongly move in behalf of the young widow yet mr wilson do not fail to point out to she niece the consequence of deception and chiefly the misery which have follow from a abandonment of some of the primary duty of life -- obedience and respect to she parent emily though keenly alive to all the principle inculcate by she aunt find so much to be pity in the fate of she friend that she failing lose they proper appearance in she eye and for a while she could think of nothing but julium and she misfortune previously to they leave the cottage mr fitzgerald with glowing cheek and some hesitation inform mr wilson she have yet another important communication to make but would postpone it until she next visit which mr wilson promise should be on the succeed day chapter xxvii emily throw a look of pleasure on denbigh as he hand she from the carriage which would have say if look could talk in the principle you have display on more than one occasion i have a pledge of _ you _ worth as he lead she into the house he laughingly inform she that he have that morning receive a letter which would make he absence from l -- necessary for a short time and that he must remonstrate against these long and repeated visit to a cottage where all attendant of the male sex be exclude as they encroach greatly on he pleasure and improvement bow as he speak to mr wilson to this emily reply gaily that possibly if he conduct himself to they satisfaction they would intercede for _ he _ admission express he pleasure at this promise as mr wilson think rather awkwardly denbigh change the conversation at dinner he repeat to the family what he have mention to emily of he departure and also he expectation of meeting with lord chatterton during he journey have you hear from chatterton lately john inquire sir edward moseley yes sir to-day : he have leave denbigh castle a fortnight since and write he be to meet he friend the duke at bath be you connect with he grace mr denbigh ask lady moseley a smile of indefinite meaning play on the expressive face of denbigh as he answer slightly -- on the side of my father madam he have a sister continue lady moseley willing to know more of chatterton 's friend and denbigh 's relative he have be the brief reply she name be harriet observe mr wilson denbigh bow he assent in silence and emily timidly add -- lady harriet denbigh lady harriet denbigh -- will you do I the favor to take wine the manner of the gentleman during this dialogue have not be in the least unpleasant but it be peculiar it prohibit anything further on the subject and emily be oblige to be content without know who marian be or whether she name be to be find in the denbigh family or not emily be not in the least jealous but she wish to know all to whom she lover be dear do the dowager and the young lady accompany chatterton ask sir edward as he turn to john who be eat he fruit in silence yes sir -- i hope -- that be i believe she will be the answer she who be she my son grace chatterton say john start from he meditation do you not ask I about grace sir edward not particularly i believe say the baronet dryly denbigh again smile : it be a smile different from any mr wilson have ever see on he countenance and give a entirely novel expression to he face it be full of mean it be know -- speak more of the man of the world than anything she have before notice in he and leave on she mind one of those vague impression she be often trouble with that there be something about denbigh in character or condition or both that be mysterious the spirit of jane be too great to leave she a pining or pensive maiden yet she feeling have sustain a shock that time alone could cure she appear again amongst she friend but the consciousness of she expectation with respect to the colonel be know to they throw around she a hauteur and distance very foreign to she natural manner emily alone whose every movement spring from the spontaneous feeling of she heart and whose word and action be influence by the finest and most affectionate delicacy such as she be not conscious of possess herself win upon the better feeling of she sister so far as to restore between they the usual exchange of kindness and sympathy but jane admit no confidence she find nothing consoling nothing solid to justify she attachment to egerton nothing indeed except such external advantage as she be now ashamed to admit have ever the power over she they in reality have possess the marriage of the fugitive in scotland have be announce and as the impression that egerton be to be connect with the moseley be destroy of course they every-day acquaintance feel the restraint remove that such a opinion have once impose be free in they comment on he character sir edward and lady moseley be astonish to find how many thing to he disadvantage be generally know that he gamble -- intrigue -- and be in debt -- be no secret apparently to anybody but to those who be most interested in know the truth while mr wilson saw in these fact additional reason for examine and judge for ourselves the world uniformly conceal from the party and he friend they honest opinion of he character some of these insinuation reach the ear of jane : she aunt have rightly judge that the surest way to destroy egerton 's power over the imagination of she niece be to strip he of he fictitious quality suggest this expedient to lady moseley and some of they visitor have though as the colonel have certainly be attentive to miss moseley it would give she pleasure to know that she rival have not make the most eligible match in the kingdom the project of mr wilson succeed in a great measure but although egerton fall jane do not find she rise in she own estimation and she friend wisely conclude that time be the only remedy that could restore she former serenity in the morning mr wilson unwilling to have emily present at a conversation she intend to hold with denbigh with a view to satisfy she annoying doubt as to some minor point in he character after excuse herself to she niece invite that gentleman to a morning drive he accept she invitation cheerfully and mrs wilson see it be only as they drive from the door without emily that he betray the faintest reluctance to the jaunt when they have get a short distance from the lodge she acquaint he with she intention of present he to mr fitzgerald whither she have order the coachman to proceed denbigh start as she mention the name and after a few moment ' silence desire mr wilson to allow he to stop the carriage he be not very well -- be sorry to be so rude -- but with she permission he would alight and return to the house as he request in a earnest manner that she would proceed without he and by no means disappoint she friend mr wilson comply yet somewhat at a loss to account for he sudden illness she turn she head to see how the sick man fare a short time after he have leave she and be not a little surprised to see he talk very composedly with john who have meet he on he way to the field with he gun lovesick -- think mr wilson with a smile and as she ride on she come to the conclusion that as denbigh be to leave they soon emily would have a important communication to make on she return well think mr wilson with a sigh if it be to happen it may as well be do at once mr fitzgerald be expect she and appear rather pleased than otherwise that she have come alone after some introductory conversation the lady withdraw by themselves and julium acquaint mr wilson with a new source of uneasiness the day the lady have promise to visit she but have be prevent by the arrangement for the ball the donna lorenza have drive to the village to make some purchase attend as usual by they only man-servant and mr fitzgerald be sit in the little parlor in momentary expectation of she friend by herself the sound of footstep draw she to the door which she open for the admission of the wretch whose treachery to she die husband 's request have give she so much uneasiness horror -- fear -- surprise -- altogether prevent she from make any alarm at the moment and she sink into a chair he stand between she and the door as he endeavor to draw she into a conversation he assure she she have nothing to fear that he love she and she alone that he be about to be marry to a daughter of sir edward moseley but would give she up fortune everything if she would consent to become he wife -- that the view of she protector he doubt not be dishonorable -- that he himself be willing to atone for he former excess of passion by a life devote to she how much longer he would have go on and what further he would have offer be unknown for mr fitzgerald have recover herself a little darted to the bell on the other side of the room he try to prevent she ringing it but be too late a short struggle follow when the sound of the footstep of the maid compel he to retreat precipitately mr fitzgerald add that he assertion concern miss moseley have give she incredible uneasiness and prevent she make the communication yesterday but she understand this morning through she maid that a colonel egerton who have be suppose to be engage to one of sir edward 's daughter have elope with another lady that egerton be she persecutor she do not now entertain a doubt but that it be in the power of mr wilson probably to make the discovery as in the struggle between they for the bell a pocket-book have fall from the breast-pocket of he coat and he retreat be too sudden to recover it as she put the book into the hand of mr wilson she desire she would take means to return it to its owner its contents might be of value though she have not think it correct to examine it mr wilson take the book and as she drop it into she work-bag smile at the spanish punctilio of she friend in not look into she prize under the peculiar circumstance a few question as to the place and year of he first attempt soon convince she it be egerton whose unlicensed passion have give so much trouble to mr fitzgerald he have serve but one campaign in spain and in that year and that division of the army and surely _ he principle _ be no restraint upon he conduct mr fitzgerald beg the advice of she more experienced friend as to the step she ought to take to which the former ask if she have make lord pendennyss acquaint with the occurrence the young widow 's cheek glow as she answer that at the same time she feel assure the base insinuation of egerton be unfounded it have create a repugnance in she to trouble the earl any more than be necessary in she affair and as she kiss the hand of mr wilson she add -- besides you goodness my dear madam render any other adviser unnecessary now mr wilson press she hand affectionately and assure she of she good wish and unaltered esteem she commend she delicacy and plainly tell the young widow that how ever unexceptionable the character of pendennyss might be a female friend be the only one a woman in she situation could repose confidence in without justly incur the sarcasm of the world as egerton be now marry and would not probably offer for the present at least any further molestation to mr fitzgerald it be conclude to be unnecessary to take any immediate measure of precaution and mr wilson think the purse of mr jarvi might be make the means of keep he within proper bound in future the merchant be prompt and not easily intimidate and the slightest intimation of the truth would she know be sufficient to engage he on they side heart and hand the lady part with a promise of meeting soon again and a additional interest in each other by the communication of that and the precede day mr wilson have ride half the distance between the cottage and the lodge before it occur to she they have not absolutely ascertain by the best means in they possession the identity of colonel egerton with julium 's persecutor she accordingly take the pocket-book from she bag and open it for examination : a couple of letter fall from it into she lap and conceive they direction would establish all she wish to know as they have be read she turn to the superscription of one of they and see -- george denbigh esq in the well know hand-writing of dr ive -- mr wilson feel herself overcome to a degree that compel she to lower a glass of the carriage for air she sit gaze on the letter until the character swim before she eye in undistinguished confusion and with difficulty she rally she thought to the point necessary for investigation as soon as she find herself equal to the task she examine the letter with the closest scrutiny and open they both to be sure there be no mistake she see the date the dear george at the commencement and the doctor 's name subscribe before she would believe they be real it be then the truth appear to break upon she in a flood of light the aversion of denbigh to speak of spain or of he service in that country -- he avoid sir herbert nicholson and that gentleman 's observation respect he -- colonel egerton 's and he own manners -- he absence from the ball and startling look on the follow morning and at different time before and since -- he displeasure at the name of pendennyss on various occasion -- and he cheerful acceptance of she invitation to ride until he know she destination and singular manner of leave she -- be all account for by this dreadful discovery and mr wilson find the solution of she doubt rush on she mind with a force and rapidity that sicken she the misfortune of mr fitzgerald the unfortunate issue to the passion of jane be trifle in the estimation of mr wilson compare to the discovery of denbigh 's unworthiness she revolve in she mind he conduct on various occasion and wonder how one who could behave so well in common could thus yield to temptation on a particular occasion he recent attempt he hypocrisy however prove that he villany be systematic and she be not weak enough to hide from herself the evidence of he guilt or of its enormity he interposition between emily and death she attribute now to natural courage and perhaps in some measure to chance but he profound and unvarying reverence for holy thing he consistent charity he refuse to fight to what be they owe and mr wilson mourn the weakness of human nature while she acknowledge to she self there might be man qualify by nature and even dispose by reason and grace to prove ornament to religion and the world who fall beneath the maddening influence of they beset sin the superficial and interested vice of egerton vanish before these awful and deeply seat offence of denbigh and the correct widow see at a glance that he be the last man to be intrust with the happiness of she niece but how to break this heartrending discovery to emily be a new source of uneasiness to she and the carriage stop at the door of the lodge ere she have determine on the first step require of she by duty she brother hand she out and fill with the dread that denbigh have avail himself of the opportunity of she absence to press he suit with emily she eagerly inquire after he she be rejoice to hear he have return with john for a fowling-piece and together they have go in pursuit of game although she see in it a convincing proof that a desire to avoid mr fitzgerald and not indisposition have induce he to leave she -- as a last alternative she resolve to have the pocket-book return to he in she presence in order to see if he acknowledge it to be he property and accordingly she instruct she own man to hand it to he while at dinner simply say he have lose it the open and unsuspecting air with which she niece meet denbigh on he return give mr wilson a additional shock and she could hardly command herself sufficiently to extend the common courtesy of good breed to mr benfield 's guest while sit at the dessert she servant hand the pocket book as direct by he mistress to its owner say you pocket-book i believe mr denbigh denbigh take the book and hold it in he hand for a moment in surprise and then fix he eye keenly on the man as he inquire where he find it and how he know it be he these be interrogatory franci be not prepare to answer and in he confusion he naturally turn he eye on he mistress denbigh follow they direction with he own and in encounter the look of the lady he ask in a stammering manner and with a face of scarlet be i indebted to you madam for my property no sir it be give I by one who find it to restore to you say mr wilson gravely and the subject be drop both appear willing to say no more yet denbigh be abstracted and absent during the remainder of the repast and emily speak to he once or twice without obtain a answer mr wilson catch he eye several time fix on she with a inquire and doubtful expression that convince she he be alarm if any confirmation of he guilt have be want the consciousness he betray during this scene afford it and she set seriously about consider the shortest and best method of interrupt he intercourse with emily before he have draw from she a acknowledgment of she love chapter xxviii on withdraw to she dressing-room after dinner mr wilson commence the disagreeable duty of remove the veil from the eye of she niece by recount to she the substance of mr fitzgerald 's last communication to the innocence of emily such persecution could excite no other sensation than surprise and horror and as she aunt omit the part concern the daughter of sir edward moseley she naturally express she wonder as to who the wretch could be possibly aunt she say with a involuntary shudder some of the many gentleman we have lately see and one who have have art enough to conceal he real character from the world concealment my love reply mr wilson would be hardly necessary such be the fashionable laxity of moral that i doubt not many of he associate would laugh at he misconduct and that he would still continue to pass with the world as a honorable man and ready cry she niece to sacrifice human life in the defense of any ridiculous punctilio or add mr wilson strive to draw nearer to she subject with a closer veil of hypocrisy wear even a affectation of principle and moral feeling that would seem to forbid such a departure from duty in favor of custom oh no dear aunt exclaim emily with glowing cheek and eye dance with pleasure he would hardly dare to be so very base it would be profanity mr wilson sigh heavily as she witness that confide esteem which would not permit she niece even to suspect that a act which in denbigh have be so warmly applaud could even in another proceed from unworthy motive and she find it would be necessary to speak in the plainest term to awaken she suspicion willing however to come gradually to the distressing truth she reply -- and yet my dear man who pride themselves greatly on they moral nay even some who wear the mask of religion and perhaps deceive themselves admit and practice this very appeal to arm such inconsistency be by no means uncommon and why then might there not with equal probability be other who would revolt at murder and yet not hesitate be guilty of lesser enormity this be in some measure the case of every man and it be only to consider kill in unlawful encounter as murder to make it one in point hypocrisy be so mean a vice i should not think a brave man could stoop to it say emily and julium admit he be brave and would not a brave man revolt at the cowardice of insulting a unprotected woman and you hero do that too reply mr wilson bitterly lose she self-command in indignation oh do not call he my hero i beg of you dear aunt say emily start excite by so extraordinary a allusion but instantly lose the unpleasant sensation in the delightful consciousness of the superiority of the man on whom she have bestow she own admiration in fact my child continue she aunt we nature be guilty of the grossest inconsistency the vilest wretch have generally some property or which he value himself and the most perfect be too often frail on some tender point long and try friendship be those only which can be trust and these oftentimes fail emily look at she aunt in surprise at hear she utter such unusual sentiment for mr wilson at the same time she have by divine assistance deeply impressed she niece with the frailty of she nature have withhold the disgusting representation of human vice from she view as unnecessary to she situation and dangerous to she humility after a short pause mr wilson continue marriage be a fearful step in a woman and one she be compel in some measure to adventure she happiness on without fitting opportunity of judge of the merit of the man she confide in jane be a instance in point but i devoutly hope you be not to be another while speak mr wilson have take the hand of emily and by she look and solemn manner she have succeed in alarming she niece although denbigh be yet furthest from the thought of emily the aunt reach she a glass of water and willing to get rid of the hateful subject she continue hurriedly do you not notice the pocket-book franci give to mr denbigh emily fix she inquire eye on she aunt as the other add it be the one mr fitzgerald give I to-day something like a indefinite glimpse of the fact cross the mind of emily and as it most obviously involve a separation from denbigh she sink lifeless into the extended arm of she aunt this have be anticipate by mr wilson and a timely application of restorative soon bring she back to a consciousness of misery mr wilson unwilling any one but herself should witness this first burst of grief succeed in get she niece to she own room and in bed emily make no lamentation -- shed no tear -- ask no question -- she eye be fix and every faculty appear oppressed with the load on she heart mr wilson know she situation too well to intrude with unseasonable consolation or useless reflection but sit patiently by she side wait anxiously for the moment she could be of service at length the uplifted eye and clasped hand of emily assure she she have not forget herself or she duty and she be reward for she labor and forbearance by a flood of tear emily be now able to listen to a more full statement of the reason she aunt have for believe in the guilt of denbigh and she feel as if she heart be freeze up for ever as the proof follow each other until they amount to demonstration as there be some indication of fever from she agitate state of mind she aunt require she should remain in she room until morning and emily feeling every way unequal to a meeting with denbigh gladly assent after ring for she maid to sit in the adjoining room mr wilson go below and announce to the family the indisposition of she charge and she desire to obtain a little sleep denbigh look anxious to inquire after the health of emily but there be a restraint on all he action since the return of he book that persuade mr wilson he apprehend that a detection of he conduct have take place he do venture to ask when they be to have the pleasure of see miss moseley again hope it would be that evening as he have fix the morning for he departure and when he learn that emily have retire for the night he anxiety be sensibly increase and he instantly withdraw mr wilson be alone in the drawing-room and about to join she niece as denbigh enter it with a letter in he hand : he approach she with a diffident and constrain manner and commence the follow dialogue : my anxiety and situation will plead my apology for troubling miss moseley at this time -- may i ask you madam to deliver this letter -- i hardly dare ask you for you good office mr wilson take the letter and coldly reply certainly sir and i sincerely wish i could be of any real service to you i perceive madam say denbigh like one that be choke i have forfeit you good opinion -- that pocket book -- have make a dreadful discovery say mr wilson shudder will not one offence be pardon dear madam cry denbigh with warmth if you know my circumstance -- the cruel reason -- why -- why do i neglect the paternal advice of doctor ive it be not yet too late sir say mr wilson more mildly for you own good as for we you deception -- be unpardonable -- i see it -- i feel it cry he in the accent of despair yet emily -- emily may relent -- you will at least give she my letter -- anything be better than this suspense you shall have a answer from emily this evening and one entirely unbiassed by I say mr wilson as she close the door she observe denbigh gaze on she retire figure with a countenance of despair that cause a feeling of pity to mingle with she detestation of he vice on open the door of emily 's room mr wilson find she niece in tear and she anxiety for she health be alleviate she know or hope that if she could once call in the assistance of she judgment and piety to lessen she sorrow emily however she might mourn would become resigned to she situation and the first step to attain this be the exercise of those faculty which have be as it be momentarily annihilate mr wilson kiss she niece with tenderness as she place the letter in she hand and tell she she would call for she answer within a hour employment and the necessity of act would she think be the surest means of revive she energy nor be she disappoint when the aunt return for the expect answer she be inform by the maid in the ante-chamber that miss moseley be up and have be write on enter mr wilson stand a moment in admiration of the picture before she emily be on she knee and by she side on the carpet lay the letter and its answer : she face be hide by she hair and she hand be close in the fervent grasp of petition in a minute she rise and approach she aunt with a air of profound resignation but great steadiness she hand she the letter she own unsealed : read they madam and if you approve of mine i will thank you to deliver it she aunt fold she in she arm until emily finding herself yield under the effect of sympathy beg to be leave alone on withdraw to she own room mr wilson read the contents of the two letter i rely greatly on the goodness of miss moseley to pardon the liberty i be take at a moment she be so unfit for such a subject but my departure -- my feeling -- must plead my apology from the moment of my first acquaintance with you i have be a cheerful subject to you loveliness and innocence i feel -- i know -- i be not deserving of such a blessing but since know you as i do it be impossible not to strive to win you you have often thank I as the preserver of you life but you little know the deep interest i have in its safety without it my own would be valueless by accept my offer hand you will place I amongst the happiest or by reject it the most wretched of man to this note which be unsigned and evidently write under great agitation of mind emily had-pen the following reply : sir -- it be with much regret that i find myself reduce to the possibility of give uneasiness to one to whom i be under such heavy obligation it will never be in my power to accept the honor you have offer I and i beg you to receive my thanks for the compliment convey in you request as well as my good wish for you happiness in future and fervent prayer that you may be ever find worthy of it -- you humble servant emily moseley perfectly satisfy with this answer mr wilson go below in order to deliver it at once she think it probable as denbigh have already send he baggage to a tavern preparatory to he intended journey they would not meet again and as she feel a strong wish both on account of doctor ive and out of respect to the service of the young man himself to conceal he conduct from the world entirely she be in hope that he absence might make any disclosure unnecessary he take the letter from she with a tremble hand and cast one of he very expressive look at she as if to read she thought he withdraw emily have fall asleep free from fever and mr wilson have descend to the supper-room when mr benfield be first strike with the absence of he favorite a inquiry after denbigh be institute and while they be wait he appearance a servant handed the old man a note from whom cry mr benfield in surprise mr denbigh sir say the servant mr denbigh exclaim mr benfield : no accident i hope -- i remember when lord gosford -- here peter you eye be young read it for I read it aloud as all but mr wilson be anxiously wait to know the meaning of this message and peter have many preparation to go through before he youthful eye could make out the contents john hastily catch the letter out of he hand say he would save he the trouble and in obedience to he uncle 's wish he read aloud : mr denbigh be under the necessity of leave l -- immediately and unable to endure the pain of take leave avail himself of this means of tender he warmest thanks to mr benfield for he hospitality and to he amiable guest for they many kindness as he contemplate leave england he desire to wish they all a long and a affectionate farewell farewell cry mr benfield farewell -- do he say farewell john here peter run -- no you be too old -- john run -- bring my hat i 'll go myself to the village -- some love-quarrel -- emmy sick -- and denbigh go away -- yes -- yes i do so myself -- lady juliana poor dear soul she be a long time before she could forget it -- but peter -- peter have disappear the instant the letter be finish and he be quickly follow by john sir edward and lady moseley be lose in amazement at this sudden and unexpected movement of denbigh and the breast of each of the affectionate parent be fill with a vague apprehension that the peace of mind of another child be at stake jane feel a renewal of she woe in the anticipation of something similar for she sister -- for the fancy of jane be yet active and she do not cease to consider the defection of egerton a kind of unmerited misfortune and fatality instead of a probable consequence of want of principle like mr benfield she be in danger of raise a ideal idol and of spend the remainder of she day in devotion to quality rarely if ever find identify with a person that never have exist the old gentleman be entirely engross by a different object and have in he own opinion decide there must have be one of those misunderstanding which sometimes have occur to himself and lady juliana he quietly compose himself to eat he salad at the supper table : on turn he head however in quest of he first glass of wine he observe peter standing quietly by the sideboard with the favorite goggles over he eye now peter be trouble with two kind of debility about he organ of vision one be age and natural weakness while the other proceed more directly from the heart he master know of these fact and he take the alarm again the wine-glass drop from he nerveless hand as he say in a tremble tone peter i think you go -- yes master say peter laconically you see he peter -- will he return peter be busily occupy at he glass although no one be dry peter repeat mr benfield rise from he seat be he come in time for supper peter be oblige to reply and deliberately uncase he eye and blow he nose he be on the point of open he mouth as john come into the room and throw himself into a chair with a air of great vexation peter point to the young gentleman in silence and retire john cry sir edward where be denbigh go sir go yes my dear father say john go without say good-bye to one of we -- without tell we whither or when to return it be cruel in he -- unkind -- i 'll never forgive he -- and john whose feeling be strong and unusually excited hide he face between he hand on the table -- as he raise he head to reply to a question of mr benfield -- of how he know he have go for the coach do not go until daylight mr wilson saw evident mark of tear such proof of emotion in one like john moseley give she the satisfaction of know that if she have be deceive it be by a concurrence of circumstance and a depth of hypocrisy almost exceed belief : self-reproach add less than common therefore to the uneasiness of the moment i see the innkeeper uncle say john who tell I that denbigh leave there at eight o'clock in a post-chaise and four but i will go to london in the morning myself this be no sooner say than it be corroborate by act for the young man immediately commence he preparation for the journey the family separate that evening with melancholy heart and the host and he privy counsellor be closet for half a hour ere they retire to they night 's repose john take he leave of they and leave the lodge for the inn with he man in order to be ready for the mail mr wilson look in upon emily before she withdraw herself and find she awake but perfectly calm and compose : she say but little appear desirous of avoid all allusion to denbigh and after she aunt have simply acquaint she with he departure and she resolution to conceal the cause the subject be drop mr wilson on enter she own room think deeply on the discovery of the day : they have interfere with she favorite system of moral baffle she ablest calculation upon cause and effect but in no degree have impaired she faith or reliance on providence she know one exception do not destroy a rule : she be certain without principle there be no security for good conduct and the case of denbigh prove it to discover these principle might be difficult but be a task imperiously require at she hand as she believe ere she yield the present and future happiness of she pupil to the power of any man chapter xxix the day have not yet dawn when john moseley be summon to take he seat in the mail for london three of the place be already occupy and john be compel to get a seat for he man on the outside a intercourse with stranger be particularly irksome to a englishman and none appear disposed for a long time to break the silence the coach have leave the little village of l -- far behind it before any of the rational being it contain think it prudent or become to bend in the least to the charity of we nature in a communication with a fellow creature of whose name or condition he happen to be ignorant this reserve be unquestionably characteristic of the nation to what be it owing -- modesty do not national and deep personal vanity appear at once to refute the assertion we might enter into a investigation of it the good opinion of himself in a englishman be more deeply seat though less buoyant than that of he neighbor in they it be more of manner in we more of feeling and the wound inflict on the self-love of the two be very different the frenchman wonder at its rudeness but soon forget the charge while a englishmam brood over it in silence and mortification it be say this distinction in character be owe to the different estimation of principle and moral in the two nation the solidity and purity of we ethic and religious creed may have give a superior tone to we moral feeling but have that man a tenable ground to value himself on either whose respect to sacred thing grow out of a respect to himself : on the other hand be not humility the very foundation of the real christian for we part we should be glad to see this national reserve lessen if not do entirely away we believe it be found in pride and uncharitableness and could wish to see man throw accidentally together on the road of the country mindful that they be also travel in company the highway of life and that the goal of they destination be equally attainable by all john moseley be occupy with thought very different from those of any of he fellow-traveller as they proceed rapidly on they route and it be only when rouse from he meditation by accidentally come in contact with the hilt of a sword that he look up and in the glimmering of the morning 's light recognize the person of lord henry stapleton : they eye meet and -- my lord -- mr moseley -- be repeat in mutual surprise john be eminently a social being and he be happy to find recourse against he gloomy thought in the conversation of the dash young sailor the frigate of the other have enter the bay the night before and he be go to town to the wedding of he sister the coach of he brother the marquis be to meet he about twenty mile from town and the ship be order round to yarmouth where he be to rejoin she but how be you lovely sister moseley cry the young sailor in a frank and careless manner i should have be half in love with one of they if i have time -- and money both be necessary to marriage nowadays you know as to time say john with a laugh i believe that may be dispense with though money be certainly a different thing oh time too reply he lordship i have never time enough to do anything as it ought to be do -- always hurry -- i wish you could recommend to I a lady who would take the trouble off my hand it might be do say john with a smile and the image of kate chatterton cross he brain but it be soon succeed by that of she more lovely sister but how do you manage on board you ship -- hurry there too oh never there reply the captain gravely that be duty you know and everything must be regular of course on shore it be a different thing -- there i be only a passenger l -- have a charming society mr moseley -- a week or ten day ago i be shooting and come to a beautiful cottage about five mile from the village that be the abode of a much more beautiful woman a spaniard a mr fitzgerald -- i be positively in love with she : so soft so polished so modest -- how come you acquaint with she inquire moseley interrupt he in a little surprise chance my dear fellow chance i be thirsty and approach for a drink of water she be sit in the veranda and be hurry for time you know it save the trouble of introduction i fancy she be trouble with the same complaint for she manage to get rid of I in no time and with a great deal of politeness i find out she name however at the next house during this rattle talk john have fix he eye on the face of one of the passenger who sit opposite to he the stranger appear to be about fifty year of age strongly pock-marked with a stiff military air and have the dress and exterior of a gentleman he face be much sun-burnt though naturally very fair and he dark keen eye be intently fix on the sailor as he continue he remark do you know such a lady moseley yes say john though very slightly she be visit one of my sister and -- yourself cry lord henry with a laugh myself once or twice my lord certainly answer john gravely but a lady visit by emily moseley and mr wilson be a proper companion for any one mr fitzgerald be very retire in she manner of living and chance make we acquaint but not be like you lordship in want of time we have endeavor to cultivate she society as we have find it very agreeable the countenance of the stranger undergo several change during this speech of john 's and at its close he eye rest on he with a softer expression than generally mark its rigid and compress muscle willing to change a discourse that be grow too particular for a mail-coach john address himself to the opposite passenger while he eye yet dwell on the face of the military stranger we be likely to have a fine day gentleman the soldier bow stiffly as he smile he assent and the other passenger humbly answer very mr john in the well know tone of honest peter johnson moseley start as he turn he face for the first time on the lank figure which be modestly compress into the smallest possible compass in the corner of the coach in a way not to come in contact with any of its neighbor johnson exclaim john in astonishment you here where be you go -- to london to london mr john reply peter with a look of much importance and then by way of silencing further interrogatory he add on my master 's business sir both moseley and lord henry examine he closely the former wonder what could take the steward at the age of seventy for the first time in he life into the vortex of the capital and the latter in admiration at this figure and equipment of the old man peter be in full costume with the exception of the goggles and be in reality a subject to be gaze at but nothing relax the muscle or attract the particular notice of the soldier who have regain he set form of countenance appear draw up in himself wait patiently for the moment he be expect to act nor do he utter more than as many word in the course of the first fifty mile of they journey he dialect be singular and such as put he hearer at a loss to determine he country lord henry stare at he every time he speak as if to say what countryman be you until at length he suggest to john he be some officer whom the downfall of bonaparte have drive into retirement indeed moseley he add as they be about to resume they carriage after a change of horse we must draw he out and see what he think of he master now -- delicately you know the soldier be however impervious to he lordship 's attack until the project be finally abandon in despair as peter be much too modest to talk in the presence of mr john moseley and a lord the young man have most of the discourse to themselves at a village fifteen mile from london a fashionable carriage and four with the coronet of a marquis be in wait for lord henry john refuse he invitation to take a seat with he to town for he have trace denbigh from stage to stage and be fearful of lose sight of he unless he persevere in the manner he have commence peter and he accordingly be put down safely at a inn in the strand and moseley hasten to make he inquiry after the object of he pursuit such a chaise have arrive a hour before and the gentleman have order he trunk to a neighbor hotel after obtain the address and order a hackney coach he hasten to the house but on inquire for mr denbigh to he great mortification be tell they know of no such gentleman john turn away from the person he be speak to in visible disappointment when a servant respectfully inquire if the gentleman have not come from l -- in norfolk that day he have be the reply then follow I sir if you please they knock at a door of one of the parlor and the servant enter : he return and john be show into a room where denbigh be sit with he head rest on he hand and apparently muse on see who require admittance he spring from he seat and exclaim -- mr moseley do i see aright denbigh cry john stretch out he hand to he be this kind -- be it like yourself -- to leave we so unexpectedly and for so long a time too as you note mention denbigh wave he hand to the servant to retire and hand a chair to he friend mr moseley say he struggle with he feeling you appear ignorant of my proposal to you sister perfectly answer the amaze john and she rejection of they be it possible cry the brother pacing up and down the room i acknowledge i do expect you to offer but not to be refuse denbigh place in the other hand the letter of emily which have read john return with a sigh this then be the reason you leave we he continue emily be not capricious -- it can not be a sudden pique -- she mean as she say yes mr moseley say denbigh mournfully you sister be faultless -- but i be not worthy of she -- my deception -- here the door again open to the admission of peter johnson both the gentleman rise at this sudden interruption and the steward advance to the table once more produce the formidable pocket-book the spectacles and a letter he run over its direction -- for george denbigh esquire london by the hand of peter johnson with care and speed after the observance of these preliminary he deliver the missive to its lawful owner who open it and rapidly peruse its contents denbigh be much affect with whatever the latter might be and kindly take the steward by the hand as he thank he for this renew instance of the interest he take in he if he would tell he where a letter would find he in the morning he would send a reply to the one he have receive peter give he address but appear unwilling to go until assure again and again that the answer would be infallibly send take a small account-book out of he pocket and refer to its contents the steward say master have with coutt & co # 7000 in the bank # 5000 it can be easily do sir and never feel by we denbigh smile in reply as he assure the steward he would take proper notice of he master 's offer in he own answer the door again open and the military stranger be admit to they presence he bow appear not a little surprised to find two of he mail-coach companion there and hand denbigh a letter in quite as formal although in a more silent manner than the steward the soldier be invite to be seat and the letter be peruse with a evident curiosity on the part of denbigh as soon as the latter end it he address the stranger in a language which john rightly judge to be spanish and peter take to be greek for a few minute the conversation be maintain between they with great earnestness he fellow traveller marvel much at the garrulity of the soldier however the stranger soon rise to retire when the door throw open for the fourth time and a voice cry out here i be george safe and sound -- ready to kiss the bridesmaid if they will let I -- and i can find time -- bless I moseley -- old marling-spike -- general -- whew where be the coachman and guard -- it be lord henry stapleton the spaniard bow again in silence and withdraw while denbigh throw open the door of a adjoining room and excuse himself as he desire lord henry to walk in there for a few minute upon my word cry the heedless sailor as he comply we might as well have stick together moseley we be bind to one port it seem you know lord henry say john as he withdraw yes say denbigh and he again require he address of peter which have be give the steward depart the conversation between the two friend do not return to the course it be take when they be interrupt as moseley feel a delicacy in make any allusion to the probable cause of he sister 's refusal he have however begin to hope it be not irremovable and with the determination of renew he visit in the morning he take he leave to allow denbigh to attend to he other guest lord henry stapleton about twelve on the follow morning john and the steward meet at the door of the hotel where denbigh lodge in quest of the same person the latter hold in he hand the answer to he master 's letter but wish particularly to see its writer on inquire to they mutual surprise they be tell that the gentleman have leave there early in the morning have discharge he lodgings and that they be unable to say whither he have go to hunt for a man without a clew in the city of london be usually time misspend of this moseley be perfectly sensible and disregard a proposition of peter 's he return to he own lodgings the proposal of the steward if it do not do much credit to he sagacity be much in favor of he perseverance and enterprise it be no other than that john should take one side of the street and he the other in order to inquire at every house in the place until the fugitive be discover sir say peter with great simplicity when we neighbor white lose he little girl this be the way we

of the latter from the moseley family lady chatterton have discipline she feeling upon the subject of grace and john into such a state of subordination that the fastidious jealousy of the young man now find no ground of alarm in anything she say or do it can not be deny the dowager be delighted to see he again and if it be fair to draw any conclusion from color palpitation and other such little accompaniment of female feeling grace be not excessively sorry it be true it be the best possible opportunity to ascertain all about she friend emily and the rest of the family and grace be extremely happy to have intelligence of they general welfare so direct as be afford by this visit of mr moseley grace look all she express and possibly a little more and john think he look very beautiful there

the alliance with disgust : and that both have unite in humble though vain remonstrance to they mother against the sacrifice and in petition to they sister that she would not be accessary to she own misery there be no pecuniary sacrifice they would not make to she to avert such a connexion but all be fruitless -- kate be resolve to be a viscountess and she mother be equally determine that she should be rich chapter xxx a day elapse between the departure of denbigh and the reappearance of emily amongst she friend a indifferent observer would have think she much graver and less animated than usual a loss of the rich color which ordinarily glow on she healthful cheek might be notice but the placid sweetness and graceful composure which regulate she former conduct pervade all she do or utter not so with jane : she pride have suffer more than she feeling -- she imagination have be more deceive than she judgment -- and although too well breed and soft by nature to become rude or captious she be change from a communicative to a reserve from a confide to a suspicious companion she parent notice this alteration with a uneasiness that be somewhat embittered by the consciousness of a neglect of some of those duty that experience now seem to indicate could never be forget with impunity franci and clara have arrive from they northern tour so happy in each other and so contented with they lot that it require some little exercise of fortitude in both lady moseley and she daughter to expel unpleasant recollection while they contemplate it they relation of the little incident of they tour have however a effect to withdraw the attention of they friend in some degree from late occurrence and a melancholy and sympathizing kind of association have take place of the unbounded confidence and gaiety which so lately prevail at benfield lodge mr benfield mingle with he solemnity a air of mystery and he be frequently notice by he relative look over old papers and be apparently employ in preparation that indicate movement of more than usual importance the family be collect in one of the parlor on a extremely unpleasant day the fourth after the departure of john when the thin person of johnson stalk in amongst they all eye be fix on he in expectation of what he have to communicate and all apparently dread to break the silence from a apprehension that he communication would be unpleasant in the meantime peter who have respectfully leave he hat at the door proceed to uncase he body from the multiply defence he have take against the inclemency of the weather he master stand erect with a outstretched hand ready to receive the reply to he epistle and johnson have liberate he body from thraldom produce the black leathern pocket-book and from its contents a letter when he read aloud -- roderic benfield esq benfield lodge norfolk favor by mr -- here peter 's modesty get the better of he method he have never be call mr johnson by anybody old or young all know he in that neighborhood as peter johnson -- and he have very nearly be guilty of the temerity of arrogate to himself another title in the presence of those he most respect : a degree of self-elevation from which he escape with the loss of a small piece of he tongue mr benfield take the letter with a eagerness that plainly indicate the deep interest he take in its contents while emily with a tremulous voice and flush cheek approach the steward with a glass of wine peter she say take this it will do you good thank you miss emma say peter cast he eye from she to he master as the latter have finish he letter exclaim with a strange mixture of consideration and disappointment -- johnson you must change you clothes immediately or you will take cold : you look now like old mose the jew beggar peter sigh heavily at this comparison and saw in it a confirmation of he fear for he well know that to he be the bearer of unpleasant tiding be he indebted for a resemblance to anything unpleasant to he master and mose be the old gentleman 's aversion the baronet now follow he uncle from the room to he library enter it at the same moment with the steward who have be summon by he master to a audience point to a chair for he nephew mr benfield commence the discourse with say peter you see mr denbigh how do he look as usual master say peter laconically still pique at be liken to old mose and what do he say to the offer do he not make any comment on it he be not offend at it i hope demand mr benfield he say nothing but what he have write to you honor reply the steward lose a little of he constrain manner in real good feeling to he master may i ask what the offer be inquire sir edward mr benfield regard he a moment in silence say certainly you be nearly concern in he welfare you daughter -- the old man stop turn to he letter-book and hand the baronet a copy of the epistle he have send to denbigh it read as follow : dear friend mr denbigh i have think a great deal on the reason of you sudden departure from a house i have begin to hope you think you own and by call to mind my own feeling when lady juliana become the heiress to she nephew 's estate take it for grant you have be govern by the same sentiment which i know both by my own experience and that of the bearer peter johnson be a never-failing accompaniment of pure affection yes my dear denbigh i honor you delicacy in not wish to become indebted to a stranger as it be for the money on which you subsist and that stranger you wife -- who ought in reason to look up to you instead of you look up to she which be the true cause lord gosford would not marry the countess -- on account of she great wealth as he assure I himself notwithstanding envious people say it be because she ladyship love mr chaworth better : so in order to remove these impediment of delicacy i have to make three proposition namely that i bring you into parliament the next election for my own borough -- that you take possession of the lodge the day you marry emmy while i will live for the little time i have to stay here in the large cottage build by my uncle -- and that i give you you legacy of ten thousand pound down to prevent trouble hereafter as i know nothing but delicacy have drive you away from we i make no doubt you will now find all objection remove and that peter will bring back the joyful intelligence of you return to we as soon as the business you leave we on be complete you uncle that be to be roderic benfield nb as johnson be a stranger to the way of the town i wish you to advise he inexperience particularly against the art of design woman peter be a man of considerable estate and great modesty there nephew cry mr benfield as the baronet finish read the letter aloud be it not unreasonable to refuse my offer now read he answer word be want to express the sensation which have be excite by mr benfield 's letter but it would be impossible for any man to be so base as to avail himself of such liberality : the recollection of it together with that of he many virtue will long continue deeply impressed on the heart of he whom mr benfield would if within the power of man render the happiest amongst human being the steward listen eagerly to this answer but after it be do he be as much at a loss to know its contents as before its perusal he know it be unfavorable to they wish but could not comprehend its meaning or expression and immediately attribute they ambiguity to the strange conference he have witness between denbigh and the military stranger master exclaim peter with something of the elation of a discoverer i know the cause it show itself in the letter : there be a man talk greek to he while he be read you letter greek exclaimed sir edward in astonishment greek say the uncle lord gosford read greek but i believe never converse in that language yes sir edward -- yes you honor -- pure wild greek it must have be something of that kind add peter with positiveness that would make a man refuse such offer -- miss emmy -- the lodge -- # 10000 -- and the steward shake he head with much satisfaction at have discover the cause sir edward smile at the simplicity of johnson but dislike the idea attach to the refusal of he daughter say perhaps after all uncle there have be some misunderstanding between emily and denbigh which may have drive he from we so suddenly mr benfield and he steward exchange look and a new idea break upon they at the instant they have both suffer in that way and after all it might prove that emily be the one whose taste or feeling have subvert they scheme the impression once make soon become strong and the party separate the master think alternately on lady juliana and he niece while the man after heave one heavy sigh to the memory of patty steele proceed to the usual occupation of he office mr wilson think a ride would be of service to emily and have the fullest confidence in she self-command and resignation avail herself of a fine day to pay a visit to they friend in the cottage mr fitzgerald receive they in she usual manner but a single glance of she eye suffice to show the aunt that she notice the altered appearance of emily and she manners although without know its true reason which she do not deem it prudent to explain julium hand she friend a note which she say she have receive the day before and desire they counsel how to proceed in the present emergency as emily be to be make acquaint with its contents she aunt read it aloud as follow : my dear niece you father and myself have be induce to think you be lead a disgraceful life with the officer you husband have consign you to the care of for hearing of you captivity i have arrive with a band of guerilla on the spot where you be rescue early the next morning and there learn of the peasant you misfortune and retreat the enemy press we too much to allow we to deviate from we route at the time but natural affection and the wish of you father have lead I to make a journey to england in order to satisfy we doubt as regard you conduct i have see you hear you character in the neighborhood and after much and long search have find out the officer and be satisfied that so far as concern you deportment you be a injured woman i have therefore to propose to you on my own behalf and that of the conde that you adopt the faith of you country and return with I to the arm of you parent whose heiress you will be and whose life you may be the means of prolong direct you answer to I to the care of we ambassador and as you decide i be you mother 's brother loui m ` carthy y harrison on what point do you wish my advice say mr wilson kindly after she have finish read the letter and when do you expect to see you uncle would you have I accept the offer of my father dear madam or be i to remain separated from he for the short residue of he life mr fitzgerald be affect to tear as she ask this question and wait she answer in silent dread of its nature be the condition of a change of religion a immovable one inquire mr wilson in a thoughtful manner oh doubtless reply julium shuddering but i be deservedly punish for my early disobedience and bow in submission to the will of providence i feel now all that horror of a change of my religion i once only affected i must live and die a protestant madam certainly i hope so my dear say mr wilson i be not a bigot and think it unfortunate you be not in you circumstance breed a pious catholic it would have save you much misery and might have render the close of you father 's life more happy but as you present creed embrace doctrine too much at variance with the romish church to renounce the one or to adopt the other with you view it will be impossible to change you church without commit a heavy offence against the opinion and practice of every denomination of christian i should hope a proper representation of this to you uncle would have its weight or they might be satisfy with you be a christian without become a catholic ah my dear madam answer mr fitzgerald despairingly you little know the opinion of my countryman on this subject surely surely cry mr wilson parental affection be a stronger feeling than bigotry mr fitzgerald shake she head in a manner which bespeak both she apprehension and she filial regard julium ought not must not desert she father dear aunt say emily she face glowing with the ardency of she feeling and ought she to desert she heavenly father my child ask the aunt mildly be the duty conflict dearest aunt the conde make they so julium be i trust in sincerity a christian and with what face can she offer up she daily petition to she creator while she wear a mask to she earthly father or how can she profess to honor doctrine that she herself believe to be false or practice custom she think improper never never exclaim julium with fervor the struggle be dreadful but i submit to the greater duty and you decide rightly my friend say mr wilson soothingly but you need relax no effort to convince the conde of you wish : truth and nature will finally conquer ah cry mr fitzgerald the sad consequence of one false step in early life rather add mr wilson the sad consequence of one false step in generation go by have you grandmother listen to the voice of prudence and duty she never would have desert she parent for a comparative stranger and entail upon she descendant a train of evil which yet exist in you person it will be a sad blow to my poor uncle too say mr fitzgerald he who once love I so much when do you expect to see he inquire emily julium inform they she expect he hourly as fearful a write statement of she view would drive he from the country without pay she a visit before he depart she have earnestly entreat he to see she without delay on take they leave the lady promise to obey she summons whenever call to meet the general as mr wilson think she might be better able to give advice to a friend by know more of the character of she relative than she could do with she present information one day intervene and it be spend in the united society of lady moseley and she daughter while sir edward and franci ride to a neighboring town on business and on the succeed mr fitzgerald apprise they of the arrival of general m ` carthy immediately after breakfast mr wilson and emily drive to the cottage the aunt both wish the latter as a companion in she ride and believe the excitement would have a tendency to prevent she niece from indulge in reflection alike dangerous to she peace of mind and at variance with she duty we reader have probably anticipate that the stage companion of john moseley be the spanish general who have just be make those inquiry into the manner of he niece 's living which terminate so happily in she acquittal with that part of she history which relate to the injurious attempt on she before she arrive at lisbon he appear to have be ignorant or he interview with denbigh might have terminate very differently from the manner already relate a description of the appearance of the gentleman present to mr wilson be unnecessary as it have be give already and the discerning matron think she read through the rigid and set feature of the soldier a shade of kinder feeling which might be work into a advantageous intercession on behalf of julium the general be evidently endeavor to keep he feeling within due bound before the decision of he niece might render it proper for he to indulge in that affection for she which he eye plainly show exist under the cover of he assumed manner it be a effort of great fortitude on the part of julium to acquaint she uncle with she resolution but as it must be do she seize a moment after mr wilson have at some length defend she adhering to she present faith until religiously impress with its error to inform he such be she unalterable resolution he hear she patiently and without anger but in visible surprise he have construe she summons to she house into a measure preparatory to accept he condition yet he betray no emotion after the first expression of he wonder : he tell she distinctly a renunciation of she heresy be the only condition on which she father would own she either as he heiress or he child julium deeply regret the decision but be firm and she friend leave she to enjoy uninterruptedly for one day the society of so near a relative during this day every doubt as to the propriety of she conduct if any yet remain be remove by a relation of she little story to she uncle and after it be complete he express great uneasiness to get to london again in order to meet a gentleman he have see there under a different impression as to he merit than what now appear to be just who the gentleman be or what these impression be

himself have he own engagement but he promise to be there in company with he friend derwent within a fortnight the former visit have be postpone by the marriage in they respective family john have be assiduous in he attention during the season of forced gaiety which follow the nuptials of kate and as the dowager 's time be monopolize with the ceremonial of that event grace have rise greatly in he estimation if grace chatterton be not more miserable than usual at what she think be the destruction of she sister 's happiness it be owe to the presence and unconcealed affection of john moseley the carriage of lord herriefield be in wait when john ring for admittance on open the door and enter the drawing-room he see the bride and bridegroom with they mother and sister accoutr for a excursion amongst the shop of bond street : for kate be die to find a vent for some of she surplus pin-money -- she husband to show he handsome wife in the face of the world -- the mother to display the triumph of she matrimonial scheme and grace be force to obey she mother 's command in accompany she sister as a attendant not to be dispense with at all in she circumstance the entrance of john at that

be it possible i have be take in after all grace be unused to resist she mother 's command and throw off she hat and shawl reseat herself with more composure than she would probably have do have not the attention of moseley be more delicate and pointed of late than formerly as they pass the porter lady chatterton observe to he significantly -- nobody at home willi -- yes my lady be the laconic reply and lord herriefield as he take he seat by the side of he wife in the carriage think she be not as handsome as usual lady chatterton that morning unguardedly lay the foundation of year of misery for she eldest daughter or rather the foundation be already lay in the ill-assorted and heartless unprincipled union she have labor with success to effect but she have that morning strip the mask from she own character prematurely and excite suspicion in the breast of she son-in-law which time only serve to confirm and memory to brood over lord herriefield have be too long in the world not to understand all the ordinary art of match-maker and match-hunter like most of he own sex who have associate freely with the worst part of the other he opinion of female excellence be by no means extravagant or romantic kate have please he eye she be of a noble family young and at that moment interestingly quiet have nothing particularly in view she have a taste of she own and lord herriefield be by no means in conformity with it consequently she expend none of those pretty little art upon he which she occasionally practice and which he experience would immediately have detect she disgust he have attribute to disinterestedness and as kate have fix she eye on a young officer lately return from france and she mother on a duke who be mourn the death of a third wife devise means to console he with a fourth -- the viscount have get a good deal enamor with the lady before either she or she mother take any particular notice that there be such a be in existence he title be not the most elevated but it be ancient he paternal acre be not numerous but he east-india share be he be not very young but he be not very old and as the duke die of a fit of the gout in he stomach and the officer run away with a girl in she teens from a boarding-school the dowager and she daughter after thoroughly scan the fashionable world determine for want of a better that _ he _ would do it be not to be suppose that the mother and child hold any open communication with each other to this effect the delicacy and pride of both would have be greatly injure by such a suspicion yet they arrive simultaneously at the same conclusion as well as at another of equal importance to the completion of they scheme on the viscount it be simply to adhere to the same conduct which have make he a captive as most likely to insure the victory there be such a general understanding between the two it can excite no surprise that they co-operate harmoniously as it be by signal for two people correctly impress with they duty and responsibility to arrive at the same conclusion in the government of they conduct would be merely a matter of course and so with those who be more or less under the dominion of the world they will pursue they plan with a degree of concurrence amounting nearly to sympathy and thus have kate and she mother until this morning keep up the masquerade so well that the viscount be as confide as a country corydon when he first witness the dowager 's management with grace and john however and he wife 's careless disregard of a thing which appear too much a matter of course to be quite agreeable he newly awaken distrust approach conviction grace chatterton both sing and play exquisitely it be however seldom she could sufficiently overcome she desire when john be a auditor

self-command immediately she rise and take a seat on a sofa and the young man be immediately at she side ah grace say john the lady 's heart beat high you certainly do sing as you do everything

much in feature and what be better still in character i could wish say grace venture to look up to resemble you sister emily in the latter and why not to be she sister dear grace say he with ardor you be worthy to become she sister tell I grace dear miss chatterton -- can you -- will you make I the happiest of man may i present another inestimable daughter to my parent as john pause for a answer grace look up and he wait she reply in evident anxiety but she continue silent now pale as death and now of the color of the rose and he add : i hope i have not offend you dearest grace you be all that be desirable to I my hope my happiness be centre in you unless you consent to become my wife i must be very wretched grace burst into a flood of tear as she lover interested deeply in they cause gently draw she towards he she head sink on he shoulder as she faintly whisper something that be inaudible but which he do not fail to interpret into everything he most wish to hear john be in ecstasy every unpleasant feeling of suspicion have leave he of grace 's innocence of manoeuvring he never doubt but john do not relish the idea of be entrap into anything even a step which he desire a uninterrupted communication follow it be as confide as they affection : and the return of the dowager and she child first recall they to the recollection of other people one glance of the eye be enough for lady chatterton she see the trace of tear on the cheek and in the eye of grace and the dowager be satisfied she know he friend would not object and as grace attend she to she dressing-room she cry on enter it well child when be the wedding to be you will wear I out with so much gaiety grace be shock but do not as formerly weep over she mother 's interference in agony and dread john have

or unable to comprehend some part of its contents until he ring the bell violently and bid the servant to send johnson to he without a moment 's delay peter say mr benfield doubtingly read that -- you eye be young peter read that peter take the paper and after have adjust he spectacles to he satisfaction he proceed to obey he master 's injunction but the same defect of vision as suddenly seize the steward as it have affect he master he turn the paper sideways and appear to be spell the matter of the paragraph to himself peter would have give he three hundred a year to have have the impatient john moseley a hand to relieve he from he task but the anxiety of mr benfield overcome he fear of the worst he inquire in tremulous tone -- peter hem peter what do you think why you honor reply the steward steal a look at he master it do seem so indeed i remember say the master when lord gosford see the marriage of the countess announce he -- here the old gentleman be oblige to stop and rise with dignity and lean on the arm of he faithful servant he leave the room mr wilson immediately take up the paper and she eye catch the paragraph at a glance she read aloud as follow to she expect friend : marry by special license at the seat of the most noble the marquess of eltringham in devonshire by the right rev lord bishop of -- george denbigh esq lieutenant colonel of he majesty 's -- regiment of dragoon to the right honorable lady laura stapleton eldest sister of the marquess eltringham be honor on the present happy occasion with the presence of he grace of derwent and the gallant lord pendennyss kinsman of the bridegroom and captain lord henry stapleton of the royal navy we understand that the happy couple proceed to denbigh castle immediately after the honey-moon although mr wilson have give up the expectation of ever see she niece the wife of denbigh she feel a indescribable shock as she read this paragraph the strongest feeling be horror at the danger emily have be in of contract a alliance with such a man he avoid the ball at which he know lord henry be expect be explain to she by this marriage for with john she could not believe a woman like lady laura stapleton be to be win in the short space of one fortnight or indeed less there be too evidently a mystery yet to be develop and she feel certain one that would not elevate he character in she opinion neither sir edward nor lady moseley have give up the expectation of see denbigh again as a suitor for emily 's hand and to both of they this certainty of he loss be a heavy blow the baronet take up the paper and after peruse the article he mutter in a low tone as he wipe the tear from he eye heaven bless he : i sincerely hope she be worthy of he worthy of he think mr wilson with a feeling of indignation as take up the paper she retire to she own room whither emily at that moment return from she walk have proceed as she niece must hear this news she think the sooner the better the exercise and the unreserved conversation of franci and clara have restore in some degree the bloom to the cheek of emily and mr wilson feel it necessary to struggle with herself before she could summon sufficient resolution to invade the return peace of she charge however have already decide on she course she proceed to the discharge of what she think to be a duty emily my child she whisper press she affectionately to she bosom you have be all i could wish and more than i expect under you arduous struggle but one more pang and i trust you recollection on this painful subject will be do away emily look at she aunt in anxious expectation of what be come and quietly take the paper follow the direction of mr wilson 's finger to the article on the marriage of denbigh there be a momentary struggle in emily for self-command she be oblige to find support in a chair the return richness of color excite by she walk vanish but recover herself she press the hand of she anxious guardian and gently wave she back proceed to she own room on she return to the company the same control of she feeling which have distinguish she conduct of late be again visible and although she aunt most narrowly watch she movement look and speech she could discern no visible alteration by this confirmation of misconduct the truth be that in emily moseley the obligation of duty be so imperative she sense of she dependence on providence so humbling and yet so confide that as soon as she be teach to believe she lover unworthy of she esteem that moment a insuperable barrier separate they he marriage could add nothing to the distance between they it be impossible they could be unite and although a secret linger of the affection over he fallen character might and do exist it exist without any romantic expectation of miracle in he favor or vain wish of reformation in which self be the prominent feeling she might be say to be keenly alive to all that concerned he welfare or movement if she do not harbor the passion of love but it show itself in prayer for he amendment of life and the most ardent petition for he future and eternal happiness she have set about seriously and with much energy the task of erase from she heart sentiment which however delightful she have find it to entertain in time past be now in direct variance with she duty she know that a weak indulgence of such passion would tend to draw she mind from and disqualify she to discharge those various call on she time and she exertion which could alone enable she to assist other or effect in she own person the great purpose of she creation it be never lose sight of by emily moseley that she existence here be preparatory to a immensely more important state hereafter she be consequently in charity with all mankind and if grow a little more distrustful of the intention of she fellow-creature it be a mistrust bottom in a clear view of the frailty of we nature and self-examination be amongst the not unfrequent speculation she make on this hasty marriage of she former lover mr wilson see all this and be soon make acquaint by she niece in term with she view of she own condition and although she have to and do deeply regret that all she caution have not be able to guard against deception where it be most important for she to guide aright yet she be cheer with the reflection that she previous care with the blessing of providence have admirably fit she charge to combat and overcome the consequence of they mistaken confidence the gloom which this little paragraph excited extend to every individual in the family for all have place denbigh by the side of john in they affection ever since he weighty service to emily a letter from john announce he intention of meet they at bath as well as he new relation with grace relieve in some measure this general depression of spirit mr benfield alone find no consolation in the approach nuptials john he regard as he nephew and grace he think a very good sort of young woman but neither of they be being of the same genus with emily and denbigh peter say he one day after they have both be expend they ingenuity in vain effort to discover the cause of this so-much-desired marriage 's be so unexpectedly frustrated have i not often tell you that fate govern these thing in order that man might be humble in this life now peter have the lady juliana wed with a mind congenial to she own she might have be mistress of benfield lodge to this very hour yes you honor -- but there be miss emmy 's legacy and peter withdraw think what would have be the consequence have patty steele be more willing when he wish to make she mr peter johnson -- a association by no means uncommon in the mind of the steward for if patty have ever a rival in he affection it be in the person of emily moseley though indeed with very different degree and coloring of esteem the excursion to the cottage have be continue by mr wilson and emily and as no gentleman be now in the family to interfere with they communication a general visit to the young widow have be make by the moseley include sir edward and mr ive the jarvise have go to london to receive they child now penitent in more

greatly disappoint by this deprivation of what they consider they lawful splendor but they find great consolation in the new dignity of lady egerton whose greatest wish now be to meet the moseley in order that she might precede they in or out of some place where such ceremonial be observe the sound of lady egerton 's carriage stop the way be delightful and it never fail to be use on all occasion although she ladyship be mistress of only a hire vehicle a slight insight into the situation of thing amongst they may be find in the follow narrative of they view as reveal in a discussion which take place about a fortnight after the reunion of the family under one roof mr jarvi be mistress of a very handsome coach the gift of she husband for she own private use after have satisfy herself the baronet -lrb- a dignity he have enjoy just twenty-four hour -rrb- do not possess the ability to furnish he lady as she term she daughter with such a luxury she magnanimously determine to relinquish

distinction lady jarvi be astounded with she vicinity to so much nobility and she draw back to she family to study its movement to advantage while lady chatterton sigh heavily as she contemplate the fine figure of a unmarried duke and marquess and she without a single child to dispose of the remainder of the party continue to view they with curiosity and listen with interest to what they say two or three young lady have now join the stranger attend by a couple of gentleman and the conversation become general the lady decline dancing entirely but appear willing to throw away a hour in comment on they neighbor william say one of the young lady there be you old messmate col egerton yes i observe he reply she brother i see he but smile significantly he continue we be messmate no longer he be a sad character say the marquess with a shrug william i would advise you to be cautious of he acquaintance i thank you reply lord william but i believe i understand he thoroughly jane manifest strong emotion during these remark while sir edward and he wife avert they face from a simultaneous feeling of self-reproach they eye meet and mutual concession be contain in the glance yet they feeling be unnoticed by they companion for over the fulfilment of she often repeat forewarning of neglect and duty to we child mr wilson have mourn in sincerity but she have forget to triumph when be we to see pendennyss inquire the marquess i hope he will be here with george -- i have a mind to beat up he quarter in wale this season -- what say you derwent i intend it if i can persuade lady harriet to quit the gaiety of bath so soon -- what say _ you _ sister -- will you be in readiness to attend I so early this question be ask in a arch tone and draw the eye of she friend on the person to whom it be address i be ready now frederick if you wish it answer the sister hastily and color excessively as she speak but where be chatterton i think he be here -- he have a sister marry here last week inquire lord william stapleton address no one in particular a slight movement in they neighbor attract the attention of the party what a lovely young woman whisper the duke to lady laura you neighbor be the lady smile she assent and as emily overhear it she rise with glowing cheek and propose a walk round the room chatterton soon after enter the young peer have acknowledge to emily that deprive of hope as he have be by she firm refusal of he hand he effort have be direct to the suppression of a passion which could never be successful but he esteem he respect remain in full force he do not touch at all on the subject of denbigh and she suppose that he think he marriage be a step that require justification the moseley have commence they promenade round the room as chatterton come in he pay he compliment to they as soon as he enter and walk with they party the noble visitor follow they example and the two party meet chatterton be delighted to see they the duke be particularly fond of he and have one be present of sufficient observation the agitation of he sister the lady harriet denbigh would have account for the doubt of she brother as respects she willingness to leave bath a few word of explanation pass the duke and he friend appear to urge something on chatterton who act as they ambassador and the consequence be a introduction of the two party to each other this be conduct with the ease of the present fashion -- it be general and occur as it be incidentally in the course of the evening both lady harriet and lady laura denbigh be particularly attentive to emily they take they seat by she and manifest a preference for she conversation that strike mr wilson as remarkable could it be that the really attractive manners and beauty of she niece have catch the fancy of these lady or be there a deeper seat cause for the desire to draw emily out that both of they evince mr wilson have hear a rumor that chatterton be think attentive to lady harriet and the other be the wife of denbigh be it possible the quondam suitor of she niece have relate to they present favorite the situation they have stand in as regard emily it be odd to say no more and the widow dwelt on the innocent countenance of the bride with pity and admiration emily herself be not a little abashed at the notice of she new acquaintance especially lady laura 's but as they admiration appear sincere as well as they desire to be on term of intimacy with the moseley they part on the whole mutually pleased the conversation several time be embarrassing to the baronet 's family and at moment distressingly so to they daughter at the close of the evening they all form one group at a little distance from the rest of the company and in a situation to command a view of it who be that vulgar-looking woman say lady sarah stapleton seat next to sir henry egerton brother no less a personage than my lady jarvi reply the marquess gravely and the mother-in-law of sir harry and the wife to sir timo -- this be say with a look of drollery that show the marquess be a bit of a quiz marry cry lord william mercy on the woman who be egerton 's wife he be the greatest latitudinarian amongst the lady of any man in england -- nothing -- no nothing would tempt I to let such a man marry a sister of mine ah think mr wilson how we may be deceive in character with the best intention after all in what be the open vice of egerton worse than the more hidden one of denbigh these freely express opinion on the character of sir henry be excessively awkward to some of the listener to whom they be connect with unpleasant recollection of duty neglect and affection throw away sir edward moseley be not dispose to judge he fellow-creature harshly and it be as much owe to he philanthropy as to he indolence that he have be so remiss in he attention to the associate of he daughter but the veil once remove and the consequence bring home to he through he child no man be more alive to the necessity of caution on this important particular and sir edward form many salutary resolution for the government of he future conduct in relation to those whom a experience nearly fatal in its result have now greatly qualify to take care of themselves but to resume we narrative -- lady laura have maintain with emily a conversation which be enliven by occasional remark from the rest of the party in the course of which the nerve as well as the principle of emily be put to a severe trial my brother henry say lady laura who be a captain in the navy once have the pleasure of see you miss moseley and in some measure make I acquaint with you before we meet i dine with lord henry at l -- and be much indebted to he polite attention in a excursion on the water reply emily simply oh i be sure he attention be exclusive cry the sister indeed he tell we that nothing but want of time prevent he be deeply in love -- he have even the audacity to tell denbigh it be fortunate for I he have never see you or i should have be leave to lead ape and i suppose you believe he now cry lord william laughing as he bow to emily he sister laugh in she turn but shake she head in the confidence of conjugal affection it be all conjecture for the colonel say he have never enjoy the pleasure of meeting miss moseley so i will not boast of what my power might have do miss moseley continue lady laura blush slightly at she inclination to talk of a absent husband so lately she lover i hope to have the pleasure of present colonel denbigh to you soon i think say emily with a strong horror of deception and a mighty struggle to suppress she feeling colonel denbigh be mistake in say that we have never meet he be of material service to I once and i owe he a debt of gratitude that i only wish i could properly repay lady laura listen in surprise but as emily pause she could not delicately as he wife remind she further of the obligation by ask what the service be and hesitate a moment continue -- henry quite make you the subject of conversation amongst we lord chatterton too who visit we for a day be equally warm in he eulogium i really think they create a curiosity in the duke and pendennyss to behold they idol a curiosity that would be ill reward in its indulgence say emily abashed by the personality of the discourse so say the modesty of miss moseley say the duke of derwent in the peculiar tone which distinguish the softer key of denbigh 's voice emily 's heart beat quick as she hear they and she be afterwards vex to remember with how much pleasure she have listen to this opinion of the duke be it the sentiment or be it the voice she however gather strength to answer with a dignity that repress further praise : -- you grace be willing to divest I of what little i possess pendennyss be a man of a thousand continue lady laura with the privilege of a married woman i do wish he would join we at bath -- be there no hope duke i be afraid not reply he grace : he keep himself immure in wale with he sister who be as much of a hermit as he be himself there be a story of a inamorata in private somewhere cry the marquess why at one time it be even say he be privately marry to she scandal my lord say the duke gravely : pendennyss be of unexceptionable moral and the lady you mean be the widow of major fitzgerald whom you know pendennyss never see she though by accident he be once of very great service to she mr wilson breathe freely again as she hear this explanation and think if the marquess know all how differently would he judge pendennyss as well as other oh i have the highest opinion of lord pendennyss cry the marquess the moseley be not sorry that the usual hour of retire put a end to the conversation and they embarrassment chapter xxxiv during the succeed fortnight the intercourse between the moseley and they new acquaintance increase daily it be rather awkward at first on the part of emily and she beating pulse and change color too often show the alarm of feeling not yet overcome when any allusion be make to the absent husband of one of the lady still as she parent encourage the acquaintance and she aunt think the best way to get rid of the remain weakness with respect to denbigh be not to shrink from even a interview with the gentleman himself emily succeed in conquer she reluctance and as the high opinion entertain by lady laura of she husband be express in a thousand artless way a interest be create in she that promise in time to weaken if not destroy the impression that have be make by denbigh himself on the other hand egerton carefully avoid all collision with the moseley once indeed he endeavor to renew he acquaintance with john but a haughty repulse almost produce a quarrel what representation egerton have think proper to make to he wife we be unable to say but she appear to resent something as she never approach the dwelling or person of she quondam associate although in she heart she be die to be on term of intimacy with they title friend she incorrigible mother be restrain by no such or any other consideration and contrived to fasten on the dowager and lady harriet a kind of bow acquaintance which she make great use of at the room the duke seek out the society of emily wherever he could obtain it and mr wilson think she niece admit he approach with less reluctance than that of any other of the gentleman around she at first she be surprised but a closer observation betray to she the latent cause derwent resemble denbigh greatly in person and voice although there be distinction easily to be make on a acquaintance the duke have a air of command and hauteur that be never to be see in he cousin but he admiration of emily he do not attempt to conceal and as he ever address she in the respectful language and identical voice of denbigh the observant widow easily perceive that it be the remains of she attachment to the one that induce she niece to listen with such evident pleasure to the conversation of the other the duke of derwent want many of the indispensable requisite of a husband in the eye of mr wilson yet as she think emily out of all danger at the present of any new attachment she admit the association under no other restraint than the uniform propriety of all that emily say or do you niece will one day be a duchess mr wilson whisper lady laura as derwent and emily be run over a new poem one morning in the lodgings of sir edward the former read a fine extract aloud so strikingly in the air and voice of denbigh as to call all the animation of the unconscious emily into she expressive face mr wilson sigh as she reflect on the strength of those feeling which even principle and testimony have not be able wholly to subdue as she answer -- not of derwent i believe but how wonderfully the duke resemble you husband at time she add entirely throw off she guard lady laura be evidently surprised yes at time he do they be brother ' child you know : the voice in all that connexion be remarkable pendennyss though a degree further off in blood possess it and lady harriet you perceive have the same characteristic there have be some syren in the family in day past sir edward and lady moseley see the attention of the duke with the greatest pleasure though not slave to the ambition of wealth and rank they be certainly no objection in they eye and a proper suitor lady moseley think the most probable means of drive the recollection of denbigh from the mind of she daughter the latter consideration have great weight in induce she to cultivate

fancy of you lordship be say mr wilson willing to gratify the trifling what kind of a woman do you mean to choose how tall for instance why madam cry the marquess rather unprepared for such a

a attack be a little at a loss for a answer but recover himself answer gravely under the apprehension of another design on he person that he do think that would be forget he duty to he descendant lady jarvi sigh and fall back in disappointment while miss harri turn to the nobleman in a soft voice desire he to ring for she carriage as he hand she down she venture to inquire if he lordship have ever

of experience in she trade and be expert from the first john -- john say sir edward with warmth sir william be my friend and he daughter must be respect then baronet cry the marquess she have one recommendation i be ignorant of and as such i be silent : but ought not sir william to teach he daughter to respect herself i view these husband-hunting lady as pirate on the ocean of love and lawful object for any rove cruiser like myself to fire at at one time i be simple enough to retire as they advance but you know madam turn to mr wilson with a droll look flight only encourage pursuit so i now give battle in self-defence and i hope successfully my lord observe the lady miss harri brother do appear to have grow desperate in she attack which be formerly much more mask than at present i believe it be generally the case when a young worman throw aside the delicacy and feeling which ought to be the characteristic of she sex and which teach she studiously to conceal she admiration that she either become in time cynical and disagreeable to all around she from disappointment or persevere in she effort as it be run a muck for a husband now in justice to the gentleman i must say baronet there be strong symptom of the malay about caroline harri a muck a muck cry the marquess as in obedience to the signal of he sister he rise to withdraw jane have retire to she own room in a mortification of spirit she could ill conceal during this conversation and she feel a degree of humiliation which almost drive she to the desperate resolution of hide herself for ever from the world the man she have so fondly enshrine in she heart prove to be so notoriously unworthy as to be the subject of unreserved censure in general company be a reproach to she delicacy she observation she judgment that be the more severe from be true and she weep in bitterness over she fall happiness emily have notice the movement of jane and wait anxiously for the departure of the visitor to hasten to she room she knock two or three time before she sister reply to she request for admittance jane my dear jane say emily soothingly will you not admit I jane could not resist any longer the affection of she sister and the door be open but as emily endeavor to take she hand she draw back coldly and cry -- i wonder you who be so happy will leave the gay scene below for the society of a humble wretch like I and overcome with the violence of she emotion she burst into tear happy repeat emily in a tone of anguish happy do you say jane oh little do you know my suffering or you would never speak so cruelly jane in she turn surprise at the strength of emily 's language consider she weep sister with commiseration and then she thought recur to she own case she continue with energy -- yes emily happy for whatever may have be the reason of denbigh 's conduct he be respect and if you do or do love he he be worthy of it but i say jane wildly throw away my affection on a wretch -- _ a mere impostor _ -- and i be miserable for ever no dear jane rejoin emily have recover she self-possession not miserable -- nor for ever you have many very many source of happiness yet within you reach even in this world i -- i do think even we strongest attachment may be overcome by energy and a sense of duty and oh how i wish i could see you make the effort for a moment the voice of the youthful moralist have fail she but anxiety in behalf of she sister overcome she feeling and she end the sentence with earnestness emily say jane with obstinacy and yet in tear you do not know what blighted affection be to endure the scorn of the world and see the man you once think near be you husband marry to another who be show herself in triumph before you wherever you go hear I jane before you reproach I further and then judge between we emily pause a moment to acquire nerve to proceed and then related to she astonished sister the little history of she own disappointment she do not affect to conceal she attachment for denbigh with glowing cheek she acknowledge that she find a necessity for all she effort to keep she rebellious feeling yet in subjection and as she recount generally he conduct to mr fitzgerald she conclude by say but jane i can see enough to call forth my gratitude and although with yourself i feel at this moment as if my affection be seal for ever i wish to make no hasty resolution nor act in any manner as if i be unworthy of the lot providence have assign I unworthy no -- you have no reason for self-reproach if mr denbigh have have the art to conceal he crime from you he do it to the rest of the world also and have marry a woman of rank and character but how differently be we situate emily -- i -- i have no such consolation you have the consolation my sister of know there be a interest make for you where we all require it most and it be there i endeavor to seek my support say emily in a low and humble tone a review of we own error take away the keenness of we perception of the wrong do we and by place we in charity with the rest of the world dispose we to enjoy calmly the blessing within we reach besides jane we have parent whose happiness be lock up in that of they child and we should -- we must overcome the feeling which disqualify we for we common duty on they account ah cry jane how can i move about in the world while i know the eye of all be on I in curiosity to discover how i bear my disappointment but you emily be unsuspected it be easy for you to affect a gaiety you do not feel i neither affect nor feel any gaiety say she sister mildly but be there not the eye of one on we of infinitely more power to punish or reward than what may be find in the opinion of the world have we no duty for what be we wealth we knowledge we time give we but to improve for we own and for the eternal welfare of those around we come then my sister we have both be deceive -- let we endeavor not to be culpable i wish from my soul we could leave bath cry jane the place the people be hateful to I jane say emily rather say you hate they vice and wish for they amendment : but do not indiscriminately condemn a whole community for the wrong you have sustain from one of its member jane allow herself to be console though by no means convince by this effort of she sister and they both find a relief by thus unburden they heart to each other that in future bring they more nearly together and be of mutual assistance in support they in the promiscuous circle in which they be oblige to mix with all she fortitude and principle one of the last thing emily would have desire be a interview with denbigh and she be happily relieve from the present danger of it by the departure of lady laura and she brother to go to the residence of the colonel 's sick uncle both mr wilson and emily suspect that a dread of meet they have detain he from he intended journey to bath and neither be sorry to perceive what they consider as latent sign of grace -- a grace of which egerton appear entirely to be without he may yet see he error and make a kind and affectionate husband think emily and then as the image of denbigh rise in she imagination surround with the domestic virtue she rouse herself from the dangerous reflection to the exercise of the duty in which she find a refuge from unpardonable wish chapter xxxv nothing material occur for a fortnight after the departure of lady laura the moseley enter soberly into the amusement of the place and derwent and chatterton become more pointed every day in they attention -- the one to emily and the other to lady harriet when the dowager receive a press entreaty from catherine to hasten to she at lisbon where she husband have take up he abode for a time after much doubt and indecision as to he place of residence lady herriefield state generally in she letter that she be miserable and that without the support of she mother she could not exist under the present grievance but what be the cause of those grievance or what grounds she have for she misery she leave unexplained lady chatterton be not want in maternal regard and she promptly determine to proceed to portugal in the next packet john feel inclined for a little excursion with he bride and out of compassion to the baron who be in a dilemma between he duty and he love -lrb- for lady harriet about that time be particularly attractive -rrb- he offer he service chatterton allow himself to be persuade by the good-natured john that he mother could safely cross the ocean under the protection of the latter accordingly at the end of the before mention fortnight the dowager john grace and jane commence they journey to falmouth jane have offer to accompany grace as a companion in she return -lrb- it be expect lady chatterton would remain in the country with she daughter -rrb- and she parent appreciate she motive permit the excursion with a hope it would draw she thought from past event although grace shed a few tear at parting with emily and she friend it be impossible for mr moseley to be long unhappy with the face of john smile by she side and they pursue they route uninterruptedly in due season they reach the port of embarkation the follow morning the packet get under weigh and a favorable breeze soon waft they out of sight of they native shore the lady be too much indispose the first day to appear on the deck but the weather become calm and the sea smooth grace and jane venture out of the confinement of they state-room to respire the fresh air above there be but few passenger and those chiefly lady -- the wife of officer on foreign station on they way to join they husband as these have be accustom to move in the world they disposition to accommodate soon remove the awkwardness of a first meeting and we traveller begin to be at home in they novel situation while grace stand lean on the arm of she husband and cling to he support both from affection and a dread of the motion of the vessel jane venture with one of the lady to attempt a walk round the deck of the ship unaccustomed to such a uncertain foothold the walker be prevent fall by the kind interposition of a gentleman who for the first time have show himself among they at that moment the accident and they situation lead to a conversation which be renew at different time during they passage and in some measure create a intimacy between we party and the stranger he be address by the commander of the vessel as mr harland and lady chatterton exercise she ingenuity in the investigation of he history by which she make the follow discovery : the rev and hon mr harland be the younger son of a irish earl who have early embrace he sacred profession in that church in which he hold a valuable living in the gift of he father 's family he father be yet alive and then at lisbon with he mother and sister in attendance on he elder brother who have be send there in a deep decline a couple of month before it have be the wish of he parent to have take all they child with they but a sense of duty have keep the young clergyman in the exercise of he holy office until a request of he die brother and the direction of he father cause he to hasten abroad to witness the decease of the one and to afford all the solace within he power to the other it may be easily imagine that the discovery of the rank of they accidental acquaintance with the almost certainty that exist of he be the heir of he father 's honor in no degree impair he consequence in the eye of the dowager and it be certain he visible anxiety and depressed spirit he unaffected piety and disinterested hope for he brother 's recovery no less elevated he in the opinion of she companion there be at the moment a kind of sympathy between harland and jane notwithstanding the melancholy which give rise to it proceed from such very different cause and as the lady although with diminish bloom retain all she personal charm rather heighten than otherwise by the softness of low spirit the young clergyman sometimes relieve he apprehension of he brother 's death by admit the image of jane among he more melancholy reflection the voyage be tedious and some time before it be end the dowager have give grace a intimation of the probability there be of jane 's become at some future day a countess grace sincerely hope that whatever she become she would be as happy as she think all ally to john deserve to be they enter the bay of lisbon early in the morning and as the ship have be expect for some day a boat come alongside with a note for mr harland before they have anchor it apprise he of the death of he brother the young man throw himself precipitately into it and be soon employ in one of the loveliest office of he vocation that of healing the wound of the afflict lady herriefield receive she mother in a sort of sullen satisfaction and she companion with a awkwardness she could ill conceal it require no great observation in the traveller to discover that they arrival be entirely unexpected by the viscount if it be not equally disagreeable indeed one day 's residence under he roof assure they all that no great degree of domestic felicity be a inmate of the dwelling from the moment lord herriefield become suspicious that he have be the dupe of the management of kate and she mother he view every act of he wife with a prejudiced eye it be easy with he knowledge of human nature to detect she selfishness and worldly-mindedness for as these be fault she be unconscious of possess so she be unguarded in she exposure of they but she design in a matrimonial point of view have end with she marriage have the viscount treat she with any of the courtesy due she sex and station she might with she disposition have be contented in the enjoyment of rank and in the possession of wealth but they more private hour be invariably render unpleasant by the overflowing of she husband 's resentment at have be deceive in he judgment of the female sex there be no point upon which man be more tender than they privilege of suit themselves in a partner for life although many of both sex be influence in this important selection more by the wish and whim of other than be usually suspect yet as all imagine what be the result of contrivance and management be the election of free will and taste so long as they be ignorant they be contented lord herriefield want this bliss of ignorance and with contempt for he wife be mingled anger at he own want of foresight very few people can tamely submit to self-reproach and as the cause of this irritated state of mind be both not only constantly present but completely within he power the viscount seem determine to give she as little reason to exult in the success of she plan as possible jealous he be from temperament from bad association and a want of confidence in the principle of he wife the freedom of foreign manners have a additional tendency to excite this baneful passion to a unusual degree abridge in she pleasure reproach with motive she be incapable of harbor and disappoint in all those enjoyment she mother have ever lead she to believe the invariable accompaniment of married life where proper attention have be pay to the necessary qualification of riches and rank kate have write to the dowager with the hope she presence might restrain or she advice teach she successfully to oppose the unfeeling conduct of the viscount lady chatterton never have implant any of she favorite system in she daughter so much by precept as by the force of example in she own person as well as by indirect eulogium on certain people who be endow with those quality and blessing she most admire on the present occasion catherine do not unburden herself in term to she mother but by a regular gradation of complaint aim more at the world than at she husband she soon let the know dowager see they application and in the end completely remove the veil from she domestic grievance the example of john and grace for a short time awed the peer into dissemble he disgust for he spouse but the ice once break they presence soon cease to affect either the frequency or the severity of he remark when under its influence from such exhibition of matrimonial discord grace shrink timidly into the retirement of she room and jane with dignity would follow she example while john at time become a listener with a spirit barely curb within the bound of prudence and at other he seek in the company of he wife and sister relief from the violence of he feeling john never admire nor respected catherine for she want those very quality he chiefly love in she sister yet as she be a woman and one nearly connect with he he find it impossible to remain a quiet spectator of the unmanly treatment she often receive from she husband he therefore make preparation for he return to england by the first packet abridge he intended residence in lisbon more than a month lady chatterton endeavor all within she power to heal the breach between kate and she husband but it greatly exceed she ability it be too late to implant such principle in she daughter as by a long course of self-denial and submission might have win the love of the viscount have the mother be acquaint with they herself so that have induce she child to marry with a view to obtain precedence and a jointure she once more set to work to undo part of she former labor by bring about a decent separation between the husband and wife in such a manner as to secure to she child the possession of she wealth and the esteem of the world the latter though certainly a somewhat difficult undertaking be greatly lessen by the assistance of the former john and he wife determine to seize the opportunity to examine the environs of the city in one of these daily ride they meet they fellow traveller mr now lord harland he be rejoice to see they again and hearing of they intended departure inform they of he be about to return to england in the same vessel -- he parent and sister contemplate end the winter in portugal the intercourse between the two family be keep up with a show of civility between the nobleman and much real good-will on the part of the junior of the circle until the day arrive for the sailing of the packet lady chatterton be leave behind with catherine as yet unable to circumvent she scheme with prudence it be deem by the world a worse offence to separate than to join together one 's child in the band of wedlock the confinement of a vessel be very propitious to those intimacy which lead to attachment the necessity of be agreeable be a check upon the captious and the desire to lessen the dulness of the scene a stimulus to the lively and though the noble divine and jane could not possibly be rank in either class the effect be the same the noble man be much enamored and jane unconsciously gratify it be true love have never enter she thought in its direct and unequivocal form but admiration be so console to those labor under self-condemnation and flattery of a certain kind so very soothing to all it be not to be wonder that she listen with increase pleasure to the interesting conversation of harland on all occasion and more particularly as often happen when exclusively address to herself grace have of late reflect more seriously on the subject of she eternal welfare than she have be accustom to do in the house of she mother and the example of emily with the precept of mr wilson have not be throw away upon she it be a singular fact that more woman feel a disposition to religion soon after marriage than at any other period of life and whether it be that have attain the most important station this life afford the sex they be more willing to turn they thought to a provision for the next or whether it be owe to any other cause mr moseley be include in the number she become sensibly touch with she situation and as harland be both devout and able as well as anxious to instruct one of the party at least have cause to rejoice in the journey for the remainder of she day but precisely as grace increase in she own faith so do she anxiety after the welfare of she husband receive new excitement and john for the first time become the cause of sorrow to he affectionate companion the deep interest harland take in the opening conviction of mr moseley do not so entirely engross he thought as to prevent the too frequent contemplation of the charm of she friend for he own peace of mind and by the time the vessel reach falmouth he have determine to make a tender of he hand and title to the acceptance of miss moseley jane do not love egerton on the contrary she despise he but the time have be when all she romantic feeling every thought of she brilliant imagination have be fill with he image and jane feel it a species of indelicacy to admit the impression of another so soon or even at all these objection would in time have be overcome as she affection become more and more enlist on behalf of harland have she admit he address but there be a impediment that jane consider insurmountable to a union with any man she have once communicate she passion to its object there have be the confidence of approve love and she have now no heart for harland but one that have avowedly be a slave to another to conceal this from he would be unjust and not reconcilable to good faith to confess it humiliating and without the pale of probability it be the misfortune of jane to keep the world too constantly before she and to lose sight too much of she really depraved nature to relish the idea of humbling herself so low in the opinion of a fellow-creature the refusal of harland 's offer be the consequence although she have begin to feel a esteem for he that would no doubt have give rise to a attachment in time far stronger and more deeply seat than she passing fancy for colonel egerton have be if the horror of impose on the credulity of harland a wounded heart be creditable to jane and show a elevation of character that under proper guidance would have place she in the first rank of she sex the pride which condemn she to a station nature do not design she for be irreconcilable with the humility a just view of she condition could not fail to produce and the second sad consequence of the indulgent weakness of she parent be confirm they child in passion directly at variance with the first duty of a christian we have so little right to value ourselves on anything that pride be a sentiment of very doubtful service and one certainly that be unable to effect any useful result which will not equally flow from good principle harland be disappointed and grieve but prudently judge that occupation and absence would remove recollection which could not be very deep they part at falmouth and we traveller proceed on they journey for b -- whither during they absence sir edward 's family have return to spend a month before they remove to town for the residue of the winter the meeting of the two party be warm and tender and as jane have many thing to recount and john as many to laugh at they arrival throw a gaiety around moseley hall to which it have for month be a stranger one of the first act of grace after she return be to enter strictly into the exercise of all those duty and ordinance require by she church and the present state of she mind and from the hand of dr ive she receive she first communion at the altar as the season have now become far advance and the fashionable world have be some time assemble in the metropolis the baronet commence he arrangement to take possession of he town-house after a interval of nineteen year john proceed to the capital first and the necessary domestic procure furniture supply and other arrangement usual to the appearance of a wealthy family in the world have be complete he return with the information that all be ready for they triumphal entrance sir edward feeling that a separation for so long a time and at such a unusual distance in the very advanced age of mr benfield would be improper pay he a visit with the intention of persuade he to make one of he family for the next four month emily be he companion and they solicitation be happily crown with a success they have not anticipate averse to be deprive of peter 's society the honest steward be include in the party nephew say mr benfield begin to waver in he objection to the undertaking as the argument pro and con be produce there be instance of gentleman not in parliament go to town in the winter i know you be one yourself and old sir john cowel who never could get in although he run for every city in the kingdom never miss he winter in soho yes yes -- the thing be admissible -- but have i know you wish before i would certainly have keep my borough if it be only for the appearance of the thing -- besides continue the old man shake he head he majesty 's minister require the aid of some more experienced member in these critical time for what should a old man like I do in westminster unless it be to aid he country with he advice make he friend happy with he company dear uncle say emily take he hand between both she own and smile affectionately on the old gentleman as she speak ah emmy dear cry mr benfield look on she with melancholy pleasure you be not to be resist -- just such another as the sister of my old friend lord gosford she could always coax I out of anything i remember now i hear the earl tell she once he could not afford to buy a pair of diamond ear-ring and she look -- only look -- do not speak emmy -- that i buy they with intent to present they to she myself and do she take they uncle ask he niece in a little surprise oh yes when i tell she if she do not i would throw they into the river as no one else should wear what have be intend for she poor soul how delicate and unwilling she be i have to convince she they cost three hundred pound before she would listen to it and then she think it such a pity to throw away a thing of so much value it would have be wicked you know emmy dear and she be much oppose to wickedness and sin in any shape she must have be a very unexceptionable character indeed cry the baronet with a smile as he proceed to make the necessary order for they journey but we must return to the party leave at bath chapter xxxvi the letter of lady laura inform she friend that she and colonel denbigh have decide to remain with he uncle until the recovery of the latter be complete and then to proceed to denbigh castle to meet the duke and he sister during the approach holiday emily be much relieve by this postponement of a interview which she would gladly have avoid for ever and she aunt sincerely rejoice that she niece be allow more time to eradicate impression which she see with pain she charge have yet a struggle to overcome there be so many point to admire in the character of denbigh he friend speak of he with such decide partiality dr ive in he frequent letter allude to he with so much affection that emily frequently detect herself in weigh the testimony of he guilt and indulge the expectation that circumstance have deceive they all in they judgment of he conduct then he marriage would cross she mind and with the conviction of the impropriety of admit he to she thought at all would come the mass of circumstantial testimony which have accumulate against he derwent serve greatly to keep alive the recollection of he person however and as lady harriet seem to live only in the society of the moseley not a day pass without give the duke some opportunity of indirectly prefer he suit emily not only appear but in fact be unconscious of he admiration and enter into they amusement with a satisfaction that be increase by the belief that the unfortunate attachment she cousin chatterton have once profess for herself be forget in the more certain enjoyment of a successful love lady harriet be a woman of manners and character very different from emily moseley yet have she in a great measure erase the impression make by the beauty of he kinswoman from the bosom of the baron chatterton under the depression of he first disappointment it will be remember have leave b -- in company with mr denbigh the interest of the duke have be unaccountably exert to procure he the place he have so long solicit in vain and gratitude require he early acknowledgment for the favor he manner so very different from a successful applicant for a valuable office have strike both derwent and he sister as singular before however a week 's intercourse have pass between they he own frankness have make they acquaint with the cause and a double wish prevail in the bosom of lady harriet to know the woman who could resist the beauty of chatterton and to relieve he from the weight impose on he spirit by disappointed affection the manners of lady harriet denbigh be not in the least forward or masculine but they have the freedom of high rank mingle with a good deal of the ease of fashionable life mr wilson notice moreover in she conduct to chatterton a something exceed the interest of ordinary communication in they situation which might possibly have be attribute more to feeling than to manner it be certain one of the surest method to drive emily from he thought be to dwell on the perfection of some other lady and lady harriet be so constantly before he in he visit into westmore land so soothing so evidently please with he presence that the baron make rapid advance in attain he object he have allude in he letter to emily to the obligation he be under to the service of denbigh in erase he unfortunate partiality for she : but what those service be we be unable to say unless they be the usual argument of the plainest good sense enforce in the singularly insinuate and kind manner which distinguish that gentleman in fact lord chatterton be not form by nature to love long deprive of hope or to resist long the flattery of a preference from such a woman as harriet denbigh on the other hand derwent be warm in he encomium on emily to all but herself and mr wilson again think it prudent to examine into the state of she feeling in order to discover if there be any danger of he unremitted effort draw emily into a connexion that neither she religion nor prudence could wholly approve derwent be a man of the world -- a christian only in name and the cautious widow determine to withdraw in season should she find grounds for she apprehension about ten day after the departure of the dowager and she companion lady harriet exclaim in one of she morning visit -- lady moseley i have now hope of present to you soon the most polished man in the unite kingdom as a husband lady harriet inquire the other with a smile oh no only as a cousin a second cousin madam reply lady harriet blush a little and look in the opposite direction to the one in which chatterton be place but he name you forget we curiosity what be he name cry mr wilson enter into the trifling for the moment pendennyss to be sure my dear madam : whom else can i mean and you expect the earl at bath mr wilson eagerly inquire he have give we such hope and derwent have write he to-day press the journey you will be disappointed i be afraid sister say the duke pendennyss have become so fond of wale of late that it be difficult to get he out of it but say mr wilson he will take he seat in parliament during the winter my lord i hope he will madam though lord eltringham hold he proxy in my absence in all important question before the house you grace will attend i trust say sir edward the pleasure of you company be among my expect enjoyment in the town you be very good sir edward reply the duke look at emily it will somewhat depend on circumstance i believe lady harriet smile and the speech seem understand by all but the lady most concern in it lord pendennyss be a universal favorite and deservedly so cry the duke he have set a example to the nobility which few be equal to imitate a only son with a immense estate he have devote himself to the profession of a soldier and gain great reputation by it in the world nor have he neglect any of he private duty as a man -- or a christian i hope say mr wilson delighted with the praise of the earl nor of a christian i believe continue the duke he appear consistent humble and sincere -- three requisite i believe for that character do not you grace know say emily with a benevolent smile derwent color slightly as he answer -- not as well as i ought but -- lower he voice for she ear alone he add under proper instruction i think i might learn then i would recommend that book to you my lord rejoin emily with a blush point to a pocket bible which lay near she though still ignorant of the allusion he mean to convey may i ask the honor of a audience of miss moseley say derwent in the same low tone whenever she leisure will admit of she grant the favor emily be surprised but from the previous conversation and the current of she thought at the moment suppose he communication have some reference to the subject before they she rise from she chair and unobtrusively but certainly with a air of perfect innocence and composure she go into the adjoining room the door of which be open very near they caroline harri have abandon all idea of a coronet with the departure of the marquess of eltringham and he sister for they own seat and as a final effort of she fading charm have begin to calculate the capability of captain jarvi who have at this time honor bath with he company it be true the lady would have greatly prefer she father 's neighbor but that be a irretrievable step he have retire disgusted with she haughty dismissal of he hope and be a man who although he greatly admire she fortune be not to be recall by any beck or smile which might grow out of caprice lady jarvi have indeed rather magnify the personal qualification of she son but the disposition they have manifest to devote some of they surplus wealth to purchase a title have great weight for miss harri would cheerfully at any time have sacrifice one half she own fortune to be call my lady jarvi would make but a shabby-looking lord ` tis true but then what a lord 's wife would she not make herself he father be a merchant to be sure but then merchant be always immensely rich and a few thousand pound properly apply might make the merchant 's son a baron she therefore resolve to inquire the first opportunity into the condition of the sink fund of he plebeianism and have serious thought of contribute she mite towards the advancement of the desire object do she find it within the bound of probable success a occasion soon offer by the invitation of the captain to accompany he in a excursion in the tilbury of he brother-in-law in this ride they pass the equipage of lady harriet and mr wilson with they respective mistress take a airing in pass the latter jarvi bow -lrb- for he have renew he acquaintance at the room without daring to visit at the lodgings of sir edward -rrb- and miss harri see both party as they dash by they you know the moseley caroline say jarvi with the freedom she manners have establish between they yes reply the lady draw she head back from a view of the carriage what fine arm those of the duke 's be -- and the coronet it be so noble -- so rich -- i be sure if i be a man lay great emphasis on the word -- i would be a lord if you could you mean cry the captain could -- why money will buy a title you know -- only most people be fonder of they cash than of honor that be right say the unreflecting captain money be the thing after all now what do you suppose we last mess-bill come to oh do not talk of eating and drinking cry miss harri in affect aversion be it beneath the consideration of nobility then any one may be a lord for I say jarvi drily if they be not to eat and drink why what do they live for but such sort of thing a soldier live to fight and gain honor and distinction -- for he wife -- miss harri would have add have she speak all she think a poor way that of spend a man 's time say the captain now there be captain jone in we regiment they say he love fight as much as eating : if he do he be a bloodthirsty fellow you know how intimate i be with you dear mother continue the lady bent on the principal object she have make I acquaint with she greatest wish she greatest wish cry the captain in astonishment why what can that be -- a new coach and horse no i mean one much dearer to we -- i should say to she than any such trifle : she have tell I of the _ plan _ plan say jarvi still in wonder what plan about the fund for the peerage you know of course the thing be sacred with I as indeed i be equally interested with you all in its success jarvi eye she with a know look and as she conclude roll he eye in a expression of significance he say -- what serve sir william some such way eh i will assist a little if it be necessary henry say the lady tenderly although my mite can not amount to a great deal during this speech the captain be wonder what she could mean but have have a suspicion from something that have fall from he mother that the lady be intend for he as a wife and that she might be as great a dupe as lady jarvi herself he be resolve to know the whole and to act accordingly i think it might be make to do he reply evasively in order to discover the extent of he companion 's information do cried miss harri with fervor it can not fail how much do you suppose will be want to buy a barony for instance hem say jarvis you mean more than we have already certainly why about a thousand pound i think will do it with what we have say jarvi affect to calculate be that all cry the delighted caroline and the captain grow in a instant in she estimation three inch higher -- quite noble in he air and in short very tolerably handsome from that moment miss harri in she own mind have fix the fate of captain jarvi and have determine to be he wife whenever she could persuade he to offer himself a thing she have no doubt of accomplish with comparative ease not so the captain like all weak man there be nothing of which he stand more in terror than of ridicule he have hear the maneuver of miss harri laugh at by many of the young man in bath and be by no means dispose to add himself to the food for mirth of these wag and indeed have cultivate she acquaintance with a kind of bravado to some of he bottle companion in order to show he ability to oppose all she art when most expose to they : for it be one of the greatest difficulty to the success of this description of lady that they character soon become suspect and do they infinitely more injury than all they skill in they vocation with these view in the respective champion the campaign open and the lady on she return acquaint he mother with the situation of the privy purse that be to promote she darling child to the enviable distinction of the peerage lady jarvi be for purchase a baronetcy on the spot with what they have under the impression that when ready for another promotion they would only have to pay the difference as they do in the army when he receive he captaincy as however the son be oppose to any arrangement that might make the produce the few hundred pound he have obtain from he mother 's folly necessary she be oblige to postpone the wished-for day until they unite effort could compass the means of effect the main point as a earnest however of she spirit in the cause she give he a fifty pound note that morning obtain from she husband and which the captain lose at one throw of the dice to he brother-in-law the same evening during the precede event egerton have either studiously avoid all collision with the moseley or he engagement have confine he to such very different scene that they never meet the baronet have feel he presence a reproach and lady moseley rejoice that egerton yet possess sufficient shame to keep he from insulting she with he company it be a month after the departure of lady chatterton that sir edward return to b -- as related in the precede chapter and that the arrangement for the london winter be commence the day precede they leave bath the engagement of chatterton with lady harriet be make public amongst they mutual friend and a intimation be give that they nuptials would be celebrate before the family of the duke leave he seat for the capital something of the pleasure that she have for a long time be a stranger to be feel by emily moseley as the well remembered tower of the village church of b -- strike she sight on they return from they protracted excursion more than four month have elapse since they have commence they travels and in that period what change of sentiment have she not witness in other of opinion of mankind in general and of one individual in particular have she not experience in she own person the benevolent smile the respectful salutation they receive in pass the little group of house which cluster round the church have obtain the name of the village convey a sensation of delight that can only be feel by the deserving and virtuous and the smile face in several instance glisten with tear which meet they at the hall give ample testimony to the worth of both the master and he servant franci and clara be in wait to receive they and a very few minute elapse before the rector and mr ive have hear they have pass drive in also in salute the different member of the family mr wilson notice the startled look of the doctor as the change in emily 's appearance first meet he eye she bloom if not go be greatly diminish and it be only when under the excitement of strong emotion that she face possess that radiance which have so eminently distinguish it before she late journey where do you last see my friend george say the doctor to mr wilson in the course of the first afternoon as he take a seat by she side apart from the rest of the family at l -- say mr wilson gravely l -- cry the doctor in evident amazement be he not at bath then during you stay there no i understand he be in attendance on some sick relative which detain he from he friend say mr wilson wonder why the doctor choose to introduce so delicate a topic of he guilt in relation to mr fitzgerald he be doubtless ignorant but surely not of he marriage it be now some time since i hear from he continue the doctor regard mr wilson expressively but to which the lady only reply with a gentle inclination of the body and the rector after pause a moment continue : you will not think I impertinent if i be bold enough to ask have george ever express a wish to become connect with you niece by other tie than those of friendship he do answer the widow after a little hesitation he do and -- be refuse continued mr wilson with a slight feeling for the dignity of she sex which for a moment cause she to lose sight of justice to denbigh dr ive be silent but manifest by he dejected countenance the interest he have take in this anticipated connexion and as mr wilson have speak with ill-concealed reluctance on the subject at all the rector do not attempt a renewal of the disagreeable chapter xxxvii samvenson have return and i certainly must hear from harriet exclaim the sister of pendennyss as she stand at a window watch the return of a servant from the neighbor post-office i be afraid rejoin the earl who be seat by the breakfast table wait the leisure of the lady to give he he cup of tea -- you find wale very dull sister i sincerely hope both derwent and harriet will not forget they promise of visit we this month the lady slowly take she seat at the table engross in she own reflection when the man enter with he budget of news and have deposit sundry papers and letter he respectfully withdraw the earl glance he eye over the direction of the epistle and turn to he servant say answer the bell when call three or four liveried footman deposit they silver salver and different implement of servitude and the peer and he sister be leave to themselves here be one from the duke to I and one for you from he sister say the brother i propose they be read aloud for we mutual advantage to this proposal the lady whose curiosity to hear the contents of derwent 's letter greatly exceed she interest in that of he sister cheerfully acquiesce and she brother first break the seal of he own epistle and read its contents as follow : notwithstanding my promise of see you this month in caernarvonshire i remain here yet my dear pendennyss unable to tear myself from the attraction i have find in this city although the pleasure of they contemplation have be purchase at the expense of mortified feeling and unrequited affection it be a truth -lrb- though possibly difficult to be believe -rrb- that this mercenary age have produce a female disengaged young and by no means very rich who have refuse a jointure of six thousand a year with the privilege of walk at a coronation within a dozen of royalty itself here the accidental fall of a cup from the hand of the fair listener cause some little interruption to the reading of the brother but as the lady with a good deal of trepidation and many blush apologize hastily for the confusion she awkwardness have make the earl continue to read i could almost worship she independence : for i know the wish of both she parent be for my success i confess to you freely that my vanity have be a good deal hurt as i really think myself agreeable to she she certainly listen to my conversation and admit my approach with more satisfaction than those of any other of the man around she and when i venture to hint to she this circumstance as some justification for my presumption she frankly acknowledge the truth of my impression and without explain the reason for she conduct deeply regret the construction i have be lead to place upon the circumstance yes my lord i feel it necessary to apologize to emily moseley for presume to aspire to the honor of possess so much loveliness and virtue the accidental advantage of rank and wealth lose all they importance when oppose to she delicacy ingenuousness and unaffected principle i have hear it intimate lately that george denbigh be in some way or other instrumental in save she life once and that to she gratitude and to my resemblance to the colonel be i indebted to a consideration with miss moseley which although it have be the means of buoy I up with false hope i can never regret from the pleasure she society have afford I i have remark on my mention he name to she that she show unusual emotion and as denbigh be already a husband and myself reject the field be now fairly open to you you will enter on you enterprise with great advantage as you have the same flattering resemblance and if anything the voice which i be tell be we greatest recommendation with the lady in higher perfection than either george or you humble servant here the reader stop of he own accord and be so intently absorb in he meditation that the almost breathless curiosity of he sister be oblige to find relief by desire he to proceed rouse by the sound of she voice the earl change color sensibly and continue : but to be serious on a subject of great importance to my future life -lrb- for i sometimes think she negative will make denbigh a duke -rrb- the lovely girl do not appear happy at the time of we interview nor do i think she enjoy at any time the spirit nature have evidently give she harriet be nearly as great a admirer of miss moseley and take she refusal to heart as much as myself she even attempt to intercede with she in my behalf but the charming girl though mild grateful and delicate be firm and unequivocal and leave no grounds for the remotest expectation of success from perseverance on my part as harriet have receive a intimation that both miss moseley and she aunt entertain extremely rigid notion on the score of religion she take occasion to introduce the subject in she conference with the former and be tell in reply ` that other consideration would have determine she to decline the honor i intend she but that under any circumstance a more intimate knowledge of my principle would be necessary before she could entertain a thought of accept my hand or indeed that of any other man ' think of that pendennyss the principle of a duke -- now a dukedom and forty thousand a year would furnish a character with most people for a nero i trust the important object i have have in view here be a sufficient excuse for my breach of promise to you and i be serious when i wish you -lrb- unless the pretty spaniard have as i sometimes suspect make you a captive -rrb- to see and endeavor to bring I in some degree connect with the charming family of sir edward moseley the aunt mr wilson often speak of you with the greatest interest and from some cause or other be strongly enlist in you favor and miss moseley hear you name mention with evident pleasure _ you _ religion or principle can not be doubt you can offer larger settlement as honorable if not as elevated a title a far more illustrious name purchase by you own service and personal merit greatly exceed the pretension of you assure friend and relative derwent both brother and sister be occupy with they own reflection for several minute after the letter be end and the silence be break first by the latter say with a low tone to she brother -- you must endeavor to become acquaint with mr wilson she be i know very anxious to see you and you friendship for the general require it of you i owe general wilson much reply the brother in a melancholy voice and when we go to annerdale house i wish you to make the acquaintance of the lady of the moseley family should they be in town this winter -- but you have yet the letter of harriet to read after first hastily run over its contents the lady commence the fulfilment of she part of the engagement frederick have be so much engrossed of late with he own affair that he have forget there be such a creature in existence as he sister or indeed any one else but a miss emily moseley and consequently i have be unable to fulfil my promise of make you a visit for want of a proper escort and -- and -- perhaps some other consideration not worth mention in a letter i know you will read to the earl yes my dear cousin frederick denbigh have supplicate the daughter of a country baronet to become a duchess and hear it ye marriage-seeking nymph and marriage-making dame have supplicate in vain i confess to you when the thing be first in agitation my aristocratic blood rouse itself a little at the anticipated connexion but finding on examination that sir edward be of no doubtful lineage and that the blood of the chatterton run in he vein and find the young lady everything i could wish in a sister my scruple soon disappear with the folly that engender they there be no necessity for any alarm for the lady very decidedly refuse the honor offer she by derwent and what make the matter worse refuse the solicitation of he sister also i have fifty time be surprise at my own condescension and to this moment be at a loss to know whether it be to the lady 's worth my brother 's happiness or the chatterton blood that i finally yield heigho this chatterton be certainly much too handsome for a man but i forget you have never see he -lrb- here a arch smile steal over the feature of the listener as he sister continue -rrb- -- to return to my narration i have half a mind to send for a miss harri there be here to learn the most approved fashion of a lady prefer a suit but as fame say she be just now practise on a certain hero clepe captain jarvi heir to sir timo of that name it strike I she system might be rather too abrupt so i be fain to adopt the best plan -- that of trust to nature and my own feeling for word nobility be certainly a very pretty thing -lrb- for those who have it -rrb- but i would defy the old margravine of -- to keep up the semblance of superiority with emily moseley she be so very natural so very beautiful and withal at time a little arch that one be afraid to set up any other distinction than such as can be fairly support i commence with hope she determination to reject the hand of frederick be not a unalterable one -lrb- yes i call he frederick what i never do out of my own family before in my life -rrb- there be a considerable tremor in the voice of miss moseley as she reply ' i now perceive when too late that my indiscretion have give reason to my friend to think that i have entertain intention towards he grace of which i entreat you to believe I lady harriet i be innocent indeed -- indeed as anything more than a agreeable acquaintance i have never allow myself to think of you brother : ' and from my soul i believe she we continue we conversation for half a hour longer and such be the ingenuousness delicacy and high religious feeling display by the charming girl that if i enter the room with a spark of regret that i be compel to solicit another to favor my brother 's love i leave it with a feeling that my effort have be unsuccessful yes thou peerless sister of the more peerless pendennyss i once think of you ladyship as a wife for derwent -- a glass of water be necessary to enable the reader to clear she voice which grow husky from speak so long but i now openly avow neither you birth you hundred thousand pound nor you merit would put you on a footing in my estimation with my emily you may form some idea of she power to captivate and of she indifference to she conquest when i mention that she once refuse -- but i forget you do not know he and therefore can not be a judge the thing be finally decide and we shortly go into westmoreland and next week the moseley return to northamptonshire i do not know when i shall be able to visit you and think i may _ now _ safely invite you to denbigh castle although a month ago i might have hesitate love to the earl and kind assurance to yourself of unalterable regard harriet denbigh p i believe i forget to mention that mr moseley a sister of lord chatterton have go to portugal and that the peer himself be to go into the country with we : there be i suppose a fellow-feeling between _ they _ just now though i do not think chatterton look so very miserable as he might adieu on end this second epistle the same silence which have succeed the reading of the first prevail until the lady with a arch expression interrupt it by say harriet will i think soon grace the peerage and happily i trust reply the brother do you know lord chatterton i do he be very amiable and admirably calculate to contrast with the lively gaiety of harriet denbigh you believe in loving we opposite i see rejoin the lady and then affectionately stretch out she hand to he she add but pendennyss you must give I for a sister one as nearly like yourself as possible that might please you affection answer the earl with a smile but how would it comport with my taste will you suffer I to describe the kind of man _ you _ be to select for you future lord unless indeed you have decide the point already the lady color violently and appear anxious to change the subject she tumble over two or three unopened letter as she cry eagerly -- here be one from the donna julium the earl instantly break the seal and read aloud no secret exist between they in relation to they mutual friend my lord i hasten to write you what i know it will give you pleasure to hear concern my future prospects in life my uncle general m ` carthy have write I the cheerful tiding that my father have consent to receive he only child without any other sacrifice than a condition of attend the service of the catholic church without any profession on my side or even a understanding that i be conform to its peculiar tenet this may be in some measure irksome at time and possibly distressing but the worship of god with a proper humiliation of spirit i have learn to consider as a privilege to we here and i owe a duty to my earthly father of penitence and care in he later year that will justify the measure in the eye of my heavenly one i have therefore acquaint my uncle in reply that i be willing to attend the conde 's summons at any moment he will choose to make they and i think it a debt due you care and friendship to apprise you lordship of my approach departure from this country indeed i have great reason for believe that you kind and unremitted effort to attain this object have already prepare you to expect this result i feel it will be impossible to quit england without see you and you

of my friend in spain have prevent my troubling you lordship of late unnecessarily with my concern the consideration of a friend to you character -lrb- mr wilson -rrb- have remove the necessity of apply for you advice she and she charming niece miss emily moseley have be next to yourselve the greatest solace i have have in my exile and unite you will be remember in my prayer i will merely mention here defer the explanation until i see you in london that i have be visit by the wretch from whom you deliver I in portugal and that the means of ascertain he name have fall into my hand you will be the best judge of the proper step to be take but i wish by all means something may be do to prevent he attempt to see I in spain should it be discover to my relation there that he have any such intention it would certainly terminate in he death and possibly in my disgrace wish you and you kind sister all possible happiness i remain you lordship 's obliged friend julium fitzgerald oh cry the sister as she conclude the letter we must certainly see she before she go what a wretch that persecutor of hers must be how persevere in he villainy he do exceed my idea of effrontery say the earl in great warmth -- but he may offend too far the law shall interpose they power to defeat he scheme should he ever repeat they he attempt to take you life brother say the lady shudder if i remember the tale aright why i have endeavor to free he from that imputation rejoin the brother muse he certainly fire pistol but the latter hit my horse at such a distance from myself that i believe he object be to disable I and not murder he escape have astonish I he must have flee by himself into the wood as harmer be but a short distance behind I admirably mount and the escort be up and in full pursuit within ten minute after all it may be for the best he be not take for i be persuade the dragoon would have sabr he on the spot and he may have parent of respectability or a wife to kill by the knowledge of he misconduct this emily moseley must be a faultless be cry the sister as she run over the contents of julium 's letter three different letter and each contain she praise the earl make no reply but open the duke 's letter again he appear to be study its contents he color slightly change as he dwell on its passage and turn to he sister he inquire if she have a mind to try the air of westmoreland for a couple of week or a month as you say my lord reply the lady with cheek of scarlet then i say we will go i wish much to see derwent and i think there will be a wedding during we visit he ring the bell and the almost untasted breakfast be remove in a few minute a servant announce that he horse be in readiness the earl wish he sister a friendly good morning and proceed to the door where be stand one of the noble black horse before mention hold by a groom and the military-looking attendant ready mount on another throw himself into the saddle the young peer ride gracefully from the door follow by he attendant horseman during this ride the master suffer he steed to take whatever course most pleased himself and he follower look up in surprise more than once to see the careless manner in which the earl of pendennyss confessedly one of the best horseman in england manage the noble animal have however get without the gate of he own park and into the vicinity of numberless cottage and farm-house the master recover he recollection and the man cease to wonder for three hour the equestrian pursue they course through the beautiful vale which open gracefully opposite one of the front of the castle and if face of smile welcome inquiry after he own and he sister 's welfare which evidently spring from the heart or the most familiar but respectful representation of they own prosperity or misfortune give any testimony of the feeling entertain by the tenantry of this noble estate for they landlord the situation of the young nobleman might be justly consider envy as the hour for dinner approach they turn the head of they horse towards home and on enter the park remove from the scene of industry and activity without the earl relapse into he fit of muse a short distance from the house he suddenly call harmer the man drive he spur into the loin of he horse and in a instant be by the side of he master which he signify by raise he hand to he cap with the palm opening outward you must prepare to go to spain when require in attendance on mr fitzgerald the man receive he order with the indifference of one use to adventure and movement and have laconically dignified he assent he draw he horse back again into he station in the rear chapter xxxviii the day succeed the arrival of the moseley at the seat of they ancestor mr wilson observe emily silently put on she pelisse and walk out unattended by either of the domestic or any of the family there be a peculiar melancholy in she air and manner which incline the cautious aunt to suspect that she charge be bent on the indulgence of some ill-judged weakness more particularly as the direction she take lead to the arbor a theater in which denbigh have be so conspicuous a actor hastily throw a cloak over she own shoulder mr wilson follow emily with the double purpose of ascertain she view and if necessary of interpose she own authority against the repetition of similar excursion as emily approach the arbor whither in truth she have direct she step its fade vegetation and chill aspect so different from its verdure and luxuriance when she last see it come over she heart as a symbol of she own blighted prospects and deaden affection the recollection of denbigh 's conduct on that spot of he general benevolence and assiduity to please be forcibly recall to she mind at the instant forgetful of she object in visit the arbor emily yield to she sensibility and sink on the seat weep as if she heart would break she have not time to dry she eye and to collect she scatter thought before mr wilson enter the arbor eye she niece for a moment with a sternness unusual for the one to adopt or the other to receive she say it be a solemn obligation we owe we religion and ourselves to endeavor to suppress such passion as be incompatible with we duty and there be no weakness greater than blindly adhering to the wrong when we be convince of we error it be as fatal to good moral as it be unjust to ourselves to persevere from selfish motive in believe those innocent whom evidence have convict as guilty many a weak woman have seal she own misery by such wilful obstinacy aid by the unpardonable vanity of believe herself able to control a man that the law of god could not restrain oh dear madam speak not so unkindly to I sob the weep girl i -- i be guilty of no such weakness i assure you : and look up with a air of profound resignation and piety she continue : here on this spot where he save my life i be about to offer up my prayer for he conviction of the error of he way and for the pardon of he too -- too heavy transgression mr wilson soften almost to tear herself view she for a moment with a mixture of delight and continue in a milder tone -- i believe you my dear i be certain although you may have love denbigh much that you love you maker and he ordinance more and i have no apprehension that be he a disengaged man and you alone in the world -- unsupported by anything but you sense of duty -- you would ever so far forget yourself as to become he wife but do not you religion do not you own usefulness in society require you wholly to free you heart from the power of a man who have so unworthily usurp a dominion over it to this emily reply in a hardly audible voice certainly -- and i pray constantly for it it be well my love say the aunt soothingly you can not fail with such means and you own exertion finally to prevail over you own worst enemy you passion the task we sex have to sustain be at the best a arduous one but so much the greater be we credit if we do it well oh how be a unguided girl ever to judge aright if -- cry emily clasp she hand and speak with great energy and she would have say one like denbigh in appearance be so vile shame however keep she silent few man can support such a veil of hypocrisy as that with which i sometimes think denbigh must deceive even himself he case be a extraordinary exception to a very sacred rule -- ` that the tree be know by its fruit ' reply she aunt there be no safer way of judge of character that one 's opportunity will not admit of more closely investigate than by examine into and duly appreciate early impression the man or woman who have constantly see the practice of piety before they from infancy to the noon of life will seldom so far abandon the recollection of virtue as to be guilty of great enormity even divine truth have promise that he blessing or he curse shall extend to many generation it be true that with we most most guard prudence we may be deceive mr wilson pause and sigh heavily as she own case connect with the love of denbigh and she niece occur strongly to she mind yet she continue we may lessen the danger much by guard against it and it seem to I no more than what self-preservation require in a young woman but for a religious parent to neglect it be a wilful abandonment of a most solemn duty as mr wilson conclude she niece who have recover the command of she feeling press she hand in silence to she lip and show a disposition to retire from a spot which she find recall too many recollection of a man whose image it be she imperious duty to banish on every consideration of propriety and religion they walk into the house be silent and they thought be draw from the unpleasant topic by find a letter from julium announce she intended departure from this country and she wish to take leave of they in london before she sail as she have mention the probable day for that event both the lady be delighted to find it be posterior to the time fix by sir edward for they own visit to the capital have jane instead of emily be the one that suffer through the agency of mr fitzgerald however innocently on the part of the lady she violent and uncontrolled passion would have either blindly unite the innocent with the guilty in she resentment or if a sense of justice have vindicate the lady in she judgment yet she pride and ill-guided delicacy would have feel she name a reproach that would have forbid any intercourse with she or any belong to she not so with she sister the suffering of mr fitzgerald have take a strong hold on she youthful feeling and a similarity of opinion and practice on the great object of they life have bring they together in a manner no misconduct in a third person could weaken it be true the recollection of denbigh be intimately blended with the fate of mr fitzgerald but emily seek support against she feeling from a quarter that rather require a investigation of they than a desire to _ drown _ care with think she never indulge in romantic reflection in which the image of denbigh be associate this she have hardly do in she happiest moment and he marriage if nothing else have interfere now absolutely put it out of the question but although a christian and a humble and devout one emily moseley be a woman and have love ardently confidingly and gratefully marriage be the business of life with she sex -- with all next to a preparation for a better world -- and it can not be suppose that a first passion in a bosom like that of we heroine be to be suddenly erase and to leave no vestige of its existence she partiality for the society of derwent she meditation in which she sometimes detect herself draw a picture of what denbigh might have be if early care have be take to impress he with he situation in this world and from which she generally retire to she closet and she knee be the remains of feeling too strong and too pure to be tear from she in a moment the arrival of john with grace and jane enliven not only the family but the neighborhood mr haughton and he numerous friend pour in on the young couple with they congratulation and a few week steal by insensibly previously to the commencement of the journey of sir edward and he son -- the one to benfield lodge and the other to st jame 's square on the return of the traveller a few day before they commence they journey to the capital john laughingly tell he uncle that although he himself greatly admire the taste of mr peter johnson in dress yet he doubt whether the present style of fashion in the metropolis would not be scandalize by the appearance of the honest steward john have in fact notice in they former visit to london mob of mischievous boy eye peter with indication of rebellious movement which threaten the old man and from which he have retreat by take a coach and he now make the suggestion from pure good-nature to save he any future trouble from a similar cause they be at dinner when moseley make the remark and the steward be in he place at the sideboard -- for he master be he home draw near at the mention of he name first and cast a eye over he figure to see if all be decent peter respectfully break silence determine to defend he own cause why mr john -- mr john moseley if i might judge for a elderly man and a serve man say the steward bow humbly i be no disparagement to my friend or even to my honor master johnson 's vindication of he wardrobe draw the eye of the family upon he and a involuntary smile pass from one to the other as they admire he starched figure and drab frock or rather doublet with sleeve and skirt sir edward be of the same opinion with he son observe -- i do think uncle benfield there might be a improvement in the dress of

unpleasant recollection to he kind master he at one time thought of close he innovation on he wardrobe however with a change of he nether garment as after a great deal of study he could only make out the resemblance between himself and the obnoxious gamekeeper to consist in the leathern breeches but fearful of some point escape he memory in forty year he tamely acquiesce in all john 's alteration and appear at he station three day afterwards newly deck from head to foot in a more modern suit of snuff-color the change once make peter greatly admire himself in a glass and think could he have have the taste of mr john moseley in he youth to direct he toilet that the hard heart of patty steele would not always have continue so obdurate sir edward wish to collect he neighbor round he once

and under the protection of they almost equally curious mother and escort by john they wisely determine to visit the curiosity while they leisure yet admit of the opportunity for the first two week they time be chiefly employ in the indulgence of this unfashionable and vulgar propensity which if it have no other tendency serve greatly to draw the thought of both the young woman from the recollection of the last few month while she sister and niece be thus employ mr wilson assist by grace be occupy in get thing in preparation to do credit to the baronet 's hospitality the second week after they arrival mr moseley be delighted by see advance upon she unexpectedly through the door of the breakfast parlor she brother with he bride lean on he arm after the most sincere greeting and

inquire lady moseley she come with we pendennyss and he sister follow immediately so my dear madam the dramati personæ will all be on the stage soon card and visit now begin to accumulate on the moseley and they time no longer admit of that unfettered leisure which they have enjoy at they entrance on the scene mr wilson for herself and charge adopt a rule for the government of she manner of living which be consistent with she duty they mix in general society sparingly and above all they rigidly adhere to the obedience to the injunction which command they to keep the sabbath day holy a duty of no trifling difficulty to perform in fashionable society in the city of london or indeed in any other place where the influence of fashion have supplant the law of god mr wilson be not a bigot but she know and perform she duty rigidly it be a pleasure to she to do so it would have be misery to do otherwise in the singleness of heart and deep piety of she niece she have a willing pupil to she system of moral and a rigid follower of she religious practice as they both know that the temptation to go astray be greater in town than in country they keep a strict guard over the tendency to err and in watchfulness find they greatest security john moseley next to he friend love he bay : indeed if the aggregate of he affection for these and lady herriefield have be put in opposite scale we strongly suspect the side of the horse would predominate one Sunday soon after be domesticate john who have soberly attend morning service with the lady come into a little room where the more reflect part of the family be assemble in search of he wife grace we have before mention have become a real member of that church in which she have be educate and have enter under the direction of dr ive and mr wilson into a observance of its wholesome ordinance grace be certainly piously incline if not devout she feeling on the subject of religion have be sensibly awaken during they voyage to lisbon and at the period of which we write mr moseley be as sincerely dispose to perform she duty as she power admit to the request of she husband that she would take a seat in he phaeton while he drive she round the park once or twice grace give a mild refusal by say it be Sunday my dear moseley do you think i do not know that cry john gaily there will be everybody there and the better day the better deed now moseley if he have be ask to apply this speech to the case before they would have frankly own he inability but he wife do not make the trial : she be contented with say as she lay down she book to look on a face she so tenderly love ah moseley you should set a better example to those below you in life i wish to set a example return she husband with a affectionate smile to all above as well as below I in order that they may find out the path to happiness by exhibit to the world a model of a wife in yourself dear grace as this be utter with a sincerity which distinguish the manner of moseley he wife be more pleased with the compliment than she would have be willing to make known and john speak no more than he think for a desire to show he handsome wife be the ruling passion for a moment the husband be too pressing and the wife too fond not to yield the point and grace take she seat in the carriage with a kind of half-formed resolution to improve the opportunity by a discourse on serious subject -- a resolution which terminate as all other do that postpone one duty to discharge another of less magnitude it be forget mr wilson have listen with interest to the effort of john to prevail on he wife to take the ride and on she leave the room to comply she observe to emily with whom she now remain alone -- here be a consequence of a difference in religious view between man and wife my child : john in place of support grace in the discharge of she duty have be the actual cause of she go astray emily feel the force of she aunt 's remark and see its justice yet she love for the offender induce she to say -- john will not lead she openly astray for he have a sincere respect for religion and this offence be not unpardonable dear aunt the offence be assuredly not unpardonable reply mr wilson and to infinite mercy it be hard to say what be but it be a offence and directly in the face of a express ordinance of the lord it be even throw off the _ appearance _ of keep the sabbath day holy much less observe the substance of the commandment and as to john 's respect for holy thing in this instance it be injurious to he wife have he be a open deist she would have shrink from the act in suspicion of its sinfulness either john must become christian or i be afraid grace will fall from she under take mr wilson shake she head mournfully while emily offer up a silent petition that the first might speedily be the case lady laura have be early in she visit to the moseley and as denbigh have both a town residence and a seat in parliament it appear next to impossible to avoid meeting he or to requite the press civility of he wife by harsh refusal that might prove in the end injurious to themselves by create a suspicion that resentment at he not choose a partner from amongst they govern the conduct of the moseley towards a man to whom they be under such a heavy obligation have sir edward know as much as he sister and daughter he would probably have discountenance the acquaintance altogether but owe to the ignorance of the rest of she friend of what have pass mr wilson and emily have not only the assiduity of lady laura but the wish of they own family to contend with and consequently she submit to the association with a reluctance that be in some measure counteract by they regard for lady laura and by compassion for she abused confidence a distant connexion of lady moseley 's have manage to collect in she house a few hundred of she nominal friend and as she have be particularly attentive in call in person on she venerable relative mr

which lose this country the wealthiest and most populous of she american colony that a fleet of ship be return from they service amongst the island of the new world to seek for they wear out and batter hulk and equally weaken crew the repair and comfort of england and home the latter word to the mariner the most endearing of all sound have as it be draw together by instinct a group of sailor on the forecastle of the proudest ship of the squadron who gaze with varied emotion on the land which give they birth but with one common feeling of joy that the day of attain it be at length arrive the water curl from the bow of this castle of the ocean in increase wave and grow murmur that at time draw the attention of the veteran tar to they quicken progress and have cheer he heart with the sight he cast he experienced eye in silence on the swell sail to see if nothing more could be do to shorten the distance between he and he country hundred of eye be fix on the land of they birth and hundred of heart be beat in that one vessel with the awaken delight of domestic love and renew affection but no tongue break the disciplined silence of the ship into sound that overcome the propitious ripple of the water on the highest summit of they towering mast float a small blue flag the symbol of authority and beneath it pace a man to and fro the deck who be abandon by he inferior to he more elevated rank he square-built form and careworn feature which have lose the brilliancy of a english complexion and hair whiten prematurely speak of bodily vigor and arduous service which have put that vigor to the severest trial at each turn of he walk as he face the land of he nativity a lurk smile steal over he sun-burnt feature and then a glance of he eye would scan the progress of the far-stretched squadron which obey he order and which he be now return to he superior undiminished in number and proud with victory by himself stand a officer in a uniform differ from all around he he figure be small he eye restless quick and piercing and bent on those shore to which he be unwillingly advance with a look of anxiety and mortification that show he the late commander of those vessel

civility endeavor to soften the hour of captivity effort which be receive with the courtesy of the most punctilious etiquette but a restraint which show that they be unwelcome it be perhaps the most unlucky moment that have occur within the two month of they association for a exchange of they better feeling the honest heart of the english tar dilate with ill-concealed delight at he approach to the termination of labor perform with credit and honor and he smile and good humor which partly proceed from the feeling of a father and a friend be dagger to the heart of he discomfited rival a third personage now appear from the cabin of the vessel and approach the spot where the adverse admiral at the moment be engage in one of these constrain conference the appearance and dress of this gentleman differ widely from the two just describe he be tall graceful and dignified he be a soldier and clearly of high rank he carefully dress hair conceal the ravages of time and on the quarter-deck of a first-rate he attire and manners be suit to a field-day in the park i really insist monsieur cry the admiral good-naturedly that you shall take part of my chaise to london you be a stranger and it will help to keep up you spirit by the way you be very good monsieur howell reply the frenchman with a polite bow and force smile misconstrue ill-judged benevolence into a wish for he person to grace a triumph -- but i have accept the offer monsieur le general denbigh be so good as to make I the comte be engage to I howell say the general with a courtly smile and indeed you must leave the ship to night or as soon as we anchor -- but i shall take daylight and to-morrow well -- well -- denbigh exclaim the other rub he hand with pleasure as he view the increase power of the wind only make yourselve happy and i be contented a few hour intervene before they reach the bay of plymouth and round the table after they dinner be seat the general and english admiral the comte under the pretence of prepare he thing for a removal have retire to he apartment to conceal he feeling -- and the captain of the ship be above superintend the approach of the vessel to she anchorage two or three well empty bottle of wine yet remain but as the health of all the branch of the house of brunswick have be propitiate from they contents with a polite remembrance of loui xvi and marie antoinette from general denbigh neither of the superior be much incline for action be the thunderer in she station say the admiral to the signal lieutenant who at that moment come below with a report yes sir and have answer very well make the signal to prepare to anchor aye aye sir and here bennet to the retire lieutenant -- call the transport all in shore of we three hundred and eighty-four sir say the officer look at he signal-book the admiral cast he eye at the book and nod a assent and let the mermaid -- flora -- weasel -- bruiser and all the sloop lie well off until we have land the soldier : the pilot say the channel be full of lugger and jonathan have grow very saucy the lieutenant make a comply bow and be retire to execute these order as admiral howell take up a bottle not yet entirely desert by its former tenant cry stoutly -- here bennet -- i forget -- take a glass of wine drink success to ourselves and defeat to the french all over the world the general pointed significantly to the adjoining cabin of the french admiral as he press he hand on he lip for silence oh cry admiral howell recollect himself continue in a whisper you can drink it in you heart notwithstanding the signal officer nod and drink the liquor as he smack he lip while go on deck he think to himself these nabob drink famous good wine although the feeling of general denbigh be under much more command and disciplined obedience than those of he friend yet be he too unusually elated with he return to home and expect honor if the admiral have capture a fleet _ he _ have take a island -- and hand in hand they have co-operate in unusual harmony through the difficulty of a arduous campaign this rather singular circumstance be owe to they personal friendship from they youth they have be companion and although of very different character and habit chance have cement they intimacy in more advanced life while in subordinate station they have be associate together in service and the general and admiral in command of a army and fleet have once before return to england with less renown as a colonel and a captain of a frigate the great family influence of the soldier with the known circumstance of they harmony have procure they this later command and home with its comfort and reward be close before they pour out a glass of madeira the general who always calculate what he say exclaimed peter -- we have be friend from boy to be sure we have say the admiral look up in a little surprise at this unexpected commencement -- and it will not be my fault if we do not die such frederick die be a subject the general do not much delight in although of conspicuous courage in the field and he proceed to he more important purpose -- i could never find although i have look over we family tree so often that we be in any manner related howell i believe it be too late to mend that matter now say the admiral musing why no -- hem -- i think not howell take a glass of this burgundy the admiral shake he head with a stubborn resolution to taste nothing french but he help himself to a bountiful stock of madeira as he reply -- i should like to know how you can bring it about this time of day denbigh how much money will you be able to give that girl of yours peter say he friend evade the point forty thousand down my good fellow and as much more when i die cry the open-hearted sailor with a nod of exultation george my youngest son will not be rich -- but franci will be a duke and have a noble estate yet say the general meditate he be so unhappy in he disposition and uncouth in he manners i can not think of offer he to you daughter as a husband isabel shall marry a good-natured man like myself or not at all say the admiral positively but not in the least suspect the drift of he friend who be influence by anything but a regard for the lady 's happiness franci he first bear be in truth as he have describe but he govern wish be to provide for he favorite george duke could never want wife but unportioned captain in the guard might george be one of the best temper in the world say he father with strong feeling and the delight of we all i could wish he have be the heir to the family honor _ that _ it be certainly too late to help cry the admiral wonder if the ingenuity of he friend could devise a remedy for this evil too too late indeed say the other with a heavy sigh but howell what say you to match isabel with my favorite george denbigh cry the sailor eye he keenly isabel be my only child and a dutiful good girl one that will obey order if she break owner as we sailor say now i do think of marry she to a seaman when a proper man come athwart my course yet you son be a soldier and that be next to be in the navy : if-so-be you have make he come aboard I when i want you to there would have be no objection at all : however when occasion offer i will overhaul the lad and if i find he staunch he may turn in with bell and welcome this be utter in perfect simplicity and with no intention of give offence partaking partly of the nature of a soliloquy so the general greatly encourage be about to push the point when a gun be fire from they own ship there be some of they lubberly transport will not mind we signal they have have these soldier so long on board they get as clumsy as the red-coat themselves mutter the admiral hastening on deck to enforce he command a shot or two send significantly in the direction of the wanderer but so as not to hit they restore order and within a hour forty line of battle ship and a hundred transport be dispose in the best manner for convenience and safety on they presentation to they sovereign both veteran be embellish with the riband of the bath and as they exploit fill the mouth of the newsmonger and the column of the public print of the day the new knight begin to think more seriously of build a monument to they victory in a union between they child the admiral however determine to do nothing with he eye shut and he demand a scrutiny where be the boy who be to be a duke exclaim he one day when he friend have introduce the point with a view to a final arrangement bell have good blood in she vein -- be a tight build little vessel -- clean heel would and trim and would make as good a duchess as the best of they so denbigh i will begin by take a survey of the senior to this the general have no objection as he well know that franci would be wide of please the taste of a open-hearted simple man like the sailor they meet accordingly for what the general facetiously call the review and what the admiral innocently term he survey at the house of the former when the young gentleman be submit to he inspection franci denbigh be about four and twenty of a feeble body and with a face mark with the small-pox to approach deformity he eye be brilliant and piercing but unsettled and at time wild -- he manner awkward constrain and timid there would be see it be true a intelligence and animation which occasionally light he countenance into gleam of sunshine that cause you to overlook the lesser accompaniment of complexion and feature in the expression but they be transient and inevitably vanish whenever he father speak or in any manner mingle in he pursuit a observer close as mr wilson would have say that the feeling of the father and son be not such as ought to exist between parent and child but the admiral who regard model and rig a good deal satisfied himself with mutter as he turn he eye on the junior -- he may do for a duke -- but i would not have he for a cockswain george be a year younger than franci in form stature and personal grace the counterpart of he father he eye be less keen but more attractive than that of he brother he air open polish and manly ah think the sailor as he end a satisfactory survey of the youth what a thousand pity denbigh do not send he to sea the thing be soon settle and george be to be the happy man sir peter conclude to dine with he friend in order to settle preliminary over the bottle by themselves the young man and they mother be engage to they uncle the duke well denbigh cry the admiral as the last servant withdraw when do you mean to have the young couple splice why reply the wary soldier who know he could not calculate on obedience to he mandate with as great a certainty as he friend -- the better way be to bring the young people together in order that they may become acquaint you know acquaint -- together -- cry he companion in a little surprise what better way be there to bring they together than to have they up before a priest or to make they acquaint by let they swing in the same hammock it might answer the end indeed say the general with a smile but somehow or other it be always the best method to bring young folk together to let they have they own way in the affair for a time own way rejoin sir peter bluntly do you ever find it answer to let a woman have she own way sir frederick not common woman certainly my good friend say the general but such a girl as my intended daughter be a exception i do not know that cry the sailor bell be a good girl but she have she quirk and whim like all the sex you have have no trouble with she as yet i believe howell say sir frederick cavalierly throw a inquire glance on he friend at the same time no not yet -- nor do i think she will ever dare to mutiny but there have be one wish to take she in tow already since we get in how say the other in alarm who -- what be he some officer in the navy i suppose no he be a kind of chaplain one parson ive a good sort of a youth enough and a prodigious favorite with my sister lady hawker well what do you answer peter say he companion in increase uneasiness do you put he off off to be sure i do -- do you think i want a barber 's clerk for a son-in-law no no denbigh a soldier be bad enough without have a preacher the general compress he lip at this direct attack on a profession that he think the most honorable of any in the world in some resentment but remember the eighty thousand pound and accustom to the way of the other he curb he temper and inquire -- but miss howell -- you daughter -- how do she stand affect to this priest how -- why -- how -- why i never ask she never ask she no never ask she : she be my daughter you know and bind to obey my order and i do not choose she should marry a parson but once for all when be the wedding to take place general denbigh have indulge he younger son too blindly and too fondly to expect that implicit obedience the admiral calculate to a certainty on and with every prospect of not be disappoint from he daughter isabel howell be pretty mild and timid and unused to oppose any of she father 's command but george denbigh be haughty positive and self-willed and unless the affair could be so manage as to make he a willing assistant in the courtship he father know it might be abandon at once he think he son might be lead but not drive and rely on he own power for manage the general see he only safety in execute the scheme be in postpone he advance for a regular siege to the lady 's heart sir peter chafe and swear at this circumlocution : the thing could be do as well in a week as in a year and the veteran who for a miracle have agree in they rival station and in doubtful moment of success be near splitting on the point of marry a girl of nineteen as sir peter both love he friend and have take a prodigious fancy to the youth he however be fain to submit to a short probation you be always for go a round-about way to do a thing say the admiral as he yield the point now when you take that battery have you go up in front as i advise you you would have take it in ten minute instead of five hour yes say the other with a friendly shake of the hand at parting and lose fifty man in place of one by the step chapter xlii the honorable general denbigh be the youngest of three son he senior franci and george be yet bachelor the death of a cousin have make franci a duke while yet a child and both he and he favorite brother george have decide on life of inactivity and sluggishness when i die brother the oldest would say you will succeed I and frederick can provide heir for the name hereafter this arrangement have be closely adhere to and the two elder brother reach the age of fifty-five and fifty-six without alter they condition in the mean time frederick marry a young woman of rank and fortune the fruit of they union be the two young candidate for the hand of isabel howell franci denbigh the eldest son of the general be naturally diffident and in addition it be he misfortune to be the reverse of captivating in external appearance the small-pox seal he doom -- ignorance and the violence of the attack leave he indelibly impress with the ravages of that dreadful disorder oh the other hand he brother escape without any vestige of the complaint and he spotless skin and fine open countenance meet the gaze of he mother after the recovery of the two in striking contrast to the deform lineament of he elder brother such a occurrence be sure to excite one of two feeling in the breast of every beholder -- pity or disgust and unhappily for franci maternal tenderness in he case be unable to counteract the latter sensation george become a favorite and franci a neutral the effect be easy to be see and it be rapid as it be indelible the feeling of franci be sensitive to a extreme he have more quickness more sensibility more real talent than george which enable he to perceive and cause he to feel more acutely the partiality of he mother as yet the engagement and duty of the general have keep he child and they improvement out of he sight but at the age of eleven and twelve the feeling of a father begin to take pride in the possession of he son on he return from a foreign station after a absence of two year he child be order from school to meet he franci have improve in stature but not in beauty george have flourish in both the natural diffidence of the former be increase by perceive that he be no favorite and the effect begin to show itself on manners at no time engage he meet he father with doubt and he see with anguish that the embrace receive by he brother much exceed in warmth that which have be bestow on himself lady margaret say the general to he wife as he follow the boy as they retire from the dinner table with he eye it be a thousand pity george have not be the elder _ he _ would have grace a dukedom or a throne frank be only fit for a parson this ill-judged speech be utter sufficiently loud to be overhear by both the son : on the younger it make a pleasurable sensation for the moment he father -- he dear father have think he fit to be a king and he father must be a judge whisper he native vanity but all this time the connexion between the speech and he brother 's rights do not present themselves to he mind george love this brother too well too sincerely to have injure he even in thought and so far as franci be concern he vanity be as blameless as it be natural the effect produce on the mind of franci be different both in substance and in degree it mortify he pride alarm he delicacy and wound he already morbid sensibility to such a extent as to make he entertain the romantic notion of withdraw from the world and of yield a birthright to one so every way more deserving of it than himself from this period might be date a opinion of franci 's which never afterwards leave he he fancy he be do injustice to another and that other a brother whom he ardently love by continue to exist have he meet with fondness in he parent or sociability in he playfellow these fancy would have leave he as he grow into life but the affection of he parent be settle on he more promising brother and he manners daily increase in they repulsive trait drive he companion to the society of other more agreeable to they own buoyancy and joy have franci denbigh at this age meet with a guardian clear-sighted enough to fathom he real character and competent to direct he onward course he would yet have become a ornament to he name and country and a useful member of society but no such guide exist he natural guardian in he particular case be he worst enemy and the boy leave school for college four year afterwards each advance in he respective property of attraction and repulsion irreligion be hardly a worse evil in a family than favoritism when once allow to exist in the breast of the parent though hide apparently from all other eye its sad consequence begin to show themselves effect be produce and we look in vain for the cause the awaken sympathy of reciprocal caress and fondness be mistake for uncommon feeling and the forbid aspect of deadened affection be miscall native sensibility in this manner the evil increase itself until manners be form and character create that must descend with they possessor to the tomb in the peculiar formation of the mind of franci denbigh the evil be doubly injurious he feeling require sympathy and softness and they meet only with coldness and disgust george alone be a exception to the rule _ he _ do love he brother but even he gaiety and spirit finally tire of the dull uniformity of the diseased habit of he senior the only refuge franci find in he solitude amidst the hundred of the university be in he muse and in the power of melody the voice of he family have be frequently mention in these page and if as lady laura have intimate there have ever be a siren in the race it be a male one he write prettily and would sing these effort of he muse to music of he own drawing crowd around he window in the stillness of the night to listen to sound as melodious as they be mournful he poetical effort partook of the distinctive character of the man be melancholy wild and sometimes pious george be always amongst the most admiring of he brother 's auditor and would feel a yearning of he heart towards he at such moment that be painful but george be too young and too heedless to supply the place of a monitor or to draw he thought into a more salutary train this be the _ duty _ of he parent and should have be they _ task _ but the world he rise honor and he professional engagement occupy the time of the father and fashion party and pleasure kill the time of he mother when they do think of they child it be of george the painful image of franci be seldom admit to disturb they serenity george denbigh be open-hearted without suspicion and a favorite the first quality tax he generosity the second subject he to fraud and the third supply he with the means but these means sometimes fail the fortune of the general though handsome be not more than competent to support he style of live he expect to be a duke himself one day and be anxious to maintain a appearance now that would not disgrace he future elevation a system of strict but liberal economy have be adopt in the case of he son they have for the sake of appearance a state and equal allowance the duke have offer to educate the heir himself and under he own eye but to this lady margaret have find some ingenious excuse and one that seem to herself and the world honorable to she natural feeling but have the offer be make to george these reason would have vanish in the desire to advance he interest or to gratify he propensity such decision be by no means uncommon parent have once decide on the merit and ability of they child frequently decline the interference of third person since the improvement of they denounce offspring might bring they own judgment into question if it do not convey a indirect censure on they justice the heedlessness of george bring he purse to a state of emptiness he last guinea be go and two month be want to the end of the quarter george have play and be cheat he have venture to apply to he mother for small sum when he dress or some trifling indulgence require a advance and always with success but here be sixty guinea go at a blow and pride candor forbid he conceal the manner of he loss if he make the application this be dreadful he own conscience reproach he and he have so often witness the violence of he mother 's resentment against franci for fault which appear to he very trivial not to stand in the utmost dread of she more just displeasure in the present case enter the apartment of he brother in this disturbed condition george throw himself into a chair and with he face conceal between he hand sit brooding over he forlorn situation george say he brother soothingly you be in distress can i relieve you in any way oh no -- no -- no -- frank it be entirely out of you power perhaps not my dear brother continue the other endeavor to draw he hand into he own entirely entirely say george then spring up in despair he exclaim but i must live -- i can not die live die cry franci recoiling in horror what do you mean by such language tell I george be i not you brother you only brother and best friend franci feel he have no friend if george be not that friend and he face grow pale while the tear flow rapidly down he cheek george could not resist such a appeal he catch the hand of he brother and make he acquaint with he loss and he want franci muse some little time over he narration ere he break silence it be all you have the last shilling cry george beat he head with he hand how much will you require to make out the quarter oh i must have at least fifty guinea or how can i live at all the idea of life in george be connect a good deal with the manner it be to be enjoy he brother appear struggle with himself and then turn to the other continued but surely under present circumstance you could make less do less never -- hardly that -- interrupted george vehemently if lady margaret do not inclose I a note now and then how could we get along at all do not you find it so yourself brother i do not know say franci turn pale -- do not know cry george catch a view of he altered countenance -- you get the money though i do not remember it say the other sigh heavily franci cry george comprehend the truth you shall share every shilling i receive in future -- you shall -- indeed you shall well then rejoin franci with a smile it be a bargain and you will receive from I a supply in you present necessity without wait for a answer franci withdraw into a inner apartment and bring out the require sum for he brother 's subsistence for two month george remonstrated but franci be positive he have be save and he stock be ample for he simple habit without it besides you forget we be partner and in the end i shall be a gainer george yield to he want and he brother 's entreaty and he give he great credit for the disinterestedness of the act several week pass without any further allusion to this disagreeable subject which have at least the favorable result of make george more guard and a better student the brother from this period advance gradually in those distinctive quality which be to mark the future man george daily improving in grace and attraction franci in a equal ratio recede from those very attainment which it be he too great desire to possess in the education of he son general denbigh have preserve the appearance of impartiality he allowance to each be the same : they be at the same college they have be at the same school and if frank do not improve as much as he younger brother it be unquestionably he own obstinacy and stupidity and surely not want of opportunity or favor such then be the artificial and accidental cause which keep a noble a proud a acute but a diseased mind in acquirement much below another every way its inferior except in the happy circumstance of want those very excellence the excess and indiscreet management of which prove the ruin instead of the blessing of they possessor the duke would occasionally rouse himself from he lethargy and complain to the father that the heir of he honor be far inferior to he younger brother in acquirement and remonstrate against the course which produce such a unfortunate inequality on these occasion a superficial statement of he system from the general meet the objection they cost the same money and he be sure he not only wish but do everything a indulgent parent could to render franci worthy of he future honor another evil of the admission of feeling of partiality in the favor of one child to the prejudice of another be that the malady be contagious as well as lasting : it exist without we own knowledge and it seldom fail to affect those around we the uncle soon learn to distinguish george as the hope of the family yet franci must be the heir of its honor and consequently of its wealth the duke and he brother be not much addict to action hardly to reflection but if anything could rouse they to either it be the reputation of the house of denbigh they idea of reputation it be true be of they own form the hour at length draw near when george expect a supply from the ill-judged generosity of he mother it come and with a heart beating with pleasure the youth fly to the room of franci with a determination to force the whole of he twenty pound on he acceptance on throw open he door he see he brother evidently strive to conceal something behind he book it be at the hour of breakfast and george have intend for a novelty to share he brother 's morning repast they always meet at dinner but the other meal be make in they own room george look in vain for the usual equipage of the table suspicion flash upon he he throw aside the book and a crust of bread and a glass of water meet he eye the truth now flash upon he in all its force franci my brother to what have my extravagance reduce you exclaim the contrite george with a heart nearly ready to burst franci endeavor to explain but a sacred regard to the truth hold he tongue-tied until drop he head on the shoulder of george he sob out -- it be a trifle nothing to what i would do for you my brother george feel all the horror of remorse and be much too generous to conceal he error any longer he write a circumstantial account of the whole transaction to lady margaret franci for a few day be a new be he have act nobly he conscience approve of he motive and of he delicate concealment of they he in fact begin to think there be in himself the seed of usefulness as he brother who from this moment begin to understand he character better attach himself more closely to he the eye of franci meet that of george with the look of acknowledged affection he mind become less moody and he face be sometimes embellish with a smile the reply of they mother to the communication of george throw a damp on the revive hope of the senior and drive he back into himself with tenfold humility i be shocked my child to find that you have lower yourself and forget the family you belong to so much as to frequent those gambling-house which ought not to be suffer in the neighborhood of the university : when at a proper age and in proper company you occasional indulgence at card i could not object to as both you father and myself sometimes resort to it as a amusement but never in low company the consequence of mingle in such society be that you be cheat and such will always be you lot unless you confine yourself to associate more become you rank and illustrious name as to franci i see every reason to condemn the course he have take be the senior by a year he should have take the means to prevent you fall into such company and he should have acquaint I immediately with you loss in place of wound you pride by subject you to the mortification of receive a pecuniary obligation from one so little older than yourself and expose he own health by a diet on bread and water as you write I for a whole month both the general and myself be seriously displeased with he and think of separate you as you thus connive at each other 's folly george be too indignant to conceal this letter and the reflection of franci be dreadful for a short time he actually meditate suicide as the only method of remove himself from before the advancement of george have not george be more attentive and affectionate than formerly the awful expedient might have be resort to from college the young man go one into the army and the other to the mansion of he uncle george become a elegant gay open-hearted admire captain in the guard and franci stalk through the hall of he ancestor they acknowledged future lord but a misanthrope hateful to himself and disagreeable to all around he this picture may be highly work but the effect in the case of franci be increase by the peculiar tone of he diseased state of mind the indulgence of favoritism nevertheless always bring its own sad consequence in a greater or less degree while it seldom fail to give sorrow and penitence to the bosom of the parent chapter xliii no little art and management have be necessary to make the admiral auxiliary to the indirect plan propose by he friend to bring george and isabel together this however effect the general turn he whole strategy to the impression to be make on the heart of the young gentleman sir frederick denbigh have the same idea of the virtue of management as the dowager lady chatterton but he understand human nature better like a prudent officer he attack be all mask and like a great officer they seldom fail of success the young couple be throw in each other 's way and as isabel be extremely attractive somewhat the opposite to himself in ardor of temperament and vivacity modest and sensible it can not be expect that the association be maintain by the youth with perfect impunity within a couple of month he fancy himself desperately in love with isabel howell and in truth he have some reason for the supposition the general watch every movement of he son with a wary and vigilant eye -- occasionally add fuel to the flame by draw he attention to project of matrimony in other quarter until george begin to think he be soon to undergo a trial of he constancy and in consequence he arm himself with a double portion of admiration for he isabel in order to enable himself to endure the persecution while the admiral several time endanger the success of the whole enterprise by volunteer contribution to the hope of the young man which only escape produce a

idea be so vivid and full of imagery or what do you think say a fourth speaking in a voice of harmony and tone of the most soothing tenderness of pity and compassion for the folly of those inferior mind who can not enjoy the reflection of a good sense and modesty peculiarly he own this might also be irony and franci think it so but the tone be so soft and conciliate that with a face pale with he emotion he venture to look up and meet the eye of marian fix on he in a expression that change he death-like hue into the color of vermillion he think of this speech he reason on it he dream on it but for the look which accompany it like the rest of the party he would have think it the cruellest cut of they all but that look those eye that voice what a commentary on she language do they not afford

may strive long and in vain to regain that singleness of heart which can bind she up so closely in she husband and child as to make she a good wife or a mother and if it should have degenerate into habit it may lead to the awful result of infidelity to she marriage vow it be vain for a coquette to pretend to religion its practice involve hypocrisy falsehood and deception -- everything that be mean -- everything that be debase in short as it be bottom on selfishness and pride where it have once possess the mind it will only yield to the truth-displaying banner of the cross this and this only can remove the evil for without it she whom the charm of youth and beauty have enable to act the coquette will descend into the vale of life alter it be true but not amend she will find the world with its allurement cling around she parting year in vain regret for day that be fly and in mercenary view for she descendant heaven bless you my child console and esteem you inestimable father while he yet remain with you and place you reliance on that heavenly parent who will never desert those who seek he in sincerity and love you die mother m pendennyss this letter evidently write under the excitement of deep remorse make a great impression on both she child in lady marian it be pity regret and abhorrence of the fault which have be the principal cause of the wreck of she mother 's peace of mind but in she brother now earl of pendennyss these feeling be unite with a jealous dread of he own probable lot in the chance of matrimony he uncle have be the suppose heir to a more elevated title than he own but he be now the actual possessor of as honorable a name and of much larger revenue the great wealth of he maternal grandfather and the considerable estate of he own father be or would soon be centre in himself and if a woman as amiable as faultless as affection have teach he to believe he mother to be could yield in she situation to the lure of worldly honor have he not great reason to dread that a hand might be bestow at some day upon himself when the heart would point out some other destination if the real wish of its owner be consult pendennyss be modest by nature and humble from principle though by no means distrustful yet the shock of discover he mother 's fault the gloom occasion by she death and he father 's decline health sometimes lead he into a train of reflection which at other he would have fervently deprecate a short time after the decease of the countess mr denbigh find he constitution fast give way under the wasting of a decline he have be in for a year resolve to finish he day in the abode of he christian friend doctor ive for several year they have not meet increase duty and infirmity on both side have interrupt they visit by easy stage he leave the residence of he son in wale and accompany by both he child he reach lumley castle much exhaust here he take a solemn and final leave of marian unwilling that she should so soon witness again the death of another parent and dismiss the earl 's equipage and attendant a short day 's ride from b -- they proceed alone to the rectory a letter have be forward acquaint the doctor of he approach visit wish it to be perfectly private but not allude to its object and name a day a week later than the one on which he arrive this plan be alter on perceive the torch of life more rapidly approach the socket than he have at first suppose he unexpected appearance and reception be know denbigh 's death and the departure of he son follow franci have be pendennyss 's companion to the tomb of he ancestor in westmoreland the earl have a shrink delicacy under the knowledge of he family history that make he anxious to draw all eye from the contemplation of he mother 's conduct how far the knowledge of it have extend in society he could not know but he wish it bury with she in the tomb the peculiar manner of he father 's death would attract notice and might recall attention to the prime cause of he disorder as yet all be veil and he wish the doctor 's family to let it remain so it be however impossible that the death of a man of mr denbigh 's rank should be unnoticed in the print and the care of franci dictate the simple truth without comment as it appear as regard the moseley what be more natural than that the son of _ mr denbigh _ should also be _ mr denbigh _ in the presence of the rector 's family no allusion be make to they friend and the villager and the neighborhood speak of they as old and young mr denbigh the name of lord lumley now earl of pendennyss be know to the whole british nation but the long retirement of he father and mother have drive they almost from the recollection of they friend even mr wilson suppose she favorite hero a lumley pendennyss castle have be for century the proud residence of that family and the change of name in its possessor be forget with the circumstance that have lead to it when therefore emily meet the earl so unexpectedly the second time at the rectory she of course with all she companion speak of he as mr denbigh on that occasion pendennyss have call in person in expectation of meet he kinsman lord bolton but find he absent he could not resist he desire to visit the rectory accordingly he send he carriage and servant on to london leave they at a convenient spot and arrive on foot at the house of dr ive from the same motive which have influence he before -- a wish to indulge undisturbed by useless ceremony he melancholy reflection -- he desire that he name might not be mention this be a easy task both doctor and mr ive have call he when a child george or lumley and be unused to he new appellation of pendennyss indeed it rather recall painful recollection to they all it may be remember that circumstance remove the necessity of any introduction to mr wilson and she party and the difficulty in that instance be happily get rid of the earl have often hear emily moseley speak of by he friend and in they letter they frequently mention she name as connect with they pleasure and employment and always with a affection pendennyss think exceed that which they manifest for they son 's wife and mr ive the evening before to remove unpleasant thought have give he a lively description of she person and character the earl 's curiosity have be a little excited to see this paragon of female beauty and virtue and unlike most curiosity on such subject he be agreeably disappoint by the examination he wish to know more and make interest with the doctor to assist he to continue the incognito with which accident have favor he the doctor object on the ground of principle and the earl desist but the beauty of emily aid by she character have make a impression not to be easily shake off and pendennyss return to the charge he former jealousy be awaken in proportion to he admiration and after some time he throw himself on the mercy of the divine by declare he new motive but without mention he parent the doctor pity he for he scan he feeling thoroughly and consent to keep silent but laughingly declare it be bad enough for a divine to be accessory to much less aid in a deception and that he know if emily and mr wilson learn he imposition he would lose ground in they favor by the discovery surely george say the doctor with a laugh you do not mean to marry the young lady as mr denbigh oh no it be too soon to think of marry she at all reply the earl with a smile but somehow i should like to see what my reception in the world will be as plain mr denbigh unprovided for and unknown no doubt my lord say the rector archly in proportion to you merit very unfavorably indeed but then you humility will be finally elevated by the occasional praise i have hear mr wilson lavish on you proper character of late i be much indebted to she partiality continue the earl mournfully then throw off he gloomy thought he add i wonder my dear doctor you goodness do not set she right in the latter particular why she have hardly give I a opportunity delicacy and my own feeling have keep I very silent on the subject of you family to any of that connexion they think i believe i be a rector in wale instead of you father 's chaplain and somehow continue the doctor smile on he wife the association with you late parent be so connect in my mind with my most romantic feeling that although i have delight in it i have seldom allude to it in conversation at all mr wilson have speak of you but twice in my hearing and that since she have expect to meet you you name have doubtless recall the remembrance of she husband i have many many reason to remember the general with gratitude cry the earl with fervor but doctor do not forget my incognito : only call I george i ask no more the plan of pendennyss be put in execution day after day he linger in northamptonshire until he principle and character have grow upon the esteem of the moseley in the manner we have mention he frequent

the desire station for the baron the result be know and pendennyss trust he secret to chatterton he take he to london give he in charge to derwent and return to prosecute he own suit he note from bolton castle be a _ ruse _ to conceal he character as he know the departure of the baronet 's family to a hour and have so time he visit to the earl as not to come in collision with the moseley indeed my lord cry the doctor to he one day you scheme go on swimmingly and i be only afraid when you mistress discover the imposition you will find you rank produce a different effect from what you

history henry egerton have be turn early on the world hundred of he countryman without any principle to counteract the art of infidelity or resist the temptation of life he father hold a situation under government and be devote to he rise in the diplomatic line he mother be a woman of fashion who live for effect and idle competition with she sister in weakness and folly all he learn in he father 's house be selfishness from the example of one and a love of high life and its extravagance from the other he enter the army young and from choice the splendor and reputation of the service catch he fancy and by pride and constitution he be indifferent to personal danger yet he love london and its amusement better than glory and the money of he uncle sir edgar whose heir he be repute to be raise he to the rank of lieutenant colonel without he spend a hour in the field egerton have some ability and a good deal of ardor of temperament by nature the former from indulgence and example degenerate into acquire the art to please in mixed society and the latter from want of employment expend itself at the card table the association between the vice be intimate there really appear to be a kind of modesty in sin that make it ashamed of good company if we be unable to reconcile a favorite propensity to we principle we be apt to abandon the unpleasant restraint on we action rather than admit the incongruous mixture free entirely from the fetter of we moral what be there that we vice will not prompt we to commit egerton like thousand of other go on from step to step until he find himself in the world free to follow all he inclination so he violate none of the decency of life when in spain in he only campaign he be accidentally as have be mention throw in the way of the donna

thought than the commission of any other than the crime that accord to he code a gentleman might be guilty of with impunity it be however the misfortune of sin that from be we slave it become a tyrant and egerton attempt what in other country and where the law rule might have cost he he life the conjecture of pendennyss be true he see the face of the officer who interpose between he and he villanous attempt but be hide himself from view he aim not at he life but at he own escape happily he first shot succeed for the earl would have be sacrifice to preserve the character of a man of honor though no one be more regardless of the estimation he be hold in by the virtuous than colonel egerton in pursuance of he plan on mr fitzgerald the colonel have sedulously avoid admit any of he companion into the secret of he have a female in he care when he leave the army to return home he remain until a movement of the troops to a distant part of the country enable he to effect he own purpose without incur they ridicule and when he find himself oblige to abandon he vehicle for a refuge in the wood the fear of detection make he alter he course and under the pretence of wish to be in a battle about to be fight he secretly rejoin the army and the gallantry of colonel egerton be mention in the next despatch sir herbert nicholson command the advanced guard at which the earl arrive with the donna julium and like every other brave man -lrb- unless guilty himself -rrb- be indignant at the villany of the fugitive the confusion and enormity daily practice in the theater of the war prevent any close inquiry into the subject and circumstance have so enveloped egerton in mystery that nothing but a interview with the lady herself be likely to expose he with sir herbert nicholson he have be in habit of intimacy and on that gentleman 's allude in a conversation in the barracks at f -- to the lady bring into he quarter before lisbon he accidentally emit mention the name of she rescuer egerton have never before hear the transaction speak of and as he have of course never mention the subject himself be ignorant who have interfere between he and he view also of the fate of

have a infant fondness for play without a adequate skill and the money of the young lady in he necessity be become of importance but the daughter of sir edward moseley be of a description more suit to he taste and they portion be as ample as the other he have become in some degree attach to jane and as she imprudent parent satisfy with he possess the exterior and requisite recommendation of a gentleman admit he visit freely he determine to make she he wife when he meet denbigh the first time he see that chance have throw he in the way of a man who might hold he character in he power he have never see he as pendennyss and it will be remember be ignorant of the name of julium 's friend : he now learn for the first time that it be denbigh uneasy at he know not what fearful of some exposure he know not how when sir herbert allude to the occurrence with a view to rebut the charge if denbigh should choose to make one and with the near-sightedness of guilt he pretend to know the occurrence and under the promise of secresy mention that the name of the officer be denbigh he have notice denbigh avoid sir herbert at the ball and judge other from himself think it be a wish to avoid any allusion to the lady he have bring into the other 's quarter that induce the measure for he be in hope that if denbigh be not as guilty as himself he be sufficiently so to wish to keep the transaction from the eye of emily he be however prepare for a explosion or a alliance with he when the sudden departure of sir herbert remove the danger of a collision believe at last that they be to be brother-in-law and mistake the earl for he cousin whose name he bear egerton become reconcile to the association while pendennyss have in he absence hear on inquire some of the vice of the colonel

she be keep there by denbigh immediately occur to he and although he be surprise at the audacity of the thing he be determine to profit by the occasion to pay this visit he stay away from the excursion on the water as pendennyss have do to avoid he friend lord henry stapleton a excuse of business which serve for he apology keep the colonel from see denbigh to return the book until after he visit to the cottage he rhapsody of love and offer to desert he intended wife be nothing but the common-place talk of he purpose and he presumption in allude to he situation with miss moseley proceed from he impression as to julium 's real character in the struggle for the bell the pocket-book of denbigh accidentally fall from he coat and the retreat of the colonel be too precipitate to enable he to recover it mr fitzgerald be too much alarm to distinguish nicely and egerton proceed to the ball-room with the indifference of a hardened offender when the arrival of miss jarvi to whom he have commit himself prompt he to a speedy declaration and the unlucky conversation of mr holt bring about a probable detection of he gaming propensity the colonel determine to get rid of he awkward situation and he debt by a coup-de-main he accordingly elope with miss jarvi what portion of the foregoing narrative make the die confession of egerton to the man he have so lately discover to be the

condition when here or at lumley castle surround by my tenantry there be i confess moment of weakness in which the loss of my wealth or rank would be miss greatly but when on service subject to great privation and surround by man superior to I in military rank who say unto I -- go and i go -- come and i come -- i find my enjoyment intrinsically the same that say franci may be owe to you lordship 's temper feeling which have teach you to look beyond this world for pleasure and consolation it have doubtless a effect say the earl but there be no truth of which i be more fully persuade than that we happiness here do not depend upon we lot in life so we be not suffer for necessaries -- even change bring less real misery than they be suppose to do doubtless cry mr haughton under the circumstance i would not wish to change even with you lordship -- unless indeed he continue with a smile and bow to the countess it be the temptation of you lovely wife you be quite polite say emily

servant announce the several carriage at the door the younger part of the company now hasten to they different engagement and chatterton hand harriet john grace and pendennyss emily into they respective carriage the duke and lady marian follow but at some little distance from the rest of the party as the earl drive from the door the countess look up to a window at which be stand she aunt and doctor ive she kiss she hand to they with a face in which glow the mingled expression of innocence love and joy before leave the park the party pass sir edward with he wife lean on one arm and jane on the other pursue they daily walk the baronet follow the carriage with he eye and exchange look of the fondest love with he child as they drive slowly and respectfully by he and if the glance which follow on jane do not speak equal pleasure it surely denote its proper proportion of paternal love you have much reason to congratulate yourself on the happy termination of you labor say the doctor with a smile to the widow emily be place so far as human foresight can judge in the happiest of all station a female can be in : she be the pious wife of a pious husband beloved and deserving of it yes say mr wilson draw back from follow the phaeton with she eye they be as happy as this world will admit and what be better they be well prepare to meet any reverse of fortune which may occur as well as to discharge the duty on which they have enter i do not think continued she muse that pendennyss can ever doubt the affection of such a woman as emily i should think not say the doctor but what can excite such a think in you breast and one so much to the prejudice of george the only unpleasant thing i have ever observe in he say mr wilson gravely be the suspicion which induce he to adopt the disguise in which he enter we family he do not adopt it madam -- chance and circumstance draw it around he accidentally and when you consider the peculiar state of he mind from the discovery of he mother 's misconduct -- he own great wealth and rank -- it be not so surprising that he should yield to a deception rather harmless than injurious dr ive say mr wilson be not wont to defend deceit nor do i now madam reply the doctor with a smile i acknowledge the offence of george myself wife and son i remonstrate at the time upon principle i say the end would not justify the means that a departure from ordinary rule of propriety be at all time dangerous and seldom practice with impunity and you fail to convince you hearer cry mr wilson gaily a novelty in you case my good rector i thank you for the compliment say the doctor i do convince they as to the truth of the principle but the earl contend that he case might make a innocent exception he have the vanity to think i believe that by conceal he real name he injure himself more than any one else and get rid of the charge in some such way he be however thoroughly convince of the truth of the position by practice he suffering grow out of the mistake of he real character and which could not have happen have he appear in proper person have be greater than he be ready to acknowledge if they study the fate of the donna julium and he own weakness say the widow they will have a salutary moral always at hand to teach they the importance of two cardinal virtue at least -- obedience and truth julium have suffer much reply the doctor and although she have return to she father the consequence of she imprudence be likely to continue when once the bond of mutual confidence and respect be break they may be partially restore it be true but never with a warmth and reliance such as exist previously to return however to yourself do you not feel a sensation of delight at the prosperous end of you exertion in behalf of emily it be certainly pleasant to think we have discharge we duty and the task be much easier than we be apt to suppose say mr wilson it be only to commence the foundation so that it will be able to support
