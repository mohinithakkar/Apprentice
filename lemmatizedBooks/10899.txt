and lonely olivia _ ss scotium oct _ 21 -lrb- _ in pencil _ -rrb- whatever you do whatever folly you commit never never be tempt to take a sea voyage it be quite the nastiest thing you can take -- i have have three day of it now so i know when i write to you on Saturday i have a uneasy feeling that in the near future all would not be well with I but i go in to dinner and afterwards walk up and down the deck try to feel brave Sunday morning dawn rain-washed and tempestuous and the way the ship heave be not encouraging but i rise or rather i descend from my perch -- do i tell you i have a upper berth -- and walk with a undulating motion towards my bath some people would have remain in bed or at least go unbathed but as i say i rise -- mark please the rugged grandeur of the scot character -- and such be the force of example the fair-haired girl rise also before i go any further i must tell you about this girl she name be hilton geraldine hilton but as that be too long a name and already we be great friend i call she g she be very pretty with the kind of prettiness that become more so the more you look -- and if you do not know what i mean i can not stop to explain -- with mass of yellow hair such blue eye and pink cheek and white tooth that i be convinced i be share a cabin with the original han andersen 's snow queen she be very big and most healthy and delightful to look at even sea-sickness do not make she look plain and that you will admit be a severe test and what be more she nature be as healthy and sweet as she face you will laugh and say it be like I to know all about anyone in three day but two sea-sick and home-sick people shut up in a tiny cabin can exhibit quite a lot of trait pleasant and otherwise in three day well we dress and reach the saloon sink into we seat only to leave again hurriedly when a steward approach to know if we would have porridge or kippered herring i know you be never sea-sick unlovable creature that you be so you will not sympathize with we as we lay limp and wretched in we deck-chair on the damp and draughty deck even the fact that we deck-chair be brand-new and have we name boldly paint in handsome black letter across the back fail to give we a thrill of pleasure at last it become too utterly miserable to be bear the sight of the deck-steward bring round cup of half-cold beef-tea with grease spot float on the top prove the last straw so with a graceful wavering flight like a woodcock we zigzag to we bunk where we have remain ever since i do not know where we be i expect ushant have slam the door on we long ago we little world be bound by the four wall of the cabin all day we lie and listen to the swish of the wave as they tumble past and watch we dressing-gown hang on the door swing backwards and forwards with the motion at interval the stewardess come in a nice scotswoman -- corrie she tell I be she home-place -- and bring the menu of breakfast -- luncheon -- dinner and we turn away we head and say nothing -- nothing we steward be a funny little man very small and thin with pale yellow hair he remind I of a moulting canary and he voice cheep and be rather canary-like too he be really a very kind little steward and trot about most diligently on we errand and try to cheer we by tale of the people he have know who have die of sea-sickness : strain they ` eart miss that be wot they do it be not very cheerful lie here look out through the port-hole now at the sky next at the sea but what it would have be without g i dare not think we have certainly help each other through this time of trial it be a wonderful blessing a companion in misfortune but where you may ask be the third occupant of the cabin would it not have be fearful if she too have be stretch on a couch of languish happily she be a good sailor though she do not look it she be a little woman with a pale green complexion and a lot of sleek black hair and somehow give one the impression of have a great many more tooth than be usual she name be mrs murray and she be go to indium to rejoin she husband who rejoice in the name of albert sometimes i feel a little sorry for albert but perhaps after all he deserve what he have get she have very assertive manners i think she regard g and I as two young woman who want keep in they place though i be sure we be humble enough now whatever we may be in a state of rude health happily she have friend on board so she rarely come to the cabin except to tidy up before meal and afterwards to tell we exactly everything she have eat she seem to have a good appetite and to choose the thing that sound nastiest when one be seedy no -- i do not like mr murray much but i dislike she hat-box more it be large and square and black and it have no business in the cabin it ought to be in the baggage-room lie up here i be free from its tyranny but on Saturday when i be unpack it make my life a burden it block up the floor under my hook and when i hang thing up i fall over it backwards when i sit on the floor which i have to do every time i pull out my trunk it hit I savagely on the spine and once when i try balance it on a small chest of drawer it promptly fall down on my head and i have still a large and painful bump as a memento i wonder if you will be able to make this letter out i be write it a little bit at a time to keep myself from get too dreadfully down-hearted g and i have both very damp handkerchief under we pillow to testify to the depressed state of we mind when i be at home i be in a better place but traveller must be content i do not even care to read any of the book i bring with I except now and then a page or two of _ memory and portrait _ it comfort I to read of such steady quiet place as the pentland hill and of the decent man who do they herding there be it really only three day since i leave you all and you envy I go out into the sunshine oh you warm comfortable people how i in this heave uncertain horror of a ship envy you _ 25th _ -lrb- _ still in pencil _ -rrb- you must not think i have be lie here all the time on Tuesday we manage to get on deck and on Wednesday it be warm and sunny and we begin to enjoy life again and to congratulate ourselves on have get we sea-leg but we get they only to lose they for yesterday the wind get up the ship roll we become every minute more thoughtful until about tea-time we retire in disorder it do not need the little steward 's shocked remark oh my you never ` ave go back to bed again to make we feel ashamed however we reach marseille to-day at noon and glorious think the ship will stand still for twenty-four hour also there will be letter this be not a letter so much as a wail do not scoff i know i be a coward _ ssscotium oct 27 _ a fountain-pen be really a great comfort i be write with my new one so this letter will not i hope be such a puzzle to decipher as my pencil scrawl we be off again but now the sun shine from a cloudless sky on a sea of sapphire and the passenger be sun themselves on deck like snail after a shower i be glad after all i do not go back from marseille by train when we reach marseille the rain be pour but that do not prevent we -lrb- we mean g and myself -rrb- from bound on shore we find a dilapidated _ fiacre _ drive by a still more dilapidated _ cocher _ who for the sum of six franc drive we to the town i do not know whether ordinarily marseille be a beautiful town or a ugly one few people i expect would have see anything attractive in it this dark rainy October afternoon but to we it be a sort of paradise regain we have tea at a café real french tea tasting of hay-seed and lukewarm water and real french cake we wander through the street stop to stare in at every shop window we buy violet to adorn ourselves and picture-postcard and sheet of foreign stamp for peter and all the time the rain pour and the street lamp be cheerily reflect in the wet pavement and it be so damp and dark and dirty and home-like we slopper joyfully through the mud and be happy for the first time for a whole week the thought of letter be the only thing that tempt we back to the ship i hear from all the home people even peter write a most characteristic epistle with only about half the word wrongly spell and finish with a spirited drawing of the _ scotium _ attack by pirate a abject figure crouching in the bow be label you how i miss that young brother of mine i ache to see he nubbly feature -lrb- nubbly be a portmanteau word and exactly describe they -rrb- and the hair that no brush can persuade to lie straight and to hear the broad accent -- a legacy from a nurse who hail from a mining village in lithgow -- which be such a trial to he relative i have no illusion about peter 's look any more than he have himself a too candid relative comment once on he excessive plainness in he presence he reply yes i know but i have a nice good face i sometimes feel that if peter turn out badly it will be greatly my fault mother be so busy with many thing that i naturally as the big sister do most of the training and it be not easy when i read to he on Sunday _ tale of the covenanter _ he at once make up he mind that he much prefer claverhouse to john brown of priesthill a unheard-of heresy and yawn vigorously announce that he be as dull as a bull and as sick as a daisy one night when i go to hear he say he prayer he say : i be not go to say any prayer oh peter i say why ` cos i have pray for a whole year it would be snow on christmas and it be not -- just rain then i say very gravely god will not take care of you through the night put I in my bed say the little ruffian and i 'll see and i be awaken at break of day by a small figure in pyjamas dance at my bedside shout with unholy joy i be here you see i be here and it be week before i could bring he to a better state of mind so much younger than any of we -- the other boy be at oxford when he be in he first knickerbockers -- he be a lonely little soul and live in a world of he own people by the creature of he own imagining he great friend be mr bathboth of bathboth -- do not you like the name -- and he would come in from a walk with he nurse fling down he cap and remark i have be see mr bathboth in he own house -- oh a lovely house it be a _ public-house _ i be afraid he be a very low character this mr bathboth accord to peter he smoke and he swore and he put he finger to he nose when he mother say he be not to so we be not surprise to hear of he end he be pull up to heaven by a crane for bathing in the sea on Sunday another of peter 's creature be a bogle call windy wallop who live in the garret and could only be repulse with hairbrush whippetie stoowrie on the other hand be a kindly creature inhabit the nursery chimney and give to lay small offering such as a pistol and cap or a sugar mouse on the fender a strange fancy once take peter to dig grave for we all in the garden it be not that he dislike we on the contrary he consider he be do we a honor my grave be suggestively near the rubbish-heap but he point out that it be because the lily-of-the-valley grow there one day he come in earthy but determined-looking dodo do not send I anything for my birthday he announce so i have _ fill up he grave _ now peter have go to school and have put away childish thing and the desire to be a knight like launcelot he no longer babble to himself in such a way as to make stranger doubt of he sanity and he confide to I lately that when he grow up he hope to lead a double life he who be bring up in camelot he who weep when roland at roncesvalle blow he horn for the last time now devour blood-curdling detective story vile thing in paper cover which he keep conceal about he person and whip out at odd moment what he hate be a book with the slightest hint of a love affair i find he disgustedly punch a book with he fist and muttering -lrb- evidently to the hero -rrb- i know you i know you you be in love with she in tone of bitter scorn when i begin to speak about peter i can not stop and forget how tiresome it must be for people to listen i apologize but please bear with I when i enlarge upon this brother of mine i simply must sometimes how good of you to write such a long letter of course i shall write often and at length but you must promise not to be bore or expect too much i fear you will not get anything very wise or witty from I you know how limited i be the fairy when they come to my christen might have come better provide with gift but then i expect they have only a certain number of gift for each family so i do not in the least blame they for give the boy the brain and give I -- what at the moment i can not think of anything they do give I except a heart that keep on the windy side of care as beatrice put it and hair that curl naturally i have no grudge against the fairy if they have give I straight hair and brain i might have be a suffragist and shame my kin by bite a policeman and _ that _ would have be a pity _ later _ g and i be crouch in a corner very awed and sad a poor man die suddenly yesterday from heart failure and the funeral be just over i do hope i shall never again see a burial at sea it be terrible the bell toll and the ship slow down and almost stop while the body wrap in a union jack be slip into the water commit to the deep in sure and certain hope of a bless resurrection in a minute it be all over the people be laugh and talk again the dressing-bugle have sound thing go on as if nothing have happen we be steam ahead leave the body -- such a little speck it look on the great water -- far behind it be the utter loneliness of it that make I cry _ ss scotium oct 29 _ this will not be a tidy letter for i be sit close beside the rail -- have it a nautical name i do not know -- and every few minute the spray come over and wet the paper and incidentally myself _ and _ the fountain-pen i greatly fear it leak for my middle finger be blacken beyond hope of cleanse and though not ten minute ago mr brand ink himself very comprehensively fill it for I already it require frequent shaking to make it write at all i think it would be a blessing it threaten to become a curse i foresee that very shortly i shall descend again to a pencil or write my letter with the aid of scratchy pen and fat respectable ink-pot in the stuffy music-room you will have two letter from port say the one i write you two day ago finish in deep melancholy but to-day it be so good to be alive i could shout with joy i wake this morning with a jump of delight and even mr albert murray -- she of the hat-box and the many tooth -- could not irritate I and you can not think how many irritating way the woman have it be 10 be and we have just come up from breakfast and have get we deck-chair place where they will catch every breeze -lrb- and some salt water -rrb- and with a pile of book and two box of chocolate be comfortably settle for the day you ask about the passenger we have all sort and condition quiet people who read and work all day rowdy people who never seem happy unless they be throw cushion or pull one another downstairs by the foot painfully enterprising people who get up sport sweep concert and dance and be full of a tiresome misplace energy bridge-loving people who play from morning till night flirtatious people who frequent dark corner happy people who laugh sad people who sniff and one man who can not be class with anyone else a sad gentleman he hair stand fiercely on end a greek testament he constant and only companion we pine to know who and what he be and where he be go yesterday i find myself beside he at tea i might not have exist for all the notice he take of I speak to he say g in my ear you do not dare of course after that i have to so pinching g 's arm to give myself courage i say in a small voice be you enjoy the voyage he turn regard I with he sad prominent eye do i look as if i enjoy it ask this monsieur melancholy and go back to he bread-and-butter g choke and i finish my tea hurriedly and in silence nearly everyone on board seem nice and willing to be pleasant i be on smile term with most and speak term with many but one really see very little of the people outside one 's own little set it be odd how people drift together and make clique there be eight in we particular set colonel and mr crawley major and mr wilmot captain gordon mr brand g and myself the crawley the wilmot and captain gordon be go back after furlough mr brand and g and i be go only for pleasure and the cold weather we table be much the merriest in the saloon mr crawley be a fascinating woman i never tire watch she very pretty very smart with a pretty wit she have the most delightfully gay infectious laugh which contrast oddly with she curiously sad unsmiling eye mr wilmot have a madonna face i do not mean one of those silly fat-faced madonna one see in the louvre and elsewhere but one 's own idea of the madonna the kind of face as someone put it that god must love she be not pretty and she be not in the least smart but she be just a kind sweet wise woman she husband be a cheery soul very big and boyish and always in uproarious spirit captain gordon make a good listener mr brand although he must have leave school quite ten year ago be still very reminiscent of eton and have a school-boyish taste in silly rhyme and riddle colonel crawley a stern and somewhat awe-inspiring man a distinguished soldier i be tell hate _ passionately _ be ask riddle and we make he frantic at table repeat mr brand 's witticism he sit with a patient disgusted face while we repeat owen more have run away owin ' more than he could pay owen more come back one day owin ' more and when he can bear it no longer leave the table remark _ titbit _ he have he revenge the other day when the ship be roll more than a little we have venture to the saloon for tea and be survey uncertainly some dry toast when colonel crawley come in ah he say steward pork chop for these lady the mere thought prove the thing too much we flee to the fresh air -- tealess i mean this to be a very long letter but this pen faint yet pursue show sign of give out i have to shake it every second word now the bugle have go for lunch and g who have be sound asleep for the last hour be uncoil herself preparatory to go down so good-bye _ ss scotium nov 1 _ all day we have glide through the canal imagine a shine band of silver water a band of deepest blue sky and in between a bar of fine gold which be the desert -- and you have some idea of what i be look at sometimes a arab pass ride on a camel and i can not get away from the feeling that i be a child again look at a highly color bible picture-book on sabbath afternoon we land at port say yesterday morning people tell we it be a dirty place a uninteresting place a horribly dull place not worth leave the ship to see but it be we first glimpse of the east and we be enchant the narrow street the white dome and minaret against the blue sky the flat roof of the house the queer shop with the arab shout to draw attention to they wares and above all the new strange smell of the east be to we wonderful and fascinating when we get ashore the sun be shine with a directness hitherto unknown to we make the back of we unprotected head feel somewhat insecure so we go first to a shop where we spy expose to sale a rich profusion of topi in case you do not know a topi be a sun-hat a white thing large and saucer-like line with green with cork about it somewhere rather suggestive of a lifebelt horribly unbecoming but quite necessary a very polite man bow we inside and we proceed on we quixotic search for a topi not entirely hideous half a hour later we come out of the shop the shopman more obsequious than ever not only wear topi but laden with box of turkish delight ostrich-feather fan tinsel scarf and a string of pink bead which he swear be coral but i greatly doubt it we have a uneasy feeling as we buy the thing that perhaps we be foolish virgin but before the afternoon be very old we be sure of it you would not believe how heavy turkish delight become when you carry half a dozen box for some hour under a blaze sun and i have a carve book-rest under one arm and g have four parcel and a green umbrella to complete we disgust after welter under we purchase for some time we see in a shop exactly the same thing much cheaper g point a wrathful finger let two parcel fall to do it look at that she say i be go straight back to tell the man he be cheat we with difficulty i persuade she it be not worth while and tired and dusty we sink -- no we do not sink they be iron chair -- we sit down hard on chair outside a big hotel and demand tea immediately some of the ship people be also have tea at little table and a party of evil-looking frenchman be twang guitar and singing sentimental song for penny while we be wait a man -- a arab i think -- crouch beside we and beg we to let he read we hand for half a crown and we be weak enough to permit it you may be interested to know that i be to be marry soon already to a high official with gold in he tooth it sound ideal g be rather awed by the varied career he sketch for she after tea which be long in come and when it come disappointing we have still some time so we hail a man drive a depressed-looking horse attach to a carriage of sort and tell he to drive we all round he look a very wicked man but it may have be the effect of he only have one eye for he certainly have a refine taste in sight when we suggest that we would like to see the arab bazaar he shake he head violently and instead drive we along dull road stop now and again to wave a vague whip towards some building remark in most melancholy tone as he do so the english church -- the american mission back on the ship again sit on deck in the soft darkness watch the light of the town and hear a faint echo of the life there i realize with something of a shock that it be hallow-e ` en do that convey nothing to you mind to I it bring back memory of cold fast-shortening day and myself jump long-legged over cabbage-stalk in the kitchen-garden chanting -- this be the nicht o ' hallow-e ` en when a ' the witch will be see -- in fearful hope of see a witch not mount on a broomstick but on the respectable household cat change for that night into a fly fury finally along with my brother be capture wash and dress to join with other spirit worse than ourselves in dook for apple and eat mashed potato in momentary expectation of swallow a threepenny-bit or a thimble to-night far from the other spirit far from the chill wind and the cabbage-stalk i have be watch the sunset on the desert make the world a glory of rose and gold and amethyst now it be dark the light be light all over the ship the floor of heaven be thick inlay with patine of bright gold in such a night do young lorenzo _ nov 2 1130 be _ we fellow-passenger derive much amusement from the way we sit and scribble and one man ask I if i be write a book all this time i have not mention the port say letter we get they before we leave the ship and determine for once to show myself a well-balanced sensible young person i take mine to the cabin and lock they firmly in a trunk tell myself how nice it would be to read they in peace on my return the spirit be willing but -- i find i must rush down to take just a peep to see if everyone be well and the game end with I sit uncomfortably on the knobby edge of mr albert murray 's bunk breathlessly tear open envelope they be all delightful and i have read they many time i have yours beside I now and to make it like a real talk i shall answer each point as it come you say the sun have not shine since i leave be you by any chance pay I a compliment or be you merely state a fact as pet marjorie would say i be prim up with majestic pride because of the compliment i receive one lady whose baby i hold for a little this morning tell I i have such a sweet unspoiled disposition but what really please I and make I feel inch taller be that captain gordon tell someone who tell I that he think i have great stability of character it be odd how one love to be tell one have what one have not i who have no more stability of character than a pussy-cat feel warm with gratitude only -- i should like to make my exit now before he discover how mistaken he be yes i wish you be sit by my side race through the wave indeed i wish all my dear people be here be you really feel lonely you popular young man of many engagement lonely and dissatisfied be you word but why why surely no one ever have less reason to feel dissatisfied there be very many people my friend who would not mind be you and yet you be not thankful not thankful for the interesting life you have the play you see the dinner you eat the charming woman you talk to the ball you dance at the club you frequent -- though what a man do at he club beyond escape for a brief season from he womenkind i never quite know think how nice to be a man and not have to look pleased when one be really bore to extinction if you be bore you have only to slip away to you most comfortable room do i tell you how much i like you room that day margie and i go to tea with you or be we too busy talk about other thing now do not be like peter he be grumble about something and i tell he to go away and count he blessing he go obediently and return triumphant i have do it he say and i have six thing to be thankful for and nine to be unthankful for -- one thing for which i think you might feel unthankful be you lamentable lack of near relation it be hard to be quite alone in the world for i agree aunt do not count for much weigh in the balance they be generally find woefully want i remember once when we be laugh over some escapade of we childhood you say you have no very pleasant recollection of you childish day that you do not look forward to holiday and that you happiest time be at school because then you have companion i feel quite sad when i think what you miss we be very lucky four of we grow up together and i sometimes wonder if other child have the same full splendid time we have and if they employ it get into as many scrape the village people shake they head over we and we probable end use to say they be a ' bad but the lassie -lrb- meaning I -rrb- be the verra deil we be bad but we be also extraordinarily happy i treasure up all sort of memory some of they very trivial and absurd store they away in lavender and when i feel dreary i take they out and refresh myself with they one episode i specially remember though why i should tell you about it i do not quite know for it be a small thing and silly sooth we be stay at the time with we grandmother the grandmother i be call for a very stern and stately lady -- the only person i have ever really stand in awe of we have be wander all day lead by john search for hidden treasure at the rainbow 's foot climb high hill to see if the world come to a end at the other side or some equally fantastic quest it be dark and almost supper-time and we have commit the heinous crime of not appear for tea so when we be tell to go at once to see we grandmother and stumble just as we be tired and dusty hair on end and stocking at we ankle into the quiet room where she sit knit fleecy white thing by the table with the lamp we expect nothing better than to be send straight to bed probably supperless we grandmother lay down she knitting take off she spectacles and instead of the rebuke we expect and deserve say bairn come away in i be sure you must be tire it have be a unsuccessful day we have find no treasure not even the world 's end the night have fall damp with a eerily sigh wind which depress we vaguely as we trudge homewards but now the black night shut out there be the fire-light and the lamp-light the kind old voice and the delicious sense of have come home all thing consider you be a young man greatly to be envy also at the present moment to be scold how can you possibly allow yourself to think such silly thing you must have a most exaggerated idea of my charm if you think every man on board must be in love with I man be not so impressionable do you think that when my well-nigh unearthly beauty burst on they they would fall on they knee and with one voice exclaim be mine i assure you no one have ever even think of do anything of the kind and if they have _ i would not tell you _ i know you be only chaff but i do so hate all that sort of thing and to hear people talk of they conquest be revolt one of the nicest thing about g be that she do not care a bit to philander about with man she and i be much happier talk to each other a fact which people seem to find hard to believe my attention be be divert from my write by a lady sit a few yard away -- the candle we call she because so many silly young moth hover round she be a buxom person with very golden hair grow darker towards the root hard blue eye and a powdery white face g and i be intensely interested to know what be the attraction about she for no one can deny there be one she be not young the god have not make she fair and i doubt of she honesty yet from the first she have be surround by man -- most of they i grant you unfinished youth bind to office in calcutta but still man i think it might be she brilliant conversation but for the last half-hour i have listen -- indeed we have no choice but to listen the voice be so strident -- and it can not be that because it be not brilliant or even amusing unless to call man name like pyjamas or fatty or tubby and slap they playfully at interval be amusing a few minute ago mr crawley come to sit with we look so fresh in a white linen dress i do not know why it be -- she wear the simplest clothes and yet she manage to make all the other woman look dowdy she have the gift too of know the right thing to wear on every occasion at port say for instance the costume be vary the candle flop on shore in a trail white lace dress and a enormous hat some broil in serge coat and skirt mr crawley in a soft green muslin and rose-wreathed hat be a cool and dainty vision well to return as mr crawley shake up she chintz cushion she look across at the candle -- a long look that take in the elaborate golden hair the much too smart blouse the abbreviated skirt show the high-heeled slipper the crowd of callow youth -- and then smile slightly to herself settle down in she chair i grow hot all over for the candle i do not suppose i need trouble myself i expect she be use to have woman look at she like that and do not mind do she really like silly boy so much and other woman so little i wonder there be generally something rather nasty about a woman who declare she can not get on with other woman and whom other woman do not like man have a absurd notion that we can not admire another woman or admit she good point it be not so we admire a pretty woman just as much as you do the only difference be you man think that if a woman have a lovely face it follow as the night the day that she must have a lovely disposition we know better that be all the poor candle i feel so mean and guilty write about she under she very eye so to speak she look at I just now quite kindly i have a good mind to tear this up but after all what do it matter my silly little observation will not make any impression on you masculine mind only do not say spiteful little cat because i do not mean to be really this be much the longest letter i ever write you will have to read a page at a time and then take a long breath and try again mr brand have just come up to ask we why a sculptor die a horrible death do you know _ ss scotium nov 6 _ no one unendowed with the temper of a angel and the patience of a job should attempt the voyage to indium mr albert murray have neither of these qualification any more than i have and for two day she have not deign to address a remark to g or I all because of a lose pair of stocking a loss which we treat with unseemly levity however the chill haughtiness of we cabin companion be something of a relief in this terrible heat for it _ be _ hot i be write in the cabin and in spite of the fact that there be two electric fan buzz on either side of I i be hotter than i can say and deplorably ill-tempered four time this morning try to keep out of mr albert murray 's way i have fall over that wretched hat-box still here despite we hint about the baggage-room and now in revenge i be sit on it though what the owner would say if she come in suddenly and find to what base use i have put she treasure i dare not let myself think g have a bad headache and it be dull for she to be alone so that be the reason why i be in the cabin at all to be honest it be most unpleasant on deck rainy with a damp hot wind blowing and the music-room be crowd and stuffy beyond word or i might not be unselfish enough to remain with g i do go up and a fat person whose nurse be ill give I she baby to hold a poor white-faced fretful baby who pull down all my hair and i have have the unpleasant task of do it up again if you have ever stand in a very hot greenhouse with the door shut and wrestle with something above you head you will know what i feel we pass aden yesterday and stop for a few hour to coal that be the limit the sun beat down on the deck the absence of the slightest breeze coal-dust sift into everything -- ouf aden 's barren rock remind I rather of the skye coolin i wonder if they be climbable i have not trouble you much have i with account of the entertainment on board but i think i must tell you about a whistle competition we have the other day you must know that we have each a partner and the woman sit at one end of the deck and the man stand at the other and be tell the tune they have to whistle when they rush to we and each whistle he tune to he partner who have to write the name on a piece of paper and hand it back and the man who get back to the umpire first win -- at least he partner do do you understand well as you know i have not much ear for music and i hope i would get a easy tune but when my partner a long thin earnest man with a stutter burst on I and whistle wildly in my face i have the hopeless feeling that i have never hear the tune before in he earnestness he come nearer and nearer he contortion every moment become more extraordinary he whistle more piercing and i by this time convulse by awful helpless laughter could only shrink farther back in my seat and gasp feebly please do not mr crawley be not much better in my own misery i be aware of she voice say politely i have no idea what the tune be but you whistle beautifully -- quite like a gramophone when my disgusted and exhaust partner cease try to emulate a steam-engine and begin to look human again i timidly inquire what he have be whistle the tune he reply very stiffly be ` rule britannium ' dear I i reply meekly i think at least it be something from _ die meistersinger _ but he deign no reply and walk away evidently hate I quite bitterly i sha not play that game again and i can not believe the silly man really whistle rule britannium for it be a simple tune and one with which i be entirely at home whereas -- but no matter g win by guess annie laurie she be splendid at all game and do i tell you how well she sing in the cabin when we be alone she sing to I snatch of all sort of song grave and gay but she will not sing in the saloon where every other woman on board with the smallest pretension to a voice carol nightly she be a most attractive person this g with quaint little whimsical way that make she very lovable we be together every minute of the day and yet we never tire of one another 's company i rather think i do most of the talk if it be true that to be slow in word be a woman 's only virtue then indeed be my state pitiable for talk i must and g be a delightful person to talk to she listen to my tale of peter and the other and ask for more and shout with laughter at the smallest joke i pass as a wit with g and have a great success she be go to stay with a married sister for the cold weather quite like I only i be go to a unmarried brother i think we be both get slightly impertinent to we elder they tease we so at meal in the saloon we have to answer back in self-defence and it be very difficult to help try to be smart sometimes at least with I it degenerate into rudeness i tell you about all the people at we table but i forget one -- a very aged man with a long white beard rather like the evil magician in the fairy tale but most harmless old sir thoma erpingham i call he for i be sure a good soft pillow for that good gray head be better than the churlish turf of indium he be very kind and call we sunshine and brightness and pay we the most involved early victorian compliment which we talk and laugh all the time seldom ever hear and it be leave to kind mr wilmot to respond _ nov 7 _ last night we have a excitement we get into a thick fog and have to stand still and hoot while something -- a homeward-bound steamer they say -- nearly run we down the people sleep on deck say it be most awesome but i sleep peacefully through it until awaken by a american female run down the corridor and remark at the top of a singularly piercing voice wal i be scared to-day it be beautifully calm and bright the nasty hot damp wind have go and we be sit in we own little corner of the deck mr crawley mr wilmot g and i sometimes read sometimes write very often talk it be luck for we to have two such charming woman to talk to mr crawley be suppose to be my chaperon i believe i forget to tell you that boggley who be a great friend of hers write and ask she to look after I how clever of he to fix on one in every way so desirable suppose he have ask the candle we have such splendid talk about book mr wilmot have i think read everything that have be write also she be very keen about poetry and have my gift -- or be it a vice -- of be able to say great piece by heart so between we g be sometimes just a little bored you see g have not be bring up in a bookish atmosphere and that make such a difference the other night she be brushing she hair unusually silent and evidently think deeply at last she look up at I in my bunk with the brush in she hand and all she hair sweep over one shoulder and say in the most puzzle way what be that nasty thing mr wilmot be say all about dead woman and do you know what she object to dear dead woman with such hair too -- what be become of all the gold use to hang and brush they bosom i feel chilly and grown old we be very much worry by people plant themselves beside we and favor we with they view on life in general one woman -- rather a tiresome person a spinster with a curiously horse-like face and large tooth -- sometimes stay for hour at a time and leave we limp even gentle mr wilmot approach as nearly as it be possible for she to approach unkindness in she comment on she she have such playful girlish manners and a irritating way of give vent to the most utter platitude with the air of have just discover a new truth she have be with we this morning and mention that she father be four time remove from a peerage i stifle a childish desire to ask who have remove he while mr wilmot murmur how interesting as she mince away mrs crawley say meditatively the rock horse fly and with a squeal of delight i realize that that be what she have always vaguely remind I of you remember the insect do not you in _ through the looking-glass _ it live on sawdust one lesson one have every opportunity of learn on board ship be to suffer fool if not gladly at least with patience the curious people who stray across one 's path one woman come on at port say -- a globe-trotter globe-trotting alone can you imagine anything more ghastly she be very tall dark and mysterious-looking and last night when g and i be in the music saloon before dinner she sit down beside we and begin to talk of spiritualism and other weird thing to bring she to homelier subject i ask if she like game game she say what sort of game i can ride anything that have four leg and i can hold my own with a sword she look so fierce that if the bugle have not sound at that moment i think i should have creep under a table quite mad say g placidly as we leave she we be go to have a dance to-night _ ss scotium nov 11 _ now we approach a conclusion we have pass colombo and in three or four day ought to reach calcutta colombo be rather nice warm and green and moist but i fail to detect the spicy breeze blow soft o'er ceylon 's isle that the hymn lead I to expect the shop be good and full of interesting thing like small ivory elephant silver ornament bangle kimono and moonstone we buy various thing and as we stagger with we purchase into the cabin which now resemble nothing so much as a overcrowded pawnshop mr murray remark -lrb- we be on speak term again -rrb- i suppose you think the cabin look rather empty that you buy so much rubbish to fill it up we be dumb under the deserve rebuke we have buy she a fan as a peace-offering rather a pretty one too but she thank we with no enthusiasm in colombo we get rickshaw and drive out to the galle face hotel a beautiful place with the surf thunder on the beach outside if i be rich i would always ride in a rickshaw it be a delightful way of get about and as we be trot along a fine broad road small brown boy run alongside and pelt we with big waxy sweet-smelling blossom we do enjoy it so at the galle face in a cool and lofty dining-hall we have a excellent and vary breakfast and eat real proper eastern curry for the first time another new experience i do not like curry at home curry as english cook know it -- a greasy make-up of cold joint serve with sodden rice but this be different first rice be hand round every particle firm and separate and white and then a rich brown mixture with prawn and other interesting ingredient which be the curry you mix the curry with the rice when a whole trayful of condiment be offer to eat with it thing like very thin water biscuit bombay duck -- all sort of chutney and when you have mix everything up together the result be one of the nicest dish it have be my lot to taste note also you eat it with a fork and spoon not with a fork alone as mere provincial do i begin to feel so excited about see boggley it be two year since he be home last will he have change much i wonder there be a letter from he at colombo and he have not leave darjeeling and have no house to take I to in calcutta so it would appear that when i do land my lodging will be the cold ground it sound as if he be still the same casual old boggley who begin that name john i think he have two name for he -- lo-the-poor-indian and boggley-wallah -- and in time we all slip into call he boggley i like to think you two man be such friend at oxford long before i know you i have hear many tale of you doings and i think that be one reason why when we do meet we like each other and become friend because we be both so fond of boggley i be fill with qualm as to whether he will be glad to see I it must be rather a nuisance in lot of way to have a sister to look after but he be so keen that i should come that surely he will not think I a bother besides when you think of it it be really very good of I to leave my home and all my friend and brave the peril of the deep to visit a brother in exile i wish i know exactly when we shall arrive this suspense be wear one man tell I we would be in on Wednesday another say we would miss the tide and not be in till Saturday i ask the captain but he direct I to the barber who he say know everything -- and indeed there be very few thing he do not know he be a dignified figure with a shiny curl on he forehead and a rich cockney accent full of information generally i must admit strikingly inaccurate but bestow with such a air i do believe he though i know he lie _ 13th _ we be in the hooghly and shall be in kidderpore dock to-morrow morning early actually the voyage be at a end i may as well finish this letter and send it with the mail which leave calcutta to-morrow we can not pack because mr albert murray be occupy all the cabin and most of the passage we shall creep down when she be quite do and put we belongings together everyone be fly about write luggage label and get they box up from the hold and count thing curiously enough i be feeling rather depress the end of anything be horrid even a loathe sea-voyage after all it be not a bad old ship and the people have be nice to-night i be fill with kindness to everyone even mr albert murray seem to swim in a rosy and golden haze and i be conscious of quite a affection for she though i expect when in a little i go down to the cabin and find she fussing and accuse we of lose she thing i shall dislike she again with some intensity we have all laugh and play and groan together and now we part no i _ sha not _ say ship that pass in the night several people -- mother whose baby i have hold and other -- have give I they card and a cordial invitation to go and stay with they for as long as i like they mean it now i know but in a month 's time shall we even remember each other 's name it will be a real grief to part to-morrow from mr crawley and mr wilmot the dear woman i wish they have be go to stay in calcutta but they go straight away up country be there i wonder many such charming woman in indium it seem improbable i shall miss all the people at we table : we have be such a gay company major wilmot say g and i have keep they all amuse and make the voyage pleasant but that be only he kind way it be quite true though what mr crawley say of g she be like a great rosy apple refreshing and sweet and wholesome what be really depressing I be the thought that wherever i be to-morrow night there will be no g to say : good-night my dear sleep well and i sha not be able to drop my head over my bunk and reply : good-night my dear old g it will seem so odd and lonely without she the ship have stop -- we be to anchor here till daylight fleshpot of calcutta _ calcutta nov 18 _ _ in indium _ i do not think i have quite realize myself or my surroundings yet but one thing i know boggley have be better than he word for we be not camp in a corner of the maidan but have a decent roof to cover we but i shall go back to where i leave off on Wednesday night we spend a hot breathless night in the river towards morning i fall asleep and dream that the ship be sink in a quicksand and that i in try to save myself have stick fast in the port-hole i waken cold with fright to find it be gray dawn and they be get up the anchor of course we be up at a unearthly hour all we belongings carefully pack and label ourselves clothe in clean white dress and topi to face the burning shine face of indium there be little to see and nothing to do and we walk about get hungrier and hungrier and yet when breakfast-time do come we find we be too excite to eat when we get into the dock we see all the people who have come to meet we pen like sheep into enclosure and we lean over the side try to make out the face of friend presently they be allow to come on board and i eagerly watch spy boggley bound up the ladder and the next moment we be clutch each other wildly but we greet -- what it be to be scot -- be merely hallo there you be i need not have worry about what i would say when i meet he -- yes i be silly enough to do that -- for he be just the same dear old boggley hair as red eye as blue and as short-sighted mouth as wide as ever i think he leg be even longer the first thing he do when he come on board be to fall over someone 's dressing-bag and that make we both laugh helplessly like silly child i introduce he to g and the other and by this time g have find she sister and soon they be all talk together so g and i slip away to look out for people in whom we be interested very specially do we want to see mr albert murray and when we do see he he be almost exactly what we have expect -- small sandy-haired he topi make he head look out of all proportion and with a trodden-on look we notice the little man wander aimlessly about when a voice from the music-room door say albert make he start visibly and turn he sidle up to we cabin companion who kiss he severely while he murmur well m ' dear how be you see we stand near she say well good-bye girl i hope you 'll have a good time and behave yourselve and then turn to she husband by way of a introduction she add these be the girl who share my cabin mr albert shuffle he topi and look at we with kind blinking eye but attempt no remark the last we see of he he be tug the hat-box in the wake of he manage wife g look at I solemnly we have little to complain of she say we be not marry to she the husband of the candle be the greatest surprise i have imagine -- why i do not know -- that that lady 's husband would be tall and red-faced with a large moustache and loud voice and manner someone who would match well with the candle instead we behold a dark thin-faced man with a stoop a man who look like a scholar and speak with a delightful quiet voice he address the candle as jane _ jane _ if it have be fluffy or trixie or chippy or even dolly but with that hair that complexion that voice that troop of attendant swain to be call jane the thing be out of all reason i wonder all the widespread family of jane with they meek eye and smoothly braided hair do not rise up and call she anything but bless oh i know there be no thought of please I when she be christen but still -- jane it be rather sweet to watch the little family group the mother assure a bored indifferent infant that this be its own daddy and the proud father beam on both the self-conscious bridegroom sidle up to they blush bride afford we much amusement some have not see each other for five year i wonder if one or two do not rue they bargain it seem to I a terrible risk i could have go on watch the people for a long time but boggley be anxious to be off so after tearful farewell and many promise to write have be exchange we depart the special providence that look after casual people have guide boggley to quite a nice house in a nice part of the town many government people who be in calcutta only for the cold weather -- i mean those of they who be burden not with wealth but women-folk -- find it cheaper and more convenient to live in a boarding-house do that conjure up to you a vision of bloomsbury and tall gray house and dirty maid-servant and the passing of third floor back it be not one bit like that this boarding-house consist oddly enough of four big house all stand a little distance apart in a compound they be let out in suite of room and the occupant can either all feed together in the public dining-room or in lonely splendor in they own apartment we have five room on the ground floor of the two sitting-room one be almost quite dark and be inhabit by a suite of furniture three marble-topped table on which boggley have set out the few photograph and trifle which he have not yet lose and a sad-looking cabinet the other open into the garden and be a nice cheerful room the dark room we have make boggley 's study as he only use it at night it do not matter about the want of light and there be a fine large writing-table which hold stack of papers we get the marble-topped table carry into the cheery room and cover they with tablecloth from a shop in park street buy rug for the floor and hanging for the door and with a few cushion and palm and flower the room be quite pretty and home-like i like the chair enormous cane thing with long wooden arm which boggley say be mean for put one 's foot on and most comfortable boggley 's bedroom be next he study but i have to take a walk before i come to mine out of the window -- or door i be never sure which it be -- down some step then along a garden-walk round a corner and up some more step where i reach first a small ante-room and then my bedroom like the other room it be whitewashed and have a very high ceiling some confide sparrow have build a nest in a hole in the wall and -- and this be really upset -- there be _ ten _ different way of enter the room door and window and half of they i can not lock or bar or fasten up in any way what i should do if a mutiny occur i can not think my bed with its mosquito-curtain stand like a little island in a vast sea of matting and there be two large wardrobe what they call _ almirah _ a dressing-table and two chair it be empty and airy and that be all that be require of a bedroom the four house as i tell you stand in a compound it be not exactly a garden for there be lot of thing in it that we would consider quite superfluous in a self-respecting garden there be a good tennis lawn plot of flower trimly-kept walk border with poinsettia and tree with white heavily-scented flower and opposite my bedroom be a little stone-paved enclosure where two cow and two calf lead a calm and meditative existence and further there be funny little hut scatter about where one catch glimpse of native at they devotions or slumber peacefully imagine in the middle of a garden at home come on a cowhouse or a shanty but this be indium boggley conduct I round both of we talk hard all the time he have so many question to ask and i have so much to tell : all the home news and silly little home joke -- peter 's latest saying -- thing that be so amusing to tell and to hear but lose all they flavor write you remember boggley 's wild burst of laughter he laugh just the same now throw he head back and shout in the most whole-hearted way we talk from 11 be till tea-time without a break -- talk ourselves hoarse and thirsty after tea we drive on the maidan up and down the red road in a unending stream of carriage and motor shabby _ tikka-gharry _ and smart little dogcart -lrb- call here tum-tum -rrb- -- all calcutta take the air one might almost have imagine oneself in the park if it have not be that now and again a strange equipage would pass fill with native man and boy gorgeous in purple and scarlet and gold or closed carriage like box on wheel in which sit dark-skinned woman demurely veil from the red road we drive to the strand a carriage-way by the river where the great ship lie and watch the sun set and the spar and mast become silhouette against the red sky then darkness fall almost at once my mind be a chaos when i go to bed after my first day in indium and i sleep so soundly that when i wake i have no idea where i be all re-collection of the voyage and arrival be wipe from my memory and i be fill first with vague astonishment and then with horror to find myself surround by filmy white stuff through which peer a black face it be only my _ ayah _ a quaint small person wrap in a white _ sari _ with demure sly eye and tooth stain red with chew betel-nut look through the mosquito-curtain to see if the miss sahib be awake and would like _ chota-hazri _ she embarrass I greatly slip about with she bare foot appear when i least expect she or squat on the floor stare at I fixedly i know no hindustanus and she know perhaps three english word so we conversation be limit the silence get so on my nerve that i drop hairbrush and thing to make a little disturbance and it give she something to do to pick they up i must at once learn some hindustanus word such as pink blue and green and then i shall be able to tell bellum what dress to lay out and she place will not be such a sinecure i call she bellum because it be the nearest i can get to she name and it have a homely sound the rest of my impression i shall keep for my next letter i have write this much to give you a idea of my surroundings and you see i have take you interest for grant be you bore of course you will say you be not but if i could see you face i should know the home mail arrive here on Sunday when people be have what they call a europe morning and have time to read and enjoy they letter when you write you have just have my mail from marseille how far behind you be it be too bad of I to write such pitiful letter but i think i be too miserable to pretend now i be very well off and no one could be more utterly thoughtful and kind than old boggley i be sure i shall never regret come to indium and it will be something to dream about when i be a douce olivia-sit-by-the-fire you speak of rain and mud and fog and it all seem very far away from this afternoon land the winter will soon pass and as you nicely put it i shall return with the spring _ calcutta nov 21 _ it be the witching hour of 10 be and i be sit in my little ante-room -- boudoir call it what you will -- immerse in correspondence boggley hard-worked man that he be have depart for he office follow by a _ kitmutgar _ carry some sandwich and a bottle of soda-water which be he modest lunch really a government servant 's life be no easy one he be up every morning by six o'clock and get a couple of hour ' work do before breakfast he office receive he at ten and keep he till four when he come home and have tea after which we ride or drive or play tennis somewhere a look in at the club for a game of billiards more work dinner and if we be not go to a dance or any frivolity a quiet talk a smoke a few more papers go through bed and the long indian day be over all day _ chuprassis _ like attendant angel flit in and out bear pile of document mark urgent which they heap on he writing-table i begin greatly to dislike the sight of they so you see i have of necessity many hour alone at least i have some and i would have more if g do not live within a few minute ' walk and every morning arm with a large green-lined parasol and protect by she faithful topi come round to pass the time of day with I she sister mr townley be a very nice woman and kindness itself to I i can say like the psalmist that goodness and mercy follow I i start from london know no one yet in twenty-four hour i be fast friend with g and afterwards with quite a lot of people on board i think when i land in calcutta i would be a stranger in a strange land and have no one but boggley instead of which i have g quite near and mr townley say i must come to they any minute of the day i want to and there be other equally kind you do not want I to give you a detailed account of calcutta do you it would not interest you to read it and it certainly would not interest I to write it when my friend go wander and write I home long description of the place of interest -lrb- falsely so call -rrb- which they visit i read they -- oh i read they faithfully -- but i be sadly bore somehow people interest I more than place that be so i shall only inflict on you a little of calcutta i like it immensely they laugh at I for say it be pretty but i do think it be quite beautiful it be so much greener than i expect and i like the broad street of pillared house stand in they palm-shaded compound the principal street be call chowringhee and it have some fine building and really excellent shop where one can buy quite as pretty thing as in london only of course they be of necessity more expensive it cost a lot to bring they out the club be in this street the bengal club and the united service where my brother would even now be lead a comfortable bachelor existence if he have not have a bother sister to provide a habitation for chowringhee face the maidan a very large park contain among other thing a race-course and cricket and football grounds the word maidan be arabic and persian and hindustanus for a open space and i hope you like the superior way i explain thing to you you who can be silent in so many language will probably know what maidan mean -- but no matter this then be the european calcutta clean and spacious and pleasant but not nearly so interesting as the native part turn down a side street walk a little way and you be in a nest of mean street unpaved dirty smell vilely line with open booth where squat half-naked man sell lump of sticky sweetmeat and pile of thing that look like unbaked scone and other strange eatables and little naked baby tumble in the dust with goat and puppy it seem to I that i go about ask why all day and no one give I a satisfactory answer to anything why for example should we require a troop of servant live as we do in a kind of hotel and yet there they be -- boggley 's bearer and my _ ayah _ -- i can see some reason for they presence -- a _ kitmutgar _ to wait on we at table and bring tea in the afternoon another young assistant _ kitmutgar _ who scurry like a frightened rabbit at my approach a delightful small boy who rejoice in the name of _ pani-wallah _ whose sole duty be to carry water for the bath the _ dhobus _ who wash we clothes by beat they between two large -- and i should say judge by the state of the clothes sharp -- stone lose most of they in the process and a _ syce _ or groom for each pony seat as one sometimes see they in row on the step augment by a _ chuprassus _ or two brilliant in uniform they make a sufficiently impose spectacle i have few word but i look at they in as pleasant a way as i know how partly because i like to be friend with servant and partly because i be rather afraid of they and do not want to rouse they to mutiny or do anything desperate but boggley discourage I at the outset you need not grin at they so affably he remark they will only think you be weak in the head they quite evidently regard I as a poor creature even bella though she humor I and condescend to say pretty pretty or nicey nicey when i be dress in the evening i think she must once have nurse child for the word she know be baby word she always call I poor missy baba and stroke I the _ pani-wallah _ find amusement in practise he english on I when he see g come through the compound he bound to my room hold up the _ chick _ and announce mee come retire stiff with pride at he knowledge of the language i have learn a few useful hindustanus word _ qui hai _ mean roughly be anyone there and you cry that instead of ring a bell and it bring the instant response _ huzoor _ and a servant spring from nowhere to do you bidding _ lao _ mean bring and _ jao _ go you never say please and you learn the word in a cross tone -- that be if you want to be really anglo-indian radical mp of course will learn please at once if there be such a word in the language which i doubt one nice globe-trotting old lady anxious like I to conciliate the native be have a cup of chocolate at pelitus 's and she insist on send out to see if the _ tikka-gharry wallah _ would like a cup a _ tikka-gharry _ be a thing like a victorium hire by the hour there be first second and third class _ tikka-gharry _ the first class have two horse the second one horse and the third be close and have no spring be a terrible vehicle indeed the driver of these carriage have as a rule long whisker and be dress in khaki they have bag of provender for the horse tie behind the conveyance where also precariously hang another man who might be the twin-brother of the driver i do not know why he be there but there he be g and i love to set out in a _ tikka-gharry _ and practice we hindustanus start early when it be fairly cool -- indian cold weather morning be the most wonderful thing so fresh and so bright and so blue -- g start we off at a mad gallop by shout _ juldus jao _ which i have to calm down with _ astus asti _ -lrb- slower -rrb- when we reach pelitus 's we cry _ roko _ -lrb- stop -rrb- and get out to buy caramel chocolate and cake for tea pelitus have a peculiarly delicious kind of chocolate cake the recipe for which i wish he would confide to fuller or buszard but it be not the european shop good as they be that occupy we morning much more fascinating haunt await we the new market and the china bazaar the former be a kind of arcade which contain everything that any reasonable person could require fragrant fruit and flower fresh-smelling vegetable and the wares of butcher and baker and candlestick-maker all lay out on booth and stall for the world to choose from there very early in the morning come the _ khansamah _ of the various mem-sahib and buy all that be need for the day while the mem-sahib be cosy in bed need not to worry about house visitor or forthcoming dinner-party housekeeping be easy in indium boggley think we have better ask some people to dinner so we do though i point out that we have no silver or anything to make the table decent and the boarding-house thing be none too dainty it 'll be all right say boggley leave it to the servant so i engage the private dining-room -- and leave it i rather tremble when the evening come and we party walk in but i need not have the servant be worthy of they trust the table look charming and as i have never see any of the thing before i have a more interesting time than usually fall to the hostess what i sincerely hope be that none of the guest have see any of the thing before either but if they have they possess great control of they countenance eatables however be by no mean the only thing to be find in the new market silk muslin chicon-work silver ornament and jewellery keep we breathless while the pleasant shopman in a frock-coat and turban offer they at what he call killin ' price the china bazaar be much farther into the city quite in the native quarter it be a real adventure to make a expedition there and the owner allow we to poke in back room from which we unearth wondrous treasure in the way of old brass vase queer slender-necked scent-bottle still faintly smell of rose old lacquer box and bit of rich embroidery i be become a shylock in the way i beat down price i should not wonder a bit when i go home and be ruffle it once more in bond street if when tell the price of a thing be a guinea i laugh in a jocular way and say oh come now i 'll give you ten shilling but to return to hindustanus i have not tell you all i know i can ask for _ tunda _ beef which be cold beef just as _ tunda panus _ be cold water _ gurrum panus _ be hot i can order what i want at meal at first when i want boil egg and hear boggley order _ unda bile _ i remonstrate not under-boiled hard-boiled until it be explain to I that _ unda _ mean egg the native can not say any word begin with s without put a _ y _ before it thus -- y-spice beef y-street when man come to see we i cry _ quus hai _ and when the servant appear order _ peg lao -- cheroot lao _ and feel intensely anglo-indian and rather fast one trait the language have which appeal greatly to I be that one can spell it almost any way one like but that be enough about hindustanus for one letter _ 23rd _ i have come in from a ride with boggley the proper time to ride be early morning but i be too lazy and too timid to go when the place be crowd and so we ride in the cool of the evening when we have the race-course almost to ourselves i ride one of boggley 's polo pony solomon by name boggley say he be as quiet as a lamb but i be not sure that he be speak the strict truth he have some nasty little way it seem to I he bite for one thing we be ride with a man the other night and quite suddenly he pony get up in the air and nearly throw he _ solomon have bite he _ the man look at I as if it be my fault and i regret to say i laugh he have also a ungentlemanly way of try to rub I off against the railing and then again for no apparent reason he suddenly scurry wildly across the maidan while i pull desperately but impotently with finger weak from fright boggley come behind convulse with laughter merely remark that i be a _ funk-stick _ -- which i take it mean the worst kind of coward _ 29th _ think where i have be for the last three day down the river in a launch that kind mr townley be take g and ask boggley if i might go we have to leave on Saturday morning before seven to catch the tide so i warn bellum that she must bring my _ chota-hazrus _ before six but i wake and find it be after six and there be no sign of the perfidious little black bellum i be not nearly ready when g rush in but i throw on garment and we flee while boggley in he dressing-gown follow with a parting benediction of pelitus 's cake as a substitute for tea and toast we find the launch delightfully comfortable not to say luxurious it have be do up for some of the royalty who be out here there be only we three on board and three young sailor man so it be a blessedly peaceful three day we lay on deck and watch the life of the river all the ship a-sailing big ship from dundee and greenock german ship french ship every kind and nationality of ship down to the curious native craft sometimes we pass a little village on the river-bank with a temple and a idol on a mound when we anchor in the afternoon two of the officer go on shore to shoot and the sailor let down a net and catch delicious fish for dinner i do wish peter have be there he would have feel like robinson crusoe and rejoice in it all at dinner the young man tell we wonderful story of they adventure with snake and tiger one man say that he be have he bath one morning when a snake come up the pipe when it see he it go down again but as it be disappear he pull it back by its tail again it try to go down and again he pull it back and then the snake take a look at he and go down tail first i believe every word but when i come home and related the amazing tale to boggley he receive they with derisive shout of laughter and say they have be spin we sailor ' yarn the mail be wait here when i come back yesterday thanks so much for you letter i be immensely interested in all you news but i have leave myself no time to answer you properly as this must be post to-day _ nb _ -- the two queerest thing i have notice in calcutta up to now be : -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- that when a man go out to tennis and stay to dinner he bearer carry he dress-clothes _ wrap in a towel _ -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- kippered herring come to the table _ roll up in paper _ _ calcutta dec 2 _ i do not think i like this casting of bread upon the water i never know which loaf it be i be receive again you reply to thing i have forget i have write and it be rather bewilder when you get this you will be settle down in germany i be sorry you have leave london for one reason and that a purely selfish one i sha not be able to imagine you in you new surroundings and in london i know pretty well what you would be do every minute of the day know as we do many of the same people when you write i have be dine with the maxwell-tempest to meet the so-and-so i could picture it all even to little mr maxwell-tempest 's attitude i be only in germany once for three day and i come away with a impression of a country weird as to food feathery as to bed and cram full of soldier but i dare say it be a very good place to write a book and now -- my heartiest congratulation on have a book to write it sound -- pardon I for say it -- a very dull subject but if i be a little wiser i expect i should see how important it be and anyway i have enough sense to perceive that it be a great compliment to be ask to write it what fun to be a man and have a career in my more exalted moment it be sometimes bear in on I that i should have be a man and a diplomatist i feel though i admit with no grounds to speak of that i might have be a great success in that most interesting profession one never know and by put my foot in it very conscientiously all round i might have earn for myself a reputation of machiavellian cunning what do you think i meet at dinner last night a travel radical member of parliament of course i have read of they -- often -- and know exactly what sort of creature they be -- fearful wild fowl who come to india for six week -- comprehend in half a mo ' what it take a man ten year or so to know that he will never know tell the native they want to be a brother to he and go home to write a book about the way indium be misgovern i be delighted at the prospect of see one quite close at hand i picture a strong still man with a beard soft fat hand and a sob in he voice that at election time would touch the great deep throbbing heart of the people instead i beheld a small thin man with eye as tired as any of the poor sun-dried bureaucrat and a wide mouth with a humorous twitch at the corner a man one could not imagine want to touch anything so silly as the heart of the people he talk i notice very little during dinner but the man be unusually long in join we afterwards and as boggley clamber after I into the _ tikka-gharry _ that be to take we home : that be a rip fellow say boggley another illusion shatter i hasten to set you mind at rest on one point i have a chaperon and a very nice though entirely unnecessary one she name be mrs victor ormonde and she know my people at home that be why she bother with I she be a most attractive woman to look at tall dark and slender with the dearest little turned-up nose which make she look rather impertinent and she be a little inclined to be sniffy to some people she consider calcutta woman suburban she husband be quite different friend with everyone a cheerful soul and as irish as he can be he be very fond of chaff he exclusive wife now do be affable he implore she the other night before they go to a large and somewhat mixed gathering and be she affable i ask next morning oh rollin ' about on the floor be the obviously untrue reply you ask how i like the anglo-indian woman and i do not know quite what to say it be the old story when they be nice they be very very nice but when they be nasty they be _ horrid _ some of they i simply hate they give I such nasty little stab the while they smile and pretend to be pleasant i be quite capable of give back as good as i get but it be not worth while because if one do yield to the temptation afterwards one feel such a worm there be no doubt it be more difficult in indium than at home to obey the command of one 's childhood : to behave pretty and be a lady what be a lady exactly i use to be tell that a lady be one who always say please when ask for more bread-and-butter and who never bite the finger of she glove that be simple and what 'll i be if i be not a lady i ask you 'll be common say the nurse severely and then and there because snatch bread-and-butter be sweet and glove chew in secret pleasant i register a vow that common i would be a dear little lady i meet the other day talk about she sister mem-sahib say airily of course we very soon lose complexion manners and moral she could afford to say so it be so obviously untrue in she case i think it be just this that the woman who be pure gold grow more charming but the pinch-beck wear off very soon the eastern sun reveal blemish moral and physical that would pass unnoticed in the murkier atmosphere of england the wonder to I be that anyone keep nice when one think of the provocation there be to deteriorate the climate the lack of any serious occupation to take up they day the constant round of gaiety indulge in partly i believe to keep themselves from think the ever-present anxiety about the child at home -- oh there be much one could say if one hold a brief for the anglo-indian woman calcutta society be make up of government people army people and business people who be call for some unknown reason _ box-wallah _ it seem very strange that there should be such a desire to go one better than one 's neighbor to have better horse a smarter carriage a larger house smarter gown because at least in the case of the civil service people they income be know down to the last rupee everybody in indium be more or less somebody it must be a very sad change to go home to england and be -lrb- comparatively -rrb- poor and shabby and certainly obscure to have people remark vaguely they suppose you be something in indium i suppose we be all snob at heart snobbery sir doth walk about the orb like the sun it shine everywhere a good lady talk to I quite seriously lately about what the best people in calcutta do it have become a light table joke with we and when i plant my elbow on the table and hum a tune while we be wait for the next course at dinner boggley mildly inquire do the best people do that it be a subject i never give much attention to but now awful doubt assail I be i the best people one thing be certain : i be of very little importance i be only a _ chota _ miss sahib and my _ chota _ - ness be my great protection no one be go to bother much what i do or trouble to pull my clothes and my conduct to piece and i can creep along unnoticed to a great extent i watch the game and find it vastly entertain it grieve I to say that i be one of the class who ought to remain in england there i be quite a nice person up to my light fairly unselfish loving my neighbor as myself but i have prove myself pinchbeck no you need not say i be sweet i be not i find myself say the most detestable thing about people oblivious of the beam in my own eye i stare fixedly and reprovingly at the mote in my neighbor 's could anything be more unlovable i get no encouragement to be a cat from boggley everyone be he very good friend mr wright call to-day i remark at tea do she say boggley she be a nice little woman you 'll like she she make up i say and she have on a most ridiculous hat mr brodie say she be a dreadful flirt rubbish say boggley she be a very good sort and devote to she husband mr brodie say i continue that she be horrid to other woman and try to take away they husband it _ be _ odd how fond anglo-indian woman be of other people 's husband much odder boggley retort that you should have become such a little backbiting cat you 'll soon be as bad as old mother brodie and _ she be _ the worst in calcutta this be the christmas mail and i have write sixteen letter but i can not send present except to mother and some girl for i have not see a single thing suitable for a man poor peter wail for a monkey or a mongoose but i tell he to wait till i come home and i would do my best to bring one or both i can only send you greeting from a far country you know you will never be better than i wish you _ calcutta dec 10 _ dear mr oliver twist -- i really do not think i can write longer letter they seem to I very long indeed i be not ashamed of they length but i be ashamed especially when i read yours of they dullness and of the poverty-stricken attempt at description how be it that you can make you little german town fascinating when i can only make this vast stupefying indium sound dull it would not sound dull if i be tell you about it by word of mouth i could make you see it then but what can a poor uninspired one do with a pen some ink and a sheet of paper i have be employ a shine hour by pay call you must know that in indium the new arrival do not sit and wait to be call on she up and call first it be quite simple you call you carriage -- or if you have not aspire to a carriage the humble useful _ tikka-gharry _ -- and drive away to the first house on the list where you ask the _ durwan _ at the gate for _ bokkus _ if the lady be not receive he bring out a wooden box with the inscription mr what be - her-name not at home you drop in you card and drive on to the next if the box be not out then the _ durwan _ take the card go in to ask if he mistress be receive and come back with she salaam and that mean that one have to go in for a few minute but it do not often happen the funny part of it be one may have hundred of people on one 's visit list and not know half of they by sight because of the convenient system of the not-at-home box the man 's calling-time be Sunday between twelve and two such a ridiculous time one be certainly not at one 's best at that hour be not it the irish rm who talk of that blank time of day when breakfast have die within one and lunch be not yet i find it on the whole entertaining though somewhat try for boggley you see have to be out pay call on he own account and so i have to receive my visitor alone it be quite like a game a servant come in and present I with a card inscribe with a name unfamiliar and i say something that sound like salaam do wait breathless for what may appear a man come in we converse i begin : where will you sit -lrb- as there be only four chair in the room the choice be not extensive -rrb- the man _ -lrb- seat and twirl he hat -rrb- _ : you have just come out myself : yes in the _ scotium _ remark follow about the voyage the man : what do you think of indium myself : oh rather nice do not you think the man : oh quite a decent place -- what again the servant appear this time with two card again i murmur the open sesame and two more man appear no 1 get up to go shake hand with I in a detach way and depart and the same conversation begin again with the new-comer until they in they turn leave when someone else come in it seem to be etiquette to go away whenever another visitor arrive i do not understand this and when a man come whom i know well in my childhood 's day and after a few minute ' stay get up to depart i grab he hand and say oh will not you stay and have a talk he very nicely stay on and we do have a delightful talk but victor ormonde who happen to be present have never cease to chaff I about it when we dine with they and get up to go he say in thrilling accent with a absurdly sentimental air oh _ will not _ you stay and have a talk i do think indium make very nice man almost every man i have meet have be delightful in he own way i have just write that last sentence when a servant bring in a card inscribe colonel simpson i get my sunshade and walk round to my sitting-room where i find a tall pensive-looking man think he must be a friend of boggley 's i hold out my hand frankly and have shake it the man go on hold it like captain hook i murmured to myself this be unusual but i try to conceal my astonishment and we sit down together on the sofa then he begin to _ feel my pulse _ by this time i have make up my mind he must be a lunatic and i have a wild idea of snatch away my hand and make a bind for the window but feeling that my leg be too weak with fright to be of any real use to I i remain seat be you sick he ask not in the least thank you i stammer a doubtful look flicker over he pensive countenance be you not my patient he ask no i answer truthfully but -- i be send for to a mrs woodward this be the address and i be show in here he be so upset that i hasten to assure he it do not matter in the least that mr woodward live above we and it be quite quite all right but my comforting protestation profit nothing and the poor man retire in great confusion murmur incoherently if i have see doctor on he card i might have be prepare but who would expect a colonel to be a doctor this confusing indium _ later _ this have be a queer day nothing but alarum and excursion g come to tea and suggest that afterwards we should go for a drive in a _ tikka-gharry _ it be a more amusing mode of conveyance in g 's eye than she sister 's elegant carriage so we drive up and down the red road and along the strand until the darkness come it rain this morning -- the first rain i have see in this dusty land -- make the road quite muddy and the air damp and cold it be like a evening in england say g let 's get out and walk home so we tell the driver to _ roko _ and g who have the money to pay he in she hand get out first at least i think she be out but she have pause balanced on the step and my slight push knock she headlong how she do it i do not know but she foot remain in the _ gharry _ while she head be in close conjunction to the horse ' hoof i suppose astonishment at this feat must have numb my finer feeling for g insist i bound over she prostrate form grab the money from she hand and pay the man before i even inquire if she be kill when i have time to look at she i be glad it be get dark and that we be in a unfrequented road she white serge costume be mud from head to foot she hat be squashed out of shape and even she poor face bear trace of contact with the red road at first she could not rise not because she be hurt but because she be helpless with laughter when i do get she on she foot i find the only injury be a slight cut on the wrist and great be my relief it be a blessing that no native reporter be near or to-morrow morning we would see in large letter : shocking affair in the red road one european lady attack another my only fear be tetanus we have be tell such tale of a slight cut cause death that i hurry g along until we burst breathless into a chemist 's shop in park street and demand something to keep away tetanus the chemist give we some permanganate of potash and for the last hour i have be bathing the wrist assist by bellum who have ruin two of my best handkerchief in the process the damage g have just depart and i do hope will not be much the worse such awful thing happen here you meet people well and strong one day and hear of they death the next death seem appallingly near one be not give time to be ill either you be quite well or else you be dead now i must stop and go and dress i see bellum fidget when this reach you the old year will be very near its end i hate to let it go : it have be such a good old year be it that i forget the unpleasant part perhaps but in look back i seem to remember only sunny day and pleasant thing to you my friend i send every possible good wish for the new year may it be the best you have ever have may it bring you health wealth and above all happiness the world be so full of a number of thing i be sure we should all be as happy as king be not that a lovable sentiment _ dec 19 _ i be try to take a interest in germany and the german for you sake but as i tell you before germany be a place i know little or nothing about france -- that noble fine land -- i know and love well italy i should like better if there be not so many madonna and child -lrb- or ought i to say madonna and child -rrb- to look at switzerland be my darling own place but germany i have hitherto only associate with goethe whom as a poet i dislike large sausage and theological doubt you description make I feel that i may have misjudge the country and the people in fact you little town sound a most attractive place to live in no i do not think i would expect you to make friend easily i think you be the sort of man to have host of acquaintance and only one or two real friend you know you rather scare people i think it be partly you manner and greatly you monocle you have such a detach air and often i have notice you very unresponsive when people be try to be amusing oh i do not mean you be ever rude but you be sometimes chill if i have not know from boggley that you be as he put it a perfect jewel i think i should have shrink away from before you that first day we meet and sit next each other at lunch i remember i talk a great deal of nonsense partly i think because i be rather afraid of you and somehow or other we have always go on talk nonsense to each other since it have become a habit but you do not really want to have a great crowd of friend do you it be only weak-minded people like myself who flop on any stranger 's neck with protestation of undying affection it be the easiest thing in the world for any dougla that ever be to make friend : i think because we be always willing to laugh at the feeblest jest nothing endear one so quickly to one 's fellow-being as laugh at they joke we have a way too of make friend with any casual stranger we may meet in train or coach or steamer you superior people who ignore you fellow-passenger sit in a corner and read _ the spectator _ do not know what you miss the thrilling story i have listen to once i hear a circumstantial story of a wreck in the south sea tell by the plucky little wife of the captain who have stay by she husband 's side -- papa she call he -- while the ship slowly sink on a coral reef and then drift about in a open boat for day before they be rescue it be mother however who meet with the oddest adventure travel one day last summer i see she off in the scotch express from euston comfortably seat in a corner with book and papers expect she would have a nice quiet day the occupant of the other corner be a russian lady and the friend who see she off ask mother if she would see she have lunch all right for she know no english this mother readily promise and the train start mother try once or twice to speak to the creature but receive only grunt in reply begin a book she have not read the first chapter when the old gentleman opposite say sternly you friend be faint and turn mother be just in time to catch the russian as she slide to the floor she wrestle with she for a hour revive she with smelling-salt and make she comfortable with she air-cushion and rug distract all the time by the yell of young infant somewhere near as soon as she could leave she she go to see what be wrong and find twin-baby make day hideous with they din while they poor mother lay stretch on a seat too ill to cope with they she be a missionary 's wife it turn out on she way home with no nurse and much malaria so of course mother have to stay and nurse the twin until luncheon be ready when another good samaritan come and take a turn while have luncheon she be hail by a friend lately leave a widow who insist on mother accompany she to she compartment where she weep on she shoulder while tell she all the detail of she husband 's last illness then back again to nurse the russian and the baby until the journey 's end when she emerge almost as hot and crumpled and exhaust as if she have run behind all the way how heartily my friend i agree with you about the tiresomeness of ball i think it must be old age approach but i can not see any use in go off at the hour when under happier circumstance i would be think of bed to a hot crowded ballroom and just at present calcutta be simply congest with ball i do not like thing that cost a lot simple little pleasure please I much more to drive out to tollygunge of a afternoon have tea and a game of croquet look at the picture papers and come quietly home again be to I the height of bliss tollygunge be a club some mile out of calcutta with a race-course golf-link croquet-lawn -- a very delectable spot the correct thing be to drive out on Sunday morning and have breakfast out in the open air then one see everyone one know and it be very gay but i think it be much pleasanter to drive out quietly in the afternoon the road to tollygunge lie partly through the jungle past cluster of native hut where little chocolate-coloured baby roll and chatter in the sunlit dust you know the jungle be quite near calcutta when i lie at night and listen to the jackal howl i remember kipling 's story and wonder if we be drive out and the jungle be let in how long it would be before calcutta become a habitation for the beast of the field yesterday i drive out with mr townley and g and three tired people we be too tired even to play the gentle game of croquet glad to sit still in comfortable chair on the greensward and steep ourselves in the peace and quietness at tea chil the kite hover in mid-air watch we jealously suddenly there be a swoop a dark flutter of wing a startled squeak from g and we cake be go that be indium tea finish while we still sit loath to leave a curious odour force itself upon we attention g sniff _ i _ sniff whatever be it ask g mr townley point riverward to where a thin column of blue-grey smoke rise and hang like a cloud in the hot still air it be a burning ghat she say they be burn a body and _ that _ be indium when one be feel fairly peaceful and secure something ghastly like the smell of burn hindoo recall to one the uncertainty of all thing we rise to go home feeling depress the smell pursue we i have two piece of news for this letter first boggley can take a few day ' holiday at christmas so he mean to take I to darjeeling to see if we can catch a glimpse of the snow we shall only be there from Saturday afternoon till Monday at noon and boggley say that kangchenjunga be often cloud-covered for week so it be a mere chance whether we shall see it but surely surely kangchenjunga will not be coy with I i come to indium of course in the first place to see boggley but in the second place to see the snow and i can not believe that the god will be so unkind as to deny a humble worshipper of great mountain a sight of the vision glorious the other piece of news be quite important boggley have get a new billet what it be i sha not try to explain for i do not understand the game of general post which be play so frequently among government official but it mean that he will have to go on a tour of inspection all over everywhere and what be more i shall go too be not it fine boggley actually hesitate about accept because he think i should so hate to leave calcutta and its gaiety to wander in the jungle it be not that i do not enjoy calcutta i do and i be most grateful to the people who have give I such a good time but i pine to see something of the real indium calcutta might be a suburb of london i want to see the native of indium not the fat babu i want to live in tent and be a gipsy i want to have boggley all to myself we have hardly time at present to pass the time of day with each other boggley try to frighten I with tale of dâk-bungalow and jungly cooking but i will not be frightened i be look forward to it all too much we do not go till the beginning of January so i shall be able to attend the drawing-room and a few other _ tamasha _ before we depart this will have to do for a letter this week i must clean some glove now that be the only useful thing i do clean g 's glove and my own we dirty so many pair of long white glove and it be cheaper to clean they at home you do it with petrol and a small piece of flannel and the result be not bad though somewhat streaky g 's part be to sit on my bed and watch I do it assist by bellum on the floor it remind I of the inhabitant of the scilly island who it be say earn a precarious livelihood by take in each other 's washing _ calcutta dec 26 _ when kiple write he _ christmas in indium _ i think he must have be in a dâk-bungalow down with fever otherwise he would hardly have paint such a very gloomy picture i at least do not find it a mock christmas -- but then indium be not my grim stepmother as victor ormonde point out to I the other night i can afford to be home-sick can afford to let myself think of the black divide sea and alien plain because here i have no continue city it be the real exile shackle in a lifelong tether who may not think but must go doggedly through they day 's darg i find it a agreeable day from the morning when i get my present and various offering of flower to the evening when we dine with some very kind people and have a amusing time play childish game i have often see picture head christmas in the tropics and look with sentimental eye at the people group among palm-tree on a verandah while the girl at the piano sing what be evidently a song about the dear homeland to judge from the far-away look in the eye of all present it seem a pity to disillusion you but it be not at all like that to begin with it be quite chilly and we be very glad of the big fire burning in the grate and we do not look pensive or far-away but eat we dinner with great content i think perhaps christmas fare be even more uninteresting in indium than at home turkey taste more like white flannel and plum-pudding be stodgier and there be no white and scarlet berry or robin but otherwise it be really a nicer day than in england of course i think a lot about the home people i imagine peter waking and grope for he stock oh _ have _ you forget what it feel like to waken up and remember it be christmas morning i sometimes wish i could still hang up my stock there be nothing in grown-up land that equal the thrill the delicious bulginess of the stock grip in the darkness give one i think they would miss I a little at home i know mother would often say i wonder what olivium be do now and what kind of christmas have you a very festive one i hope very many thanks for the book you send I you could not possibly have give I anything i like better somehow i have never possess a copy of _ a child 's garden of verse _ and this one so exquisitely specially bind will be a great treasure i like too you reason for choose it it be nice of you to like my childish reminiscence but it be rash to say you wish you have know we then look at we now so quiet so well-behaved _ such _ ornament to society you would be surprise what villain we once be -- at least on week-day we have what rl call a covenant childhood look back it seem to I that we childhood be a queer mixture of calvinism and fairy tale calvinism even now i associate with ham and egg -- i suppose because sabbath morning be the only time we ever taste that delicacy between bustling Saturday night when we wistfully watch we toy be lock away and cheery Monday morning when thing begin again there be a great gulf fix and that be the sabbath day what strenuous sabbath day we have first there be worship and the catechism -lrb- the only time i ever wish to be english be when i think i might have dally with what be you name instead of wrestle with such deep thing as what be man 's chief end -rrb- after worship be over we be allow to walk in the garden till it be time for the morning service that be the forenoon diet of worship then come the afternoon diet of worship have sit like rock through they both we proceed to the sabbath school and then go home to tea and cake and jam and a evening fill with bind volume of _ the christian treasury _ where we wrestle with tale of religious bigotry and persecution until we seem to breathe the very atmosphere of dark and mouldy cell and become daringly familiar with the thumb-screw and the rack the inquisition and other devildom of spain i use to wonder pitifully why it have never occur to the poor victim to say they prayer in bed and thus save themselves such fiery trial i wonder why i pretend we find we sunday a trial look back i love every minute of they father could make any day delightful and what a through-the-week father he be sometimes he come to tea with we in the nursery and make believe there be a fairy call annabel lee in the teapot carry on conversation with she that send eerie thrill down we several spine afterwards he would read out of a little green and gold book that contain for we all the romance of the age between its elegant cover from father we hear of angus the subtle morag of the misty way and the king of errin who ride and ride and whose road be to the end of day sometimes lay book aside he tell we old tale that he have hear from he mother who in turn have hear they from hers -- of the red etain of ireland who live in belligand and who steal the king 's daughter the king of fair scotland and the pathetic tale of the bannock that go to see the world with its cynical end : ah well we 'll all be in the tod 's hole in less than a hunner year it be father who give we first a love for book and teach we the magic of lovely word and it be father who try to place we stumble little childish foot in the narrow way and to turn we eye ever towards a better country -- that be a heavenly i suppose it be the dimly-understood talk of the better country that give john and I the idea of we kingdom it be a great secret once but now i may tell without break faith boggley and the bird be prosaic people care more for bird-nesting and red indian hunting than game of make-believe so they never know it be part of the sunny old garden we kingdom and be call nontland because it be rule by one nont he have once be a common ninepin but have have a hole bore through he middle with a red-hot wire he become possess of a mystic power and personality even we -- he creator so to speak -- stand somewhat in awe of he the river beulah flow through nontland and it be bound on the north by the celestial mountain on the south by the red brick wall where the big pear grow on the west by the rose of sharon tree and on the east by the pig-sty that last sound something of a descent but it be not really a pig-sty and i can not think why it be call so for to my knowledge it have never harbour anything but two innocent white russian rabbit with pink eye it be situate at the foot of the kitchen-garden next door to the hen-house the roof make of pavement flag be easy to climb and slope as it do to the top of the wall overlook the high-road be greatly prize by we as a watch-tower from which we could see the world go by to get into we kingdom we knock at the wicket gate murmur as we do so : el dorado yo he trovado and it open -- with a push we have not a idea then nor have i now what the word mean we get they out of a book call _ the spanish brother _ and think they splendidly mysterious besides ourselves and nont and the russian rabbit there be only one other denizen of we kingdom -- a turkey with a broken leg a lonely lovable fowl which john out of pity raise to the peerage and the office of prime minister i have a vivid recollection of ride in hot haste on a rake to tell the king -- not in proper fairy fashion that the sky be fall but that lord turkey of henhouse be dead john i remember always carry some fern seed in he trouser-pocket he say it make he invisible -- a delusion i loyally support it seem to I the sun always shine in those day the time be ever three o'clock in the afternoon and faery lay just adown the road it have just occur to I and it be a awesome thought that you must converse every day and all day in the german language i believe i have forget all i ever know of german though it be not so very long ago since i wrestle in tear and confused darkness of mind with that uncouth tongue do not forget you native tongue and do not dare write I a letter in german or like the editor of _ the spectator _ i shall say this correspondence must now cease since last i write life have be one long change of garment and move from one show to another Tuesday be viceroy 's cup day at the race a very pretty sight one side of the ground be crowd by pretty woman in lovely gown and on the other side the native sit in they hundred and chatter not the drab-coloured crowd we produce but gay and striking as a bed of tulip there be three stand -- one for the member of the turf club one for the ordinary public and one for the native who can afford a seat the member of the turf club may be say to be the sheep the other the goat it be more comfortable in every way to be a sheep you get a better seat and a comfortable tea in a enclosure with the sight of the goat scramble wildly for a little refreshment to keep you thankful for in the heat and dust and glare even a sheep be apt to lose sight of its mercy i think g be the prettiest girl there she be always such a refreshing sight pink and white and golden like a morning in may and tall -- like a king 's own daughter i be with the ormonde and of course boggley mr ormonde be so charming she be a great favorite with man and be always surround when she go anywhere by about half a dozen eager for she smile she have the quaintest way of hand she surplus cavalier on to I but i really much prefer victor and boggley as companion they do not need to be amuse like other man and be always good-natured and funny i be feel a little pale with all the excitement and shall be glad of the change to darjeel to-morrow next mail you shall hear all about it -- that be to say if no person seditiously inclined derail the train or do anything horrid some very dreadful thing have be happen lately but i do not think there be much danger so long as we keep far from the vicinity of dignitary _ calcutta new year 's day _ Wednesday already the mail go to-morrow and i with so much to write about to begin -- we leave calcutta on Friday afternoon and get to the gange about eight when we embark in a ferry-boat to cross the river it be quite a big steamer with dinner-table lay out on deck decorate for christmas with palm-branches chinese lantern and large deadly-looking iced cake on the other side the train be wait that be to take we to siligurus and we lose no time in look for place indian train be rather different from we train each carriage have two broad seat run lengthway which pull out for sleep berth and two other berth that let down from the roof i find i have to share a carriage with two other female and a upper berth fall to my share the bearer arrange my bed and boggley take a glance round ask if i be all right and depart to he own place be not it a queer idea to carry one 's bedding about with one pillow blanket and a quilt all do up in a canvas hold-all accompany people wherever they travel -- in train hotel even when stay with friend well there be i shut up for the night with two strange woman mother and daughter evidently american certainly and the horror of a upper berth stare I in the face it be quite a experience to sleep in the upper berth of a indian train to begin with it take a acrobat of no mean order to reach it at all and once you be in you nose almost touch the roof of the carriage as i climb to my lofty perch one of the american lady remark i guess child you be not go to have the time of you life up there to-night and i have not every time the train give a jolt -- which it do every few seconds -- i clung wildly to the strap to keep myself from descend suddenly and violently to the floor and in less than a hour every bone in my body be cry out against the inhuman hardness of my couch in spite of everything i fall asleep and awake feeling colder than i ever remember feeling before i start up bang my head on the roof as i do so to find that the carriage door be swing wide open what be to be do i carefully feel the bump begin to rise on my forehead and consider it be humanly speak impossible that i could descend and shut that door and yet could i endure lie inadequately cover and expose to all the wind of heaven there remain my fellow-traveller -- they at least be on the first floor so to speak but as i waver a striking apparition rise stalk down the carriage and lean far out into the night seize the door and shut it with a bang then arise a shrill protest from beneath I : oh mommer how could you be so careless you might have fall out and i should have be leave quite alone in this awful heathen country after that there be no more sleep and when daylight come filter through the shutter i slide warily to the floor and have wash and dress sit on my dressing-bag and converse amiably with the american i find they charming and most entertaining simple quiet people not the shrill-voiced tourist _ jât _ at all they have be travel so they tell I with a sort of dreary satisfaction for two year and they have still about a year to do it sound like hard labor the poor dear i can not think why they do it they would have be so much happier at home in they own little corner of the world i can picture they attend sew bee and other quaint thing people do attend in old-fashioned new england storybook they have a servant with they whom they address as alus a bearded rascal who evidently cheat they at every turn and who actually come into they presence with he shoe on i do not know till i meet these american that i be such a wit -- or perhaps wag be a better word i do not try to be funny i do not even know i be be funny but every word i say convulse they the mommer say to I : child be you marry no i say surprised why i be just think what a good time you husband must have when we reach siligurus i be surprise to find everything glisten with frost and the few native who be about have they head wrap up in shawl as if they be suffer from toothache we get some breakfast in the waiting-room and then take we place in the funniest little toy train this be the darjeeling-himalaya railway it be all very primitive a man bang with a stick on a piece of metal by way of a starting-bell and we set off on we journey to cloudland eagerly look for darjeeling come at last but alack no mountain only piled-up bank of white cloud it be bitterly cold and we be glad to get out and stamp up to the hotel where we find great fire burn in we room there be not much to do in the hotel beyond read back number of _ the lady 's pictorial _ and i go to bed on Saturday night rather low in my mind fear after all i be not to be account worthy to behold the mountain some of the people in the hotel be get up at 330 to go to tiger hill to see the sun rise on everest boggley the lazy one would not hear of go and when i awake in the gray dawn stiff with cold in spite of a fire and heap of blanket and rug i feel thankful that i have not a strenuous brother if it have be john i dare not think where he would have make I accompany he to in he effort to get as near as possible to he beloved mountain never shall i forget the first time he take I to switzerland to climb i have never climb before -- unless you call scramble on the hill at home climbing -- and i be all eagerness to try till john give I whymper 's book on zermatt to amuse I in the train and i read of the first ascent of the matterhorn and its tragic sequel it have the effect of reduce I to a state of abject terror all through that journey from pari to lausanne from lausanne to visp from visp to zermatt horror of the matterhorn hang over I like a pall i even find something sinister in little zermatt when we get there -- zermatt that now i love so with the rush icy river the cheerful smell of wood smoke the goat that in the early morning wake one with the tinkle-tinkle of the bell through the street and the quiet-eyed guide that sit on the wall in the twilight and smoke the pipe of peace after dinner that first night we walk through the village and along the wind path that lead up to the schwarzsee and gaze at the mighty peak so wild so savage in the pale purple light that follow the sunset glow -- gaze at it in silence john wrap in adoration i thinking of the man who have go up this road to they death yes say john as we turn back some very scared man have come down this road if he have know what a exceedingly scared girl be at he side he would not i think have choose that moment to turn into the little graveyard that surround the village chapel to look at the grave of the victim -- the grave of croz the guide of hudson and the boy hadow the text on one stone catch my eye -- _ be ye therefore also ready _ it be too much i flee back to the hotel lock the door of my room shutter the window so that i should not see the vestige of a mountain -- and weep it be odd to think how i hate it all that night how to myself i maligned all climber call they in my haste foolhardy -- senseless -- imbecile when i have only to go up my first easy mountain to become as keen as the worst -- or the best sometimes in those mountaineer excursion with john to zermatt to chamonix to grindelwald i have find it in my heart to envy the unaspiring people who spend long day potter about on level ground but look back it be not the quiet lazy day one like to think about no -- rather it be the morning when one rise at 2 be and thrust ache foot into nail boot tiptoe noisily into the desert dining-room to be supply with coffee and roll by a pitifully sleepy waiter outside the guide wait joseph and aloy and away we tramp in single file along the little path that run through field full of wild flower drench with dew into a fairy-tale wood of tall straight pine-tree we follow the steady slow footstep of joseph the chief guide up the wind path that turn and twist and turn again but rise always rise until we be clear of the wood past the rough stony ground and on to the snow firm and hard to the foot before the sun have melt the night 's frost when we reach the rock and before we rope aloy remove he rücksack and proceed to lay out we luncheon for if one breakfast at two one be ready for the next meal at nine crouch in strange attitude we munch cold chicken roll and hard-boiled egg sweet biscuit and apple with great content joseph have bury a bottle of white wine in the snow and now pour some into a horn tumbler which he hand to mademoiselle with a air -- a draught of nectar it be john 's turn for the tumbler next and as he emerge from the long ice-cold satisfying drink he declare he firm intention he unalterable resolve never to drink anything but white wine again in this world but doubtless as you know the white wine of the lowland be not the white wine of the mountain it need to be bury in the snow by joseph and drunk out of a horn tumbler at the foot of a aiguille after a six hour ' climb to be at its best after refreshment come the hard work to look at the face of the rock up which joseph have swarm to say hopelessly i can not do it i can not and then gradually to find here a niche for one hand here a foothold to learn to cling to the rock to use every bit of oneself to work one 's way up delicately as a cat so as not to send loose stone down on the climber below until pant one land on the ledge appoint by joseph there to rest while the next man climb it be the best of sport and at the top to stand in the stainless eminence of air to look down eight -- ten -- a thousand foot to the toy village at the foot while john name all the other angel peak that soar round we tell I you who be also a climber be it not very good but the come down stumble wearily down the steep path of the pine-wood with the skin rub off one 's toe and give at the knee like a old and feeble horse that be not so good and yet -- i do not know for as we near the valley puff of hot scented air come up to meet we the tinkle of the cow-bell greet we ear and we realize that it be only give to those who have brave the peril who have search for the deep thing of the ancient mountain and find out the precious thing of the lasting hill to thoroughly appreciate the pleasant homely quietness of the meadow-land but i have wander mile away from Sunday morning in darjeel it be still misty when we go out after breakfast but not so solidly misty so boggley hold out hope it would clear darjeeling be a pretty place tuck into the mountain-side in the middle be the bazaar and it happen to be market day which make it more interesting the village street be line on both side with open booth some pile with fruit and vegetable other oddly enough with lamp and mirror and other cheap rubbish which bear the legend make in germany other with all sort of curio the place be throng with people a few plainsman and tibetan boggley point out but most of the crowd be hill-people jolly little squat man and woman hang with silver chain and heavy ear-ring set with turquoise they eye be very black and all pucker with laughing and they have actually rosy cheek they crowd round try to sell we curio and lump of rough turquoise when we ask the price of anything they reply promptly twenty rupee we would offer two rupee and after a few minute ' bargaining they take it quite cheerfully the thing probably not be worth eight anna i buy a prayer-wheel it be a round silver thing with a handle rather like a child 's rattle and inside be slip of paper cover with write these be the prayer and at interval you twirl the wheel round and the oftener you turn it the more devout you be i also purchase some lump of rough turquoise though boggley say they be not a good blue -- too pale -- and be tie they up in my handkerchief when boggley grip my arm look he say i look straight across the valley higher say boggley and i lift my eye literally to the sky and there -- suddenly -- behold -- beyond -- be the everlasting snow all day they stay with we and as the sun be set we climb to a point of vantage to see the last of they it have be say they be a snow-white wall bar the whole horizon they be like a city carve by giant out of eternal ice a city which lieth four-square we watch while peak after peak fade into cold greyness until kangchenjunga tower alone rose-red into the heaven sublime in its valorous isolation then the light leave it too and we turn and come down from the hill of god we leave for calcutta at noon on Monday and i have a thoroughly over-eaten uncomfortable day all owe to boggley 's forethought he say as we begin breakfast about nine o'clock : now eat a good breakfast for we shall have to leave before lunch and no man know when we shall get another meal it seem good common-sense so i eat a egg and two piece of toast after i have really finish that be all very well but the hotel people thoughtfully provide we with a substantial luncheon before we leave even then boggley keep on look to the future oh tuck in he say we sha not get anything more till eight o'clock i do not feel as if i want anything ever again but i hurriedly gobble some food and we race to the station then sit in the train half a hour before it start at the first station we stop at the bearer appear at the carriage window with a breakfast cup of tea and a large y-sponge-cake ferret from no man know where he be so pleased with himself that i have not the heart to refuse it -- so there be three meal that ought to have be spread over the greater part of the day crowd into one morning i sympathize with the vulture who eat between he meal and that be the reason why he very very rarely feel as well as you and i it be never pleasant to come down from the height and we have rather a dreary journey to siligurus boggley have take care to wire for a lower berth in the train for I but it seem ordain that i shall ascend in indian train i again find myself in a carriage with my american and the daughter have such bad toothache and seem so much to dread the prospect of mount to the eyrie that i have to say that i would rather like it for myself toothache keep miss america awake and make she talkative which be unfortunate for I she want to know all about the manners and custom of the british she only know we from the outside so to speak incidentally she shed a lurid light on the habit of the american male it seem that young man in america be expect to carry offering of fruit and flower and candy to young woman -- not when they be engage mark you what be expect of they then i dare not think -- but to quite irrelevant young woman do not young gentleman do so in england ask miss america no i say feeling that i be make out my countryman poor mean creature indeed but feeling also how much more complicated life would become for these gentleman of england now abe if they have to carry crate of orange drum of fig and pound of candy to every casual young woman whose acquaintance they enjoy you do not say say miss america and do not they take you out drive in they buggy _ never _ i reply firmly they have not get they you do not say and how do a young gentleman show he admire you well he do not as a rule i murmured feebly i guess she say we manage thing better in america and indeed perhaps they do this conversation so exhaust we that we fall very sound asleep and know nothing till we arrive at the station where we have to get out and change into the ferry-boat then there be a terrible scurry the servant wait to pack up the bedding and strap bag -- they say they have waken we at the previous station but they must have waken someone else instead -- while we throw on various article of clothing stick hat on undo hair and foot into unlaced shoe all the while like a greek chorus the mommer moan reproachfully oh ali you might have wake we while outside on the platform bound the irate boggley speak wingéd word we do get on to the boat so after all there be no harm do i be quite sorry to part with my american when we reach calcutta they and they alus be go on to benare that night tire and spiritless they shake we both violently by the hand vow we be just lovely people and that i be a real little john bull the home mail be wait we when we get back and i read my letter sleep for a hour or two and then get up and go to a big new year 's dinner-party where we have firework in we cracker and sing what g call oldlangzine thanks so much for you delightfully long letter my wrist ache so i can not write another word _ calcutta jan 8 _ one more week and we start for the mofussil and the simple life the mofussil i may remark in pass be not as at first i think some sort of prophet but mean simply the country district i have be stand over bellum while she lay out all my dress tell she which be to be pack carefully and left in calcutta and which be to accompany I i do not want to take any more luggage than i can help as it be i foresee we shall have a mountain boggley have be beg everyone for the loan of book as he do not see how i be to be keep in read matter when there be no library within reach he accuse I of be capable of finish two fat volume in a day but i sha not have time to read much if i carry out my great project _ i be go to write a book _ you be surprised but why other member of the family can write why not i i read in a review lately that john have great distinction of style so perhaps i have too anyway i have buy a pile of essay-paper and sixpenny-worth of j nib and i mean to find out it be to be a book about the mutiny the information to be derive from trevelyan 's book on cawnpore there be room do not you think for a really good book on the mutiny last night the drawing-room be hold by the vicereine a function that everyone more or less be expect to attend i go with g and she sister -lrb- one need not go with the lady who present one -rrb- and find it most entertaining not be the wife or daughter of member of council or anything _ burra _ we have not the private entrée and have to wait we turn in pen like dumb drive cattle it be a much simpler affair than a presentation at home one need not even wear veil and feather and the train of we white satin gown be modest as to length it be silly to be nervous about such a little thing but i quite shake with terror i think it be the be pass along by adc 's that unnerve I but when i reach the last and hear to be present and my name shout out i stotted -lrb- do you know the scot word to stot it mean to walk blindly -- to stumble -- that and much more oh a very expressive word -rrb- over a length of red carpet that seem to stretch for mile feel exactly as a dutch wooden doll look saw as in a glass darkly familiar face that smile jeeringly or encouragingly i could not be sure which duck feebly and uncertainly before the two center figure and gasp relief find myself go out of the doorway walk on g 's train afterwards when we be all gather upstairs the many pretty gown and uniform make a gay sight i see the dearest little maharanee blaze in magnificent jewel and look so scared and shy and sweet there be a supper-room and lot to eat if one could have get at it or have have room to eat it after it have be get i do not like champagne -- simpkin they call it here -- much to drink but i like it less when it be shoot down my back by a careless man there be a fancy-dress ball to-night at government house and that be the last of my dissipation for some time to come i go on write write all the time about my own affair and never even mention you letter and nothing make I so cross as to have people do that to I i like my friend to make interested comment on everything i tell they i be glad you be so happy in you work and enjoy life be the book nearly finish yet it be nice that you have find such charming friend be the fräulein person you talk about pretty i can imagine how you enjoy hear she play and singing to she accompaniment i always think of you when i hear good music and of you face when i tell you that the only music i really like be scot song play on the pianolum but you know that be really true i simply hate good music once in paris i go with some people to hear _ samson et delilah _ and while everyone sit rapt enchant by the sweet sound i wait with what patience i could till the stage temple fall in the vain hope that some part would hit the tenor what would you fräulein say to such blasphemy forgive I malign the god of you idolatry i think i have better finish this letter before i go on from bad to worse because i be in a unaccountably perverse and impertinent frame of mind to-day and there be no say what i shall say next _ calcutta jan 8 _ such a scene of confusion everything i possess be lie on the floor all the thing i have accumulate on my way out and since i come to calcutta lie in one heap wait to be packed shoe dress hat book photograph be scatter madly about and in the middle almost reduce to idiocy and make no effort to reduce chaos to order sit bellum i can not help she for i must get my home letter write and post before we leave calcutta for before i reach my first halting-place the mail will be go boggley have be in the mofussil for three day and i have be stay with the townley i come back last night it be nice be with g again and she sister be extraordinarily kind we have rather a interesting day on Friday i have always be ask where be the missionary but i suppose i must have ask the wrong people for they do not seem to know however the other day i meet a lady -- mr gardner -- the wife of a missionary who ask we to go to lunch with she and promise she would show we something of the work among the woman so on Friday we set off in a _ tikka-gharry _ we leave the calcutta we know -- the european shop the big cool house the maidan -- and drive through native street airless treeless drab-coloured place until we despair of ever reach anywhere when at last we man do stop we find mr gardner 's cool english-looking drawing-room a welcome refuge from the glare and the dust and she be kindness itself she make a delightful cicerone for she have a keen sense of humor and a wide knowledge of native life we go first to see the girl ' school -- a quaint sight all the funny little woman with they hair well oil and plaster down with iron bangle on they wrist to show that they be marry wrap in they _ sari _ so demurely chant they lesson when we go in they all stand up and touch they forehead say in a queer sing-song drawl salaam mee sahib salaam the teacher be native bible-women the schoolroom open on to a court with a well like a village pump in the middle one small girl be bring out to tell we the story of the prodigal son in bengali which she do at great length with dramatic gesture but we attention be somewhat divert from she by a small boy who run in from the street hot and dusty sluice himself unconcernedly all over at the pump and race out again drip it do look so invite when we leave the school mr gardner say she would take we to see some _ purdah nashin _ woman -- that be woman who never go out with they face uncovered and who never see any man but they own husband i do not quite know what we expect to see -- something very oriental and luxurious anyhow marble hall and woman with veil and scarlet satin trousers dot about on cushion -- and the reality be disappointing no marble hall no divan and richly carve table no hookah and languid odour of rich perfume but a room with cheap modern furniture china ornament and a round table in the middle of the floor for all the world like the best parlor of the work class two woman live there with they husband and family and they come in and look g and I all over finger we dress examine we hat and then ask why we be not marry i could see they do not like the look of we at all they say we be like the doll they little girl get at the fête and produce two glassy-eyed atrocity with flaxen hair and vivid pink cheek and ask if we see the resemblance we do not they tell mr gardner -- who have be many year in indium and look it -- that they think she be much nicer-looking than we be she face be all one color -lrb- they speak of course in bengali but mr gardner translate -rrb- poor woman what a pitifully dull life be theirs g be disappoint to hear they have not become christian she have a idea that the missionary have only to appear with the gospel story and the deed be do i be afraid it be not as easy as that by a long way mr gardner read a chapter from the bible while we be there and these woman argue with she most intelligently they be by no means stupid before we leave g sing to they with no accompaniment but a cold stare when she finish they say they prefer bengali music it have more tune we leave feeling we have be no success have see a comparatively well-to-do household mr gardner say she would show we a really poor one we follow she through a network of lane more evil-smelling than anything i ever imagine -- london can not compete with calcutta in the way of odour -- until we reach a little hovel with nothing in it but a string-bed a few cooking-pot and two woman caste it seem have nothing to do with money and these woman though as poor as it be possible to be be thrice-born brahmin and receive we with the most gracious charming manners invite we to sit on the string-bed while they stand before we with meekly fold hand the dim interior of the hut with its sun-bleached mud floor the two gentle brown-eyed woman with they _ sari _ and silver anklet look wonderingly at g in she white dress sit enthrone with she blue eye shine and she hair a halo make a unforgettable picture of the east and the west we have tea at the mission house and meet several missionary lady who tell we much that be interesting about they work which they seem to love whole-heartedly i ask one girl how it compare with work among the poor at home and she say well perhaps it be the sunshine but here it be never sordid i can not agree to I the eternal sunshine make it worse at home although the poverty and misery be terrible still i comfort myself the poor have they cosy moment in winter sometimes when fund run to a decent fire and a kippered herr to make a savoury smell a brown teapot on the hob and the child gather in they be as happy as possible for the time be i have see they i can not imagine any brightness in the life of the woman we see to be a missionary in calcutta i think one would require to have a acute sense of humor and no sense of smell be i flippant i do not mean to be because i feel i can not sufficiently admire the man and woman who be bear the heat and burden of the day and now that sound patronize and heaven know i do not mean to be that anyway g and i be never intend to be missionary we drive home very silent in the only vehicle procurable a third-class _ tikka-gharry _ feeling as if all the varied smell of the east be lie heavy on we chest once g say gloomily how long do typhoid fever take to come out which make I laugh weakly most of the way home _ 13th _ the day of we departure have come and boggley be behave dreadfully have take time by the forelock i be packed and ready but boggley have do nothing he remark airily that i must go to the store and get some sheet a new mosquito-net and a supply of pot and pan and then go off to lunch with someone at the club leave I speechless with rage how can i possibly know what sort of pot and pan be wanted i never camp out before i shall calmly finish this letter and pay no attention to he order we have a farewell dinner last night the ormonde and one or two other we come into this dismantle room afterwards and talk till midnight and amuse ourselves vastly i happen to say that i be rather scare at the thought of the wild beast i might encounter probably under my camp-bed in the jungle so a man captain rawson draw out a table for I to take with I into camp one heave and a wriggle mean a boa-constrictor two heave and a growl a tiger -- and so on so you can imagine I in a tent in the dead of night sit up anxiously striking match and consult my table as to what be attack I mrs ormonde who be so nervous that if a cracker go off in she hearing she think it be another mutiny be anxious that we should take gun with we into the mofussil in case we be attack picture to yourself boggley and I set out with a little hoard of maxim arm i should be a menace alike to friend and foe my first stopping-place be takai boggley be go to some very far-away place where it would not be convenient to take a female so when dr and mr russel ask I to come to they while he be there i very gladly accept the invitation dr russel be a medical missionary i do not know he but he wife a very clever interesting woman i meet when she be last home and she tell I about she home in the jungle until i long to see it boggley will come for I in about ten day bellum i shall leave in calcutta it would be a nuisance cart she about from place to place and i be not so helpless that i can not manage for myself expect next mail to receive a budget of prodigious size the sunburned earth _ takaus jan 19 _ there be no doubt this be the ideal place for letter-writing i sit here in the verandah with long quiet hour stretch out before I and nothing to do but write and write and i suppose that be why for the last thirty minute i have sit nibble the end of my pen and dream -- without put pen to paper where do i leave off the Monday we leave calcutta be not it to continue the say Monday be a strenuous day boggley absent himself till late afternoon while i wrestle with wild beast at ephesus in the shape of bearer and coolie my hindustanus desert I utterly as it always do at a crisis g desolate at the thought of the come separation hover round all day and do she best to help about tea-time boggley walk in serenely regardless of the fact that we be still devoid of bed and table linen crockery and cooking utensil in the end the bearer be dispatch to the store with a list but the result of he shopping i have not yet see g stay till nearly dinner-time and sing to we for a last time it be horrid parting from she my dear old g do i write too much about she i think from something you say in a letter that perhaps i rather bore you talk of she you see i like she so much and you can hardly understand how much she have mean to I since we leave england together that showery October day after dinner we say good-bye to we friend in what boggley irreverently call the hash-house and at nine o'clock depart to the station the bearer be there with all the luggage and the _ syce _ with the pony for we be take the pony in case there be a chance of polo in the end we nearly miss the train at the booking-office when we try to book the pony the babu in charge lose he presence of mind and turn round and round like a teetotum i be amaze at boggley 's patience for myself i be conscious of a intense and most unladylike desire to slap the poor babu i who have constantly protest against any want of consideration in the treatment of native as i be the only lady travel the guard be much against give I a carriage to myself but a man who speak with authority hear we argue come up and tell he to put a lady only placard on my carriage so i travel in lonely splendor at assansol which we reach at 5 be we have _ chota-hazri _ tea and toast and most diminutive egg which we have to hold in we finger as there be no egg-cups simultalum be my destination and about eleven o'clock we reach it underneath the tree a few yard away from the little station we find a bullock-cart which the russel have send for my luggage and a doolie for myself a doolie be a kind of string-bed hang on a pole with a cover to keep off the sun it be carry by four man and two other run alongside to relieve they companion at interval i have sixteen mile to travel in this thing i look at boggley very doubtfully and he try to encourage I it be really quite comfortable he say -lrb- and when he say so he lie -rrb- and the man go very fast you will be there in no time so i bundle in somehow say a wistful good-bye to boggley and we start i can not honestly say i like a doolie i would rather have be my luggage and go in the bullock-cart whichever way i lay i very soon get a ache in my back the conduct too of the coolie fill I with uneasiness they keep up a continue groan one say oh -- oh -- oh and the other reply oo -- oo -- oo and you can not think what a depressing sound it be -lrb- i know now that doolie-coolie always make that noise when on duty it seem to keep up they heart so to speak and cheer they on -rrb- feeling guiltily that it be my weight that make they groan i lay perfectly still and be even hold my breath in a effort to make myself lighter when for no apparent reason we leave the road such as it be and start across the trackless plain there be nothing to be see except a infrequent bush no trace of a human habitation -- nothing but the wind blowing and the grass grow awful thought begin to come into my head i be all alone in indium indeed worse than alone i be in the company of six native most inadequately clothe : of they language i know not one single word i do not even know if they be carry I in the direction i want to go suddenly the groan cease and i find myself and the doolie plant on the ground _ be _ my bright young life to be end cold with terror i shut my eye tight and when i open they i find all the six coolie squat round all talk at once all presumably address I i make out one word which be repeat often _ baksheesh _ remind myself that i be of the dominant race i sit up and wave a hand towards the horizon say sternly jao i do think i must have intimidate they for they meekly pick I up again and we resume we journey the longest lane turn the darkest night wear on to dawn the weariest river wind at last to the sea and about tea-time ache dishevelled hungry -lrb- have have nothing but a few chocolate since _ chota-hazrus _ at 5 be -rrb- i be deposit before the verandah of the russel ' bungalow i do not suppose you know anything about mission work neither do i which be very shocking as i have have every opportunity of acquire information perhaps as a child i be take to too many missionary meeting with they atmosphere of hot tea and sentiment and hear too much of my dear brother and sister in the mission field for i grieve to say before i come to india i quite actively dislike missionary and think they a feeble folk mother be the only kind of missionary i like she have a mission -- so we tell she -- to the dreary people of this world not the very poor -- they be vastly entertaining -- but the not-very-rich highly respectable deadly dull people with awkward unlovable manners whom no one care very much to visit or to ask to thing and who must often feel very lonely and neglect while other be take up with more entertaining company mother have time to trot to these people with a new book or magazine or merely to talk for half a hour in the funny bright way which be like no one else 's way have they to the house to meet interesting people -lrb- in spite of the remonstrant groan of the family -rrb- and have bring they do not neglect they but draw they out till they seem quite brilliant and they go away warm and enliven by they social success even the most determine distruster of mission could not stay long at takaus without be convert dr russel very far from be feeble be a most able man who would have make he mark in he profession at home but he prefer healing the body and save the soul of the santal in the jungle to build up a lucrative practice and even attain the dizzy height of a knighthood to heal they poor neglect body to be the first to tell they of jesus -- how do festus put it -- one jesus which be dead whom paul affirm to be alive to teach they to help and raise they until life become for these native a new and undreamed-of thing -- one can see how fine it be how soul-satisfying dr russel have build a hospital and the native come from far and near bring they sick as i sit here write they come troop past take a short cut past the bungalow stop to stare at I quite unabashed sometimes carry a sick child sometimes a blind old man or woman they know they can come at any time and the padre sahib will never tell they to go away it be different with a government official he be hedge round by _ chuprassis _ who levy toll on the poor native before they allow they to enter the presence of the sahib it be a scandal but it seem impossible to stop it you may catch a _ chuprassus _ in the act you may beat he and insist on he hand back the money but almost before you back be turn the anna or pice have change hand again it be _ dustoor _ my first view of the hospital be rather a shock nothing be what i have expect the bed be square block of cement without even a mattress the patient bring they own bedding and they cooking pot and pan and generally a friend to look after they the say friend camp all round the hospital and it be pretty to see they at sunset each cooking he evening meal over he own little fire this morning be Sunday i go to a service at the hospital the mingled smell of carbolic hookah and coco-nut oil be i confess rather overpower but when dr russel ask I be this at all interesting to you or be it merely disgusting i could reply truthfully that it be more interesting than disgust the patient sit roll up in they blanket and listen while the tale of the prodigal son be read to they hold up they hand in horror when they hear he herd swine : they regard that as a very low job indeed it be odd the way they respond : just as if during church service at home a man be to answer each statement make by the clergyman right you be guv ` nor coming home we see a native cooking he dinner on a little charcoal fire and as i pass he throw the contents of the pot away surprise i ask why because i be tell you shadow fall on it and defile it one can hardly overestimate the boon a man like dr russel be to a district trust be a plant of slow growth with the native but they have learn to trust he entirely and go to he in all they trouble as child go to a father and he have a very real helpmate in he wife i never see such a busy woman if she be not in the hospital help at operation -lrb- she have a medical degree -rrb- she be teach girl to sew or woman to read and yet the child be beautifully care for and the house excellently manage i suppose most woman would pity mr russel sincerely she pass she life in a place many mile from another european with absolutely no society no gaiety no theater not even shop where she can while away the time buy thing she do not want yet i never meet a woman so utterly satisfy with she lot honestly i do not think she have a single thing leave to wish for : devote to she husband devote to she child heart and soul in she work if only she sometimes say it would go on the child will have to go home very soon -- the tragedy of anglo-indian life they be such dear child ronald and robert and tiny jean the boy speak santalus like little native and even they english have a odd turn when little jean be bear they be greatly interested in the first white baby they have see and ronald say rapturously : oh mummy be not lady darling when they be baby they mother find they one day bend over the cradle argue as to why the baby cry ronald say she have no tooth for that reason she cry robert say she have no hair for that reason she cry and ronald finish she have no english for that reason she cry i be not the only visitor at takaus there be two missionary lady here rest after a strenuous time in some famine district one be tall and stout the other be short and thin both have drab-coloured face and straight mouse-coloured hair both wear eye-glass and sort of up and down dress -- the very best of woman one feel sure but oh so difficult you know my weakness for make people like I but these dear lady will have none of I charm i never so wisely everything i do meet with they disapproval -- how well i see it in they avert spectacled eye i talk too much laugh too much tell foolish tale mimic my elder and betters and -- worst sin of all -- i have never read never even hear of the _ missionary magazine _ something you say in you last letter some allusion to religion i do not quite like and at any other time i would have write you a sermon on the subject in calcutta -lrb- where i feel so self-righteous -rrb- nothing would have prevent I -- but now i have not the spirit mark please how the whirligig of time bring its revenge in calcutta i think myself a saint in takaus i be regard as a brand unpluck it be rather dispiriting i be begin to wonder if i really be as nice as i think i be _ takaus jan 22 _ this gorgeous east be a cold and draughty place we have _ chota-hazri _ in the verandah at 730 and at that early hour it be so cold my blue finger will hardly lift the cup now the sun be begin to warm thing into life again and i have be sit outside basking in its ray to the anxiety of mr russel who like all anglo-indian have a profound respect for the power of the eastern sun the child be teach that one thing they must not do be to run out without a topi they be look over _ the pilgrim 's progress _ with I and at a picture of christian bareheaded approach the celestial city with the ray of the sun very much in evidence robert point a accuse finger say john bunyan you be in the sun without you topi the poor santal must feel dreadfully cold just now especially the child who have hardly anything on mr russel have a big trunk full of thing send out from home as present to the mission -- piece of calico and various kind of garment -- and these be give as prize to the child who attend the christian school the piece of cloth which they can wind round they be the most value prize some of the garment be too ridiculous shapeless sack of pink flannelette intend i suppose for shirt and such-like this morning there be a prize-giving the big trunk be bring into the verandah and the child be allow to choose one small boy choose a dressing-gown of a material know i believe as duffle of a striking pattern in this he array himself with enormous pride : a wide frilled collar stand out round he little thin neck and to complete the picture he carry a bow and arrow a quainter figure i never see i only wish the well-meaning dorca who make the garment could have see he a little missionary from somewhere in west africa once tell I about a small orphan native she have rescue and adopt i have he christen she say plaintively i have he christen david livingstone and i dress he in a blue serge man-of-war suit but he run away i murmured sympathy but i could not feel surprised imagine a little heathen david livingstone in a hot sticky serge suit these bow and arrow by the way be rather interesting the native make they of bamboo and strip of hide and they be tip with iron they really shoot thing with they -- bird and wild animal i mean i buy one from the owner of the dressing-gown for four anna to take home to peter it seem very little for a real bow and arrow but dr russel say it be quite enough and when one come to think of it it be double a man 's day 's wage i _ be _ enjoy myself at takaus as the man say when he lose he wife it be verra quiet but verra peacefu ' after calcutta the quiet do seem almost uncanny it be a blameless existence one lead i think i would soon grow very good for there be no temptation to be anything else one can not be very frivolous when there be no one to be frivolous with nor can one backbite and be unkind for there be no provocation as for be vain and fond of the put on of apparel what be the good when one be the best people if one wear a garment of any description although there be nothing to do the day never seem too long after _ chota-hazri _ i generally go for a walk with the child there be one good broad road pass the bungalow which lead away to the back of beyond but we prefer the little track worn by the foot of the native which criss-cross everywhere jean will not stir a step without a horrid dilapidated rag doll call topsy i do dislike the face of rag doll they lack of profile be so gruesome and topsy be a most depressing specimen of she kind but jean lavish affection on she a woman-child be a odd thing i remember be take into a shop to choose a doll and i choose a most hideous thing with curly white hair no one could understand why and i be too shy to tell it be because the doll be so ugly i feel sure no one would buy she and i could not bear to think of she loneliness the boy christen she mrs smilie after a lady of that name whom they think she resemble and the poor thing come to a tragic end they be play at the execution of mary queen of scot in the shrubbery seize on mr smilie to play the title rôle and with brutal realism chop off she poor ugly head i arrive just in time to see the deed and rush swiftly with fist and foot to avenge she fate well we set off every morning on we pilgrimage jean call herself mr jone and walk primly till we reach what we pretend be the seashore where she forget she dignity and roll about in the sand a certain kind of tree that dr russel have plant round about the bungalow make a noise exactly like wave so it be easy to pretend about the sea we meet many pilgrim on they way to some holy place and we create quite a sensation in the little cluster of hut -- they could hardly be call village -- that we pass through the inhabitant crowd around we say johar which i take it be santali for salaam and we repeat johar and grin broadly in reply and the pie dog sniff round we in a friendly way the other day we meet a boy who on behold I stand stock still throw back he head and shout with laughter i never hear more whole-hearted merriment i have to join in whether it be that he have never see anyone with fair hair before or whether there be something particularly droll in my appearance i do not know but he evidently find I the funniest thing he have meet with for a long time it be generally topsy who be the center of interest they hustle one another to look at she and gurgle with delight jean tell I solemnly i have to leave she at home when i go with mummy to the village they will not listen about jesus for look at topsy jean 's great desire be to meet someone white yesterday i see a horseman approach in european ride kit and a topi look jean i say i believe that be a englishman but when he come up to we and raise he topi with a flourish jean say mournfully no it be nobody white and i have to pick she up hurriedly in case she should say something more to hurt the poor eurasian when we come in from we walk it be tiffin-time after that the child be put to bed and i sit in the verandah and write and rest do i say rest this be what go on : o-liv-i-a i go into the nursery and jean very wide awake demand a needle and thread as she want to sew a dress for topsy i tie a piece of thread into a large darning-needle and supply she with my handkerchief which she proceed to sew into a tight ball i return to my write olivium this time it be robert olivia if this bungalow fall into the tank would it splash out all the water of course it would then what would the water do when it fall back from the splash and find the bungalow block up its tank unable to think of a answer i tell he to be a good boy and not disturb people when they be write ronald beg for a piece of paper and a pencil and have get it proceed to write down everything begin with g i once tell peter to do that and he list when i look at it run : god -- gollywog -- gordon highlander immediately i resume my write it begin again olivia in every tone peremptory beseech coax -- but like the deaf adder i stop my ear and refuse to hear i be use this opportunity to write my great work on the mutiny and it be not nearly so easy to write a book as i think no matter how much i try my sentence seem all to stand up on end i can not acquire any ease or grace of style i read somewhere lately that young writer use too many adjective that good writer depend more on verb it have make I rather nervous and i keep count both but a certain dubiety in my own mind as to which be which greatly complicate matter my heroine too be a failure i like she name -- belinda -- but it be the only thing i like about she what be the good of I laboriously write down that she be beautiful and charming when i be convince in my own mind she be nothing of the kind however i mean to persevere we all meet at tea -- the nicest time of the day i think my friend katie say the world be not properly warm up till five o'clock and certainly there be a feeling of comfort all over everything at the clink of the teacup mr russel be scot know how to give a proper tea with plate and knife and scone and jam and i be as greedy as a schoolboy over it yesterday there be no milk -- such a blow the cow have wander into a man 's land and he as the custom be march they into the pound five mile away and there we be -- milkless the country round takaus be quite pretty -- almost like scot moorland yesterday we go for a picnic to a river at the opening of a pass -- a most interesting place where not very long ago a native boy have be eat by a tiger you see picnic in the jungle be not quite the insipid thing they be at home there be always the chance that the unwary may be devour actually we do see yesterday the footprint of a tiger in the sand by the river -- pug i think be the proper expression i be scared but robert advance boldly into the bush ronald watch he admiringly say he be very brave he be as brave as daniel talk about tiger they be not nearly as prevalent as i think i have a idea they be prowl all over indium wait to spring but one man tell I he have be in indium fifteen year and have never see one boggley come on one once and take it for a cow -- short-sighted boggley dr russel say there be a man-eating tiger in the district lately and a reward be offer for its capture a young engineer sally forth to slay he direct the native to dig a pit near where the tiger be know to be and cover it with branch and the next day go and find it have walk into the trap the native remove the branch the gallant engineer approach but they have dig the pit on a slope and the tiger _ come walk up to meet he _ i would rather like to see a wild beast from a safe distance a native come into hospital only yesterday with he arm all tear and maul by a leopard but though i have walk mile through the jungle i have see nothing more fearsome than a black-beetle and _ that _ i might have see at home the santal be very keen _ shikari _ and go regularly to hunt arm with bow and arrow and a few gun one morning i watch they start with they be a youth home on holiday from a situation in calcutta -- i like he idea of a shooting costume he wear a pair of bright blue sock and yellow shoe a pink shirt wear over a dhoti and over that a well-cut tweed coat -lrb- evidently a old one of he master 's -rrb- a high linen collar but no tie a straw hat and enormous blue spectacles the last-named be evidently worn more for effect than by order of the oculist for the youth remove they when the time come to use he gun _ 27th _ my home mail have just come in i like to be in the verandah to see the dâk-runner bring in the letter i hear he long before i see he for he carry a stick with jingle bell at the end to frighten away animal as he come through the jungle mine be a particularly nice mail to-day -- good news from everyone you have no idea how out here one love to get letter and how one gloat over every scrap of news do you really look forward to my letter you letter be the greatest comfort to I indeed i can not imagine what it would be like without they i must finish this up for the mail go to-morrow my time here be nearly run i hear from boggley that he expect to arrive to-morrow and we depart together the next day i shall be sorry and glad -- both sorry to leave takaus and the dear people more than glad to be with boggley robert have just come in excitedly clutch the tail of a lizard he have catch it go up the wall and the lizard have wriggle away and leave its tail now i suppose it will perseveringly grow another robert be hold the tail before jean that she may see it wriggle and say god make it so _ be not _ it clever the dear baby how i shall miss they _ circuit house lakseraus jan 31 _ this letter must begin in pencil for boggley have the only pen by the bye would you mind keep my letter till i get home i think it might be amusing to read they when my cold weather in indium be a thing of the past behold we on the first stage of we wanderings we leave takaus on Wednesday i in my old friend the doolie boggley on he bicycle it be wonderful where a bicycle can go in indium i be much sorrier to leave takaus than i think i should be and i think they be a little sorry to see I go even the missionary lady unbent so far as to say they would miss my bright face and merry chatter how differently people describe thing bright and merry be hardly the adjective i should have apply to my soulful countenance and brilliant conversation but no matter they all stand on the verandah to watch we go mr russel dear woman be obviously sincerely sorry for anyone leave such a delectable spot as takaus and indeed there be many worse place the boy grin benignly each hop on one foot robert look rather like a toadstool with he topi and thin leg say i be go to scotland soon and i be not come back to indium till i have a long beard just as we be start a object hurtle through the air and fall at my foot and jean 's voice explain it be topsy olivium you may have she then self-sacrificing but heart-broken she bury she head in she mother 's lap i be rather tear-minded as we old nurse use to say at any time and i see thing through a mist for the first mile or two it do not seem nearly such a long way go to the station as come from it but boggley on he bicycle be there long before I and my doolie man we get a train to wherever we be go to about five o'clock i have some sandwich with I and we get tea handed in at a station it taste of musty straw and boggley say the milk be not safe but the cup make up for everything boggley 's bear the legend _ forget-me-not _ and mine _ a present for a good girl _ in gilt letter about eight o'clock we come to another station -- it be quite impossible to remember they ridiculous name -- and get out it be quite a important station and the large refreshment-room have a long table set for dinner line the wall of the room be tall glass case fill with tinned meat jam biscuit and other eatables for in the mofussil provision be buy at the railway station after dinner boggley produce a pencil and sheet of paper now he say we must make a list of provision want so we sit on the table and lay we head together we 'll begin with necessaries say boggley butter jam i add and cheese these be put down we could not think of another single thing go on say boggley bite he pencil that can not be all biscuit i say with a flash of inspiration and we choose three box of biscuit and stick again when the attendant produce a list of provision keep we get on better and soon have two large wooden box pack with thing that sound as if they might taste good the only thing i do feel we have be extravagant in be mustard -- it be a enormous tin and one do not really eat such a vast deal of mustard the list finish and approve i ask when we train come in about 430 say boggley this be 9 pm what i cry aghast where be we go to sleep boggley wave he hand comprehensively anywhere he say we 'll see what the waiting-room be like the waiting-room be like nothing i have ever see before a large dirty barn-like apartment with some cane seat arrange round the wall and a attempt at a dressing-table with a spotty looking-glass on it in one corner one small lamp smell vilely serve to make darkness visible and a old hag crouching at the door be the attendant spirit it do not sound cheery do it the bearer autolycus by name -lrb- i call he autolycus not because he be a knave and witty but because he be such a snapper-up of unconsidered trifle -rrb- make up a bed on one of the cane seat and there in that dreary and far from clean apartment with horrible insect walk up the wall and doubtless carpeting the floor with no lock on the door and unknown horror without i sleep dreamlessly my last wake thought be i wish my mother could see I now boggley sleep in the refreshment-room autolycus have go to the stationmaster and demand a bed for a first-class commissioner sahib and so far do impudence carry one get it i be awaken at 3 be and the aged crone help I to pack up my bedding i give she a rupee which afterwards i regret when autolycus point out she have steal a sheet we cross the gange in the gray dawn a clammy fog shroud everything nothing be visible but a stretch of wan water and one or two native near the bank bathing in the holy river we be the only european travel till at one station a nice old priest come in of what nationality we could not make out i be ponder it when i discover that my bangle with the miniature which i always wear be not on my wrist we look up and down and round about and then i shout why there it be and there it be lie on the priest 's lap he look so utterly dumbfoundered poor dear man and blush all over he fat good-natured face and i when i realize i have point a accuse finger be also cover with confusion we try to explain that it have come off with my glove but he merely bow repeatedly and make hurt ejaculation in some unknown tongue so we be reduce to a uneasy silence about twelve o'clock we have breakfast in the refreshment-room of a station we have wire for it so it be ready first we get ham and egg the ham be evidently tin and the egg be quite black i poke my share suspiciously and ask what make it so black pepper say boggley who be eat away quite placidly pepper as if i could not recognize plain dirt when i see it we plate be the kind with hot water inside and a cork and as the venerable man remove they for the next course i watch see he wipe they perfunctorily with the corner of he already none too clean garment then gravely hand they back after that i think dry bread be the safest thing to breakfast on now we be install in lakseraus circuit house these rest-house be keep up by the government for official on inspection duty dâk-bungalow be rather different any traveller may stay in they by pay so much this house consist of one very large room dining draw smoking room in one and two bedroom it be rather damp and dreary but that do not matter for we leave again to-morrow morning we have be to call this afternoon on the wife of the collector mr edston a pretty woman with nice manners and a sweet voice we have tea with she and see she small son she bungalow interested I it be only the second mofussil bungalow i have see the takaus drawing-room be delightful a big rather empty room with one or two good reproduction of famous picture on the wall heap of book and a almost entire absence of ornament -- rather a ascetic room it suit the simple strenuous life there mr edston 's be quite different -- bright and pretty full of flower and grow plant table laden with silver and photograph of pretty woman and child comfortable chair with opulent cushion soft rug and hanging -- altogether a very cosy room mr edston have kindly ask we to dine with she to-night _ later _ we have just come back and as i be not very sleepy i shall write a bit it be pour rain at eight o'clock so a trap be send for we and a note ask we not to whip the horse too hard i think they must be very restive animal but it turn out to be a joke there be no horse in the trap only cooly we have a very pleasant dinner mr edston be out in camp but two young assistant officer be there they live in tent in the compound as the bungalow be small and have they meal with the edston sit to-night before a blaze fire in the pretty drawing-room listen to mr edston singing i reflect that they be exceedingly fortunate young man to have such a home-like habitation and such a charming hostess to do they justice i think they quite realize they good fortune we depart to-morrow morning for some quite unpronounceable place about twenty mile from here to stay at another rest-house till Monday _ madhabad Sunday _ we have reach the unpronounceable place after much prayer and fast what a day we have yesterday we leave the lakseraus circuit house at 10 be precede by autolycus and a crowd of coolie bear luggage each coolie carry one thing and as they be all pay the same without regard to the weight carry of course there be great competition for the light package it be odd to see one man stagger under a trunk while another trot gaily off with a cushion or a kodak we be allow to take hand-luggage into the carriage and we take such a broad view of the word that it mean with we dressing-bags suit-case tennis-rackets gun-case polo-stick golf-club and as much more as the compartment will hold the station when we reach it yesterday be cram with native squat so thick on the platform one could hardly move without tread on they a great festival be go on which only happen once in a long time -- fifty year i think -- and if they bathe in the holy gange while the festival last all they sin be wash away they be flock from all part eagerly board every train that stop regardless of the direction it be go in the festival end to-day at twelve so i greatly fear many will be disappoint at all time the native love railway travel and as he have no notion of time-table he often arrive at the station the night before sleep peacefully on the ground and be in comfortable time for the first train in the morning also he have no idea of fixed charge and when he go to the ticket-office and ask for he tickut and the babu in charge tell he the price he offer half when that be refuse he go away and return in a hour or so and offer a little more it may take a whole day to convince a native that he can not beat down the railway company this festival have so disarrange the train that we train which should have leave at ten do not come in till twelve then we have to change at the next station and wait for the connection and we actually sit there till eight in the evening when we train saunter in they say of a certain cold and draughty station in scotland that in it there be neither man 's meat nor dog 's meat nor a place to sit down and it be equally true of the indian junction we have nothing to eat all day except ginger snap and they pall after a time especially in a dry and dusty land where no water be there be two other traveller in the same plight a mr and mr blackie and we sit together through that long hot day too utterly hungry and bored even to pretend interest in each other when the train do come in something have go wrong with the engine and they lose more time potter about with it -- tie it up with string probably it be then that my temper and i do think i behave with great fortitude up to that time give way and i try to bully the official it be no use they merely smile and say cer-tain-lee and boggley irritated I more and more by solemnly repeat : it be not good for the christian soul to hustle the aryan brown for the christian rile and the heathen smile and it weareth the christian down and the end of the fight be a tombstone white with the name of the dear deceased and the epitaph drear -- ' a fool lie here who try to hustle the east ' we have nothing to look forward to at the end of the journey except a dâk-bungalow 's cold welcome but the blacky who live at madhabad insist we should go home with they to dinner so instead of the tin ham-and-egg meal we have expect we have a dainty well-cooked dinner in a cosy dining-room warm and feed we retire to we present resting-place and find little comfort here autolycus and he coolie have only just arrive and autolycus be search vainly for a lamp -- a _ batus _ he call it the floor be stone and as cold as the tomb mr blackie beg we to go back to he place for the night but we would not hear of it autolycus run a lamp to earth we explore for bedroom and find two in which he hastily make up bed they be damp and far from clean but one learn to put up with a lot in the mofussil and in a very short time we have forget we trouble in sleep this morning i rise betime and go out to the verandah and there i find -- quite suddenly -- a handsome young man it seem he too be stay in this eligible mansion he be a engineer -- a bridge-builder i think -- and this be convenient for he present work he be in bed and asleep and do not hear we arrive last night so he be as surprised to see I as i be to see he when boggley appear we have breakfast together it be interesting hearing about the kind of life this young man lead he say although madhabad be not gay it be piccadilly compare to where he often be out in camp forty mile from another european with not a soul to speak to from week to week the evening be the dreariest time and he often go to bed immediately after dinner he be quite cheerful and say he like the life madhabad be a large village but the blacky be the only european there be a lot of planter however live round about we have caller this morning mr royle to whose place we go on Monday ride over with he two small daughter to say they would expect we to stay with they we mean to camp but it will be much pleasanter to stay with the royle everyone say they be charming people boggley and i go for a walk after tea to see the country there be not much to see except a long straight brown road and a most insanitary-looking tank the village be more interesting with its queer booth i do think it be a incongruous sight to see as i see this afternoon a native naked but for a loin cloth ply a singer 's sewing-machine the native look sullen and rather suspicious or be it only that i imagine it because they be so unlike the broad-smiling santal with they cheerful _ johar _ there be four tree before this bungalow and at present two vulture be perch on each -- horrible creature with long scraggy neck i point they out to boggley who be immediately remind of a tale of a bumptious young civilian new to the country who be tell by one who have suffer many thing at he hand that the bird be wild turkey a much-valued delicacy hearing which the youth promptly shoot some and send they round to the lady of the station do you believe that tale i do not we have just finish dinner -- much the most amusing dinner i ever eat there be a intense rivalry it seem between we cook and the engineer-man 's cook and although we dine together we bills-of-fare be keep jealously apart autolycus of course wait on we and when he hand I the fish and i help myself to one of the four piece he say sternly two please and i meekly take the other the engineer have no fish but on the other hand he have a entrée which be deny we both cook rise to a savoury -lrb- they _ will _ give you the savoury before the sweet if you insist on anything else it so demoralize they that the dinner be a ruin -rrb- we savoury be rather ambitious -- stuff egg roll in vermicelli it taste rather like a bird 's - nest and one feel it have take a lot of make and roll in brown hand i envy the simpler poached egg on tomato of the engineer you can not _ pat _ a poached egg _ rika feb 9 _ i have no home letter to answer this week we forget to give the calcutta people the new address so on Monday night the dâk-runner with he bell would jingle with my precious home mail into the takaus verandah mr russel have no other address would re-direct they back to calcutta and they may reach we here about Sunday it be tantalizing but i do not pine for news in rika so much as in most place i be so thoroughly at home i find the mofussil be simply full of nice people when we ride out here on Monday morning and mr royle with a shy small girl on either side come down the verandah step to meet we i know i be go to love stay here there be a atmosphere about that make for peace and happiness and every day i like the place and the people more rika be rather a revelation the civilian ' bungalow have a here-we-have-no-continuing-city look about they they owner be constantly be move and pitch they move tent elsewhere but the royle have be at rika for fifteen year and have make a delightful home the bungalow be build on a slightly rise ground with a verandah all round -- a verandah make pleasant with comfortable chair rug writing-tables book and flower at one end a _ dirzee _ squat with a sewing-machine surround by white stuff in various stage of progress for the mem sahib and the child from the middle of the verandah a broad flight of step flank on either side by grow plant in pot lead down to the road and across the road lie the tennis-lawn and the flower-garden i have read that one of the most pathetic thing about this land of exile be the useless effort to make english flower grow in rika they must feel at home for the whole air be scented with rose and mignonette when mr royle take we to see she flower boggley pull a sprig of mignonette sniff it appreciatively and hand it to I say : what do that remind you of miss aitken 's tea i say promptly always that scent take I straight back to sunny summer afternoon when the day be just a day to my mind all sunny before and sunny behind over the heather and myself in a stiffly starched frock accompany by three brother with polished face and spotless collar set out to drink tea with we friend miss aitken and miss elspeth there be always honey for tea i remember -- honey make by the bee that buzz through laborious day in they thatched house in a corner of the sunny garden -- and little round scone and crisp shortbread and as we eat and chatter through the open window the rose nod in give greet to they friend the rose of past summer dry and entomb in great vase and the scent of mignonette so mixed itself with the sound of gentle old voice and childish treble the fragrant tea in the fragile china cup the prance dragon in the cabinet that now over the year it bring they all back to I as surely as potently as if it have be indeed a sprig of oberon 's wild thyme or ophelium 's rosemary for remembrance as i have tell you we be naughty child sometimes even wicked child but we conduct at this house

babylonish garment they be very old when we know they these dear lady and they have be dead many year but they simple kindly life have leave a fragrance to sweeten this workaday world even as the mignonette in bygone summer scented they old-world garden how i do reminisce it be entirely you fault for say you like it you know it be a trait in the dougla family we way of entertaining guest be to sit close together and recall happening and delightedly remind each other of childish escapade shout hilariously while we guest sit in a bored and puzzle silence pleasant family the douglase well as i say rika be a pleasant place and the royle irish therefore charming mr royle be a most purpose-like person i like to go with she in the morning on she round through the garden we go to see the banana and pine-apple and tomato ripen in the sun and make sure that the _ mali _ be do they work then on to the wash-house where the _ dhobus _ be finish the weekly wash to the kitchen to see that the cooking-pot be clean finally to stand on the verandah while the _ syce _ bring the pony and feed they before we suspicious eye i forget the henhouse as we live almost entirely on fowl in the mofussil the _ moorghy-khana _ be a most important feature of the establishment but just now i regret to say owe to a moorghy famine in the district the stock be at a somewhat low ebb man have be scour the country for fowl but when we go to look at the result this morning we find about a dozen miserable chicken almost featherless standing dejectedly in corner and mr royle wail we can not kill these : it would be a sheer slaughter of the innocent it be not easy to get beef or mutton in this part of the world and when a sheep be bring to rika it have to be carefully conceal or kittiwake tie a ribbon round its neck and claim it as she own and terrible be the outcry if anyone dare to make away with she pet there be two royle child -- kittiwake and hilda kittiwake -lrb- christen i believe kathleen helen -rrb- be fat and broad and beam and very religious hilda be incline to love the gay world and find rika too quiet -- the baby aged six they be both thorough little sportsman and mount on they pony go with they father almost everywhere yesterday i go for a ride with they along dusty brown road between rice-field and they give I a wonderful lot of information about the place and the people as we pass a little village temple kittiwake stop _ that _ she say solemnly point with she whip be where they worship false god i tell mr royle about peter be so anxious for a mongoose and to-day when the child come run to beg I to come quickly and see what the fisherman have catch for I my mind leap at once to mongoose when i see confine under a wicker basket two animal with yellow fur and flat head that move ceaselessly my heart sink if they have be catch for I how could i be so ungracious as to refuse they and yet how be it possible for I to carry these most terrifying creature about with I and perhaps on the voyage home have to share my cabin with they i look round wildly the fisherman be grin delightedly at he own cleverness we two _ chuprassis _ autolycus and a _ syce _ stand round with the child all wait for my approval they be rather nice be not they i stammer feebly oh -- _ sweet _ say hilda rapturously sweet i echo but be not they big one big cry kittiwake why they be only _ butcha _ and she lift the edge of the basket to get a better view at which one of the _ butcha _ make a rush for the opening and make straight at I with a yell i snatch up my skirt knock over hilda leap like a haarse on to the verandah straight into the astonished mr royle while the weird beast disappear like a yellow streak whatever be the matter he ask as i sink to the floor olivium 's afraid of the _ butcha _ otter squeal hilda while she scamper about look for the truant otter say i yes say mr royle they be baby otter that the fisherman find at the side of the lake i thought of send they to the calcutta zoo they be not very common in indium i be _ so _ glad i gasp and mr royle look mystified it do not seem exactly a reason for fervent gladness but suppose they _ have _ be mongoose my life so to speak be ruin stay in the house with mr royle be rather like be with colonel newcome in the flesh he be such a very perfect gentil knight -- as courteous to a native woman as to the l-g 's wife the people round about adore he and he wife they be a kind of father and mother to the whole district there would be little hear of disloyalty to the british if all the sahib be like mr royle he be so good -- i would be almost afraid to be so good in case i die -- but not the least in a sickly way he be a teetotaller a thing almost unheard of in indium and he be not ashamed to be hear singing hymn with the child before they bed-time yet -lrb- why yet -rrb- he be a crack shoot a fine polo player a all-round sportsman both he and he wife be very fond of book mr royle read everything she can lay she hand on but she husband 's special subject be philosophy and last night he lend I a volume of nietzsche i do not think i understand a single word but between it and the _ moorghy-khana _ i have a bad night i think i have to make in five minute a new scheme of the universe all the odd-shaped piece be lie about like a picture-puzzle and i feverishly try to make they fit in the clumsy ineffective way one do thing in dream just as i have it almost finish mr royle come with a fowl in each hand and say sternly these must come into you scheme i take the two great cluck thing and vainly try to thrust they foot -- or be it claw hen have -- into a tiny corner and they have just wreck all my effort when i wake i have take some photograph which i shall send you the delightful babu button tightly into the frock-coat be a clerk of mr royle 's call a sita-ram -- two-o'clock the frock-coat be a legacy from a depart collector and he be immensely proud of it he be a great delight to I and say he will never cease to pray for my _ internal _ welfare talking of babus one write to mr royle the other day about a pair of riding-breeches and say i have you honor 's measurement but will be glad to know if there be any improvement in the girth do not you think that be a very pretty way of ask if he have put on weight when i show autolycus and the _ chuprassis _ the photograph i have take of they the _ chuprassis _ say _ atcha _ -lrb- very good -rrb- but autolycus shake he head violently and when boggley ask he what be wrong he reply in a injured tone that it make he look quite black _ feb 12 _ deep snow hard frost bright sun -- how gloriously sparkling it must be it dazzle my eye to think of it i do not wonder you revel in the skating and the long sleigh ride through the silent forest talk about the magic of the east -- it could never appeal to I like the magic of the north stork snow-queens moor-wife ell-woman -- how the name thrill one what be you han andersen like mine be light blue and gold with wonderful color picture but it be the frontispiece i study and which hold I frighten yet fascinate it be a picture of a pine-wood with a small girl in a blue frock and white pinafore and red stocking cry bitterly under a tree in the branch of which a doll hang limply throw there by cruel brother through the tree the sunset sky be pale green melting into rose-colour and the wicked little gnome that twilight bring be tweaking the child 's hair and jeer at she misfortune one feel how cold it be and how badly the little girl want she hood and cloak the darkness be very near and worse thing than little gnome would slip from behind the tree-trunk trunk it never occur to I that the little girl might have run home to warmth and light and safety that be no solution -- the doll would still have be there you letter with its tale of snow and great quiet forest and the picture you draw I of the funny little girl with the flaxen plait and the red stocking make I remember it i do not know where my old book be -- go long since from the nursery bookshelf to the dustbin i expect for it be much-used and frail when i know and love it -- but you word-picture give I the passport and enable I to creep once again inside its cover so brave in blue and gold and to greet my friend in the red stocking and find she as highly color as ever and not a day older it be nice of you to say i have a courageous outlook on life but i wish i have not tell you the story of the mongoose that be a otter now you will say like boggley _ funk-stick _ if i stay much longer in this frightsome land my hair will be white and my nervous system a mere wreck yesterday we leave the solitude of rika and go to polo at a place about seventeen mile away it be very interesting to meet all the neighbouring european -- mostly planter and they wife there be about twenty people and everyone very nice i wish i have time to tell you about they but i have not after polo which i enjoy watch we all have tea together and talk very affably then mr royle drive I home while boggley go with mr royle i hear as we be leave mr royle say something to boggley about the horse be young and skittish and a faint misgiving pass through I but i forget it talk to mr royle and when we reach rika i go off to dress for dinner take it for grant that the other be just behind letter be wait I and i linger so long over they i have to dress in a hurry and run to the drawing-room expect to find everyone wait but the room be empty hungry and puzzle i wait for another ten minute and then go along to boggley 's bedroom to see what _ he _ mean anyway but there be no one there more and more puzzle but distinctly less hungry i go back to the drawing-room look into the dining-room finally wander out into the verandah where i find the child 's old nurse anne tidy away the child 's toy i say : nurse where 's everybody anne leave the toy and lift both hand to high heaven och miss dougla dear it be not for nothing i dream last night of water-horse the night before ma sister maggie 's man be kill by a kick from a wicked gray horse -lrb- angus m ` veecar be he name and a fine young lad he be -rrb- i dream i see one as big as three hill it be with a awful starin ' white face and a tail on it near as long as from portree to sligachen it give a great screech and a wallop in the face of I and jump into the loch and by milkin ' - time next morning -- a Thursday it be -- ma sister maggie come into the door cryin ' ` och and och ma poor man and he so kind and so young ' and fall on the floor as stiff as a board anne come from skye and often tell I about water-horse and such-like odd denizen of that far island and i find she soft highland speech with its ass for as and ch for j very divert but this time i be not amuse but nothing _ have _ happen anne what be you talk about where be my brother mercy on we all how can i tell the mistress and the young gentleman have never come in and the master say to I ` fetch I my flask anne ' say he and fetch it i do and he drive away a ' i be sure as i be sittin ' here i do not see the water-horse for nothing what do a flask mean but a accident och -- och and a nice laughin ' - face young gentleman he be too if life be go to contain many such half-hour i do not see how i be to get through it with any credit i leave anne -- whom at that moment i hate -- to seek information from the servant which she do with a valiant disregard of she entire lack of knowledge of hindustanus a language she stubbornly refuse to learn a word of the last i saw of she she have seize the _ khansamah 's _ young assistant and be shout at he chokra -- ye impident little black deevil will you tell this moment have there be a accident backwards and forwards i go in the verandah then down the step to the road strain my eye to see and my ear to hear something -- what i do not know from the garden the scent of the rose and mignonette come to I in the soft indian darkness i venture a little bit along the road too anxious to remember or remember to care that i have no lantern and that at any moment i might tread on a snake i could only think of one thing and how often i picture it mr royle come back and the native carry someone -- someone who do not laugh any more the odd thing be i do not seem to mind at all what happen to kind mr royle it be boggley and only boggley that matter to I of course nothing do happen to anyone it be not when one expect and dread it that tragedy come tragedy come quietly swiftly i remember go to see a fisherman 's widow in a little village on the stormy east coast she tell I of she husband 's death i have he tea a ' ready a ' a bit buttered toast a ' a kipper but he never cam ' in that be all -- he never cam ' in when we wanderer return they be rather amuse than otherwise the horse have give trouble and end by kick the trap to piece and they have to walk part of the way home quite simple you see but the first opportunity i look in a mirror to see if my hair have not turn white in a single night as man 's have do through sudden fear it have not but i do dream of a water-horse with a awful starin ' white face this morning mr royle take I to the village to get some brass to take home the shop be a little hut with a earthen floor a pair of scale and one shelf crowd with brass thing make not for the european market but for the daily use of the people such as drinking-vessel -- _ lota _ be the pretty name -- and big brass plate out of which they eat they rice and _ dhalbat _ they keep they beautifully polish with sand and i think they ought to be rather decorative much more attractive certainly than the candlestick and pot and cheap rough silver-work which be the usual loot carry away by the cold-weather visitor _ 16th _ another mail-day will soon be upon we they simply pounce on one we have to get letter away by Tuesday from the mofussil instead of Thursday as in calcutta i look forward with great distaste to leave this place next week when with the royle one can not imagine oneself happy anywhere else the day pass so quickly breakfast seem hardly over when it be time for luncheon and before one have really settle down to read or write it be four o'clock and time to go to tea which be spread down by the lake among the rose the sun have lose its fierceness and begin to think of go to bed we all sit at a round table and eat brown bread and butter and jam all home-make the china we use be very pretty and come from ireland but mr royle have be greatly trouble by its discolor appearance which the servant assure she there be no cure for i suggest rough salt and lemon-juice and after tea yesterday afternoon they bring it and we each set to work on we own cup and saucer and behold in a very short time they be like new boggley make he particularly beautiful but unfortunately break it immediately afterwards at which kittiwake laugh so immoderately she fall on she saucer and send it to its long home i have learn to take a most intelligent interest in fowl and nietzsche and more and more as the day pass do i like and admire we host and hostess i never meet people i feel so _ affectionately _ towards here come the child fly follow patiently by the old _ khansamah _ with a spoon in one hand and a bottle of cod-liver-oil emulsion in the other i have better finish this letter and get the ink out of they reach _ baratah Thursday feb 21 _ now we be really camp out and i sit outside my tent even as abraham do of old i have a whole long day before I to write boggley be up and away long before i be awake and will not be back till evening we leave rika on Monday afternoon very sad indeed mrs royle as be she way heap we with benefit and mindful of we starvation on the way to rika have a luncheon-basket packed with cold fowl home-made bread tomato and a big cake as we drive off the child pursue we down the drive cry do not go away stay with we always at the station we be tell that the train be two hour late and boggley think it would be a excellent plan to spend the time call on the blacky who live near so leave autolycus and the _ chuprassis _ with the luggage we set out we have be show the flower-garden and a crocodile that mr blackie have shoot and be about to drink a dish of tea in the drawing-room when we hear the whistle of a engine the train cry boggley bound to he foot and spurn the cup of tea mrs blackie be offer to he it be no moment for ceremony with a shrieked good-bye we leap out of the window and across the compound and set off on we half-mile run to the station there be something peculiarly nasty about the nature of indian train simply because we leave the station it choose to be up to time it must have be a amusing incident to the people in the station but i would have enjoy it more have i be one of the native watch from a third-class carriage instead of so to speak one of the principal actor there be the engine shriek in its anxiety to start there be we luggage neatly spread all over a empty compartment there be autolycus protest shrilly that the train could not leave without he sahib who be a very _ burra _ sahib and finally there _ we _ be with scarlet face topi on the back of we head surround by a thick cloud of dust career wildly into the station after all the fuss we have only about thirty mile to travel when we get out and drive three mile in a kind of native cart to a dâk-bungalow a very poor and uncomfortable specimen of its kind it do not uplift we to hear that plague be very bad all round and after a somewhat jungly dinner during which we be very thoughtful and disincline for conversation we seek we mildewed couch to rise again at skreich of day and continue we journey till late on Tuesday night we get out finally at baratah station and drive out to we present camping-ground the people know we be come and the tent be up but they have not expect we till the next day so nothing be ready not even a lamp it be the oddest experience to stumble about in black darkness in entirely unknown surroundings you know how boggley tumble over thing in the broad light of day so you can imagine what toss he take over dressing-table and chair in the darkness it do not last long however for a important fat _ khansamah _ hurry in shock at we plight and explain that he sahib mr lister be away for a few day bring we a lamp and other necessaries dinner be not possible under the circumstance -- the box with we fork and knife have not arrive -- so the remains of mr royle 's luncheon-basket coldly furnished forth we evening meal while we sit there uncomfortably poise on dressing-bag gnawing leg of fowl and hunch of bread i thought of you probably dine at the ritz or the savoy with soft light and music and lovely food and probably not half as merry as boggley and i i do not know if i really like a tent to live in the floor be cover with straw and then a carpet be stretch over it which make a particularly bulgy uneven surface to stand dressing-table and thing on the straw too be apt to stick out where it be least expect and give one rather the feeling of be a tinker sleep in a barn at night a tent be a awesome place it be terrible to have no door to lock and to be entirely at the mercy of anything that creep and crawl to have only a mosquito-net between you and a awful end i wake last night to hear something sniff outside the tent it scrape and scrape and i be sure that it be digging a hole and creep underneath the canvas i sit up in bed and in a quavering voice say go away and the noise stop but only to begin again -- scrape scrape snuffle snuffle in the most eerie way then something worse happen at my very ear as it seem the most blood-curdling yell rent the astonished air it be only a jackal boggley say but it sound as if all the force of evil have be let loose at once you can laugh if you like but i think it be enough to frighten a very daniel as for I in one moment i be well under the blanket with finger in both ear and i suppose even in the midst of my terror i must have fall asleep for the next thing i know be daylight and the cheerful sound of voice to-night i shall have a lamp burning and a _ chokidar _ -lrb- watchman -rrb- to sleep outside my tent baratah be quite a large town and have a roman catholic mission and two lady doctor we be camp about a mile from the town in a corner of mr lister 's compound it be pretty with well-kept grass and flower-bed and opposite be the guest house of the raj where we would be stay now be it not that its roof be not quite safe and it can not be use i go through it and a great neglect place it be with tawdry early victorian furniture and awful oleograph when the sun have go down yesterday we go for a walk to explore along a avenue of peepul tree across a fine polo-ground and then we light on a big tank a tiny native boy be perch on the bank watch something in the water so we sit down beside he and watch too the something be very large and black and we be puzzle to know what it be till at a word from the child it heave itself out of the water and reveal itself a elephant up it come to where we be lay its trunk down so that the small boy could walk up and off he go proudly ride on its head it be the nicest thing to watch i ever see we get the home mail the night we arrive here but could not see to read it till the next morning so you be back in london -- sloppy muggy February london how you will miss the cold clear north and all the ice-fun but you will be so busy finish the book that surroundings will not matter much it seem quite home-like to see the familiar address on the note-paper to-day i be go to devote entirely to write surely my book will make some progress now how many word should there be in a book i have get 18000 now ragged incompetent word they be too i wonder what make a writer of book would know all the word in the dictionary help I my statement be so bald somehow it do not seem a interesting tale to I so i be afraid i can not expect a unprejudiced reader to find it thrill the mutiny be perhaps too large a subject for I -- though mind you there be one bit that sound rather well i have take great pain with it and as viola say of she declaration ` tis poetical the worst of it be when i write poetically i be never quite sure that i be write sense i dare say i would be wise to take the moorwife 's advice you remember in _ the will-o ' - the wisp be in town _ when the man have listen to the moorwife 's tale he say i might write a book about that a novel in twelve volume or better a popular play or better still say the moorwife you might let it alone ah say the man that would be pleasanter and easier how true _ baratah Thursday feb 28 _ we be still in baratah as you see and shall be till Tuesday it be a very nice life this nomadic existence and one get nearer the people they come in little group and talk to boggley outside he tent and i must say he be most patient with they and try to do he very best for each one of they they make my heart ache these native they be so gentle and so desperately poor be not it steeven who say the indian ryot have be starve for thirty century and see no reason why he should be fill the lister be home now and we have be see a lot of they they be delightful people mr lister be quite a girl and so good-looking and cheery she have the prettiest house i think i ever see when we go to call the first time and be show into the white-panelled drawing-room with its great open blue-tiled fireplace and cupboard of blue china i suppose it be the contrast with we own rather sordid surroundings but it seem to I like fairyland the hall be lovely with a gallery all round and most exquisite carve rose-red velvet curtain persian rug glowing with rich soft color and everywhere great silver bowl of flower they be the most hospitable people and ask we to dinner every night and to every other meal as well mr lister tell I babu story last night here be one the government send round make inquiry about some scandinavian -lrb- please do not ask why scandinavian because i can not answer -rrb- the sub-divisional officer forward the reference to the different police-station for report the babus in charge of these station have not a idea what scandinavian be but would have scorn to ask three of the report run thus : 1 honor sir i have the honor to report that the scandinavian have be conclude in this district and have be remove to lahseraus -lrb- survey and settlement operation -rrb- 2 sir i have the honor to report that there have be no scandinavian in the district this year but it be rage furiously at rika -lrb- plague -rrb- 3 sir i have the honor to report two scandinavian be see at gopalbung one be shoot by billie burke sahib the other have not since return -lrb- tiger -rrb- that be a good but somewhat involve story another be about a missionary who have be eat by a tiger the police wire a tiger have man-eat the pope of ramnugger yesterday the lister have a duck-shoot about twenty man come from all round and mr lister and i go with they we drive two and two to a very large lake and then set sail in queer native boat punt by native of course i want to go with boggley but be send off with a strange man one major griffith who eye I with great dislike because he say my light dress would frighten the bird it get frightfully hot with the sun beating on the water and i simply dare not put up a sunshade in case of scare the bird more than i be already do and thereby increase the wrath of my companion he shoot a lot of duck but evidently not so many as he think he ought to shoot and when he see the bird all congregate at one corner of the lake a thought strike he and he tell the native to take we to shore he get out and beckon I to follow which i obediently do and together we crawl through the jungle with the _ bandar-log _ chatter above we and -- for all i know to the contrary -- snake hiss beneath we foot if i step which i could hardly avoid do sometimes on a fall branch make it crackle the man turn on I a glance so malignant i positively quail breathlessly we creep to the water-side and the unsuspecting duck and then major griffith fire into the brown -- be that the proper expression -- kill i do not know how many i do not think it be at all a nice thing to do but my opinion be neither ask nor desire even then my friend be not satisfied and he voyage about until i know luncheon be long since a thing of the past and i hate so the shape of he face i could have scream when at last we do return i find my surmise as to luncheon have be only too correct and we have to content ourselves with scrap the next duck-shoot i attend i shall choose as companion a less earnest sportsman the weather be begin to stoke-up as boggley call it and during the day the tent be insufferable i can sit outside it in the early morning but as the sun get up autolycus summons the _ chuprassis _ and they carry my table and writing-material to the verandah of the guest house which have a cool not to say clammy and tomb-like atmosphere my chief trial be the insect there be a land of large black beetle with wing that have a strange habit of poise itself just above my head and remain there someone tell I -- who i forget anyway boggley say it be not true but it seem quite likely -- that if these beetle drop on you they _ explode _ do you ever hear of anything quite so horrible i keep a wary eye on they and shift my seat at they approach not a hundred yard away a heathen temple stand with its gilded roof shine in the sun we try to go inside it the other day but a angel with a flaming sword in the shape of a _ fakir _ keep we out it do not look very attractive we see enough when we behold the post the poor kid and goat be tie to all messy and horrid from the last sacrifice the priest who forbid we to enter just to show there be no ill-feeling hung wreath of marigold round we neck boggley once we be out of sight hide he in the ditch but i afraid they might find out and be offend go about for the rest of the day deck like any sacrificial goat that we be lead the simple life i think you would admit if you see we at we meal i find that food really matter very little we cook be of the jungle jungly autolycus be disgust with he and do he best to reform he _ chota-hazri _ i have alone as boggley be away inspect before seven o'clock i emerge from my tent and find a table before boggley 's tent with a cloth on it -- not particularly clean -- a loaf of bread -lrb- we bread be make in jail : a _ chuprassus _ go to fetch it every second day -rrb- a tin of butter and a tin of jam autolycus appear accompany by the jungly cook bear a plate of what under happier circumstance might have be porridge a spoonful or two be more than enough no good demand autolycus no and disdainfully hand the plate back to the entirely indifferent cook he proceed to produce from somewhere about he person a teapot and two tiny egg luncheon be much worse for the food that appear be so incalculably greasy that it argue a more than bowing acquaintance with native _ ghee _ dinner be luncheon intensify so tea be really the only thing we can enjoy the fact be if we think about it we would never eat at all i happen to walk round the tent to-day and find the dish-washer wash we dish in water that be positively thick and dry they with a cloth that have begin life polish we brown boot i storm at he in english and later boggley storm at he in hindustanus and he vow it would never happen again but i dare say if i be to look round at this minute i should find he do exactly the same thing and i do not really care so long as neither of we perish with cholera as a result such funny thing live behind my tent what should i find the other day but a little native baby -- about two or three year old it seem he mother be dead and he father who be we _ chokidar _ have to take he with he wherever he go he be the oddest little figure clothe in a most inadequate shirt and a string round he neck with a shell attach to keep away evil spirit he hair be closely shave except for one upstand tuft which be leave to pull he up to heaven with and he face look nothing but two great twinkling eye he squat beside I nearly all day and eagerly eat anything i give he like a little puppy dog toffee and fancy biscuit both of which i possess in abundance be he favorite a old servant of boggley 's be with a sahib near here and he arrive dress in spotless white from head to foot bearing in one hand a large seed cake wreathe with marigold and in the other a plate of toffee color pink green and yellow a offering to the miss sahib which he present with many salaam and of which my little hindoo get the benefit autolycus and the _ chuprassis _ take a great interest in teach he manners when i hold out a biscuit autolycus say sternly say salaam to the miss sahib and the baby put he small hand gravely to he forehead bow low with a talaam mee tahib then snap up the prize i shall miss my little companion i wonder what will become of he -- little brown heir of the age already he can lisp to idol but he have never even hear of the christ who say suffer the child _ march 3 _ i shall finish this and post it to-morrow before we leave we have be to church to-night the most unusual occurrence with we nowadays of course it be only a english church -lrb- i remember the time when i think it very exciting and more than a little wicked to be present at a church of england service -rrb- and the padre be a very little young padre and rather depress he insist so that we be but a pass vapor that i begin to feel it be only too horribly true and boggley who have partake largely of tinned cheese at luncheon and be feel far from well grow every moment more yellow and green the lister ask we to go back with they to dinner but we think it better -lrb- boggley especially -rrb- to seek the seclusion of we tent _ manpur march 9 _ now we be in a different place at least it have a different name and be a day 's journey from bantale but it look exactly the same we leave baratah yesterday morning and get in and out of train all day until about seven in the evening we get out finally at manpur i have a dreadful cold and be sniffy and inclined to be cross so when boggley suggest we should dine in the waiting-room while autolycus and the _ chuprassis _ go on with the luggage to acquaint the dâk-bungalow people of we arrival i upbraid he for not make proper arrangement and revile the meager repast and be altogether very unpleasant when we reach we destination we find autolycus prance distractedly this he say to boggley be what come of make no bundabust some other people be already occupy the bungalow and we could only get the back room small mouldy and inconvenient poor boggley look so crushed i have to laugh and we calm the worried autolycus who hate to see he sahib shove into corner and there be no inducement to remain up -- go to bed manpur be a fairly big station -- the sort of place you read about in anglo-indian novel there be six household and a club boggley and i call on all the six this evening and then go to the club everyone meet there in the evening to see the picture-papers and to play tennis and bridge it be rather a bore little community manpur i think they be all pretty sick of each other and one can not wonder even a archangel would pall if one meet he at tea play tennis with he and sit next he at dinner almost every day of the year how much more poor human being -- and anglo-indian human being at that take separately they be delightful but each assure we that the other be quite impossible they unite in be shock at we living in such discomfort and have all invite we to stay but it be not worth while to change we quarter besides we be go away for the week-end to some friend of boggley 's who live about thirty mile from here a nice little young civilian be at present call on we he come to pay he duty call and he and boggley become so deep in oxford talk and find so many mutual friend that we ask he to stay to dinner autolycus tell I in a stage whisper that the sahib could easily stay as the dâk-bungalow cook be very good and that we would get quite a calcutta dinner he pride as he bear in the dish be beautiful to see and it be a good dinner though rather tinny _ manpur Thursday 12th _ this delay letter must be post before we leave by the night train for we next trek we come back late last night from misanpore after a nice but very queer time on Saturday when after a long dusty drive of eight mile from the station we arrive at the bungalow of boggley 's friend there be every evidence that no visitor be expect just think boggley have never let he know we be come the poor man be ignorant of the fearful joy in store for he i grip boggley by the arm wretch i hiss in he ear why do not you write what sort of man be he will he hate have I _ qui hai _ bellow boggley to the deserted-looking bungalow then turn to I oh yes he 'll hate it he say calmly but he 'll be pleased afterwards i could have shake he make I play the part of a visit to the dentist when we host appear very dishevelled -lrb- it turn out that he be feel far from well and have be lie down -rrb- and behold I dismay be write large on he countenance he glare round in a hunt way and it look as if he be go to make a bolt for it but he remember in time he manhood and face I -lrb- he name be ferris and he be tall and bald and about forty and so shy that when he blush he eye water -rrb- somehow we all get inside the house and boggley and i sit in the drawing-room while mr ferris rush out to summon he minion and make arrangement we hear a whisper discussion go on about sheet and i long to tell my distract host that i have all my bedding with I in a strap but the thought that he might consider I ondelicate like mr glegg deter I presently i be show into what only too evidently be we host 's own room for a servant snatch away some last remaining effect of he master -- a spatter-brush and a slipper -- as i enter i sit down on the bed and ponder over what i would have feel have i be a man and shy and seedy and a strange female have be suddenly shoot into my peaceful home it be rather a difficult week-end i have meet man who be difficult to talk to but never one like mr ferris who while willing indeed anxious to be agreeable so absolutely annihilated conversation it be not till dinner on Sunday night that i discover a subject that really interested he -- london restaurant he grow quite animated as we discuss the relative merit of the ritz the carlton the savoy the dieudonné i think that long thin bald gentle bachelor spend all he spare moment -- and he must have many in lonely misanpore -- think about he next leave and the feast he will then enjoy yet the odd thing be he be not greedy about food i think it must be more the light and music and people that attract he mr ferris and boggley be away all Sunday and i spend the whole day with a volume of dana gibson 's drawing the only book i could find i do go for a short walk but the dust be nearly knee-deep and except the little bungalow and outhouse there be absolutely nothing to see yesterday again boggley have to go and inspect some place so it be decide he would bicycle there and then pick I up at some station we have to change at on we way to manpur i drive to the station in mr ferris 's little dogcart -- alone mr ferris say he be so sorry he have a engagement but i think myself it be simply that he could not face the eight mile alone with I the groom instead of sit behind run behind and as the pony be fresh he have to run pretty fast there be two road -- a _ pukka _ or make road and a _ cutcha _ road on which the native walk and drive they _ ekka _ autolycus and the _ chuprassis _ be wait at the station and put I into a carriage they go straight on to manpur with the luggage instead of wait at the station where we change train it be ten o'clock when i get out of the train and boggley have say he would be no later than half-past eleven then we would have luncheon and get the one o'clock train to manpur i go into the refreshment-room to ask what we could have for luncheon ham and egg say the fat babu promptly nothing else i ask yes say the babu mixed biscuit oh i say surprised certainlee say the babu then i go outside to read a book and watch for boggley my book be one of those american novel where every woman be -- to judge from the illustration -- of more than earthly beauty i get so dishearten after a little when everyone i meet have a complexion of rose and snow -lrb- besides i do not believe it -rrb- that i shut it up i find it be nearly twelve o'clock and boggley have not arrive i wait another quarter of a hour and then go in and eat some ham and egg one o'clock and the train come and go but still no trace of the laggard outside the station the blind white road lay empty nothing stir not even a native be visible the whole world seem asleep in the heat a pile of trunk lay on the platform address to somewhere in devonshire and label _ not want on the voyage _ some happy people be go home a far cry it seem from this dusty land to green devonshire i sit on the largest trunk and think about it two o'clock three four -- the hour go past i feel myself become exactly like a native sit with my hand fold look straight before I if i have not be so anxious i should not have mind the wait at all now and again i refreshed myself with a peep at the babu just to assure myself that i be not the only person leave alive in the world about five o'clock boggley and he bicycle stroll into the station i have mean to be frightfully cross with he when he appear -- that be to say if he be not wound or disable in any way -- but somehow i never can be very cross when i see he the way he wrinkle up he short-sighted eye be so disarm he have absolutely no excuse except that he have run across old friend and they have persuade he to stay to lunch and then they have get talk and so on and so on he be very repentant but inclined to laugh i expect really he have forget for the time he have a sister he confess he have not mention my existence till he be leave and then he say they do seem rather surprised i should think so indeed we home mail be wait we at manpur and another calcutta dinner you letter my faithful friend be more than usually charming and kind -- a balm to my lacerated feeling if you do not get a letter next mail after this it will mean either that we be entirely out of the reach of post office or that a tiger have eat the dâk-runner _ chota haganpore march 25 _ a whole fortnight since i write last and we tour be almost over on Wednesday we go back to calcutta and in April i sail for home the time have simply rush past this last fortnight have be a time of pure delight i have be too absorb in enjoy myself to write first we stay two day in a town where boggley have to open some sort of build the native meet we with a band and there be decoration and motto and crowd in the evening a dramatic entertainment take place for we amusement -- _ julius caesar _ act by schoolboy mark anthony wear a _ dhoti _ a norfolk jacket and a bowler hat in the middle of friend roman countryman the bowler fall off still declaim he pick it up with he toe catch it with he hand and gravely put it on again -- very much on one side i envy the mob they serene calm of countenance boggley and i make horrible face in we effort to preserve we gravity the next day boggley play in a football match with these same boy one get a kick on the shin and limp up to boggley say sir i be wound i can not play whereupon another run up to the wound one cry courage brother ti a nelson 's death great dear i think they be since then we have be through dry place and camp in desolate place hardly ever see a european and enjoy ourselves extremely one day a red-letter day boggley shoot two crocodile one be a fish-eater but the other be a great old _ mugger _ most loathsome to look at autolycus hope for _ human limb _ inside it and i believe they do actually find relic of he gruesome meal in the shape of anklet and ring and bangle boggley be go to have the skin make up into thing for I but it will take about six month to cure they it be good to think there be one _ mugger _ the less i hate the nasty treacherous beast pretend they be log and then eat the poor native one night we have a delightful camping-ground on the edge of a lochan well stock with duck which boggley set out to shoot and end by miss gloriously we be much embarrass by a fat old landowner heap present on we he nearly weep when we refuse to accept a goat all the fortnight we have only meet two european -- a couple call martin i do not know quite what they be or why they be hold up the flag of empire in this lonely outpost but they be the greyest people i ever see finding ourselves in the neighborhood of european we call as in duty bind the compound round the bungalow have a dreary look and when we be show into the drawing-room i could see at a glance it be a room that no one take any interest in the rug on the floor be rumpled the cushion soil photograph stand about in broken frame and the flower be die in they glass when mr martin come in i be not surprise at she room a long gray face lack-lustre eye greyish hair roll up anyhow and greyish clothes with a hiatus between the bodice and skirt this say i to myself be a woman who have lose interest in herself and she surroundings she husband be small and bleached-looking and give encouragement incline to be jokesome sometimes -lrb- by accident -rrb- he be funny mr martin pay very little attention to we and none whatever to she husband 's joke i laugh loudly i think it be so persevere of he to go on try to be funny when he be marry to such a depressing woman as we get up to go i notice in a corner a child 's chair with a little chintz cover and seat in it a smile china doll lack one arm and a leg i could hardly wait till i be outside to tell boggley what i thought of mr martin and she house the hopeless untidy creature i rave she do not deserve to have such a little cheery husband or child the only thing i do not like about boggley be that he never will help I to abuse people poor woman he say she be pretty bad then he tell I she story as he have hear it ten year ago it seem she be quite a cheery managing woman with two little girl whom she worship she and she husband live for the child they be just go to take they home when they sicken with some ailment mr martin at the time be prostrate after a bad attack of fever there be no doctor within thirty mile one child die and the mother start with the other on the long drive to the nearest doctor the last ten mile it be a dead child she hold in she arm when boggley finish i be silent remember the little chintz-covered chair -- empty but for a broken doll now that i have taste the joy of solitude i do not see how i be to enjoy live in a crowd again i be practically alone all day for boggley have long distance to ride and bicycle -- and i never be so happy in my life i write and i read and i fold my hand in newly acquire oriental calm -lrb- which my bustling busy little mother most certainly will not admire -rrb- and sit look before I for hour the book lend I by various people be all read long ago and i have go back to those that be always with I they be all before I as i write the little fat green one at the end of the row be lamb 's _ essay of elia _ : he so well fit some mood and certain minute of the day that gentle writer next be my _ pilgrim 's progress _ the one i have have since my tenth birthday father give each of we a copy when we reach the mature age of ten it be only on high day and holy-day that we be allow to look at he own treasured copy which stay behind glass door in the corner book-case the illustration i know now be very fine and even then we find they wonderful then come my little old bible i covet it for year before i get it because it have page like five-pound note i value it now for other reason next the bible be q 's _ anthology of english verse _ its brave leather cover rather impaired by the fact that for two morning boggley have mislay he strop have strop he razor on it lastly come my shakespeare sometimes in a night-marish moment i wonder what the world would have be like have there be no shakespeare suppose we have never know falstaff never hear the clown sing o mistress mine never laugh with beatrice nor masquerade with rosalind never thrill when cleopatra again for cydno to meet mark antony cry give I my robe put on my crown i have immortal longing in I what would we do when surfeit with the company of those around we if we could not creep away and pass for a little while into the company of those immortal what do it matter how tiresome and complacent people be when i be orsino invite the clown to sing word the utter beauty of which bring the tear to my eye : o fellow come the song we have last night : mark it cesario it be old and plain : the spinster and the knitter in the sun and the free maid that weave they thread with bone do use to chant it it be silly sooth and dally with the innocence of love like the old age one never come to the end of the beauty only to-day while i be browse for a few minute in a comedy i have not much acquaintance with i happen on these line which i be go to write down merely for the pleasure of write they : i be a woodland fellow sir that always love a great fire and the master i speak of ever keep a good fire i be for the house with the narrow gate which i take to be too little for pomp to enter : some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and they 'll be for the flowery way that lead to the broad gate and the great fire a very pleasant thing about we present solitude be that one can read aloud or speak to oneself without risk of be think demented the fact be the inhabitant of the little village on the outskirts of which we be camp regard we as so hopelessly and utterly mad already that no further display of eccentricity on we part could make any difference even in the jungle there be servant trouble we cook finding i expect this life too uneventful intimate that he father be die and leave last night we think we should have to go without dinner but autolycus step gallantly into the breach say no he would cook it he have often cook while with colonel-m ` greegor-sahib the next we see be a hen fly wildly pursue by autolycus and in about half a hour it appear on the table its leg -- still rather feathery -- stick protestingly from the dish that be all there be for dinner except two breakfast-cup of muddy coffee the dâk come in a little while ago with the english mail i have just finish read you letter i think i know what you must feel about you book it be sad to come to the end of a long and pleasant task -- something finish you will not do again a page of life close i know it scare I too how quickly thing come to a end we be hurry on so the year pass so quickly that even a long life be a terribly short darg life be such a happy thing one would like it to last i be twenty-six yesterday and if my soul be to say to I now _ finish good lady the bright day be over _ i would be most dreadfully sorry -lrb- and i would expect everyone else to be dreadfully sorry too i be afraid i would insist on a great moaning at the bar when i put out to sea -rrb- but i would have to admit that i have have a good time -- a good good time but i do not agree with you about the darkness of what come after how can it be dark when the sun of righteousness have arise i suppose it must be very difficult for clever people to believe the wise and prudent who demand a reason for everything but christ say that in this the foolish thing of the world would confound the wise i be glad he say that i be glad that sometimes the battle be to the weak at the cross i sink cry christian the strong man i sink in deep water but much-afraid go through the river singing though none could understand what she say i do not know that i could give you a reason for the hope that be in I -lrb- i speak as one of the foolish thing -rrb- but this i know that if we hold fast to the substance of thing hope for the evidence of thing not see look to jesus the author and finisher of we faith then when the end come we shall be able to lay we head down like child say _ this night when i lie down to sleep _ in the sure and certain hope that when have do with house make with hand we wake up in the house of many mansion it will be what john bunyan call a sunshine morning i shall have to stop write though lecture you be a fascinating pastime for the day be almost do and boggley will soon be home autolycus look very worried be busy with the task of prepare the evening meal one of the _ chuprassis _ he gaudy uniform lay aside and clothe in a fragment of cotton be sluice himself with water and pray audibly the _ dhobus _ be beat we clothes white on stone in the tank in the village the woman be grind corn the ox be draw water from the well the wood-smoke hang in wisp on the hot air and the song of the boy bring home the cattle come to I distinctly in the stillness the sunset color be fading into the deep blue of the indian night and the faithful be be call to prayer at home they be burn the whin on the hillside and the loch o ' the lowe lie steel-grey under the march sky the land of regret _ calcutta April 1 -lrb- Monday _ -rrb- the flesh-pot of calcutta be wonderfully pleasant after jungly fare and there be something rather nice about a big airy bedroom with a bathroom to correspond hot water at will and a _ ayah _ to look after one 's clothes after the cramped space of a tent a zinc bath wiggle on a uneven floor and autolycus fumble vaguely among one 's belongings i be stay with g in she sister 's mr townley 's very charming house boggley have to go off at once on another short tour and i be only too pleased to come to this most comfortable habitation it be nice to be with g again and she have lot to tell I about she doings -- dance garden-party picnic -- all of which she have enjoy thoroughly all the same i would rather have have my jungle experience she and she sister and brother-in-law laugh greatly at my tale they regard I as a immense joke i do not know why i think myself i be rather a sensible serious sort of person mr townley be the kindest woman she have such a delightful way of make you feel that you be do she the greatest favor by accept she hospitality i be not the only guest a member of a nursing sisterhood -- sister anna margaret -- be rest here for a few day she wear clothes quite like a nun but she be the cheeriest soul with such contented eye she might be a girl from the interest she take in we doings and the way she laugh at we well-meant but not very witty fun calcutta be very hot the punkah go all day -- not the flap kind of mofussil punkah but thing like bit of windmill fasten to pole i never like to sit or sleep exactly underneath one they look so insecure besides they make one so untidy at a dinner-party it be really dreadful to have the thing flap-flapping above one 's carefully do hair my hair need no encouragement to get untidy and i have quite a ophelia-like air before we get to the fish it be too hot to go out much except very early in the morning and again after tea we read and write and work till luncheon then go to bed and try to sleep till tea-time we waken hot and very cross and it be the horridest thing to get up and get into a dress that seem to fasten with million of hook and button my old bellum be back with I but she have find a mistress whose temper have shorten as the temperature have rise yesterday she fumble so fastening my dress that i jump round on she stamped my foot and say bellum i shall slap you in a minute she reply in such a reprove tone oh missee baba tea make one feel better and then there be tennis and a drive in the cool of the evening mosquito be a great trial they do not worry so much through the day but at night -- at night when one with infinite care have examine the inside of the mosquito-curtain to make sure none be lurk and then satisfied have dive into bed and tuck the curtain carefully round and be just go off to sleep -- buzz-z-z sound the hateful thing and all hope of a quiet night be go the other night i wake and find g spring all over she bed like a kangaroo at first i think she have go mad dog-like with the heat but it turn out she be only stalk a mosquito yesterday we all go -- mr townley sister anna margaret g and i -- to the calcutta zoo we feed the monkey with bun watch the loathly little snake crawl among the grass in they cage and then g begin gratuitously to insult a large fierce tiger by poke at it with she sunshade it be not a kind thing to do for it be surely bad enough to be cage without have a sunshade poke at one and evidently the tiger think so for it lash its tail and its roar shake the cage we go home and retribution follow swift and sure the first floor of the house consist of the drawing-room and two enormous bedroom one open into the other and both opening by several window on to the verandah sister anna margaret be in one g and i in the other we have two bed but they be draw close together and cover by a mosquito-curtain last night we go to bed in we usual gay spirit and fall asleep it seem to I that we be in the zoo again and the tiger be fiercer than ever it hit the bar with its great paw and to my horror i see that the bar be give i run but it be too late the beast be out of the cage and come after I with great bound my leg go round in circle and make no progress as leg do in dream the tiger spring -- and i wake at first i lay quiet too thankful to find myself in bed to think about anything else then i sniff olivium say g do you notice it what i ask that awful smell of zoo of course that be it i have be wonder what be the curious smell my first thought -- a awful one -- be that the tiger have actually break loose track we home and be now under the bed wait to devour we there be nothing to hinder it but a mosquito-curtain how i accomplish it paralyse as i be with terror i know not but i take a fly leap and land on g hit she nose with my head and clutch wildly at she brawny arm much develop with tennis as my only refuge she be too terrify to resent my intrusion what do you think it be she whisper hu-s-h speak low perhaps it do not know there be anyone in the room it be the tiger from the zoo i hiss with conviction g start visibly rubbish she say a tiger would not get into a house ah -- oh listen distinctly we hear the fud of four foot go round the bed cry for help say g sister we yell together sister anna sister anna margaret no answer sister anna margaret sleep well sister say g bitterly she be no sister in adversity get up g i say encouragingly get up and turn on the light perhaps it be not a tiger perhaps it be only a musk rat g refuse with some curtness get up yourself she add again we shout for sister with no result you have no idea how horrible it be to lie there in the darkness and listen to movement make by we know not what we feel bitterly towards sister anna never think of what she feeling would be if she come confidingly to we help and be confront by some fearsome animal if only say g we know what time it be and when it will be light i can not _ live _ like this long let go my arm can not you i dare not i say you be all i have get to hold on to we lay and listen and we lay and listen but the padding footstep do not come back and then i suppose we must have fall asleep for the next thing we know be that the _ ayah _ be stand beside we with tea and the miserable night be past g and i look at each other rather shamefacedly do we dream it i ask g be rub she arm where i have grip it i do not dream this anyway she say it be black and blue at breakfast we know the bitterness of have we word doubt no one believe we report they laugh at we and say we have dream it or that we have hear a mouse and become so offensive in they unbelief that g and i rise from the table in a dignified way and go out to walk in the compound we be very busy collect thing to take home with we -lrb- do i tell you g 's berth have be book in the ship i sail in -- the _ socotra _ -- it sail about the 23rd -rrb- the _ chicon-wallah _ come this morning and spread he wares on the verandah floor -- white rug from kashmir embroidered gaily in red and green and blue tinsel mat and table centre piece of soft bright silk dainty white sew work we could hardly be drag from the absorb sight to the luncheon-table the townley never change they servant and now three generation serve together the old _ kitmutgar _ be the grandfather and train he grandson in the way which they should go to-day at luncheon -lrb- fortunately we be alone -rrb- one of they make a mistake in hand a dish whereupon he grandfather give he a resounding box on the ear knock off he turban instead of go out of the room the boy go on hand I pudding sob loudly the while and with tear run down he face it be very embarrassing and none of we have enough hindustanus to rebuke the too-stern grandparent _ later _ this afternoon when we be have tea in the garden and enjoy pelitus 's chocolate-cake a great outcry arise from the house and we see the servant run and look up to the verandah mr townley call out to know what be the matter and receive such a confused jumble of hindustanus in reply that he go to investigate he come back shrug he shoulder it be some nonsense about a ` spirit ' they say it be be appear suddenly then disappear for some time now the _ chokra _ swear he see it go up the verandah into a bedroom to satisfy they i have send for my gun and i 'll wait below while they drive the ` spirit ' down it be we midnight visitor g and i cry together we wait breathless the servant rush on to the verandah with stick -- a dark streak slide down the verandah pillar -- mr townley fire it be not a tiger it be a civet cat -- a thing rather like a fox with a long pointed nose and a uncommonly nasty smell think say g as we look at it lie stretch out stiff -- think of have that thing under we bed a mouse indeed we do not say i tell you so but we look it boggley come back to-morrow and i be go with he to the grand hotel so that we shall be together for the last little while _ agra April 11 _ from a chapter in the _ arabian night _ from the middle of the most gorgeous fairy-tale the mind of man could invent i write to you to-night often i have hear of the taj mahal read of its beauty dream of its magic but never in my dream do i imagine anything so exquisite so perfect boggley think i should not leave indium without see this miracle of miracle -- the final wonder of the world so we leave calcutta on Monday night by the punjab mail and come to agra and we have do it all in proper order yesterday in the morning we motor to the desert city the capital of akbar the greatest of the mogul emperor about twenty mile off it have battlement wall and great gate like a fairy-tale city the bazaar part of it be mostly in ruin but the royal part be perfectly preserved and could be live in comfortably now there be akbar 's council chamber the house of he wife the courtyard where they play live chess the stable waterworks the palace of he chief minister the mosque and cloister the gate of victory the carve in marble and red sandstone be wonderful akbar must have be a broad-minded man for we find painting of the annunciation side by side with picture of the hindu god ganesh it be intensely interesting to see the place just as it be hundred of year ago in the great mosque quadrangle there be a marble mausoleum delicately carve a priceless piece of work in mother-of-pearl erect to akbar 's high priest and we guide be he lineal descendant glad to get five rupee for he trouble we lunch in the government bungalow a comfortable place not glaringly out of keep with the surroundings and then motor to akbar 's tomb -- another piece of colossal magnificence i be awed by it out of the glaring sunshine we go down a long dark passage to a great vault where the air be cold with the coldness of death it be completely dark except for one ray of light fall on the plain marble tomb a old mohammedan croon eerily impressively a lament which echo round and round the vault the mohammedan and the scot have a similar passion for death and funeral lastly in its fitting order we drive to the taj mahal you know the story i have just be read about it in steeven 's book you know how shah jehan grandson of akbar first mogul emperor of hindustan loved and marry the beautiful persian arjmand banu -- call mumtaz-i-mahal -- and when she die he in he grief swear that she should have the loveliest tomb the world ever behold and for seventeen year he build the taj mahal you know how after thirty year he son rise up and dethrone he and keep he a close prisoner for seven year in the gem mosque where he daughter jehanara attend he and would not leave he when grow very feeble he beg to be lay where he could see the taj mahal and the request be grant you know how he die with he face towards the tomb of the beautiful persian whose palankeen follow all he campaign in the day when empire be still a-winning whose child call he father -- arjmand banu silent and unseen now for four-and-thirty year the wife of he youth such a passionate old story such a marvellous love-memorial shah jehan -- mumtaz-i-mahal -- grape garden -- golden pavilion -- jasmine tower as gw steeven say there be dizzy-magic in the very name i be no more capable of describe it than i would have be capable of build it you must see it for yourself it alone be worth come to indium to see leave the taj mahal daze and dizzy with beauty i be hail by a voice that sound familiar and turn round i saw -- a incongruous figure in that arabian night garden -- we old friend of the _ scotium _ the rock horse fly she have another female with she and mr brand the funny man who ask conundrum i be afraid my eye have ask what he be do in this galley for he hastily say that he have only arrive in agra that morning and find we _ scotium _ acquaintance at the hotel i introduce boggley and we stand uncomfortably about while the rock horse fly wax sentimental over we meeting be not it odd she say that we should all meet and just part again i think it would have be much odder -lrb- and how infinitely horrible -rrb- if we have all meet and never part as it happen we be not allow to part with she as soon as we could have wish she discover we be stay at the same hotel so we have to dine together and she talk the taj all through dinner spatter it with adjective while boggley grunt at interval it be refresh to see mr brand again he seem to be enjoy indium vastly and have three quite new story though if he do not laugh so much tell they it would be easier to see the point boggley and he love each other at once after dinner when the man be smoke the rock horse fly begin to get arch -- do not you hate people when they be arch -- and say surely i be never go home without capture some heart i reply stoutly and truthfully that i be naughty girl say the rhf you have not make the most of you opportunity do not you know what they call girl who come out for the cold weather i say i do not they be call ` the fishing fleet ' she say sweetly i say oh because i do not know what else to say feeling as i do so remiss i have hear -- mr townley tell I -- that long ago when a ship from england arrive in the hoogly a cannon be fire and all the gay bachelor leave they office and go to the dock to appraise the new arrival a ball be give on board on the night of arrival and many of the girl be engage before they leave the ship i do not object to that it be a fine sincere way of do thing but why the subject of marriage should be make a occasion for archness for sly look for -- in extreme case -- nudging pass my comprehension the rhf have a way of make common any subject she touch -- even the taj and marriage -- so i think i would go to bed as i say goodnight i regard attentively the friend wonder much how anyone could of choice accompany the rhf in she journeying she be a very silent person large and fat and about forty and she eye be small out of all proportion to she face but they twinkle at I in such a understanding way that i generally so chary of offer embrace go up to kiss she she be kind but so large that be kiss by she be almost as destroy as be in a railway accident do i ignore what you say in you letter you see it be rather difficult write to a friend in a far country be like shout through a speaking-tube to the moon and one can not shout very intimate thing can one let we be sensible do not be angry but be you

feeblest you have a refined sense of humor the poorest most obvious joke be good enough for I but this be only talk i do not know that i be in love -- i do not like the expression anyway -- but this i know that if you be not in the world it would be a unpeopled waste to I the place you happen to be in be where all interest centre every minute of the time as i go through my day laugh talk enjoy

for they how dull for all the rest of the people in the world not to have a _ you _ i be not go to write any more not because i have not lot to say but because write much or talk much about a thing -- be queer and scot it be hard for I to say love -- seem somehow to cheapen it profane it i have open this just to say again my dear my dear _ calcutta April 21 _ only three more day in indium and i do not know whether i be horribly sorry to go or profoundly relieved to get away there be no doubt it be a sudden and dangerous country three people we know have die suddenly of cholera and two other have have bomb throw at they i shall be thankful to find myself safely on board the steamer but even if i escape i be leave boggley in the midst of these peril not that he let the thought of they vex he soul you learn he say to look upon death in a different way in indium but i be sure i never could learn to regard with equanimity the thought of be quite well one day and be hurry away to the circular road cemetery early the next it be sad to die in a foreign land and it be somehow specially sad at least i think so for a home-loving scot to lie away from home tell I not the good and wise care not where they dust repose that to he who sleep lie desert rock shall seem as rose i have be happy above ground i could ne'er be happy under out of teviot 's gentle sound part we then not far asunder yesterday i see a pathetic sight a couple in a _ tikka-gharry _ the man a soldier a gordon highlander and on the front seat a tiny coffin the man 's arm be round the woman 's shoulder and she be cry bitterly a bit of shabby crape be tie round she hat and she carry a sad little wreath since come back from agra we have stay at the grand hotel it be a comfortable airy place wonderfully pleasant in the morning when we sit at a little table in the verandah look out on the maidan and flat-faced hill-waiter bring we a excellent breakfast we own servant be with we -- autolycus and bellum when we arrive very early in the morning and the coolie be carry up we luggage a servant sleep outside he master 's door hold up he hand for quietness say something quite gently about not wake he master beat he say autolycus to the coolie quite without heat as he hurry on the air get hotter and everything look more and more tired every day even proud-pied April dress in all its trim can not put a spirit of youth into anything but these last day in calcutta in spite of fear and heat be very pleasant i do not know how i could have say the calcutta woman be horrid now that i be go to leave they they seem so kind and attractive every minute of my time be fill up with river-picnics garden-party tennis tournament dinner and theater party and my morning be spend with g rake in queer shop for curiosity i be insatiable for thing to take home and autolycus have pack and rope three large wooden box contain my treasure i wish life be not such a mixed thing just when i be tiptoe on the height of joy because i be go home i be bring to common earth with a thud by the miserable thought that i must leave boggley -lrb- how pleasant it would be to have a sort of spiritual whipping-boy to bear the nasty thing in life for one -- the disappointment the worry the time of illness and sorrow the parting -rrb- boggley say it will be all right once i be away as a rule he only feel pleasantly home-sick now with the preparation for departure constantly before he help to address box to the familiar old place go with I in imagination from port to port till we reach cool western land i be afraid he have many a pang i be so sorry you be so worried you will almost have get my letter by this time but i wish i have cable as you ask only somehow i do not like the idea i think you know i care but after all how could you i do not know myself when i leave england look back i seem always to have care immensely how could i help it what i can not understand be how every woman of you acquaintance do not care as i do you seem to I so lovable i be so glad -lrb- though it seem a odd thing to be glad about -rrb- that you have no mother and no sister i do not feel such a marauder as i would have do if by take you i have rob some other woman and i be glad of you lonely life i shall be able to show you what a nice thing a home be a quiet safe place we shall make it where worldly care may not enter boggley say i can make a hotel room look home-like and indeed it be almost my only accomplishment this talent for home-making there be one thing i want to say to you you know what robert loui say about married man -- that there be no wander in pleasant bypath for they that the road lie long and straight and dusty to the grave it dull I to think of it _ do not _ feel that do not let it be true we must not let we life get dusty and straight and narrow we shall love whimsy and we shall laugh so long as laughter be not heartless and do not hurt anyone it be good to laugh life will see to it that there be tear -- at least i be tell so but suppose in year to come after we have grow use to each other -lrb- though it do amaze I that people should talk about thing lose they charm because one get _ use _ to they do a child tire of its mother because it be use to she be spring any the less wonderful because we be use to she coming god grant we have many year to get use to each other -rrb- -- suppose one fine morning you find that life have lose its savor you be tire of the accustomed round you be tire of the house you be tire of the look of the furniture you want to get away for a time -- in a word to be free well remember you be not to feel that the road be not clear before you i promise you not to feel aggrieved i sha not wonder how my infinite variety could have pall i know that all man -- man who be man -- at time hear the red god call they -lrb- woman hear they too you know only they have more self-control they find they peace in fearful innocence and household law -rrb- and i shall be wait on the doorstep when you return from climb kangchenjunga or explore the bramahputra gorge ready to say come away in for i be sure you must be tired arthur dear be i a disappointing person do you find ought i to be able to write you different sort of letter tenderer more loving letter but you see it would not be I if i could my heart may be indeed i think it be full of the warmest instinct but they have be unwinged from birth so they can not fly to you one of the most talkative people live in some way i be strangely speechless why i have not even tell boggley though if he have eye to see instead of be the blindest of dear old bat my shine face would betray I i keep on smile in a perfectly imbecile manner so that people exclaim well you be indecently glad to get away and when they ask why i point they to the scene in the old testament where hadad say unto pharaoh _ let I depart that i may go to mine own country then pharaoh say unto he but what hast thou lack with I that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answer nothing : howbeit let I go in any wise _ so it be with I indium have give I the best of good time i have lack for nothing -- howbeit let I go in any wise you need not think i be change i be not i be afraid i be not one would think that a new environment would make a difference but it really do not a person with a suburban mind would be as suburban in the wild of nepal as in the wild of toot the illuminating thought have come to I that it be not a man 's environment that matter it be he mind have not you often notice in a evening in london all the city man hurry home like rabbit to they burrow -lrb- not the prosperous city man but the lesser one whose frock-coat be rather shiny and they silk hat rather dull -rrb- and have not you often think how narrow they life be how cramp they environment but suppose one of those clerk love book and be something of a poet what do it matter to he though he room in clapham or brixton be grimy almost squalid and fill with the worst kind of victorian furniture mind innocent and quiet take such for a hermitage once inside the long day at the office over and the door shut on the world a arm-chair draw up to the fire and he book around he he be as happy as a king for he mind to he be a kingdom he may be a puny little man in bodily presence contemptible but he will feel no physical disability as he clamber on the wall of jerusalem with count raymond or thrill as he set forth with drake to fight spaniard one against ten instead of the raucous cry of the milk or the coal man he hear the horn of elfland faintly blow and instead of a window which can show he nothing but a sodden plot plant with wearied-looking shrub he have the key of that magic casement which open on perilous sea in fairyland forlorn he will never do anything great in the world he will never lead a forlorn hope or marry the princess or see far land he will never be anything but a poor shabby clerk but he be of such stuff as dream be make of and god have give to he he fairyland no i do not think a new environment change people and it be foolish to think it make they forget sometimes in the eden garden at sunset when we draw up to listen to the band i watch the face of the youth -- scot boy come out from glasgow and dundee -- dream there in the indian twilight while the piper play the tune familiar to they since childhood they be sahib out here they have a horse to ride and a servant to look after they thing they never would have have have they stay in dundee or glasgow but though they be proud they be lonely what do grandeur matter if the quothquan folk can not see it the peepul tree rustle softly overhead the languorous soft air lap they round the scent of the east be in they nostril but they eye be with they heart and be this what they see a night of drizzling rain a street of tall dingy gray house and a boy he day 's work do bound upstairs three step at a time to a cosy kitchen where the tea be spread where work-roughened hand at he come lift the brown teapot from the hob and a kind mother 's voice welcome he home at the end of the day autolycus have knock at the door to say master 's come -lrb- he like to be very european with I so do not call he sahib -rrb- and i must go to tea to-morrow boggley be take the whole day off and we have get it all plan out every minute of it in the morning we shall drive in a _ tikka-gharry _ to the store to buy some final necessaries -lrb- such as soap and tooth-powder -rrb- then to pelitus 's to eat ice then to the shop in park street so that boggley may get I a delay birthday present then round and round the maidan _ then _ we shall go to luncheon at the townley and go on with they to tollygunge for golf _ then _ we be go to tea with some people who be take we a motor run _ then _ we go to a farewell dinner at the ormonde ' then we shall go to bed bless you my dear _ ss socotra homeward bind somewhere in the hoogly April 24 _ this day seem to have be go on for week and it be only tea-time now be it only this morning that we leave i can not think it be _ this _ morning that boggley and i take we last _ chota-hazrus _ together and boggley as he gloomily sugar he tea say now i know what a condemn man feel like on the morning of he execution then we laugh and it be not so bad autolycus very important because the miss sahib be go to cross the black water bustle about with my few package -lrb- all the heavy baggage go away two day ago -rrb- and finally bustle we into a _ tikka-gharry _ in such good time that we have to drive twice round the maidan before we go to the landing-stage dear funny autolycus i shall miss he ugly honest face he have add greatly to the gaiety of nation as represent by boggley and I the last we see of he be stand before the hotel door along with bellum and the two _ chuprassis _ bow low and murmur salaam miss sahib salaam while i undignified to the last knelt on the seat and wildly wave a handkerchief the landing be crowd with people i wonder how we be all to get on board one ship but find as we get on to the launch that most of the people remain behind they be only see-er off mr townley have by some means manage to get permission for himself he wife and boggley to go down the river with we in the launch to where the _ socotra _ lay which be a great comfort to we all when we find we party poor g 's face be much less pink than usual the ormonde be there have ride down to see we off and quite a lot of other people have come for the same reason we -lrb- the passenger -rrb- have to be medically examine before we be allow to leave -- in case of plague i suppose g and i be rather scare at the thought -- how be we to know that we have not plague lurk about we however after a very cursory glance we be pass on get we good-bye say and embark on the launch at any other time i would have hate say good-bye to the ormonde and the other dear people but with the parting from boggley loom so near i be absent-minded and callous though i hope i do not appear so the _ socotra _ be quite a tiny ship compare to the _ scotium _ g and i clamber on board in great haste to find we cabin we find it already occupy by we cabin companion -lrb- she be scotch and have artificial tooth and a fine rich glasgow accent and -lrb- i think -rrb- be of a gentle and yielding disposition -rrb- and a enormous hat-box boggley be with we but when he see we be go to be firm he flee this say g wave she hand towards the offend box must go into the baggage-room certainly say the glasgow woman i be sure i do not know what it be do here ma husband write the label and she actually begin to drag it into the passage see she so amenable to reason we smile kindly and beg she to desist but she say not at all and smile back in such a delightfully glasgow weel-pleased way that my heart warm to she i can see she will be a constant entertainment mr townley introduce we to the captain who look kind and who ask we to sit at he table and then we all go in to breakfast in spite of we low spirit we enjoy the meal g create something of a fracas about a kidney which she eat and then say be bad but she calm down and we enjoy look at the other passenger speculate as to who and what they be almost directly after breakfast we people have to go and g and i very stricken watch the launch as it steam up the river till lose to sight behind a big vessel since then except for a interval in the cabin to get we eye bath into decency we have sit on deck with ache head try to read and write at first the heat be terrible we droop like candle in the sun we wilt like flower and g gasp if all the voyage be go to be as hot as this i be do limp and wretched i agree with she then we find we have put we chair against the kitchen which be up on deck in this ship no wonder we be warm we quickly find a cooler spot and i have be write a long letter to boggley to send off with the pilot be not he pure gold my boggley i know that you too think nobly of the soul he will be home in a year and i be try to tell myself that a year be not long well the indian trip be over and i have a lot learn a few thing and make some friend -- best of they my faithful g it be rather astonishing that i should have the joy of she company home again many people i be sure expect she would remain in indium but i think she take the precaution to leave she heart at home wise g one thing you should be thankful for there will be no more letter what a blessing people be nicer than they letter how good you have be about mine how willing to take a interest in the people i meet in the place i saw in everything i tell you about and when i be jocose you pretend to be amuse ah well be cheerful sir we revel now be end and so i be go home home to my own bleak kindly land place of all weather that end in rain i be go home to my own people -lrb- i think i see peter jig up and down in expectation before my trunk -rrb- and i be go to you and the queer thing be i can not feel glad i be so home-sick for indium all my horror of bomb and sudden death have go and memory -lrb- as someone say -rrb- be make magic carpet under my foot so that i be back again in the white hot sunlight under the dusty palm-tree hear the creak of the wagon as the patient oxen toil on the long straight road and the song of the coolie return home at even i see the country lie vague in the clammy morning mist and the great broad gange glimmer wanly and again it be a wonderful clear night of star i know that my own land be the best land that the fat babu with he carefully oil and part hair and he too-apparent sock-suspenders can not be mention in the same breath as the britisher that we daffodil and primrose be sweeter far than the heavy-scented blossom of the east that the brain-fever bird of indium be a wretched substitute for the lark and the thrush and other of god 's jocund little fowl that abana and pharpar and other river of damascus be better than this jordan -- all this i say i know but to-night i do not believe it indium have throw golden dust in my eye and i be see thing all wrong we have anchor for the night i be watch the misty green blur which be all that be leave to I of indium grow more and more indistinct as darkness fall soon it will be night g who have be absolutely silent for more than a hour sit up suddenly just now and take my hand olivium she say it be a nice place england she tone be the tone of one seek reassurance it be i say dolefully _ very _ and it really do not rain such a great deal no anyway it be home and indium be not though indium _ have _ be jolly she sigh then i shall enjoy a slice of good roast beef
