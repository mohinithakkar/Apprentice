bear a rueful countenance down piccadilly and into halfmoon street where presently he introduce it to one whom he find await he in he lodgings much at ease in he easiest chair make free with he whiskey and tobacco and read a slender brown volume select from he shelf this dégagé person be patently a englishman though there be trace of oriental ancestry in he cast the other he of the doleful habit be as unmistakably of gallic pattern though he dress and carry himself in a thoroughly anglo-saxon fashion and even seem a trace intrigue when greet by a name distinctively french for the englishman rousing from he appropriate ease drop he book to the floor beside the chair uprose and extend a cordial hand exclaim : h ` be ye monsieur duchemin to this the other respond after a slight pause obscurely enough : oh ancient history eh well for the matter of that : how be you mister wertheimer they hand fall apart and monsieur duchemin proceed to do away he hat and stick and chamoix glove while he friend straddle in front of a cold grate and extend he hand to a imaginary blaze cover with a mild complaint the curiosity excite by a brief study of that face of melancholy pretty way you have get of make you friend wait on you pleasure here i have waste upward of two hour of he majesty 's time how be i to know you would have the cheek to force you way in here in my absence and help yourself to my few poor consolation duchemin retort help himself to they in turn but then one never do know what fresh indignity fate have in store after you with that whiskey by you leave i say : i would give something to know where you ignorant furriner come by this precious pre-war stuff but without wait to be deny this information mr wertheimer continue : go on the evidence of you look and temper you have be down to tilbury dock this afternoon to see karslake and sonium off a few such flash of intelligence apply professionally my friend should carry you far and the experience have leave you feel a bit down what i imagine even you do not esteem parting with those whom one love a exhilarating pastime but when it be so obviously for they own good oh i know duchemin agree without enthusiasm if anything should happen to karslake now it would break sonium 's heart but and after the part he play in that vassilyevskus show he lease of life would not be apt to be prolong by stay on in england i agree but still -- sigh duchemin throw himself heavily into a chair which wertheimer continue standing be why we arrange to give he that billet with the british legation in peking do not know you have a hand in that observe duchemin after favor the other with a morose stare oh you can not trust I when you get to know I better you 'll find i be always like that -- forever flit hither and yon bestow benefit and boon on the ungrateful like any other giddy providence but one be not ungrateful duchemin insist god know i would gladly have speed karslake 's emigration with sonium to van dieman 's land or patagonium or where you will if it promise to keep he out of the way long enough for the smolny institute to forget he since the say smolny inconsiderately persist in fail to collapse as per the daily prediction of the hopeful just so but be not you forget you yourself have give that smolny lot the same and quite as much reason for hold you name anathema ah duchemin growl -- as for I i can take care of myself thank you my trouble be i want somebody else to take care of i have a daughter once for a few week long enough to make I strangely fond of the responsibility of a father and then karslake take she away leave I nothing to do with my life but twiddle futile thumb and contemplate the approach of middle age middle age why flatter yourself with a daughter marry too sonium 's only eighteen she be bear when you be twenty that make you nearly forty and that be next door to second childhood man the englishman declare solemnly -- you be superannuated i know and so long as i feel my year even you can abuse I with impunity but wertheimer would not hear he odd he muse i never think of it before that you be grow old and i have be wonder too what it be that have be make you so precious slow and cautious and cranky of late you be just doddering -- and i think you be simply tire out and need a holiday perhaps i be and do say duchemin patiently one feel one have earn a holiday if ever anybody do in you bless s s ah you think so you would think so if you would be muck round the east end all winter with you life in you hand still -- at you age -- i would be think about retire instead of ask for a rest although duchemin know very well that he be merely be ragged in that way of deadly seriousness which so often amuse the english he choose to suggest sourly : my resignation be at you disposal any time you wish it accept say wertheimer airily to take effect at once to this duchemin merely grunt as who should say he do not consider this turn of conversation desperately amusing and wertheimer resume he chair the two remain for some moment in silence a silence so doggedly maintain on both side that duchemin be presently aware of dull gnawing of curiosity it occur to he that he caller should have find plenty to do in he bureau in the war office and to what he enquire with the tedious irony of ennui be one indebted for this unexpected honor on the part of the first under-secretary of the british secret service or whatever you high-sounding official title be oh wertheimer reply lazily -- and knock out he pipe -- i merely drop in to say good-bye duchemin discover symptom of more animation hello where be you off to nowhere -- worse luck i mean i be here to bid you farewell and godspeed and what not on the eve of you departure from the british isle and where pray be i go that be for you to say monsieur duchemin meditate briefly i see he announce : i be to have a rove commission worse than that : none at all duchemin open he eye wide ` the wind bloweth where it listeth ' wertheimer affirm how do i know whither you 'll blow now you be a free agent again entirely on you own i have get no control over you movement the s s have never no more do not you tender I you resignation a moment ago be not it promptly accept look here : what the devil -- well if you must know the englishman interrupted hastily my instruction be to give you you walking papers if you refuse to resign so you connection with the s s be from this hour sever and if you be not out of england within twenty-four hour we 'll jolly well deport you and that be that one perceive one have serve england not wisely but too well shrewd lad wertheimer laugh you see old soul we admire you no end and we be determine to save you life word have leak through from petrograd that you name have be triple-star on the smolny 's index expurgatorius karslake 's too a honor legitimately earn by you pernicious collaboration in the vassilyevskus bust karslake 's already take care of but you be still in the limelight and that make you a public nuisance if you linger here much longer the verdict will undoubtedly be : violent death at the hand of some person or person unknown so here be passport and a goodish bit of money if you run through all of it before this blow over we 'll find a way of course to get more to you you understand : no price too high that buy good riddance of you and there will be a destroyer wait at portsmouth to-night with instruction to put ashore secretly anywhere you like across the channel after that -- as far as the british empire be concern -- you blood be on you own head the other nod investigate the envelope which he late chief have hand he then from he letter of credit and passport look up with a reminiscent smile it be not the first time you have vouch for I by this style remember well you have earn as fair title to the name of duchemin as i ever do to that of wertheimer but the smile be fading from the eye of the man whom england prefer to recognize as andré duchemin but where on earth be one to go do not ask I the englishman protest and above all do not tell I i do not want to know since i have be on this job i have learn to believe in telepathy and mind reading and witchcraft and all manner of unholy rot and i do not want you to come to a sudden end through somebody 's establish illicit intercourse with my subconscious mind he take he leave shortly after that and monsieur duchemin settle down in the chair which he guest have quit to grapple with he problem : where under heaven to go after a waste while he pick up in abstraction the book which wertheimer have be read -- and wonder if by any chance he have leave it there on purpose so strong seem the hint it be stevenson 's ` travels with a donkey ' duchemin be familiar enough with the work and have no need to dip anew into its page to know it offer one fair solution to he quandary if -- he assure himself -- there be any place in europe where one might count on be reasonably secure from the solicitous attention of the grudge-bearing bolshevikus it be the cévennes those little-known hill in the south of france well inland from the sea ii one walk a little place call le monastier in a pleasant highland valley fifteen mile from le puy notable for the making of lace for drunkenness for freedom of language and for unparalleled political dissension be mr stevenson 's point of departure on he travels with a donkey monsieur duchemin make it he as well and on the fourth morning of he hegira from england set out from le monastier afoot a volume of montaigne in he pocket a stout stick in he fist -- the fat rucksack strap to he shoulder enable this latter-day traveller to dispense with the society of another donkey the weather be fine he heart high he be happy to be out of harness and again he own man more than once he laugh a little to think of the vain question of he whereabouts which be be moot in the underworld of europe where -lrb- as well he know -rrb- man and woman spit when they name he for he route from the channel coast to le monastier have be sufficiently discreet and devious to persuade he that he escape have be as cleanly execute as it be timely instigate thus for upward of a fortnight he fare southward in the footstep of mr stevenson and much good profit have he of the adventure for it be he common practice to go to bed with the bird and rise with the sun and more often than not he lodge in the inn of the silver moon with moss for a couch leafy bough for a canopy and the star for night-light -- accommodation infinitely more agreeable than those afford by the grubby and malodorous auberge of the wayside average and between sun and sun he punish he boot famously constant exercise tune up muscle go slack and soft with easy living upland wind cleanse the man of the reek of city and make he appetite a thing appalling a keen sun darken he face and hand brush up in he cheek a warmer glow than they have show in many a year and fade out the heavier line with which time have mark he countenance moreover because this be france where one may affect a whisker without lose face he neglect he razor and though this be not he first think a fair disguise it prove for when toward the end of the second week he submit that wanton luxuriance to be tame by a barber of florac he hardly know the trimly beard mask of bronze that look back at he from a mirror not that it matter to monsieur duchemin from the first he meet few of any sort and none at all whom a lively and exacting distrust reckon a likely factor in he affair it be a wild bold land he traverse and thinly people at pain to avoid the larger town he seek by choice the loneliest path that loop its quiet hill such as pass the time of day with he be few and for the most part peasant a dull dour lot taciturn to a degree that please he well so that he soon forget to be forever alert for the crack of a ambush pistol or the pattering footfall of a assassin with a knife it be at florac on the tarnon that he part company with the trail of stevenson here that one have turn east to alai whereas duchemin have be lose to the world not nearly long enough he be mind to wander on till weary the weather hold there be sunshine in golden flood and by night moonlight like molten silver between beetle rampart of stone terraced crenellated and battlemented in motley stratum of pink and brown and yellow and black the river tarn have gouge out for itself a canyon through which its water sweep and tumble as green as translucent jade in sunlight profound emerald in shadow cream white in churn rapid the lofty profile of its cliff be fringe with stunt growth of pine and ash a ragged stubble while here and there châteaux forsake as a rule and crumble rear ruin silhouette against the blue eighteen hundred foot below it might be more the tarn thread lush bottom-land till field goodly orchard plantation of walnut and spanish chestnut and infrequent tiny village that cling to precarious foothold between cliff and water on high again beyond the cliff stretch the causs vast arid and barren plateau flat and featureless save for a occasional low round mound a menhir or a dolmen and -lrb- if such may be term feature -rrb- great pit that open in the earth like cold crater which the countryfolk term avens a strange bleak land inhospitable wind-harried haunt the home of seven howling devil of desolation rain at length intern the traveller for three day in a little place call meyruei which lie sweetly in the valley of the jonte at its confluence with the butézon long league remote from railroad and the world they stitch together -- that world of unrest uncertainty and intrigue which in those day seem no better than a madhouse the break in the monotony of daily footfaring prove agreeable it suit one well to camp for a space in that quaint town isolate in the heart of a enchanted land with which one be in turn enchanted and contemplate soberly the grave issue of life and death here -lrb- say duchemin -rrb- nothing can disturb I and it be high time for I to be consider what i be to make of the remainder of my day too many of they have be waste too great a portion of my span have be sacrifice to vanity one must not forget one be in a fair way to become a grandfather it be plainly a urgent duty to reconcile oneself to that estate and cultivate its proper gravity and decorum yet a little while and one must bid adieu to that youth which one have so heedlessly squander a last adieu to youth with its day of high adventure its carefree heart its susceptibility to the infinite seduction of romance quite seriously the adventurer entertain a premonition of he to-morrow a vision of himself in skull-cap and seedy clothing -lrb- the trousers well-bagged at the knee -rrb- with rather more than a mere hint of a equator emphasize by grease-spot on he waistcoat preside over the fortune of one of those dingy little parisian shop wherein debatable antique accumulate dust till they fetch the ducat of the credulous and of a Sunday walk out in a shiny frock-coat with he ribbon of the legion in the buttonhole a ratty topper crowning he placid brow a humid grandchild adhering to he hand : a thrifty and respectable bourgeois the final avatar of a rolling stone yes : it be amusing but quite true though it would need a deal of contrive something little short of a revolution to bring it about to precisely such a future as that do duchemin most seriously propose to dedicate himself but always they say it be god who dispose and for all this mood of premature resignation to the bourgeois virtue duchemin be glad enough when he fourth day in meyruei dawn fair and by eight be up and away purpose a round day 's tramp across the causse noir to montpellier-le-vieux -lrb- concern which one hear curious tale -rrb- then on by way of the gorge of the dourbie to millau for the night nor would he heed the dubious head shake by he host of meyruei who earnestly advise a guide the causs he declare be treacherous man sometimes lose they way upon those lofty plain and be never hear of more duchemin do not in the least mind get lose that be to say fail to make he final objective at worst he could depend upon a good memory and a unfailing sense of direction to lead he back the way he have come he be to learn there be nothing more unpalatable than the repentance of the headstrong he find it a stiffish climb up out of the valley of the jonte by the time he have manage it the sun have already rob all vegetation of its ephemeral jewellery the causse itself show few sign of a downpour which have drench it for seventy-two hour on end to that porous limestone formation water in whatever quantity be as beer to a boche only if one pause to listen on the brink of a aven there be odd and disturbing noise to be hear underfoot liquid whispering grim chuckle horrible gurgle that tell of subterranean stream in spate coursing in darkness to destination unknown unguessable he path -lrb- there be no trace of road -rrb- run snakily through a dense miniature forest of dwarf gnarled pine of a peculiarly sombre green ever and again in some scant clearing lose itself in a web of similar path that converge from all point of the compass so that the wayfarer be fain to steer by the sun -- and at one time find himself abruptly on the brink of a ravine that gash the earth like a cruel wound he work he way to a elevation which show he plainly that -- unless by a debatable detour of several mile -- there be no way to the farther side but through the depths of the ravine itself if that descent be a desperate business the subsequent climb be heartbreaking he need a long rest before he be able to plod on now conceive the sun in the guise of a personal enemy the sweat that stream from he face be brine upon he lip for hour it be thus with duchemin and in all that time he meet never a soul once he see from a distance a lonely château overhang another ravine but it be apparently only one more of the many ruin indigenous to that land and he take no step toward closer acquaintance long after noon sheer fool 's luck lead he to a hamlet whose mean auberge serve he bread and cheese with a wine singularly thin and acid here he enquire for a guide but the one able-bodied man in evidence a hulk surly animal on learn that duchemin wish to visit montpellier-le-vieux refuse with a growl to have anything to do with he several time during the course of luncheon he catch the fellow eye he strangely he think from a window of the auberge in the end the peasant girl who wait on he grudgingly consent to put he on he way in a rocky gorge call the rajol a spot as inhumanly grotesque as a nightmare of gustave doré 's with the heat of a pit in tophet he labor for hour the hush of evening and its long shadow be on the land when finally he scramble out to the causse again then he lose he path another time miss entirely the village of maubert where he have think to find a conveyance or at least a guide and in the silver and purple mystery of a perfect moonlight night find himself look down from a hilltop upon montpellier-le-vieux rumor have prepare he to know the place when he see it nothing for its stupendous lunacy heaven know what convulsion or measure process of nature accomplish this thing for he part duchemin be unable to accept any possible scientific explanation and will go to he grave believe that some half-witted cyclops back beyond the dimmest dawn of time create montpellier-le-vieux in a hour of idleness building he a play city of titanic monolith then wander away and forget it altogether he see what seem to be a city at least two mile in length more than half as wide a huddle of dwelling of every shape and size a labyrinth of narrow tortuous street break here and there by wide and stately avenue with public square and vast cirque -lrb- of such amphitheatre he count no less than six -rrb- and wall command by a citadel but never door or window break the face of any building no chimney exhale a breath of smoke neither wheel nor foot disturb these grass-grown thoroughfare montpellier-the-old indeed duchemin reflect but rather montpellier-the-dead -- dead with the utter deadness of that which have never live marvel he go down into the city of stone and pass through its desolate way shape a course for the southern limit where he think to find the road to millau fatigue alone dictate this choice of the short cut but for that he confess he might have go the long way round he be no more prone to childish terror than any other man but to he mind there be something sinister in the portentous immobility of the place in its silence its want of excuse for be a sense of age-old evil like a inarticulate menace out of this mood he fail to laugh himself time and again he would catch himself listen for he know not what approach warily the corner of the next huge monolith as if think to surprise behind it some ghoulish rite glance apprehensively down the corridor he pass or overshoulder for some nameless thing that stalk he and be never there when he look but ever lurk impishly just beyond the tail of he eye so that when abruptly a man move from behind a rock some thirty or forty pace ahead duchemin stop short with jangled nerve and a barely smother exclamation possibly a shape of spectral terror would have be less startling in that weird place and hour humanity seem more incongruous than the supernatural it be at once apparent that the man have neither knowledge of nor concern with the stranger for a instant he stand with he back to the latter peer intently down the aisle which duchemin have be follow a stout body fill out too well the uniform of a private soldier in the american expeditionary force -- that most ungainly inutile unbecoming costume that ever grace the form of man then he half turn beckon hastily to one invisible to the observer and furtively move on as furtively he signal be answer by a fellow who wear the nondescript garment of a peasant and as suddenly as they have come into sight the two slip round a rocky shoulder and the street of monolith be empty iii meeting by moonlight now grant that a soldier should be free to spend he leave where he will unchallenged it remain true that the last of the aef have long since say farewell to the shore of france while the tarn country seem a far cry from the bank of the rhine in those day still under occupation by force of the united state regular army then too it be a fact within the knowledge of monsieur duchemin that the uniform of the american have more than frequently be use by those ancient acquaintance of he the apach of pari as a cloak for they own misdoing so it do not need the air of stealth that mark this business to persuade he there be mischief in the brew but indeed he get in motion to investigate without stop to debate a excuse for so do and several seconds before he hear the woman 's cry of these the first sound shrill with alarm as duchemin turn the corner where the prowler have go from sight but a high wall of rock alone meet he vision and he break into a run that carry he round still another corner and then plump he headlong into the theater of villainy this be open ground a breadth of turf border on one of the great cirque -- a rudely oval pit at a guess little less than seven hundred foot in its narrowest diameter and something like four hundred in depth a vast black well against whose darkness the blue-white moonglare etch a strange grouping of figure seven in all on he one hand duchemin see a woman in mourn clasp to she bosom a terrify young girl the author of the scream on the other three man close-locked in grimmest combat one defend himself against two with indifferent success while in between stand a third woman with she back to and perilously near the chasm shrink from the threat of a pistol in the hand of the fourth man this last be the one nearest duchemin who be upon he so suddenly that it would be difficult to say which be the more surprised when duchemin 's stick strike down the pistol hand of the other with such force as must have break he wrist the weapon fall he utter a oath as he swing round clutch the maim member and then see he assailant for the first time he swoop down to recover the weapon so swiftly that it be in he left hand and spit vicious tongue of orange flame before duchemin be able to get in a second blow but there be the abrupt end of that passage smitten cruelly between the eye the fellow grunt thickly and go over backwards like a bundle of rag head and shoulder jut out over the brink of the precipice so far that though he body check perceptibly as it strike the ground he own weight carry he on he shoot out into space and vanish as though some unseen hand have lift up from these dark depths and pluck he down to annihilation the young girl shriek again the woman give a gasp of horror duchemin himself know a sickish qualm but he have no time to spare for that : it be go ill with the man contend against two the adventurer 's stick might have be bewitch that night so magical be its work a single blow on the nearest head -lrb- but believe it be select with care -rrb- and instantaneously that knot of contention be resolve into its three several part the smitten clap hand to he hurt moan he brother scoundrel start back with stare eye in which rage give place to dismay as he grasp the change in the situation and see the stick swing for he head in turn he duck neatly the stick whistle through thin air and before duchemin could recover the other have turn and be run for dear life duchemin delay a bare instant but manifestly he assistance be no more need here in a breath he who have be so recently outmatch recollect he wit and take the initiative with admirable address duchemin see he fly furiously at he late opponent trip and lay he on he back then turn and give chase to the fugitive this be the masquerader in the american uniform and a amazingly fleet pair of heel he show take into account he heaviness of body already he have a fair lead and have he maintain for long the pace he set in the first few hundred yard he must have win away scot-free but whether he lack stay power or confidence he make the mistake of adopt another and less fatiguing means of locomotion duchemin see he swerve from he first course and steer for a vehicle standing at some distance -- evidently the conveyance which have bring the sightseer to view the spectacle of montpellier-le-vieux by moonlight wait in the middle of a broad avenue of misshapen obelisk a dilapidated barouche with a low body sag the lower for debilitate spring on either side its pole droop two sorry specimen of crowbait and they pained amazement be so unfeigned that duchemin laugh aloud when the fat rogue bound to the box snatch up rein and whip and curl a cruel lash round they bony flank from this one infer that he be indifferently acquaint with the animal certainly not they accustomed driver and since it take they some moment to come to they sens and appreciate that all this be not a evil dream duchemin 's hand be clutch for the back of the carriage when the horse break suddenly into a awkward lumber gallop and whisk it out of reach but not for long extend himself duchemin catch the fold top jump and begin to clamber in the man on the box be tug fretfully at something wedge in the hip-pocket of he breeches proof enough that he be not the original tenant of the uniform since it fit too snugly to permit ready extraction of a pistol in a emergency but he get no chance whatever to use the weapon for the moment duchemin find he own foot in the sway vehicle he leap on the shoulder of the other and drag he backwards from the box what follow be not very clear to he a mélange of impression the mock-american fight like a devil unchained cursing duchemin fluently in the purest and foulest argot of belleville -- which be not in the french vocabulary of the doughboy the animal at the pole catch fire of this madness and run away in good earnest that wretch barouche roll and pitch like a rudderless shell in a crazy sea the two man flounder in its well like fish in a pail they fight by no rule with no science but bit and kick and gouge and wrench and strike as occasion offer and each to the best of he ability duchemin catch glimpse of a face like a chinese devil-mask hideously distort with work feature and disfigure with smear of soot through which insane eyeball roll and glare in the moonlight then a hand like a vice grip he windpipe he be on he back he head overhang the edge of the floor a thumb be feel for one of he eye yet it could not have be much later when he and he opponent be stand and sway as one lock in a embrace of wrestler still duchemin know as many trick of hand-to-hand fighting as the other perhaps a few more and then he be no doubt in far better condition at all event the fellow be presently at he mercy in a hold that give one the privilege of break he back at will a man of mistaken scruple duchemin fail to do so but hold the other helpless only long enough to find he hip-pocket and rip out the pistol -- a deadly luger then a thrust and a kick which he enjoy infinitely send the brute spin out to land on he head the fall should have break he neck at the worst it should have stunned he evidently it do not when duchemin have scramble up to the box capture the rein and bring the nag to a stop -- no great feat that they be quite sate with the voluptuousness of run away and well content to heed the hand and voice of authority -- and when finally he swing they round and drive back toward the cirque he see no sign of he apache by the roadside so he congratulate himself on the forethought which have possess he of the pistol otherwise the assassin since he have retain sufficient wit and strength to crawl into hiding could and assuredly would have potted monsieur duchemin with neither difficulty nor compunction not five figure but four only be wait beside the cirque when wheeling the barouche as near the group as the lay of the ground permit he climb down a man lay at length in the coarse grass he head pillow in the lap of one woman another woman stand aside tremble and wring aged hand the third knelt beside the supine man but rise quickly as duchemin draw near and come to meet he in this one he recognize she to whose salvation chance have first lead he and now find time to appreciate a face of pallid loveliness intelligent and compose while she address he quietly and directly to the point in a voice whose timbre be he fancy out of character with the excellent accent of its french a exquisite voice nevertheless english he guess or possibly american but much at home in france monsieur d'aubrac have be wound a knife thrust it will be necessary to get he to a surgeon as quickly as possible i fancy there will be none nearer than nant do you know the way one can doubtless find it say duchemin modestly but i myself be not without knowledge of wound perhaps if monsieur would be so good duchemin kneel beside the man who welcome he with open eye and a wry smile that be almost as faint as he voice it be nothing monsieur -- a clean cut in the arm with some loss of blood but let I see the young girl in whose lap rest the head of monsieur d'aubrac sit back and watch duchemin with curious grave eye in which trace of moisture glimmer have the animal at my mercy i think d'aubrac apologise when suddenly he draw that knife stick I and break away i understand duchemin reply but do not talk you 'll want all you strength my friend with he pocket-knife he lay open the sodden sleeve of coat and shirt expose a upper arm stain dark with blood that well in ugly jet from a cut both wide and deep artery sever he announce and straighten up and look about at a loss my pack -- one 's action in moment of excitement be apt to be largely direct by the subconscious he know still he find it hard to believe that he could unwittingly have unshipped and drop he rucksack while make ready to pursue the american uniform nevertheless it seem that be just what he have do the woman who have speak to he find and fetch it from no great distance and its contents enable duchemin to improvise a tourniquet and when the flow of blood be check a bandage during the operation d'aubrac unostentatiously faint the young girl catch she breath a flutter hiss do not be alarm mademoiselle duchemin soothe she he will come round presently he will do splendidly now till we get he to bed and then he convalescence will be merely the matter of a while of rest he slip he arm beneath the unconscious man gather he up bodily and bear he to the carriage -- and thanks to man 's amusing amour propre make far less of the effort than it cost he then with d'aubrac disposed as comfortably as might be on the back seat once again pillow in a fashion to make any man envious duchemin turn to find the other woman at he elbow to the eldest he offer a bow suit to she condition and a hand to help she into the barouche madame she agitation have measurably subside the gentle inclination of the aged head which acknowledge he courtesy be as eloquent of she quality as he find the name which she give he in quaver accent madame de sévénié monsieur with madame 's permission : i be andré duchemin monsieur duchemin have place we all deeply in he debt louise the girl in the carriage look up and bow murmur mademoiselle de montalais monsieur : my granddaughter and eve she turn to the third to she whose voice of delightful accent be not in duchemin 's notion wholly french : madame de montalais my daughter by adoption widow of my grandson who die gloriously for he country at la fère-champenoise iv eve when she have graciously permit duchemin to assist she to a place in the carriage madame sévénié turn immediately to comfort she granddaughter it be easy to divine a attachment there between d'aubrac and louise de montalais duchemin fancy -lrb- and as it turn out rightly -rrb- the two be betroth but madame de montalais be claim he attention monsieur think -- she enquire in a guard tone take advantage of the diversion provide by the elder lady to delay a little before enter the barouche monsieur d'aubrac be in no immediate danger still the service of a good surgeon as soon as may be will it be dangerous to wait till we get to nant how far be that madame twelve mile duchemin look aside at the decrepit conveyance with its unhappy horse and sum up a conclusion in a shrug millau be nearer be it not madame but nant be not far from the château de montalais and at la roque-sainte-marguerite we automobile be wait less than two mile below the chauffeur advise against bring over the road from la roque to montpellier it be too rough and very steep oh say duchemin as one who catch a glimmering of light pardon monsieur madame 's chauffeur be wait with the automobile no doubt but assuredly monsieur he recollect himself we shall see what we shall see then at la roque with a automobile at you disposal nant be little more distant than millau certainly nevertheless let we not delay monsieur be too good momentarily a hand slender and firm and cool rest in he own then its owner be set into place beside madame de sévénié and duchemin clamber up to he on the box the road prove quite as rough and declivitous as its reputation one surmise that the spring rain have find it in a bad way and do nothing to better its condition deep rut and a liberal sprinkling of small boulder collaborate to keep the horse stumble plunge and pitch as they strain back against the singletree duchemin be grateful for the moonlight which alone enable he to keep the road and avoid the worst of the go -- until he remember that without the moon there would have be no expedition that night to view the mock ruin of montpellier by its unearthly light and consequently no adventure to entangle he upon this reflection he swear softly but most fervently into he become beard he be well feed up with adventure thank you and could have do very well without this latest and especially at a time when he desire nothing so much as to be permit to remain the footloose wanderer in a strange land a bird of passage without tie or responsibility he think it devilish hard that one may never do a service to another without incur a burden of irksome obligation to the serve that bond of interest forge in moment of unpremeditated and generous impulse be never readily to be break now because chance have see fit to put he in the way of save a hapless party of sightseer from robbery or worse he find himself hopelessly commit to take a continue interest in they it appear that they home be a château somewhere in the vicinity of nant well after they shocking experience and with the wounded man on they hand -- and especially if la roque-sainte-marguerite tell the story one confidently expect -- duchemin could hardly avoid offer to see they safely as far as nant and once there he would be definitely in the toil he would have to stop in the town overnight and in the morning he would be able neither in common decency to slip away without call to enquire after the welfare of d'aubrac and the tranquillity of the lady nor in discretion to take himself out of the way of the civil investigation which would inevitably follow the report of what have happen in montpelier no : have despatch a bandit to a end well-earned it now devolve upon andré duchemin to satisfy society and the state that he have do so only with the most amiable motive on due provocation to save he own life and possibly the life of other he have premonition of endless delay while provincial authority wonder doubt criticise procrastinate investigate report and -- repeat and then there be every chance that the story thanks to the prominence of the person involve for one make no doubt that the name of sévénié and montalai and d'aubrac rank high in that part of the world -- the story would get into the newspaper of the larger town in the department and what then of the comfortable pseudonymity of andré duchemin pose in a inescapable glare of publicity how long might he hope to escape recognition by some acquaintance friend or enemy heaven know he have enough of both sort scatter widely over the face of europe it seem hard indeed but it be -- of course he assure himself grimly -- all a matter of fatality with he never for he the slippered ease of middle age the pursuit of bourgeois virtue of which he have so fondly dream in meyrueis adventure be he portion as surely as humdrum and eventless day be many another 's war might come and war might go : but he mere presence in its neighborhood would prove enough to turn the palace of peace itself into action front or so it seem to he in the bitterness of he spirit nor would he for a instant grant that he lot be not without its own peculiar compensation at la roque a tiny hamlet huddle in the shadow of montpellier and live almost exclusively upon the tourist that pass that way it be as duchemin have foresee remember the american uniform and the face smudge with soot -- that favorite device of the french criminal of the lower class fear recognition for there it appear that whereas the motor car be wait safe and sound enough its chauffeur have vanish into thin air not a soul could be find who recall see the man after the barouche tiad leave the village whereupon duchemin ask whether the chauffeur have be a stout man and be inform that it be so consider the case complete mesdame de sévénié et de montalais he suggest might as well then and there give up all hope of ever again see that particular chauffeur -- unless by some mischance entirely out of the reckoning of the latter the landlord of the auberge a surly sot who have supply the barouche with the man to act as driver and guide in one take with ill grace the charge that he employee have be in league with the bandit but this be true on the word of madame de montalais it be they guide she say whom duchemin have drive over the cliff and -lrb- as duchemin have anticipate -rrb- she name alone prove enough to silence the landlord 's virtuous protestation one could not always avoid be deceive he declare he know nothing of the dead man more than that he have come well recommend with which he say no more but lend a efficient if sullen hand to the task of transfer d'aubrac to the motor car d'aubrac come to while this be be accomplish beg feebly for water be give it with a little brandy to boot and comfortably settle in the rear seat between louise de montalais and she grandmother relapse once more into unconsciousness learning that madame de montalais would drive duchemin dissemble a sigh of relief and standing beside the car doff he cap to say good-bye he be only too happy to have be of such slight service as the circumstance have permit and if at any time he could do more a line address to he at nime poste restante but if monsieur duchemin would be good enough madame de sévénié interpose in a fretful quaver -- and if it would not be take he too far out of he way -- it be night anything may happen the car might break down and i be a old woman monsieur with sorely tried nerve -- look down at he from she place at the wheel madame de montalais add : it would be a act of charity i think monsieur if it do not inconvenience you too greatly on the contrary he fabricate without blush you will be oblige a weary man by put he several mile on he way he have no cause to regret he complaisance seat beside madame de montalais he watch she operate the car with skilful hand make the best of a highway none too good if a city boulevard in comparison with that which they have cover in the barouche follow the meandering dourbie it run snakily from patch of stare moonlight to patch of inky shadow now on narrow ledge high over the brawling stream now dip so low that the tyre be almost level with the plane of broken water the sweep of night air in he face be sweet and smooth not cold -- for a marvel in that altitude -- and stroke he eyelid with touch as bland as caress of a pretty woman 's finger he be sensible of drowsiness a surrender to fatigue to which the motion of the motor car swing seemingly on velvet spring and the shift blending chiaroscuro of the magic night be likewise conducive so that there come a lessen of the tension of resentment in he humor it be true that life would never let he rest in the quiet byway of he desire but after all unrest be life and it be good to be alive tonight alive and weary and not ill-content with self in a motor car swing swiftly and silently along a river road in the hill of southern france with a woman lovely soignée and mysterious at the wheel perhaps instinctively sensible of the regard that dwell warm with wonder on the fair curve of she cheek the perfect modelling of she nose and mouth she look swiftly askance after a time surprise he admiration and as if not displeased smile faintly as she return attention to the road duchemin be conscious of something like a shock of emotion a sudden surge of some hunger that have long lain dormant in he be unsuspected how long he could not surmise gain strength in latency wait to be awaken and set free by one careless sidelong look and smile of a strange woman eve he whisper unheard eve de montalai then of a sudden he catch himself up sharply it be natural enough that one should be susceptible to gentler impulse at such a time under circumstance so strange so unforeseen so romantic but he must not dare not would not yield that way danger lay not that he fear danger for like most of mankind he love it well but here the danger hold potentiality if not the certainty of pain -- pain it might be not for one alone besides it be too absurd v phinuit & co in the upshot however the necessity of he dismal foreboding have nothing to do with the length of time devote by monsieur duchemin to kick idle heel in the town of nant where the civil authority prove considerate in a degree that -- even make allowance for the local prestige of the house of montalai -- gratified and surprise the confirm parisian for that be just what the good man be at heart and would be till he die the form in which environment of younger year have mould he : less french than parisian share the almost insular ignorance of life in the province characteristic of the native boulevardier to whom the sun be truly nothing more or less than a spotlight focus exclusively on pari leave the rest of france in a sort of crepuscular gloom the world besides steep in eternal night the driver-guide of la roque turn out to have be a thorough-paced scamp well and ill-known to the gendarmerie the wound sustain by monsieur d'aubrac bear testimony to the gravity of the affair amply excuse duchemin 's interference and its fatal sequel while the statement of mesdame de sévénié et de montalais duly become public property bid fair to exalt the local reputation of andré duchemin to heroic stature and naturally he papers be unimpeachable so that he find himself before he acquaintance with nant be thirty-six hour of age free once more to humor the dictate of he own sweet will to go on to nime -lrb- he profess objective -rrb- or to the devil if he like a freedom which consistent with the native inconsistency of man he exercise by elect to stop over in nant for another day or two at least assure himself that he find the town altogether charming more so even than meyruei -- and sometimes believe this fiction for as much as twenty minute at a stretch besides the weather be unsettle the inn which go by the unpretending style of the grand hôtel de l'univer he find clean comfortable and as to its cuisine praiseworthy the window of the cubicle in which he have be lodge -- one of ten which suffice for the demand of the itinerant universe -- not only overlook the public square and its amusing life of a minor market town but command as well a splendid vista of the valley of the dourbie with its piquant contrast of luxuriant alluvial verdure and grim scarp of rock that run up on either side the wanton glimmering river into two oppose and overshadow pinnacle of crag the roc nantai and the roc de saint alban -- peak each a rendezvous just then for host of cloud that scowl forbiddingly down upon the peaceful sun-drenched valley moreover even from the terrasse of the café below one need only to lift one 's eye to see afar perch high upon a smile slope of green with the highway to millau at its foot and a beetle cliff behind the château de montalais seat on that terrasse late in the afternoon of he second day in nant discuss a picon and a villainous caporal cigarette of the régie -lrb- to whose product a rugged constitution be grow slowly reconcile anew -rrb- duchemin let he vision dwell upon the distant château almost as constantly as he thought he be to dine there that very evening even take into account the signal service duchemin have render this be not easy to believe when one remember the tradition of social conservatism among french gentlefolk still it be true : duchemin of the open road be bid to dine en famille at the château de montalais in he pocket lay the invitation pen in the crabbed antique hand of madame de sévénié and fetch to the hotel by a servitor quite as crabbed and antique : monsieur duchemin would confer a true pleasure by enable the lady of the château to testify even so inadequately to they sense of obligation etc with a postscript to say that monsieur d'aubrac be rest easily he wound mend as rapidly as heart could wish of course duchemin be go have in fact already despatch he acceptance by the hand of the same messenger equally of course he know that he ought not to go for a man of he year he be as a matter of training and habit amazingly honest with himself he know quite well what bent he inclination toward visit the château de montalais just once before effect what he be resolve upon a complete evanishment from the ken of its people he have yet to hold one minute of private conversation with eve de montalais he have of she no sign to warrant he think she anything but utterly indifferent to he and yet no he be not ass enough to dream that he be in love with the woman to the contrary he be wise enough know himself well enough to know that he could be easily and would be give half a chance to lose he head he warning have be clear beyond mistake in that hour in the motor car on the road from la roque to nant when nature as she sometimes will incautiously have show she hand to one whom she herself have school to read shrewdly let he discern what be she will with he the snare that be lay for he foot and in which he must soon find himself trap beyond extrication always provide he lack the wit and resolution to fly he peril who know through bitterest of learn that love be never for he now he have see madame de montalais another time and have find that she fit to the sweetest detail of perfection he ideal of woman on the previous afternoon meet the lady of the château by arrangement in the bureau of the maire duchemin have sit opposite and watched and listen to eve de montalai for upward of two hour -- as completely devote to covert study of she as if she have be the one woman in the room as if the girl louise madame de sévénié and the official and functionary of nant have not exist in the same world with she and in that tedious and constrain time of formality he have learn much about she but first of all thanks to the uncompromising light of day that fill the cheerless room that moonlight have not enhance but rather temper the charm of person which have the night before so stir he pulse pose with consummate grace in a comfortless chair a figure of slender elegance in she half-mourning she have narrate quietly she version of last night 's misadventure a occasional tremor of humor lighten the move modulation of she voice a deep and vibrant voice contralto in quality hint at hidden treasure of strength in the woman whose superficial mind it express a fair woman slim but round with brown eye level and calm a translucent skin of matchless texture hair the hue of bronze lace with intimation of gold she story tell and take down in longhand by a withered clerk she supply without reluctance or trace of embarrassment such intimate personal information as be necessary in order that she signature to the document might be acceptable to the state she age she say be twenty-nine she birthplace the city of new york she parent edmund anstruther once of bath england but at the time of she birth a naturalised citizen of the united state and eve marie anstruther née legendre of paris both be dead in June 1914 she have marry in pari victor maurice de montalais who have be kill in action at la fère-champenoise on the ninth of September follow she home the château de montalais on the hand she strip in order to sign she deposition duchemin see a blue diamond of such superb water that this amateur of precious stone catch he breath for sheer wonder at its beauty and excellence and worth such jewel he know be few and far to seek outside the collection of prince out of these simple element imagination reconstruct a tragedy a tragedy of life singularly close to the truth as he later come to learn it a story not at all calculate to lessen he interest in the woman such woman he know be the product of a cultivation seldom to be achieve by poverty this one have be make before and not by she marriage she father then have command riches and when one know as duchemin know what delight new york have for young woman of wealth and fashion one perceive a radiant and many-coloured background for this drab life of a recluse expatriate from the high world of she inheritance which eve de montalai must lead and for the six year of she premature widowhood must have lead in that lonely château bury deep in the loneliest hill of all france the sole companion and comfort of she husband 's bereaved sister and grandmother chained by sorrow to they sorrow by a inexorable reluctance to give they pain by seem to slight the memory of the husband brother and grandson through turn she face toward the world of life and light and gaiety of which she be so essentially a part isolate from which she be so inevitably a thing exist without purpose or effect how often duchemin wonder have she in hour of solitude and restlessness feel she spirit yearning toward paris the nearest gateway to she world and have cry out : how long o lord how long the mellow resonance of a two-toned automobile horn disturb the early evening hush and at the same time duchemin 's meditation recall he to nant in time to see a touring car of majestic proportion and mien which come from the south from the direction of the railroad and nime be sweep a fine curve round two side of the public square arrive in front of the hôtel de l'univer it execute a full stop and stand curb yet palpitant purr heavily : a impressive brute of a car all shine silver plate and lustrous green paint and gold the newest model of the costliest and best automobile manufacture in france instantly as the wheel cease to turn a young man in the smartest livery imaginable green garnish with gold leap smartly from the driver 's seat with military precision open the door of the tonneau and hold it immobilise himself into the semblance of a waxwork image with the dispassionate eye the firm mouth and the closely razored square jowl of the model chauffeur rustic and townsfolk be already gather a gaping audience when from the tonneau descend first a long and painfully emaciated gentleman whose face be a cadaverous mask of settle melancholy and he choose toilette for motoring -lrb- as might be see through the open and flap front of he ulster -rrb- a tightly tailor light gray cutaway coat and trousers with a double-breasted white waistcoat a black satin ascot scarf transfix by a single splendid pearl and spotless white spat he hand as gaunt as a skeleton 's assist to alight a young woman whose brilliant blonde beauty view for the first time in evening shadow be like a shaft of sunlight in a darkened room a well-made creature becomingly and modishly gown for motor spirited yet dignified in carriage she be like a vision of as she be palpably a visitation from the rue de la paix follow she a third passenger present the well-nourished indeed rotund person of a frenchman of thirty devoted to le sport as witness he aggressively english tweeds and the single glass screw into he right eye-socket he face be chubby pink and white he look be merry he be magnificently self-conscious and débonnaire like shape from some superbly costumed pageant of high life in the twentieth century this trio drift rather than merely walk like mortal across the terrasse and into the café de l'univer -lrb- which seem suddenly to shrink in proportion as if remind of its comparative insignificance in the scheme of thing -rrb- where a awed staff of waiter lead by the overpower propriétaires monsieur et madame themselves welcome these apparition from another and a better world with bowing and scrapings and a vast bustle and movement of chair and table while all nant all of it that be that be accustom to foregather in the café at this the hour of the aperitif look on with awed and envious eye it be all very theatrical and inspiring -- to monsieur duchemin too who lose in the shuffle of nant and content to be so murmured to himself that serviceable and comforting word of the time profiteer and contemplate with some satisfaction he personal superiority to such as these but there be more and better to come there remain in the car a mere average man undistinguished but by a lack of especial distinction sober of habit economical of gesture dress in a simple lounge suit such as anybody might wear beneath a rough and ready-made motorcoat when the car stop he have stand up in he place beside the chauffeur as if mean to get out but rather remain motionless rest a hand on the windshield and thoughtfully gaze northwards along the road that skirt the grounds of the château de montalais disappear from view round the sleek shoulder of a hill now as the pattern chauffeur shut the door to the tonneau with the properly arrogant slam the man who linger in the car nod gravely to some private thought unlatch the door get down and turn toward the café but before follow he companion of more brilliant plumage pause for a quiet word with the chauffeur we dine here jules he announce in english settle into place behind the wheel jule salute with fine finish and deference very good mr phinuit sir he say meekly in the same tongue to this he add coolly without the least flicker of a glance aside without move one muscle other than those involve by the act of speech and in precisely the tone of respect that become he livery : what be the awful idea you big stiff mr phinuit betray not the slightest sense of anything untoward in this mode of address but look round to the chauffeur with a slow not unfriendly smile why he say pleasantly -- you misbegotten garage hound -- why do you ask in the same manner jule reply : can not you see it be go to rain mr phinuit cock a calm observant eye heavenwards involuntarily but unobtrusively under cover of the little tubbed tree that hedge the terrasse apart from the square duchemin do likewise and so discover or for the first time appreciate the cause of the uncommonly early dusk that lour over nant between the sentinel peak that tower above the valley black battalion of storm cloud be fraternise join force coalesce into a vast and formidable army of ominous aspect so it be mr phinuit comment amiably indeed not without a certain hint of satisfaction bless if you do not see everything well then : what about it why _ i _ should say you would better find a place to put the car under cover in case it come on to storm before we be finish -- and put up the top you do not mean to go on in the rain jule protest -- yet studiously in no tone of protest but naturally how do you get that way do you want we all to get soak to we skin my dear jule mr phinuit return with a win smile -- i do not give a tupenny damn if we do with that he go to join he company while jule once the other 's back be turn permit himself for the sake of he own respect and the effect upon the assemble audience the luxury of a shrug that outrivalled word in expression of he personal opinion of the madness that contemplate further travel on such a night as this promise to be then like the well-trained servant that he be not he mesh gear silently and swing the car away to seek shelter take with he the sympathy as well as the wonder of the one witness of this bit of by-play who have be able to understand the tongue in which it be couch and who know too well what rain in those hill could mean be begin to regret that he invitation to the château have not be for another night as for the somewhat unusual tone of the passage to which he have just listen he nimble wit could invent half a dozen plausible explanation it be quite possible indeed when one judge mr phinuit by he sobriety in contrast with the gaiety of the other it seem quite plausible that he be equally with jule a pay employee of those ostensible nouveaux riches : and that the two the chauffeur and the courier -lrb- or whatever mr phinuit be in he subordinate social rating -rrb- be accustom to amuse themselves by indulge in reciprocal abuse but what duchemin could by no means fathom be the reason why phinuit should choose and how he should rule the choice of he party in the face of such threatening weather to stop in nant for a early dinner -- with millau only a hour away and the chance fair that before the storm break the automobile would reach the latter city with its superior hotel and restaurant accommodation but it be after all none of the business of andré duchemin he light another cigarette observe the group of stranger in nant with a open inquisitiveness wholly gallic therefore inconspicuous the entire clientèle of the café de l'univer be do the same mr phinuit 's party be the focal point of between twenty and thirty pair of stare eye and be endure this with much equanimity mr phinuit be confer earnestly over the menu with madame la propriétaire the other be order aperitif of a waiter through the clatter of tongue that fill the café one catch the phrase veeskysoda utter by the monsieur in tweeds then the tall man consult the beautiful lady as to she preference and duchemin catch the word madame la comtesse speak in the rasp nasal drawl of a american evidently a person of rich humor the speaker : madame la comtesse be abruptly convulse with laughter the chubby gentleman roar mr phinuit look up from the carte with a enquire receptive smile the waiter grin broadly but the cause of all this merriment wear only a expression of slightly pained bewilderment on he death-mask of a face at that moment arrive the calèche which duchemin have command to drive he to the château and with a ride of two mile before he and rain imminent he have no more time to waste vi visitation dinner be serve in a vast and sombre hall whose darkly panelled wall and high-beamed ceiling breed a multitude of shadow that dance about the table a weird spasmodic saraband without mean or end restlessly advance and retreat as the candle flicker fail and flare in the gusty draught there be -lrb- duchemin learn -rrb- no other means of illumination but by candle-light in the entire château the time-old structure have be thoroughly renovate and modernize in most respects it be furnish with taste and reverence -lrb- one could guess whose the taste and purse -rrb- but madame de sévénié remain its undisputed chatelaine a belated spirit of the ancien régime stubbornly set against the convenience of this degenerate age electric lighting she would never countenance the telephone she esteem a convenience for tradespeople and vulgarian in general beneath the dignity of leisured quality the motor car she disapprove yet tolerate because for all she year she be of a brisk and active turn and like to get about whereas since the war good horseflesh be difficult to find in france and man to care for it more scarce still so much and more besides she communicate to duchemin at interval during the meal comport herself toward he with graciousness not altogether innocent of a certain fade coquetry have speak of herself as one bear too late for she time she pause and eye he keenly a gleam of light malice in she bright old eye and you too monsieur she add suddenly but you i think belong to a even earlier day i madame and why do you say that i should have be guillotine under the terror but you monsieur you should have be hang long before that -- hang for a buccaneer on the spanish main madame may be right say duchemin amuse and quite possibly i be you know then he wonder a little and begin to cultivate some respect for the shrewdness of she intuition he sit on she leave the place of honor go by custom immemorial to monsieur le curé of nant for all that duchemin decline to feel slight be he not on the right of eve de montalais the girl louise be place between the curé and she sister-in-law duchemia could not have be guilty of the offence of ignore she but the truth be that save when courtesy demand that he pay she some attention he hardly see she she be pretty enough but very quiet and self-absorbed a slender nervous creature with that pathetically eager look peculiar to she age and caste in france starve for the life she might not live till marriage should set she free a pale and ineffective wraith beside eve whose beauty relieve in candleglow against the background of melting darkness burn like some rare exotic flower set before a screen of lustreless black velvet and like a flower to the sun she respond to the homage of he admiration -- which he be none the less studious to preserve from the sin of obviousness for he be well aware that she response be impersonal it be not he but any admiration that she crave as a parched land want rain less than three month a wife more than five year a widow still young and ardent near the noontide of she womanhood and immolate in this house of perennial mourning make vain oblation of she youth she beauty the rich wine of life that course so lustily through she be upon the altar of a memory whose high priestess be only a old old woman he perceive that it would be quite possible for he do he yield to the bent of he sympathy to dislike madame de sévénié most intensely not that he be apt to have much opportunity to encourage such a gratuitous aversion : to-morrow would see he on the road again he back forever turn to the château de montalais or if not to-morrow then as soon as the storm abate it be rage now as if it would never weaken and have the will to raze the château though it be the task of a thousand year from time to time the shock of some great blast of air would seem to rock upon its foundation even that ancient pile those heavy wall of hew stone build in time of honest workmanship by forget sieurs de montalais who have mean they home to outlast the age rain in sheet sluice the window without rest round turret and gable the wind rave and moan like a famished wild thing deny its kill occasionally a venturesome gust with the spirit of a minor demon would find its way down the chimney to the drawing-room fire and send spark in volley against the screen with thin puff of wood smoke that linger in the air like acrid ghost at such time the curé sit at piquet with madame de sévénié after dinner would cough distressingly and remind that he have a bed to reach somehow through all this welter anathematise the element help himself to a pinch of snuff and proceed with he play duchemin sit at a little distance talk with madame de montalais over they cigarette to smoking curiously enough madame de sévénié offer no objection woman have not smoke in she day and she for she part would never but eve might : it be do even in those circle of hidebound conservatism the society of the faubourg st germain lady of this day smoke unrebuked louise have excuse herself -- to sit duchemin have no doubt by the bedside of d'aubrac under the duenna-like eye of a old nurse of the family be duly encouraged duchemin talk about himself of he wanderings and adventure all with discretion with the neatest expurgation and with a object lead cunningly round to the subject of new york at mention of it he see a new light kindle in eve 's eye she breath come more quickly gentle emotion agitate she bosom monsieur know new york but well : he have be there as a boy again as a young man and then later in the year when america enter the great war not since it be my home say eve de montalais softly look away -lrb- one note that she say be -- not be -rrb- so duchemin have understand madame have not visit she home recently not in many year not in fact since nineteen-thirteen she assume the city must have change greatly duchemin think it be never the same but forever change itself overnight so to speak and yet always itself always like no other city in the world fascinating fascinating but irresistible how i long for it she be distrait for a instant my new york monsieur -- would you believe -- i dream of it he have find a key to one chamber in the mansion of she confidence as much to herself as to he unconsciously drop into english she begin to talk of she life at home she father have be a partner in a great jewellery house cottier 's of pari london and new york -lrb- so that explain it she be wear the blue diamond again tonight with other jewel worth in the judgment of a keen connoisseur a king 's ransom -rrb- school at a exclusive establishment for the daughter of people of fashion eve at a early age have make she début but within the year she father die and she mother whose heart have always be in the city of she nativity close the house on east fifty-seventh street and remove with she daughter to pari there eve have meet she future husband shortly after she mother die eve return to new york to attend to some business in connection with she estate remain only a few week leave almost reluctantly but the new love be very sweet she have look forward joyfully to the final transplant of she affection and then the war the short month of long long day in the apartment on the avenue des champs-elysées wait wait while the earth tremble to the tramp of armed man and the tireless rumble of caisson and camion and the air be vibrant with the savage dialogue of cannon ever louder daily more near she fall silent sit with bow head and gaze remote from the splendid jewel that adorn the finger twist together in she lap the firelight strike coruscant gleam now i hate pari i wish never to see it again duchemin utter a sympathetic murmur but new york -- ah but sometimes i think i would give anything to be there once more the animation with which this confession be deliver proved transient then i remind myself i have no one there -- a few friend yes acquaintance but no family tie no one dear to I but -- pardon -- you stay here it be beautiful here monsieur but such solitude such isolation -- for you madame i know still i be fond of the life here it be here i find myself again after my grief and i be fond of my adopt mother and louise too and they of I indeed i be all they have leave louise of course will marry before long george -- she use d'aubrac 's give name -- will take she away then madame de sévénié will have nobody but I and at she age it would be too sad across the drawing-room that lady look up from she card and sharply interrogate a manservant who have silently present himself to she attention what be it you want jean the servant mumble he justification : a automobile have break down on the highroad near the château the chauffeur be unable to move the car or make any repair in the storm a gentleman have come to the door to ask he move aside indicate the doorway to the entrance hall beyond which mr phinuit be to be see stand with cap in hand tiny rivulet run from the fold of he motor-coat and form pool on the polished flooring as in concerted movement madame de sévénié eve de montalais the curé and duchemin approach he cool intelligent good-humoured glance survey they swiftly each in turn and with unerring instinct settle on the first as the one to whom he must address himself but the bow with which he also acknowledge the presence of eve be hardly less profound duchemin himself at he best could hardly have better it he manner in fact leave nothing to be desire and the french in which immediately he beg a thousand pardon for the intrusion be so admirable that it seem hard to believe he be the same man who have only a few hour earlier composedly trade the slang of the state with a chauffeur in front of the café de l'univer mr phinuit be desolate to think he might be impose on madame 's good nature but the accident be positive the night truly inclement madame la comtesse be already suffer from the cold and if one might beg shelter for she and the gentleman of the party while one telephone or send to nant for another automobile but monsieur might feel very sure madame de sévénié would never forgive herself if the hospitality of the château de montalais fail at such a time she would send servant to the car at once with light wrap umbrella there be no necessity for that the remainder of the party have it seem presume upon she courtesy in anticipation and be not far from the heel of its ambassador even while madame be speak jean be open the great front door to those who prove -- formal introduction be duly effect by mr phinuit -- to be madame la comtesse de lorgnes monsieur le comte she husband -lrb- this be the well-fed body in tweeds -rrb- and mr whitaker monk of new york these personage be really not at all in a bad way they wrap be well peppered with rain they be chilly the footgear of madame la comtesse be wet and need change but that be the worst of they plight and when mr phinuit learn that there be no telephone have accept a offer of the montalai motor car to tow the other under cover and so enable jule to make repair and eve de montalai have carry madame la comtesse off to she own apartment to change she shoe and stocking the gentleman troop to the drawing-room fire at the instance of madame de sévénié and grow quite cheerful under the combined influence of warmth and wine and biscuit duchemin standing by with a half-rejected doubt to preoccupy he vaguely disturb by the oddness of this rencontre consider in relation to that injudicious stop for dinner at nant in the face of the impending storm and with mr phinuit 's declaration that he do not give a tupenny damn if they do all get soak to they skin it seem far-fetched and ridiculous to imagine that people of they intelligence -- and they be most of they unusually intelligent and alert if demeanor and utterance might be take as criterion -- should adopt any such elaborate machinery of mystification and duplicity in order to gain a introduction to the château de montalais with what possible motive but there be the devil of have a mind like duchemin 's : once it conceive a notion like that it be all but impossible for he to dislodge it unless or until something happen to persuade he of he stupidity now to make he suspicion seem at all reasonable a motive be lack and that worry the man hugely he desire most earnestly to justify he captiousness and to this end exercise a power of conscientious observation on he new acquaintance monsieur le comte de lorgnes he be dispose to pass at face value as a innocuous be good natured enough but none too brilliant with much of the disposition of a overgrown boy and a rather boyish tendency to admire and imitate in other quality which he do not himself possess mr phinuit have not return so there be no present opportunity to take further note of he though duchemin first infer from mr monk 's manner and later learn through a chance remark of he that phinuit be he secretary upon this mr monk duchemin concentrate close attention satisfy that he have here to do with a extraordinary personality if not one unique mr whitaker monk might have be any age between thirty-five and fifty-five so non-committal be that lantern-jawed countenance of a droll with its heavy black eloquent eyebrow its high and narrow forehead merge into a extensive bald spot fringe with greyish hair its rather small blue illegible eye its high-bridged nose and prominent nostril its wide and thin-lipped mouth its rather startling pallor taller by a head than anybody in the room except duchemin he figure be remarkably thin yet not ill-proportioned neither be mr monk ill at ease or ungraceful in he action clothe in that extravagantly correct costume -- correct at least for a drawing-room if never for motoring -- he have all the appearance of a comedian fresh from the hand of he dresser one naturally expect of he mere grotesquery -- and find simply the courteous demeanor of a gentleman of the world so much for externals but what more nature herself have cast mr monk in the very mould of a masquerader what manner of man be hide behind the mask he word and deed alone would tell duchemin could only weigh the one and await the other in the meantime mr monk be sketch rapidly for the benefit of madame de sévénié the excuse for he present plight a chance meeting at monte carlo he say with he old friend the comte et comtesse de lorgne have result in they yield to he insistence that they tour with he back to pari by this roundabout way a whim of my age madame somehow the nasal intonation of the american suit singularly well he fluent french he seem to have less trouble with he r 's than most anglo-saxon as a young man -- a younger man -- ah well in ninety-four then -- i explore this country on a walk tour inspire by stevenson you know perhaps he divert travels with a donkey but i daresay its spirit would hardly have survive translation at all event i have the whim to revisit some of those well-remembered scene i say some for naturally it would be impossible even with the vastly improve road of to-day for my automobile to penetrate everywhere i wander afoot nor would i wish it to a few disappointment a few failure to recapture something of that first fine careless rapture would instill a lyric melancholy but too many would make one morbid well then : at nant in those old day i once have a famous dinner and naturally return i must try to duplicate it even though it mean go on to millau in the rain but alas the café de l'univer be no more what it be -- or i be grow over critical what now of duchemin 's doubt to tell the sad truth they be just as strong as ever the man be somehow prejudice : he find monk 's story entirely too glib and know a mean sense of gratification when the curé interpose a gentle correction but in ninety-four monsieur there be no café de l'univer in nant astonished eyebrow climb the forehead of mr monk no monsieur le curé truly not then it must have be another how one 's memory will play one false how strange then be coincidence madame de sévénié suggest you who make a walk tour of this country so long ago monsieur regard there that good monsieur duchemin himself engage upon just such a undertaking duchemin acknowledge with a humorous little nod mr monk 's look of moderate amazement at this so strange coincidence a whim of my age monsieur he say -- a project i have entertain since youth but always till of late lack leisure to put into execution but be there anything more wonderful than the workings of the good god madame pursued observe that if monsieur duchemin have be suffer to indulge he inclination in youth we should all i my daughter my grand-daughter even poor george d'aubrac would quite probably be lie dead at the bottom of a cirque at montpellier-le-vieux naturally the stranger require to know about that and madame de sévénié would talk in fact dote on tell the tale of that great adventure duchemin make a face of resignation and hear himself extol as a paladin for strength address and valor the truth be that he be not at all resign and would infinitely liefer have be leave out of the limelight the more he be represent as a person of consequence the less fair he chance to study these other at he leisure in the comfortable obscurity of they indifference now the enigmatic eye of monk be bore into he seek to search he soul with a question in they stare which he could not read and quite likely would have decline to answer if he could also the eye of monsieur le comte de lorgne be very round and constant to he and before madame de sévénié be finish phinuit stroll in and hear enough to make he subject duchemin to a not unfriendly steady and open inspection and when the trumpet have be flourish finally for duchemin and he have dutifully assure madame that she be too generous and have acknowledge congratulation on he exploit phinuit stroll over and offer a hand good work he say in english see you before have not i somewhere mr duchemin under other circumstance duchemin not at all hoodwink by this too obvious stratagem would have take mean pleasure in look blank and beg monsieur to interpret himself in french but with or without cunning phinuit 's question be well-timed : eve de montalai be at that moment enter the drawing-room with madame la comtesse de lorgne and she know very well that duchemin 's english be quite as good as he french at the café de l'univer this afternoon he reply frankly i remember you drive away just before the storm break in a ramshackle rig that must have come out of the ark to come here mr phinuit funny say phinuit with hesitation you be there and then we turn up here duchemin thought he know what be on the other 's mind i be immensely entertain -- do you mind my say so -- to hear the way you chauffeur talk to you monsieur tell I : be it the custom in you country -- oh jule say phinuit and laugh jule be my younger brother when he be demobilise he job be go back home and i wish he on mr monk as a chauffeur we be always kid each other like that now what could be more reasonable duchemin wonder and conclude that if anything it would be the truth but he do not pretend to himself that he be not quite illogically and with no provocation whatsoever most vilely prejudice against the lot of they but you must know america to speak the language as well as you do duchemin nod : but very slightly monsieur i be wonder somehow i can not get it out of my head i have see you somewhere before to-day it be quite possible : when one move about the world one be visible -- n'est - ce pa monsieur but my home duchemin add be paris i guess say phinuit in a tone of singular disappointment it must have be there i see you duchemin 's bow signify that he be content to let it go at that moreover monk be signalling to phinuit with he expressive eyebrow what about the car phin examine he wrist watch phinuit draw near he employer jule should not need more than half a hour now monsieur be there in this employment of french to respond to a question couch in english the suggestion of a subtle correction from employé to employer if not why must duchemin have think so if so why do monk without betray a sign of feel the reproof continue in french do jule say half a hour yes monsieur my god monk address the company : if i be press for time i would rather have one of jule ' half-hour than anybody else 's hour and a half let we hope however the comtesse de lorgnes interpose sweetly by that time this so dreadful tempest will have moderate one have that hope she husband utter in a sepulchral voice but if the storm continue madame de sévénié say you must not think of travel farther -- on such a night the château be large there be ample accommodation for all there be a negligible pause during which duchemin see the long lash of the comtesse de lorgnes curtain momentarily she disastrous violet eye : it be a sign of assent immediately it be follow by the least of negative movement of she head she be look directly at phinuit who so far as duchemin could see make no sign of any sort who neither speak nor act on the signal which indubitably he have receive on the other hand it be monk who acknowledge the proffer courtesy madame de sévénié be too good but we could not dream of impose no but truly madame i be oblige to ask my guest to proceed with I to millau to-night regardless of the weather important despatch concern my business await I there i must consider they and reply by cable to-night without fail it be really of the most pressing necessity otherwise we should be honor madame de sévénié incline she head it must be as monsieur think best but monsieur monk madame la comtesse exclaim with vivacity : do you know what i have just discover you and madame de montalais be compatriot she be of you new york you must know each other i have be wonder monk admit bow to eve if it be possible i could be mislead by a strong resemblance eve turn to he with a look of surprise yes monsieur it be many year ago you be a young girl then if it be truly you madame but i have a keen eye for beauty i do not soon forget it i be in the private office of my friend edmund anstruther of cottier 's one afternoon select a trinket with he advice and -- that be my father monsieur then it be you madame i feel sure of it you come in unannounced to see you father he make I know to you as a friend of he and request you to wait in a adjoining office but that be not necessary i have already make up my mind i leave almost immediately do you by any chance remember the effort of the memory knit eve 's brow but in the end she shake she head i be sorry monsieur -- but why should you be why should you have remember I you be a young girl then as i say and i already a man of middle age you see I once for perhaps two minute it would have be a miracle have i remain in you memory for as long as a single day nevertheless _ i _ remember i be so glad to meet a friend of my father 's monsieur and i to recall myself to he daughter i have often wonder would you mind tell I something madame de montalais if i can you father and i entertain one passion in common one which he be better able than i to gratify for good diamond and emerald i have often wonder what become of he collection he have some superb stone i inherit they monsieur they do not find they way into cottier 's stock then the comtesse de lorgnes give a gesture of excitement but what a fortunate woman you truly have those magnificent emerald those almost matchless diamond of which one have hear -- the anstruther collection i have they madame la comtesse say eve with a smile nod -- yes but one presume in paris in some impregnable strong-box no madame here but not here madame de montalais to this eve give another nod and smile but be you not afraid -- of what madame that they will be steal no they have be in my possession for year -- indeed i should be unhappy otherwise for i have inherit my father 's fondness for they -- and nobody have ever even attempt to steal they but what of the affair at montpellier the other night enquire the comte de lorgne -- that terrible attack upon you of which madame de sévénié have just tell we surely you would call that a attempt to steal simple highway robbery if you like monsieur le comte but even have it prove successful i have very few jewel with I all that matter all that i would have mind lose be here in a safe place nevertheless say monk -- if you will permit I to offer a word of advice -- i think you be very unwise it may be monsieur nonsense madame de sévénié declare who would dare attempt to burglarise the château de montalais such a thing be never hear of there be always the first time for everything madame monk suggest gently i fancy it be you first experience of the sort at montpellier a rascally chauffeur from paris a few low character of the department since the war thing be not as they be that be the very reason why i suggest madame -- but monsieur i assure you all my life i have live at montalai monsieur le curé will tell you i know every face hereabouts and i know that these poor country-folk these good-natured dolt of peasant have not the imagination much less the courage -- but what of criminal from outside from the great city from london and pari and berlin they have the imagination the courage the skill and if they ever get wind of the fortune madame de montalais keep lock up here what of the lone wolf the comtesse de lorgnes add i have hear that one be once more in france duchemin blink incredulously at the speaker but when do you hear that madame la comtesse quite recently monsieur i have understand that the monsieur in question have long since retire only for the duration of the war monsieur i be afraid it be true accord to all report the comte de lorgne say : monsieur lanyard -- that be the name be it not if memory serve monsieur le comte duchemin agree yes the count screw he chubby feature into a laughable mask of gravity now one remember quite well he pass as a collector of objet d'art especially of fine painting in pari for year before the war -- this monsieur michael lanyard then he disappear it be rumor that he be of good service to the ally as a spy act independently and after the armistice i have hear he do well for england in the matter of a bolshevist conspiracy over there but not long ago accord to my information monsieur the lone wolf resign from the british secret service and return to france -- doubtless to resume he old practice perhaps not duchemin suggest possibly he reformation be genuine and last the comtesse de lorgnes laugh that laugh of light derision which be almost exclusively the laugh of the parisienne of a certain class remark this duchemin eye she mildly madame la comtesse do not believe that well -- who know -- perhaps she be right possibly she know more of the nature and habit of the criminal class than we share as she do no doubt the apparently accurate and precise source of information of monsieur le comte at all event phinuit put in promptly i know what i would do if i possess a little fortune in jewel and learn that a thief of the ability of this lone wolf be at large in france : i would charter a armored train to convey the loot to the strongest safe deposit vault in pari thereby advertise to the lone wolf the exact location of the jewel monsieur so that he might at he leisure make he plan perfect to burglarise the vault be that likely phinuit jeer duchemin give a slight shrug one have hear that the fellow have real ability he say the servant jean come in catch the eye of madame de sévénié and announce : the chauffeur of monsieur monk wish I to say he have complete repair on the automobile and the rain have cease vii turn about duchemin take back with he to nant that night not only monsieur le curé in the hire calèche but food in plenty for think together with a nebulous notion which by the time he wake up next morning have take shape as a fix conviction that he have better resign himself to stop on indefinitely at the grand hôtel de l'univer and see what he should see that fatality on which he have so bitterly reflect when act as emergency coachman en route from montpellier-le-vieux to la roque-sainte-marguerite have he now fairly by the heel as it be he very shadow something as tenacious as inescapable or he have be give every excuse for believe that such be the case impossible -- and the more so the longer he ponder it -- to credit to mere coincidence the innuendo utter at the château by mr monk and he party no : there have be malice in that duchemin be satisfy if not some darker purpose which perplex the most patient scrutiny now malice without incentive be unthinkable but duchemin search he memory in vain for anything he could have say or do to make anybody desire to discredit he in the sight of the lady of the château de montalais still the attempt so to do have be unmistakable : the lone wolf have be lug into the conversation literally by he legendary ear surely one would think that nocturnal prowler of pre-war pari have be so long dead and bury even the most ghoulish gossip should respect he poor remains and not disinter they merely to demonstrate that the past can never wholly die have he then some enemy of old hide under one of those sleek surface a excellent visual memory review successively the physical characteristic of messieurs monk phinuit and de lorgne and they chauffeur jule with the upshot that duchemin could have swear that he have never before know any of these and madame la comtesse in respect of that one memory again draw a blank but remain unsatisfied when one thought of she some remote faint chord of reminiscence thrill and hum but never recognisably not that there be anything remarkable in this : if one care to look for they the world be throng with woman such as she handsome spirited well-groomed animal endue with some little distinction of manner native or acquire with every appeal to the sens and more or less generally spurious to the intelligence they make the theater possible in france leaven the social life of the half-world flutter conspicuously and often disastrously through circle of more sedate society have they portrait in every salon they photograph in every issue of the fashionable journal some make history other fiction : either would be insufferably dull lack they influence but they be as much alike as so many pea out of they several shell and the man who see one inevitably remember all set aside then the theory of positive personal animus what other reason could there be for the effort to fasten upon duchemin suspicion of identity with the late lone wolf a sinister consideration if any and one duchemin suspect not unconnected with the much-talked-about jewel of madame de montalais but it be absurd to believe that person foster a design of such nature would so deliberately and obviously advertise they purpose cheerfully admit that he be a imbecile to think of such a thing duchemin set he mental alarm for six the follow morning rise at that hour and by eight have tramp the five mile between nant and the nearest railway station combe-redonde where he despatch a code telegram to london request any information it might have or be able to obtain concern mr whitaker monk of new york and the several member of he party the say information to be forward in code to await the arrival of andre duchemin at the hôtel du commerce millau and then partly to kill time partly to get himself in trim for to-morrow 's trip which he mean to make strictly in character as the pedestrian tourist he walk round three side of a square in return to nant -- by way that be of sauclières and the upper valley of the dourbie in the rich sunshine that fall from a cloudless sky -- even the twin peak that stand sentinel over nant have shamelessly put off they yashmak for the day -- the rain-fresh world be sweet to see and duchemin find himself consuming league with heel strangely light or he think they lightness strange until he discover the buoyance of he heart which be not strange at all he know too well the cause of that and have give over fret about the inevitable the sum of he philosophy be now : _ what must be must _ it would have be difficult to be unhappy in the knowledge that one retain still the capacity to love generously honourably expect nothing exacting nothing regret nothing not even in anticipation of the ultimate inevitable heartache toward mid-afternoon a solitary mischance throw a pass shadow upon he content as he trudge along the river road on the last lap of he journey -- nant almost in sight -- he hear a curious intermittent rumble on a steep hillside whose foot be skirt by the road and seek its cause barely in time to leap for life out of the path of a great boulder that dislodge from its bed possibly by last night 's deluge be hurtle downhill with such momentum that it must have crush duchemin to a pulp have he be less alert strike the road with a impact that leave a deep saucer-shaped dent with one final bind the huge stone amid vast splashing find its last rest place in the river duchemin move out of the way of the miniature avalanche that follow and for some minute stand review with a truculent eye the face of the hillside but nothing move thereon it be quite bare of good cover little more than a slant of naked earth and shale dot manywhere with boulder cousin to that which seek he life -- none however so large if human agency have move it the stone have come from the high skyline of the hill and by the time one could climb to this last duchemin be sure there would be nobody there to find the remainder of the afternoon be waste utterly on the terrasse of the café de l'univer with the château ever in view wish it be convenable to make one 's duty call without more delay but it be not not to wait a decent interval would be self-betraying since duchemin have no longer any immediate intention of move on from nant finally he rather hope to get news at millau that would strengthen a prayer to eve de montalai to be sensible and remove she jewel to a place of safe-keeping before it be too late millau however disappoint at the end of a twenty-mile walk on a day of suffocating heat duchemin plod wearily into the hôtel du commerce engage a room for the night and be give a telegram from london which reward decode to some such effect as this : monk american independent means good repute no information as to other have ask surété concern lorgne would give something to know what mischief you be meddle with this trip and why the deuce you must few thing be better calculate to curdle the milk of human kindness than to find that one 's fellow-man have meanly contrived to keep he reputation fair when one be satisfied it should be otherwise duchemin use bitter language in strict confidence with himself dislike he dinner and after conscientiously loathe the sight of millau for a hour or two seek he bed in the devil 's own humor though he wait till eleven of the follow forenoon there be no supplementary telegram : london evidently mean he to understand that the surété in paris have communicate nothing to the discredit of monsieur le comte de lorgne and he consort enquiry of the administration of the hôtel de commerce elicit the information that the monk party have stop there on the night of the storm double back in the morning to visit montpellier-le-vieux return for midday déjeuner and have then proceed for paris just like any other well-behaved company of tourist there be nothing more to be do but go back to nant and -- what make it even more disgusting -- nothing to be do there except wait thoroughly disgruntle more than half persuade he have stake a claim for a mare 's - nest he take the road in the heat of a day even more oppressive than its yesterday in the valley of the dourbie the air be stagnant lifeless after eight mile of it duchemin be guilty of two mistake of desperation in the first instance he pause in la roque-sainte-marguerite and torment by thirst refresh himself at the auberge where the barouche and guide have be hire to convey the party from montalais on to montpellier the landlord remember duchemin and make believe he do not serve the wayfarer with a surly grace the only drink he would admit he have to sell a atrociously acid cider fit to render the last stage of thirst worse than the first duchemin however think it safer than the water of the place when he have spy out the association of the well he drink sit on a bench outside the door of the auberge he could hear the voice of the landlord inside grumble and growl to what purport he could not determine but it be not difficult to guess and before duchemin be finish he have testimony to the rightness of he surmise find himself the cynosure of more than a few pair of eye set in the ill-favoured face of native of la roque one gather that the dead guide have enjoy a fair amount of local popularity while duchemin drink and smoke and pore over a pocket-map of the department a lout of a lad shamble out of the auberge wear a fix scowl in no degree mitigate by the sight of the customer in the dooryard which be also the stableyard the boy catch and saddle a dreary animal apparently a horse design by a gothic architect mount and ride off in the direction of nant then duchemin commit he second error of judgment which consist in think to find better and cooler air on the height of the causse larzac across the river together with a shorter way to nant -- indicate on the pocket-map as a by-road running in a tolerably direct line across the plateau -- than that which follow the winding of the stream accordingly he cross the dourbie toil up a zig-zag path cut in the face of the frown cliff reach the top in a bath of sweat and sit down to cool and breathe himself the view be splendid almost worth the climb duchemin could see for mile up and down the valley a panorama wildly picturesque and limn like a rainbow across the way la roque-sainte-marguerite stand out prominently and with such definition in that clear air that duchemin identify the figure of the landlord standing in the door of the auberge with arm raise and elbow thrust out on a level with he eye : the pose of a man use field-glass duchemin wonder if he ought to feel complimented then he look up the valley and see far off a tiny cloud of dust kick up by the heel of the horse ridden by the boy from the auberge make good time on the highway to nant and again duchemin wonder have rest he pick himself up find he road a mere trail of wagon track and mindful of the cooling drink to be have in the café de l'univer put he best foot foremost after a time something call it instinct impel he to look back the way he have come half a mile distant he see the figure of a peasant follow the same road duchemin stop and wait for the other to come up think to get a better look at he perhaps some definite information about the road and in particular as to he chance of find drinkable water but when he stop the man stop sit he down upon a rock fill a pipe and conspicuously rest duchemin give a impatient gesture and move on after another mile he glance overshoulder again the same peasant occupy the same relative distance from he but if the fellow be follow he with a purpose he could readily lose himself in that wild land before duchemin could run he down and if on the contrary he prove to be only a peaceable wayfarer he be bind to be a dull companion on the road and a unsavory one to boot so duchemin do nothing to discourage he voluntary shadow but look back from time to time never fail to see that squat round-shouldered figure in the middle distance of the landscape follow he with the doggedness of fate toward evening however of a sudden -- between two glance -- the fellow disappear as completely and mysteriously as if he have fall or dive into a aven thus definite mental irritation be add to the physical discomfort he suffer for if anything it be hotter on the high causse than it have be in the valley a intermittent breeze imitate to vicious perfection draught from a furnace and if this be a short cut to nant duchemin 's judgment be gravely at fault otherwise the journey be not unlike a exaggerated version of he walk from meyruei to montpellier-le-vieux except that the road be clearly marked and he find less climb to do he see neither hamlet nor farmstead and find no water by the middle of the afternoon he thirst have become sheer torture in dusk of evening he stumble down into the valley again and strike the river road about midway between the château de montalais and nant at this junction several dwelling cluster in that fading light dark mass on either side of the road duchemin notice a few shadowy shape loitering about but be too far go in fatigue and thirst to pay they any heed he have no thought but to stop at the first house and beg a cup of water as he lift a hand to knuckle the door he be attack with no more warning than a cry the signal for the onslaught and the sudden scuffling noise of several pair of foot he wheel find himself already closely press by a number of man and strike out at random he stick land on somebody 's head with a resounding thump follow by a yell of pain then three man be grapple with he two more seek to aid they and another lay in the roadway clutch a fractured skull and spit oath and groan he stick be seize and wrench away he be over-whelmed by number the knot of struggle figure topple and go to the dust duchemin underneath so weigh down that he could not for the moment move a hand toward he pistol half-stifled by the reek of unwashed flesh he hear broken phrase growl in voice hoarse with effort and excitement : the knife hold he stand clear and let I -- the knife struggle madly he work a leg free and kick with all he might one of he assailant howl aloud and fall back to nurse a broken shin two other scramble out of the way leave one to pin he down with knee upon he chest another to wield the knife stare eye catch a warning gleam on descend steel duchemin squirm frantically to one side and feel cold metal kiss the skin over he rib as the blade penetrate he clothing close under the armpit before the man with the knife could strike again duchemin rouse to a mightier effort throw off the ruffian on he chest get on he knee and rain blow right and leave as the other close in again somehow manage to scramble to he foot fist-work tell for a instant he stand quite free the center of a circle of uncertain assassin whose cowardice give he time to whip out he pistol but before he could level it a man be on he back he wrist be seize and the weapon twist from he grasp a cry of triumph be echo by exclamation of alarm as disarmed duchemin be again leave free the thug stand back to let the pistol do its work in that instant a broad sword of light swing round a nearby corner and smite the group : the twin glaring eye of a motor car flood with blue-white radiance that tableau of one man at bay in the middle of the road in a ring of merciless enemy duchemin 's cry for help be utter only a instant before he pistol explode in alien hand the headlight show he distinctly the face of the man who fire the same face of fat feature black with soot that he have see by moonlight at montpellier-le-vieux but the bullet go wild and the automobile do not stop but drive directly at the group and so swiftly that the flash of the shot be still vivid in duchemin 's vision when the car sweep between he and those other scatter they like chicken simultaneously the brake be set the dark bulk begin to slide with lock wheel to a stop and a voice cry : quickly monsieur quickly -- the voice of eve de montalai in two bound duchemin overtake the car and before it have come to a standstill leap upon the running-board and grasp the side he have one glimpse of the set white face of eve en profile as she bent forward manipulate the gear-shift then the pistol spat again its bullet strike he a blow of sickening agony in the side aware that he be dangerously wound he put all that he have leave of strength and will into one final effort throw he body across the door as he fall sprawl into the tonneau consciousness depart like a light withdraw viii in re amor et al in the course of two week or so duchemin be able to navigate a wheel chair bask on the little balcony outside he bedchamber window in the château de montalais and even -- strictly against order -- take experimental stroll the wound in he side still hurt like the very deuce at every ill-considered movement but duchemin be ever the least patient of man unless the will that coerce he be he own constraint to another 's however reasonable irk he to exasperation so that these faltering in forbid way be really -lrb- as he assure eve de montalais when one day she catch he creep round he room one hand press against the wall for support the other to he side -rrb- in the nature of a sop to he self-respect you have only get to tell I not to do a thing often enough he comment as she lead he back to he chair to fill I with unholy desire to do it if i die in the attempt be not that a rather common human fail she ask wheeling the invalid chair through one of the french window to the balcony that be what make it all seem so unfair smile the woman turn the back of the chair to the brightest glare of sunshine drape a light rug over the invalid 's knee and seat herself in a wicker chair face he make all what seem so unfair the indignity of be bear human he accept a cigarette and wax didactic : the one thing that the ego can find to reconcile it with existence be belief in its own uniquity i do not think she interrupt with a severe face belie by amuse eye that sound quite nice uniquity because it sound like iniquity they be not unrelated what make iniquity seem attractive be as a rule its departure from the commonplace but you be say -- merely it be we personal belief that we emotion and sensation and way of thought be peculiar to ourselves individually that sometimes make the game seem worth the scandal yes : one presume we all do think that but no sooner do one get firmly establish in that particular phase of self-complacence than along come life grin like a gamin and kick over we pretty house of card -- show we up to ourselves by reveal we pet exclusive idiosyncrasy as simple infirmity all mortal flesh be heir to monsieur be cynic madame mean obvious well : if i patter platitude it be to conceal a sense of gratification eve arch she eyebrow i mean you have show I that i share at least one quality with you : instinctive resentment of the voice of reason she pronounce a plaintive mon dieu and appeal to heaven for compassion declare : he mean again to wrestle spiritually with I about the proper disposition of my jewel no madame : pardon i be contemplate a long series of exhaustive argument design to prove it you duty to leave you jewel where they be in all they noble insecurity this in the firm belief that to plead with you long enough to adopt this course will result in you go and do otherwise out of sheer perversity monsieur humanity madame eve de montalais laugh the charming low-keyed laugh of a happily divert woman but spare yourself monsieur i surrender at discretion : i will do as you wish truly rather than listen to my discourse you actually agree to remove you jewel to a safe place even so monsieur as soon as you be able to get about and the château de montalais lack a guest i will leave louise to take care of madame ma mère for a few day while i journey to paris -- alone but naturally take you jewel with you why else do i go but madame you must not -- and why you a woman travel alone to pari with a treasure in jewel ah no i should say not monsieur be emphatic eve suggest demurely monsieur mean to be rather than let you run such a risk i would steal the jewel myself convey they to paris put they in safe keep and send you the receipt what a lot of trouble monsieur would save I if he would only be so kind as to do as he threaten and how amusing if he be arrest en route duchemin supplement with a wry smile i be quite confident of you ability to elude the police monsieur do i hear you compliment I if you take it so but suppose you be not confident of my good will impossible madame be too flattering one be sure she be too wise to put so great a temptation in the way of any man monsieur be the reverse of flattering he imply that one do not know where one can repose trust i must warn madame there be those in this world who would call she faith misplace doubtless but what of that be i to distrust you because other might who do not know you so well but -- madame -- you can hardly claim to know I well listen my friend eve de montalais flick away she cigarette and sit forward elbow on knee hand lace she level gaze hold he it be true we acquaintance be barely three week old but you do injustice to my insight if you assume i have learn nothing about you in all that time you have not be secretive with I the mask you hold between yourself and the world lest it pry into what do not concern it have be lower when you have talk with I and i have have eye to see what be reveal -- ah madame -- the nature of a man of honor monsieur simple of heart and generous as faithful as he be brave eve have speak impulsively with warmth of feeling unrealised until too late now slow color mantle she cheek but she eye remain steadfast candid unashamed it be duchemin who drop he gaze abashed and though nothing have any sense in he understand other than the word which he have just hear from the lip of the woman who hold he love -- as he have know now these many day -- some freak of dual consciousness make he see for the first time in that moment how oddly bleached and waste seem the powerful nervous brown hand that rest on he knee and he think : it will be long before i be strong again with a troubled smile he say : i would give much to be worthy of what you think of I madame and i would be a poor thing indeed if i fail to try to live up to you faith you will not fail she reply what you be you be before my faith be and will be afterwards when she do not finish but of a sudden recollected herself lounge back in she chair and laugh quietly with humorous appeal to he sympathy so that be settle : i be not to be permit to take my jewel to pari alone what then monsieur i would suggest you write you banker say duchemin seriously and tell they that you contemplate bring to pari some valuable to entrust to they care say that you prefer not to travel without protection and request they to send you two trust man -- detective they may call they -- to guard you on the way they will do so without hesitation and you may then feel entirely at ease not otherwise you think not otherwise i feel sure but why you have be so persistent about this matter monsieur ever since that night when those curious people stop here in the rain can it be that you suspect they of evil design upon my trinket duchemin shrug who know madame what they be you call they ` curious ' for my part i find the adjective apt i fancy i know what you think about they and that be -- that they rather lead the conversation to the subject of my jewel such be my thought indeed perhaps you be right if so they learn all they need to know except possibly the precise location of you strong box they may have learn even that how madame i do not know but if they be what you suspect they be they be clever people far more clever than poor provincial like we she take a moment for thought but i be puzzle by they harping on the subject of -- i think they call he the lone wolf now why should they do that duchemin be constrain to take refuge in another shrug who know he iterate if they be as clever as we assume doubtless they be clever enough to have a motive even for that he really exist this lone wolf he be more than a creature of fable assuredly madame for year he be the nightmare and the scourge of people of wealth in every capital of europe why do they call he the lone wolf do you know i believe some imaginative parisian journalist fix that sobriquet on he in recognition of the theory upon which apparently he operate and that be -- that a criminal at least a thief to be successful must be absolutely anonymous and friendless in which case nobody can betray he as madame probably understand criminal above a certain level of intelligence be seldom catch by the police except through the treachery of accomplice the lone wolf seem to have exercise a fair amount of ingenuity and prudence in make he coup and inasmuch as he have no confederate not a living soul in he confidence there be no one who could sell he to the authority still in the end -- oh no madame he be never catch he simply cease to thieve i wonder why i believe because he fall in love and consider good faith with the object of he affection incompatible with a career of crime so he give up crime how romantic and the woman : do she appreciate the sacrifice while she live yes madame or so they say unfortunately she die and then -- so far as be know the convert enemy to society do not backslide the lone wolf never prowl again a extraordinary story but be not every story that have to do with the workings of the human soul what one of we have not bury in he a story quite as strange even you -- monsieur deceive himself i be simply -- what you see but what i see be not simple but complex and intriguing beyond expression a woman of you sort wall herself up in a wilderness renounce the world renounce life itself in its very heyday -- but hardly that monsieur then i be stupid i will explain the sleekly coiffured brown head bent low over hand that play absently with they jewel to a woman of my sort monsieur life be not life without love i live once for a little time then love be take out of my life when my sorrow have spend itself i know that i must find love again if i be to go on live what be i to do i know that love be not find through seek so i wait such philosophy be rare madame philosophy no : i will not call it that it be knowledge -- the heart wise in its own wisdom surpassing mine tell I that if i would but be patient love would one day seek I out again wherever i might wait and give I once more -- life she rise and go to the window pause there turn back to duchemin a face compose but fairer for a deepen flush but this be not write to my banker monsieur she say in a change but steady voice i must do that at once if i be to get the letter in to-day 's post if madame will accept the advice of one not without some experience what else do monsieur imagine i be do then you will write privately and burn you blotting paper after which you will post the letter with you own hand let nobody see the address and when shall i say i will make the journey as soon as you banker can send they people to the château de montalais that will be in three day or less as soon as you banker can send they people to the château de montalais that will be in three day or less but you will not be strong enough to leave we within another week what have that to do -- this : that i refuse positively to go away while you be we guest monsieur somebody must watch over you and see that you come to no harm but madame -- no : i be quite resolve monsieur have too rare a genius for get in the way of danger i shall not leave the château before you do so i shall set this day week for the date of my journey ix blind man 's buff in short monsieur duchemin consider convalescence at the chateau de montalais one of the most agreeable of human estate and count the cost of admission thereunto by no means dear and with all he grousing -lrb- in respect of which he be conscientious hold it at once a duty and a perquisite of he disability -rrb- he be at heart in no haste whatever to be discharge as whole and hale the plain truth be the man malinger shamelessly and even take a certain pride in the low cunning which enable he to pose on as the impatient patient when he be so very well content to take he ease be wait on and cater to and listen for the footstep of eve de montalai and the accent of she delightful voice these last he hear not often enough by half still he seldom lack company in the long hour when eve be busy with the petty duty of she day and leave he lorn madame de sévénié have take a flattering fancy to he and frequently come to gossip beside he bed or chair he find she tremendously entertaining endowed as she be with a excellent and well-stored memory a gift of caustic characterization and a pretty taste in the scandal of she bygone day and generation as well as with a mind still active and better inform on the affair of to-day than that of many a parisienne of the haute monde and half she age during the first bedridden week george d'aubrac visit duchemin at least once each day to compare wound and opinion concern the inefficiency of the local gendarmerie for that body accomplish nothing toward lay by the heel the author of the attack on d'aubrac and duchemin but -lrb- for all duchemin can say to the contrary -rrb- be still follow clue with the fruitless diligence of so many american police detective on the trail of a bank messenger accuse of steal bond a decent likable chap this d'aubrac as reticent as any englishman concern he part in the great war duchemin have to talk round the subject for day before d'aubrac confess that he record in the french air service have win he the title of ace and this only when duchemin find out that d'aubrac be at present in he civilian capacity manage director of a establishment manufacturing airplane at the end of that week he leave to go back to he business and louise de montalai replace he at duchemin 's side where she would sit by the hour reading aloud to he in a voice as colourless as she unformed personality nevertheless duchemin be grateful and with the young girl as guide for the _ nth _ time sail with d'artagnan to newcastle and ride with he toward belle isle with he frustrate the machination of overween arami and yawn over the insufferable virtue of that most precious prig of all romance raoul vicomte de bragelonne but the third week find duchemin mend all too rapidly the time come too soon when the word to-morrow hold for he all the dread significance he assure himself that it hold for a condemn man on the eve of execution to-morrow the detective commission by madame de montalais 's banker would arrive to-morrow eve would set out on she journey to pari to-morrow andré duchemin must walk forth from the château de montalais and turn he back on all that be most dear to he in life on that last day he see even less of eve than usual she be naturally busy with preparation for she trip a trifle excite too it would be only the third time she have leave the château for as long as overnight since return to it after she husband 's death when duchemin do see she she seem at once exhilarate and subdue and he think to detect in she attitude toward he a trace of apprehensiveness she know of course duchemin at thirty-eight be too well verse in lore of woman to dream he have succeed in keep he secret from the fine intuition of one of thirty but -- he tell himself a bit bitterly -- she ought to know he well enough by this time to know more that she need not fear he would ever speak he heart to she the social gulf that set they life apart be all too wide to be span but by a miracle of love requite and he have too much humility and naivété of soul to presume that such a thing could ever come to pass and even if it should there remain the insuperable barrier of she fortune in the face of which the pretension of a penniless adventurer could only seem silly he be permit to be about the house in the afternoon and to dine with eve and louise in the draughty shadow-haunted dining hall madame de sévénié be indispose and keep to she room she suffer from time to time from a affection of the heart nothing remarkable in one of she advanced age and so no excuse for unusual misgiving but the presence of the young girl in some measure and the emotion of the other in greater lend the conversation a constraint against which duchemin 's attempt at levity could not prevail the talk languish and revive fitfully only when some indifferent impersonal topic offer itself the weather for example enjoy unwonted vogue it happen to be drizzle eve be afraid of a rainy morrow she confess to a minor superstition she do not really like to start a journey in the rain she smoke only one cigarette with duchemin in the drawing-room after dinner then excuse herself to wait on madame de sévénié and finish she packing it be time too for duchemin to remember he be still a invalid and subject to a régime prescribe by he surgeon : he must go early to he bed i be sorry mon ami the woman say hesitate after she have leave she chair before the fire whose play of broken light be perhaps responsible for some of the softness of she eye as she face duchemin and give he she hand -- sorry we last evening together must be so brief i be in the mood to sit and talk with you for hour to-night if you could only manage even one madame she shake she head gently with a wistful smile there will never be another night i know i know and the knowledge make I very sad i have enjoy know you monsieur even under such distressing circumstance my wound you tempt I to seek another do not be absurd he be still hold she hand and she make no move to free it but seem forgetful of it altogether linger on i shall miss you monsieur the château will seem lonely when i return i shall feel its loneliness more than i have ever feel it and the world madame say duchemin -- the world into which i must go -- it too will seem a lonely place -- a desert haunt you will soon forget château de montalais forget when all i shall have will be my memory -- yes she say we shall both have memory and suddenly the rich deep voice quote in english : ` memory like almighty wine ' she offer to disengage she hand but duchemin tighten gently the pressure of he finger bow over it and as he look up for she answer murmuring : with permission she give the slightest inclination of she head he lip touch she hand for a moment then he release it she go swiftly to the door falter turn we shall see each other in the morning -- to say au revoir with we monsieur it must never be adieu she be go but she have leave duchemin with a singing heart that would not let he sleep when he have go to bed stare blankly at the last chapter of bragelonne for a hour and put out he candle till long after midnight he toss restlessly bedevil alternately by melancholy and exhilaration or lay stare blindly into the darkness strive to focus he thought upon the abstract a hopeless effort try to think where to go to-morrow whither to turn he foot when the gate of paradise have close behind he and know it do not matter he do not care that hereafter one place and another would be the same to he so that they be not the place of she abode the château be as still as any castle of enchantment only a old clock in the draw room two floor below toll the slow hour and through the open window come the mournful murmur of the river a voice of utter desolation in the night he hear the clock strike two and shortly after in a fit of exasperation think to discipline he mind with reading light the candle on the bedside stand find he book and fumble vainly in the little silver casket beside the candlestick for a cigarette now a sincere smoker can do without smoking for hour on end as long as the deprivation be voluntary but let he be without the wherewithal to smoke if he have the mind to and he must procure it instantly though the heaven fall it be so then with duchemin and what greater folly could there be than to want a cigarette and do without one when there be plenty in the drawing-room to be have for the take he rise girdle about he he dressing-gown take up the candlestick open he door the hallway be as empty and silent as he have expect to find it he have no fear of disturb the household for he slipper be of feel and silent and the stair be of stone and creakless shield the candle flame with he hand and somewhat dazzle by the light thus cast into he face he pass the floor on which the three lady of the château have each she separate suite of room and gain the drawing-room as noiselessly as any ghost the fire have die down till only ember glow faint under film of ash like a old anger grow cold with age the cigarette be not where he have expect to find they near one end of a certain table duchemin put down the candlestick and move toward the other end discover the box he seek as soon as he back be turn to the light in the same breath this last go out he stand for a moment transfix in astonishment there be no window open no draught that he could feel nothing to account for the flame expire as it have suddenly without one flicker of warn a insane thing to happen to one at such a hour in such a place involuntarily memory hark back to the night of he first dinner in the château when the shadow have dance so weirdly and the strange notion have come to he that they be like famished spectre greedy of the light yearning to spring and snatch and feed upon they as wolf might snatch at chop a mad fancy when he turn hack to relight the candle it be go at least he must have be mistake as to the exact spot where he have place it perplexed he paw over all that end of the table but no candlestick be there he straighten up sharply and stand quite still listen no sound he vision spend itself fruitlessly against the blackness which the close window drapery render absolute but for those dull sardonic eye of die ember in spite of himself he know a moment when flesh crawl and the hair seem to stir upon the scalp for duchemin know he be not alone there be something else in the room with he something nameless stealthy silent sinister have knowledge of he where he stand and what he be while he know nothing of it only that it be there keep surveillance over he itself unseen in its cloak of darkness then with a resolute effort of will he master he imagination remind himself that spirit gifted in the matter of move material object such as candlestick frequent only the booth of seance medium without a sound he step back one pace then two to one side away from the table they be long stride when he pause he be well away from the spot where he have stand when the light be extinguish and where consequently a hostile move might be expect to develop otherwise he plight be little better he do not quite know where he be in relation to the door and the piece which furnish the room that old-time habit of memorise the arrangement of furniture in a room immediately on enter it have fail through disuse in course of year he be acquaint with the plot of this drawing-room in a general way but by no means with such accuracy as be need to serve he now so he wait strain to cheat that opaque pall of night of one little hint as to he whereabouts who have remove the light resurrect another old trick he measure time by pulse-beat and stand unstirring and all but breathless for three full minute but perception stimulate to extra sensibility by apprehension of danger detect nothing and he hearing be so keen he tell himself no breath could have be draw in that time without he have knowledge of it still he know he be not alone somewhere in that encompass murk a alien and inimical intelligence skulk baffle by power of patience and immobility that mock he own he move again edge toward the entrance-hall a progress so gradual he could have swear it must be imperceptible yet he have a feel a suspicion perhaps merely a fear that he do not stir a finger without the other 's knowledge a hand extend about a foot encounter the back of a upholstered chair which he identify by touch assume the chair to be occupy its usual position he need only continue in a line parallel with the line of its back to find the entrance-hall in about six pace within three he stop dead as if paralyse by sudden instinctive perception of that other presence close by whether he have draw near to it inch by inch or whether it see he about to make good he escape have creep up on he he could not say he only know that it be there within arm 's - length wait tense prepared and somehow deadly in its animosity digging the nail deep into the palm of he hand until the pain relieve he nervous tension he wait once more one minute two three but nothing then very slowly he lift a arm and sweep it before he right and left at one point of the arc a trifle to he left he finger-tip brush something he think he detect a stir in the darkness a stifled sound step forward quickly claw the air and catch between he finger a wisp of some material like silk sheer and glacé a portion of some garment simultaneously he hear a smother cry of anger or alarm and the night seem to split and be rent into fragment by a thousand shooting needle of color flame smitten brutally on the point of the jaw he head jerk back he reel and fall against a chair which go to the floor with a muffle crash x but as a mustard seed duchemin wake up in he bed glare of sunlight in he eye from the latter circumstance he reckon rather groggily it must be about the middle of the forenoon for not till about that time do the sun work round to the window still heavy with lees of slumber he wit occupy themselves sluggishly with question concern the enervation that oppress he the reason for he oversleeping why he have not be call then remind that noon be the hour set for eve 's departure fear lest she get away without he bon voyage bring he sharply up in a sit position he groan aloud and with both hand clutch temple that promise to split with pain that crash between they stroke upon stroke like blow of a mighty hammer a neatly fasten bandage hold in place above one ear a wad of cotton once saturate with arnica now dry duchemin remove these and with gingerly finger explore discover a noble swell on the side of he head where the cotton have be place also he jaw be stiff and develop a protest ache whenever he open he mouth then duchemin remember that be to say he recall clearly all that have lead up to that vicious blow from out of the darkness which have find he jaw with such surprising accuracy and he be visit by one or two rather indefinite memory of subsequent event he remember labor up the stair half walk half support by the strong arm of the footman jean who be in shirt trousers and slipper only while in front of they move the shape of madame de montalais en négligée carry a light candle and constantly look back then he have a impression of be lift into he bed by jean and of have he head and shoulder raise by the same arm some time later so that he might drink a draught of some concoction with a pleasant aromatic taste and odour in a glass hold to he lip by eve de montalai and then -lrb- duchemin have a faint smile of appreciation for a mental parallel to the technique of the cinema -rrb- a singularly vivid and disturbing memory of she face of loveliness exquisitely tender and compassionate bend so near to he fade away into a dense blank of sleep somewhat to he surprise he find the watch on he wrist tick away as callously as though its owner have not experience a prolonged lapse of consciousness it tell he that eve would leave the château within another hour he get up hastily grunt a bit -- though he headache be no longer so acute or else he be grow accustomed to it -- and ring for the valet-de-chambre order he petit déjeuner before this be serve he spend several thrilling minute under a icy shower and emerge feeling more on term with himself and the world the valet-de-chambre bring with he tray the announcement that madame de montalais present she compliment and would be glad to see monsieur at he convenience in the grand salon so duchemin make short work of he dress he café-au-lait and half a roll and hurry down to the drawing-room seat in a easy chair in the temper light of a awninged window which stand open on the terrasse nothing in she pose -- she be wait quietly hand fold in she lap -- and nothing in she countenance in the un-lined brow the grave serene eye lend any color to he apprehension and yet in he heart he have know that he would find she thus and alone no matter what have happen she profound reverie disturb by he approach she rise quickly advance to meet duchemin with both hand offer in sympathy my dear friend you be suffer -- he meet this with a smile denial not now at first yes but since my bath and coffee i be as right as a trivet and you madame a little weary monsieur otherwise quite well she resume she chair sign to duchemin to take one nearby he draw it closer before sit down but madame be not dress for she journey no monsieur i have postpone it -- a slight pause preface one more word -- indefinitely at this confirmation of the fear which have be haunt he duchemin nod slightly but the man send here by you banker -- they have not yet arrive we may expect they at any moment now i see say duchemin thoughtfully and then -- may i suggest that we continue we conversation in english one never know who may overhear she eyebrow lift a little but she adopt the suggestion without other demur the servant he nod : or anybody then you have guess -- broadly speak everything i fancy not in any detail naturally but one put two and two together i may as well tell you to begin with : i be wakeful last night and finding no cigarette in my room come down here to get some i leave my candle on the table -- there as soon as my back be turn somebody take it away and put it out a few minute later while i be try to steal out of the room i run into a fist yes she say thoughtfully and with some hesitation add : i too find it not easy to sleep but i hear nothing till that chair crash then i get up to investigate and find you lie there senseless in fall you head must have strike the leg of the table you come down here -- alone i listen first hear no sound saw no light but i have to know what the noise mean still you come downstairs alone but naturally monsieur i do not believe say duchemin sincerely the world hold a woman you peer for courage or curiosity she laugh at all event i find you but could do nothing to rouse you so i call jean and he help I get you upstairs again where do jean sleep in the servant ' quarter on the third floor in the rear of the house it must have take you some time several minute i fancy jean sleep soundly when you come back with he -- or at any time -- do you see or hear -- nothing out of the normal -- nobody indeed i at first believe you have somehow manage to overexert yourself and have faint -- or have trip on something and fall hurt you head later then you find reason to revise that theory not till early this morning please tell I well you see it all seem so strange i could not sleep when i go back to bed i lay awake puzzle uneasy it be broad daylight before i notice that the screen which stand in front of my safe be out of place the safe be build into the solid wall you know i get up then and find the safe door a inch or so ajar whoever open it last night close it hastily and neglect to shoot the bolt and you jewel of course -- she pronounce with unbroken composure : they have leave I nothing monsieur duchemin groan and hang he head i know it he declare no credit to I however naturally whoever steal my candle and knock I out do not break into the house for the fun of it i imagine that what with find I insensible wake jean up and get I back in my room you must have be away from yours fully half a hour quite that long it could not have be better arrange for the thief he declare if only i have stay in my room -- if you have it might possibly have be worse -- might not it the burglar -- or burglar -- know precisely the location of the safe they be come to my room and if they have find I awake i think it quite possible my friend that you appetite for cigarette may have save my life there be consolation in that he confess -- if it be any to you who have lose so much but perhaps i shall get my jewellery back what make you think that there be always the chance be not there and i believe i have a clue as they call it a indefinite one but something to work from perhaps what be that it seem to I it must have be what the police at home call ` a inside job ' because whoever it be apparently know the combination of the safe you mean it be not break open that signify nothing i have never see yours but i know something about safe and i 'll undertake to open it without the combination within ten minute you monsieur duchemin he nod gloomily it be no great trick once one know it with a ordinary safe that be such as you be apt to find in a private home have you look for finger-print not yet have you any idea how the thief break in through this very window i imagine you see i be up early and in my agitation dress hurriedly and come downstairs hour before i usually do the servant be already up but have not open the living room for the day i myself find this window unlatch the fastening be insecure you see it have be out of order for some time duchemin be on he foot examine the latch true he say but might not the wind -- there be no wind to speak of last night monsieur and what there be do not blow from that quarter she add as duchemin step out through the window : where be you go to look for footprint on the tile it be mist when i go to bed and with the mud -- but there be a heavy shower just before daybreak if the thief have leave any track on the terrasse the rain must have wash they clean away i have already look with a baffled gesture duchemin turn back to she side you have communicate with the police of course she interrupt with a accent almost of impatience : i have tell nobody but you monsieur not even my mother and louise but why i want to consult you first and she break off sharply to ask : yes jean : what be it the footman have enter to bring she card over which eve de montalais arch she brow show the gentleman in please the servant retire the man from pari madame yes you will excuse I -- duchemin bow but one word : you can hardly do better than put the case in the hand of these gentleman they be apt to be of a good order of intelligence when select to serve banker you know i understand she reply in she cool sweet voice she go to meet the man in the middle of the room duchemin turn back to the window where standing in the recess with the light behind he he could watch and reflect without he interest or emotion become too apparent and he be grateful for that moment of respite in which to compose and prepare himself within a hour he know within a day or so at most he must be under arrest charge with the theft of the montalai jewel damned by he yesterday as much as by every turn of circumstantial evidence the man whom jean usher in prove to be outwardly what duchemin have expect : of a class only too well-known to he plain man of the people unassuming well-trained and informed sceptical not improbably shrewd hand in the game of thief-taking salute madame de montalais with calculate ceremony one act as spokesman offer to present they credentials duchemin have a start of surprise to dissemble when he see the woman wave these aside it be not necessary monsieur she say i regret very much to have inconvenience you although of course it will make no difference in you bill but i have bring you here to no purpose the necessity for my contemplated journey no longer exist there be expression of surprise to which she put a end with the word accompany by a charming smile : frankly messieur i be afraid you will have to make allowance for the traditional inconsistency of my sex : i have simply change my mind there be nothing more to be say openly more than a little mystified the man withdraw the smile with which she dismiss they linger delightful and enigmatic as eve recognize the stupefaction with which duchemin move to remonstrate with she madame he cry in a low voice of wonder and protest -- why do you do that why let they go without tell they -- i must have have a reason do not you think monsieur duchemin i do not understand you madame you treat the loss of jewel as if it must be a secret private to ourselves to you and to I possibly that be my wish monsieur he give a gesture of bewilderment perhaps she continue meet he blank stare with eye in which amusement give place to a look almost apologetic yet utterly kind -- perhaps i have more faith in you duchemin bow he head over hand so tightly knit that the knuckle be white with strain you would not have faith he say in a low voice if you know -- she interrupt in a gentle voice : be you sure -- what i must tell you my friend she say : tell I nothing that would distress you he do not immediately reply the struggle go on within he be only too plainly betray by engorged vein upon he forehead and exceed pallor of countenance if you have tell those detective he say at length without look up you must have know very soon they must have find I out without too much delay and who in the world would ever believe anybody else guilty when they learn that andré duchemin you guest for three week be only a alias for michael lanyard otherwise the lone wolf but you be wrong monsieur she reply without the long pause of surprise he have anticipate i should not have believe you guilty dumb with wonder he show she a haggard face and she have for he in the agony and the abasement of he soul still quiver from the rack of emotion that alone could have extort he confession -- she have for he the half-smile tender and compassionate that it be give to most man to see but once in a lifetime on the lip and in the eye of the woman beloved then you know -- i suspect how long -- since the night those strange people be here and try to make you unhappy with they stupid talk of the lone wolf i suspect then and when i come to know you better i feel quite sure and now you _ know _ -- yet hesitate to turn I over to the police no such thought have ever enter my head you see -- i be afraid you do not quite understand I -- i have faith in you but why she shake she head you must not ask I that at the end of a long moment he say in a broken voice : very well : i will not not yet awhile but this great gift of faith in I -- i can not accept that without try to repay it if you accept my friend you repay no say michael lanyard -- that be not enough you jewel must come back to you if i go to the end of the earth to find they and -- man 's undying vanity would out -- if there be anyone living who can find they for you it be i xi au revoir early in the afternoon eve de montalai make it possible for lanyard to examine the safe in she boudoir without exciting comment in the household he be nearly a hour thus engage but bring back to the drawing-room in addition to the heavy magnifying glass which he have requisition to eke out he eyesight only a face of disappointment nothing he retort to eve evidently a gentleman of rigidly formal habit we friend of last night -- would not dream of call at any hour without he glove on i have be over every inch of the safe outside and in and the frame of the screen too but -- nothing however i have be think a bit as well i hope to some purpose the woman nod intently as he draw up he chair and sit down you have make a plan she state rather than enquire i will not call it that not yet we have get too little to go on but one or two thing seem fairly obvious therefore must not be leave out of consideration assume for the sake of argument that mr whitaker monk and he lot have a hand in this -- ah you think that i admit i be unfair but first they quarrel with my sense of the normal by be too confoundedly picturesque too rich and brilliant too sharp and smart and glib too -- well -- theatrical like character from the cast of what you american theater call a crook melodrama and then if they intention be so bless pure and praiseworthy what right have they to make so many ambiguous gesture lead the talk up to my jewel you mean i mean every move they make : all too suspiciously smooth too well rehearse in effect that stop to dine in nant with the storm come on when they could easily have make millau before it break : what else be that for but to stage a ` break-down ' at you door at a time when it would be reasonable to beg the shelter and hospitality of you roof then madame la comtesse de lorgnes -- whoever _ she _ be -- must get she foot wet a excellent excuse for ask to be introduce to you boudoir so she may change she shoe and stocking and incidentally spy out the precise location of you safe and when they ear be haul into the garage mr phinuit must go to help which give he a chance to stroll at leisure through the lower part of the house and note every easy way of break in mr monk casually note you likeness to the little girl he once meet _ he _ say in you father 's office something you tell I you do not recall at all and that place you as the veritable owner of the anstruther jewel and no mistake then -- madame de lorgnes guide the conversation by secret signal which i intercept -- somebody recognize I as the lone wolf in spite of the work of year and a new-grown beard and you be obliquely warn that if you jewel should happen to disappear it be more than likely the lone wolf will prove to be the guilty party at any rate they will be ever so much oblige if you 'll believe he be it 'll save so much trouble all around finally : when you ex-chauffeur -- what be he name -- albert dupont a name as unique in france as john smith be in england when albert dupont try to take my life as a simple and natural act of vendetta -- you really think it be that i recognize the beast when he let off that pistol at my head i be in he way here and he owe I one besides for my interference at montpellier that night when dupont half murder I and i be lay up on you hand for nearly a month we friend with design on you jewel thoughtfully wait before they strike till i be able to be up and about consequently in a position to be accuse of a crime which no one would put past the lone wolf oh i think we can fairly count mr monk and he friend in on this coup i be sure of it say eve de montalai but albert : be he one of they they employee or confrère dupont i fancy not i may be wrong but i believe he be entirely on he own -- quite independent of the monk party but he attack on we at montpellier and later on you here come at about the same time as they visit -- coincidence if you ask I the weight of probability be against any collusion between the two party please explain dupont be a apache of paris the language he use to I when we fight in that carriage at montpellier be the slang of the lowest order of parisian criminal use spontaneously under stress of great excitement with no intent to mislead these other people be -- if anything but poor misjudge lamb -- swell mobsman the élite of the criminal world the two caste never work together because they can not trust each other the swell mobsman work with he head and only kill when corner the apache kill first as a matter of instinct and then think -- to the best of he ability the apache know the swell mobsman can outwit he the swell mobsman know the apache will assassinate he at the first hint of a suspicion of he good faith so they rarely if ever make use of each other you say ` rarely ' but possibly in this instance i think not dupont be employ as you chauffeur you have tell I upward of a month he have ample opportunity to familiarise himself with the premise and pass the information on if act in connivance with those other but we know he do not or they would never have show themselves here in order to secure information they could not have get otherwise i see monsieur say the woman then you think the thief may have be any one of the monk party -- or several of they act in concert lanyard interrupted smile or albert not dupont unless i underestimate he gravely he be incapable of such finesse he be a thug first a thief afterwards he would have kill I out of hand if it have be he who have I at he mercy down here in the dark nor would he have be able to open the safe without use a explosive that indeed be why as i understand he dupont attack you at montpellier if he could have dispose of you there he would have return here to work upon the safe and blow it at he leisure fob the servant off with some yarn or if they prove too troublesome intimidate they kill one or two if necessary but why have he make no other attempt -- you forget the police have be make the neighborhood fairly warm for he besides he want I out of the way before he try housebreak if he have succeed in murder I that night i do not doubt he would have burglarise the château soon after but he fail the police be stir up to renew activity and if monsieur dupont be not now safely back in pari hiding in some warren of montmartre or belleville i be much mistaken in the man -- a type i know well eliminate albert then -- there remain the monk lot you be satisfied that one or all of its member commit the theft last night not less than two probably say phinuit at a venture and he alleged brother jule the chauffeur both american adventurous intelligent and resourceful yes i believe that and you plan of campaign be base on this conclusion that be a big name -- lanyard 's smile be diffident a plea for suspend judgment on he lack of inventiveness -- for a lame idea i believe we only course be to let they believe they have be successful in every way and so lull they into carelessness with a false sense of security a wrinkle appear between the woman 's eyebrow how do you propose to accomplish that she ask in a voice that betray ready antagonism to what she intuition foresee very simply they hope to shift suspicion on to my shoulder well let they believe they have do so the wait hostility develop in a sharp negative : ah no but yes lanyard insist it be so simple nobody here know as yet that you jewel have be steal only you and i very well : you will not discover you loss and announce it till to-morrow morning by that time andré duchemin will have disappear mysteriously the room to which he will retire to-night will be find vacant in the morning he bed unslept in obviously the scoundrel would not fly the château between two sun without a motive inform the police of the fact and let they draw they own conclusion : before evening all france will know that andré duchemin be suspect of steal the montalai jewel and be a fugitive from justice no monsieur the woman iterate decidedly you will observe he continue lightly persuasive it be andré duchemin who will be accuse madame not michael lanyard never the lone wolf the heart of man be in truth a dark forest and vanity the only light to guide we through its maze i confess i be jealous of my reputation as a reform character but andré duchemin be merely a name a nom de guerre you may saddle he with all the crime in the calendar if you like and welcome for when i say he will disappear to-night i mean it quite literally : andré duchemin will nevermore be hear of in this world she have a smile quiver on she lip yet shake she head monsieur forget i learn to know he under the name of duchemin ah madame do not make I think too kindly of the poor fellow for whether we like it or not he be doom and if madame in she charity mean to continue to know I it must be michael lanyard whom she suffer to claim a little portion of she friendship she smile grow wistful with a tenderness he have the grace not to recognize abashed incredulous he turn aside he gaze then without warn he find she hand at rest in he more than a little monsieur more than a little friendship only he close the hand in both he own then be kind to I madame be still more kind give I this chance to find and restore you jewel it be the only way this plan of mine if we adopt it no one will suffer only a old alias that be no longer useful if we do not adopt it i may not succeed for the true author of this crime may prove too wary for I and the end will be that my best friend will believe the worst of I even you madame even you will not be sure you faith be not misplace enough the woman beg in a stifled voice it shall be as you wish -- if you will have it so she seek to take away she hand but lanyard kiss it before he let it go and immediately she rise with a murmured half articulate excuse and go from the room leave he to struggle with himself and that which be in he which be stronger than himself he hunger for she love to deny stubbornly the evidence of he sens and end by persuade himself against he will that he be nothing to she more than a object of common kindness such as she would extend to anyone in similar plight because he never could be more those few last hour in the château pass swiftly enough most of they in make plan for he escape something which demand a deal of puzzling over map and railway guide in the seclusion of he room since the next noon must find andré duchemin a criminal publish and proscribe he have need to utilise every shred of cunning at he command if he be to reach pari without be arrest and without undue loss of time to take a train at millau would be simply to invite pursuit for that be the likeliest point a escape criminal would strike for a stop place for all train north and southbound telegraphic advice would cause every such train to be search to a certainty furthermore lanyard have no desire to enter pari by the direct route from millau not the police alone but other enemy even more dangerous might be expect he by that route on the other hand the nearest railway station combe-redonde be equally out of the question since to gain it one must pass through nant where andré duchemin be know and risk be see while at combe-redonde itself the station people would be apt to remember the monsieur who have recently create a sensation by despatch a code telegram to london there be nothing for it then but a twenty-mile walk due west across the causse larzac by night to tournemire where one could get train in any one of four direction constraint mark that last dinner with eve de montalais they be alone louise be dine by the bedside of madame de sévénié who remain indispose a shade more so than yesterday the ill health of this poor lady indeed be the excuse eve have give for put off she trip to pari they talk be frame in stilted phrase inconsecutive they dare not converse naturally each fear to say too little or too much for the memory of that surge of emotion transient though it have be in which they discussion have culminate that afternoon stand between they like a warning ghost a implacable finger seal its lip and theirs with the sign of silence but talk they must for the benefit of the servant and talk they do after a uneasy fashion make specious arrangement for lanyard 's departure on the morrow when eve be to drive he to millau to catch the afternoon rapide for pari nor be it much better after dinner in the drawing-room consciousness of each other and consciousness of self as each fight to master the emotion inspire by thought of they near parting drive both into the refuge of a dry insincere cool impersonality lanyard communicate nothing of he plan though aware he failure to do so might be misconstrue instil a instinctive if possibly unconscious resentment to render the situation still more difficult the truth be he could barely trust himself to speak lest mere word work on he guard like tiny stream that sap the strength of the dike till it break and loose the pent and devastate sea at half past nine end a long silence lanyard sit forward in he chair hesitate and cover he hesitation by light a cigarette i must go now he say puff out the match he be aware of she almost imperceptible start of surprise so soon she breathe the moon rise not long after ten and i want to get away without be see either by the servant or by -- anybody who might happen to be pass you understand she nod he linger frown at he cigarette with permission i will write please when i have anything to report she turn she head full face to he let he see she fluttering indulgent smile you must wait for that perhaps he falter -- at least i hope -- it will not be long you must wait for that perhaps he falter -- at least i hope -- it will not be long i shall be wait she tell he simply -- watch every post for word from you i sha not worry only for you he get up slowly from he chair and stand half choke with unutterable word i know no way to thank you he manage to say at last for what for everything -- kindness charity sympathy -- what be those thing she demand with a nervous little laugh word just word that you and i use to hide behind like timid child she rise suddenly and offer he she hand but i do not think it be any use my friend i be quite sure that neither of we be deceive no : say nothing more the time be not yet and -- we both can wait only know i understand go now -- she finger tighten round he -- but do not stay away any longer than you must do not be influence by silly tradition false and foolish standard when you think of I go now -- she free she hand and turn away -- but oh come safely back to I my dear xii travels with a assassin under a sky whose misty silver pulsed with wave of violet light and dim glimmering of gold lanyard gray with the dust and weariness of twenty league of heavy walking trudge into the sleep street of the town of tournemire in the railway station -- whose buvette serve he such listless refreshment as one may find at railway lunch-counter and nowhere else the world over -- a train be wait with a apathetic crew and a sprinkling of sleepy passenger for the most part farm and village folk of the department there be nowhere in evidence any figure resemble that of a agent de police lanyard make enquiry find that the train be destine for le vigan on the eastern slope of the cévennes and purchase a ticket for that point make himself as comfortable as might be in a depressingly third-rate second-class compartment -lrb- there be no first class and the third be far too richly flavor for he stomach -rrb- he cultivate a doze as the train pull out but drive as provincial train habitually be in a high spirit of devil-may-care its first stop wake he up with a series of savage back-breaking jolt which be translate into jerk when it start on again and fiendishly reiterate at every suspicion of a way-station on the course so that he presently abandon all hope of sleep and seek solace in tobacco and the shift view afford by the window penetrate the upper valley of the cernon the railroad skirt the southern boundary of the causse larzac then laboriously climb up to the plateau itself and lanyard rouse to the fact that he be approach familiar ground from a new angle : the next stop would be combe-redonde the day be still in its infancy when that halt be make aside from the station agent not a soul wait upon the platform but one or two passenger be set down and as the engine begin to snort anew a man dart from behind the tiny structure that house ticket-office and waiting-room gallop heavily across the platform and with nothing to spare throw himself into the compartment immediately behind that wherein lanyard sit alone this maneuver be perform so briskly and unexpectedly that lanyard catch barely a glimpse of the fellow but one glimpse be enough to convince he he have be wrong in assume that monsieur albert dupont have sneak back to pari to hide from the authority after fail to assassinate andré duchemin more than three week ago but why -- assume one be not mislead by a chance likeness to that heavy but athletic figure so well-remembered -- why have dupont linger so long in the neighborhood in hourly peril of arrest and why this sudden departure in the chill break of dawn a move so time and execute that it wear every sign of haste and fear no reasonable explanation offer in solution of either of these riddle unless indeed it be reasonable to believe that lust for vengeance be the ruling passion in the dupont nature that the creature have hang about the château in hope of get another chance at duchemin and have decide to give it up only on discover -- inexplicably at this hour -- that the latter have steal away under cover of night but lanyard do not believe that neither do he believe that dupont have have any hand in the robbery of night before last and be now in tardy flight in truth he do not know what to think and the wildest flight of a imagination provoke by this mystery be tame and timid in contrast with the truth as he be later to learn it to a amateur in sensation there be true piquancy in the thought that one be travel in company with a thug who have already have two try for one 's life and would not hesitate to essay a third in the same coach separate only by the thin partition between the compartment safe only in the thug 's unconsciousness of one 's proximity and this without the privilege of denounce the man to the police for to do so now would be to enmesh in the toil of the law not only albert dupont would-be assassin but andré duchemin charge with steal the montalai jewel lanyard would have give something for a peep-hole in the partition to be able to study the countenance of dupont unaware that he be under scrutiny but he have to content himself with keep vigil at the window make sure that dupont do not drop off at some one of those many way-station which the train be so scrupulous never to slight monsieur dupont however do not budge a foot out of he compartment before the end of the run and then lanyard purposely delay saw dupont get down from the compartment astern and make for the booking-office at le vigan without a glance to right or leave -- evidence not the remotest interest in he late company on the train but rather a complete indifference a absolute assurance that he have nothing now to fear and with this a preoccupation of mind so thoroughgoing that lanyard be able to edge up behind he when he pause at the guichet and eavesdrop on he consultation with the clerk of the ticket bureau dupont desire ardently to proceed to lyon with the least avoidable delay under such condition accord to the indicateur des chemins de fer he best available route be via nime where the next express from le vigan make close connection with a northbound train rapide due to arrive in lyon late in the afternoon there be however this drawback or so the clerk declare after a dubious sum up of the disreputable dupont ensemble : whereas one might travel any class as far as nime the rapide for lyon carry only passenger of the first class but say dupont with other blasphemy all the world know that the sacred rapide have no sacred accommodation for sacred passenger of the second and third class be he not the peer of any sacred first-class pig that ever travel by train in france if not he prove the contrary to he own satisfaction by pay for he ticket from a impose accumulation of french bank-note then with half a hour to wait he lumber into the buvette and gorge while lanyard -- have secure he own transportation for lyon by the some route -- skulk in the offing and keep a close eye on the gourmand have eat ferociously dupont come out slouch into a seat on a bench and he thick limb a-sprawl consume cigarette after cigarette in most absolute abstraction of mind observe thus off he guard and at tolerably close range with he face clean of soot he project a personality so forbid that lanyard marvel at the guilelessness which must have influence the lady of château de montalais to accept the man at he own valuation and give he a place in they household the face of fat feature be of porcine cast the forehead low and slant sharply back into bristle of black hair the snout long and blunt the lip flabby the chin retreat the jowl pendulous the eye a pig 's little cunning and predaceous the complexion sallow and pimply from unholy living with a incongruous over-layer of sunburn a type to inspire distrust one would think at sight a nature as repellant as a snake 's and ten time as deadly in every line and lineament in every move and gesture a apache of the apach as for the baleful reflection with which dupont be patently concern to the exclusion of all consideration of either surveillance or environment lanyard find himself so inquisitive that he have never a thought but to follow and study the fellow till he surprise he secret if possible -- at least so long as it might seem safe to do so moreover nothing could have suit he own purpose better than to proceed to pari by way of lyon nothing hinder the carry out of he design still lose in thought and inattentive dupont entrain for nime and at that station change to the rapide for lyon where duly at four o'clock -- with lanyard still a discreet shadow -- he alight in the gare de perrache here again fortune favor the voluntary sleuth the station be well throng a circumstance which enable he to keep inconspicuously close to he victim furthermore dupont be obviously look for somebody and so distract presently a shabby furtive little rat of a man nudge he elbow and dupont follow he to a corner where they confabulate in undertone for many minute while lanyard loiter just outside they normal range of vision a unnecessary precaution : they be unafraid of observation interested only in they private concern the little man do most of the talk dupont seeming content with a listen rôle and gratify by what he hear he nod frequently and once or twice a grim smile enhance the ugliness of he mouth a smile terrible in its contain savagery fit to make one 's blood run cold that cruelly relish in anticipation the success of some evil scheme not to be able to hear a word be exasperate to a degree the smaller villain produce something -- a slip of paper -- from a waistcoat pocket and hand it to dupont who examine it with disfavor shake he head repeatedly to the other 's recommendation of a sudden he end the argument by thrust the slip back into the hand of the jackal growl a few word of imperative instruction jerk he thumb toward the ticket bureau and without more ado turn and stride from the terminus alone the little man roll appealing eye heavenward then he shrug in resignation and trot over to the guichet lanyard now with no fear of be recognize range alongside and listen openly it seem that book for pari on the rapide to leave at one-twelve in the morning this lesser rascal have be assign a certain sleeping-car berth business of display the ticket : identify by lanyard as the object over which the conference have split now however it appear that a friend be to journey to pari by the same train but in another sleeping-car it be greatly desire by both that they be separate no farther than necessity might dictate that this reservation might be exchange for another in the same carriage with the friend thus far without interruption from the clerk of the ticket bureau but here ensue inevitably the violent french altercation between the two human being on either side of the guichet then as suddenly as it have arise the squall blow over a amicable settlement be arrive at the exchange of reservation be effect the small scoundrel with ten thousand thanks and profuse assurance of deathless esteem depart grin lanyard secure the reject berth and go about he business profoundly mystified but not downheart beyond shadow of fair doubt dupont be up to some new devilment but lanyard would be surprise if its nature fail to develop on the train or at latest upon its arrival in paris the next morning for the present he be weary of the sight of the fat apache glad to believe he have see the last of he for some hour he have much to do on he own part nothing less in fact than utterly to obliterate from human ken the personality of andré duchemin this affair involve several purchase for he be travel light indeed have leave even he rucksack at the château de montalais nevertheless it be no later than seven in the evening when he leave a room which he have engage in a hotel so pretentious and heavily patronise that he be lose in its ebb and flow of life a inconsiderable and unconsidered bit of flotsam -- and leave it a changed man the pointed beard of monsieur duchemin be no more and a little stain artfully apply have tone the newly expose flesh to match the tan of the rest the rough tweed walking-suit have be replace by a modest and commonplace blue serge the cap and heavy brown boot by a straw boater and plain black shoe the loose-throated flannel shirt by one of plain linen with stiff cuff and a fold collar and neat foulard tie so easily be madame de sévénié 's buccaneer metamorphose into the semblance of a government clerk but this be by no means all the papers of andré duchemin be crisp black ash in the fireplace of the room which lanyard have just quit all but the letter of credit and this last be enclose in a envelope to be send to london by register post with a cover note to request that the unpaid balance be forward in french bank-note to monsieur paul martin poste restante paris paul martin be the name which appear on a entirely new set of papers of identification which lanyard have thoughtfully secrete in the lining of the tweed coat before leave london if lanyard want better testimony than that supply by he bedroom mirror to the thoroughness of the transformation in he look he have it unsought and that twice within a hour the first time be when leave the hotel to seek the post office and despatch he letter to london he find himself suddenly face to face with dupont who be seat at a café table near the hotel entrance and narrowly scrutinise all who pass in and out cover this occupation with affected interest in the gossip of he companion the little rat man of the gare de perrache at this rencontre lanyard know a momentary shock of doubt perhaps he have not be so clever as he have think himself in trail dupont all the way from combe-re-donde to lyon but the beady little eye of a pig comprehend he in a glance and reject he as of positively no interest to albert dupont a complete stranger and a cheap one at that so he fare serenely on he way and dupont give he never another think return lanyard be favor with even less attention a error in judgment which enable he to remark that dupont be in a ugly temper sullen and snappy it might be because of a disappointment of some sort possibly in consequence of the liberal potation indicate by the tall stack of little saucer at he elbow as for the lesser villain he be already silly with drink one would have be glad of a chance to eavesdrop again upon those two but there be no vacant place within earshot of they table besides lanyard want he dinner so he re-enter the hotel and seek its restaurant where the untiring long arm of coincidence take he by the hand and lead he to a table immediately adjoining one occupied exclusively by monsieur le comte de lorgne and this one in turn look lanyard up and down but detect in he not the remotest flavor of reminiscence return divide attention to a soup and the door of the restaurant which he be watch just as closely and impatiently as dupont outside be watch the main entrance and apparently with as little reward for he pain but now lanyard tell himself one know what have drag dupont in such hot haste to lyon somehow word have reach he probably by telegraph that monsieur le comte be wait there to keep a rendezvous and if you ask he lanyard would confess he firm conviction that the other party to the rendezvous would prove to be the person -lrb- or person -rrb- who have effect the burglary at château de montalais so he settle to keep a eye on monsieur le comte and promise himself a interesting evening but as time pass it become evident that there have be a hitch somewhere de lorgne be only human he could not rendezvous all by himself alone and nobody turn up to help he out he be fret when lanyard first see he before he dinner be half serve he nerve be give way continually he distract gaze seek the door only to turn back in disappointment to he plate everlastingly he consult he watch he appetite fail the hand that too often carry a glass to he lip shake so that drop of wine spatter the cloth like blood he could not even keep a cigarette alive but burn more match than tobacco a heavy sweat bedew he forehead the ruddy color of that plump countenance grow sadly fade the good-natured feature draw and pinch with worry by nine o'clock the man be hag-ridden by fear of the unknown by terror of learn what fault have develop in the calculation of he confrères effort to fix he mind on a evening newspaper fail miserably and this be not for lack of interest in the news it publish to the citizen of lyon for lanyard have a copy of the same sheet and know that eve have loyally keep she promise a brief despatch from millau tell of the simultaneous disappearance of one andré duchemin and the jewel of madame de montalais and add that the police be already active in the case at length unable longer to endure the grow tension of anxiety and keep up a pretence of eat de lorgnes call for he addition and flee the restaurant lanyard finish he own meal in haste and arrive in the foyer of the hotel in time to see de lorgnes settle he account at the bureau and hear he instruct a porter to have he luggage ready for the one-twelve rapide for pari in the meantime anybody who might enquire for monsieur le comte de lorgne should be direct to seek he in the café thither lanyard dutifully repair and waste the rest of that evening which he have think would prove so amusing watch dupont and company watch de lorgne to whom dupont 's barely dissemble interest plainly mean nothing at all but whose mental anguish grow to be all but unbearable nor do the quantity of veeskysoda consume by the unhappy nobleman help he bear it though undoubtedly he assure himself it do by midnight he be more than half-fuddled and wholly in despair half a hour later he finish he eighth veeskysoda and weave a unsteady but most dignified way back to the foyer of the hotel immediately dupont and he fellow both markedly the worse for wear pay and leave the café lanyard return to he room to get a new-bought travel bag and start for the train afoot a neat brown paper parcel under one arm on the way he make occasion to cross the saône by one of its dozen bridge and pause in the middle of the span to meditate upon the witchery of the night when he move on the brown paper parcel be bear merrily downstream the mortal remains of andré duchemin that be to say he discard clothing in the gare de perrache lanyard witness a affect farewell scene between the little man and dupont not much to he surprise he discover that the former be not travel to pari that night after all it be on dupont 's account alone that he have take so much trouble to secure the change of reservation and when monsieur le comte de lorgne have waver through the gateway in tow of a luggage-laden porter and dupont have tear himself away from he fond familiar and lurch after the count and lanyard after a little wait have follow in turn : he be able to see for himself that dupont have contrived to be berth in the same carriage with de lorgnes prove that he do not mean to let the count out of sight day or night well weary lanyard proceed to he own compartment in the car ahead and turn in a busy day and not altogether unprofitable whatever expectation have be thwart in this mild outcome one have learn much and to-morrow one would resume the chase anew and one rather fancy learn a deal more but he be not of those who sleep well on train in spite of he extreme fatigue he wake up every time the rapide stop he be awake at dijon at four in the morning and again at laroche about a quarter after six there peer out of the window to identify the station he be startle to see the broad round-shouldered back of albert dupont make away across the rail -- leave the train it be not feasible to dress and pursue even have it be wise and lanyard be vex dupont he feel be hardly play fair after give one every reason to believe he mean to go through to paris and what under heaven do the brute think to accomplish in laroche be he still after the comte de lorgnes then the latter must likewise have flee the train or else something sinister in the slant of the dupont shoulder as he vanish something indescribably evil in he furtive yet heavy tread of a beast of prey strike a thrill of horror into the mind of lanyard he shudder and warn himself he must learn to hold he imagination in better check the newspaper of pari that day have a sensation that crush into insignificance the news from château de montalais : in a compartment which he have occupy alone on the night rapide from lyon a man have be find with he throat cut he clothing rip to rag even he luggage slash to ribbon whether through chance or intention every possible clue to the victim 's identity be miss xiii athenai in london about noon of that day a gentleman whom lanyard most often think of by the name of wertheimer decipher a code message whose contempt for customary telegraphic brevity be quite characteristic of the sender indeed a better voucher for he bona fide than the initial append in place of a signature with some editing in the way of punctuation it follow : dear old bean : -- please advise prefecture de police without reveal you source of information unidentified man find murder on rapide arrive gare de lyon eight-thirty this morning stop

athenai reneaux now that sound more like only it be a bit debilitating to contemplate as the mirror insist one must the shortcoming of machine-made evening clothes whose obviously exorbitant cost as a post-war luxury do nothing to make amends for they utter want of personal feeling for one need sympathy in a dress-coat quite as much as cloth still it be a tolerably personable figure that suffer lanyard 's critical inspection and a emergency be a emergency those readily serviceable clothes be of more value than the most superbly tailor garment that could possibly have be make up for he in any reasonable length of time for to-morrow night it might and as lanyard hold surely would be too late to accomplish what he hope to accomplish to-night and for whose accomplishment evening dress be indispensable since wertheimer have pass the word on the name of the comte de lorgnes would be publish to the world in the morning papers and by evening the bird if they be wise would be in full

have never see you look better flattery she comment but i love it meanwhile she gaze that seem so constant to he eye review other people in the lounge in one swift search glance and return to lanyard

chance to see you will be good enough to tell I who they be and -- other detail concern they way of life if i know but i be sure you know everyone worth know in pari athenai then -- if i be right in assume you be look for some person in particular -- you have reason mademoiselle i run the risk of lose a entertaining evening not necessarily besides there be many evening be you not at my command

paul : you be too gallant wait till i try to find out something about you directly or indirectly and see what you will then have to say about the curiosity of woman but i should not mind it would be too flattering so dig away i will who be it you be look for in pari after midnight anyone of several people perhaps i know they it might save time if you would give I they name now it be you who ask I to risk lose a enjoyable evening but so be it le comte de lorgnes mademoiselle reneaux look blank madame la comtesse de lorgnes the young woman shake she head both of a class sure to be conspicuous in such place as maxim 's lanyard explain the name then be probably fictitious if you could describe they perhaps -- useless i be afraid neither be a uncommon type any word picture of either would probably fit anyone of a score of people of the same life be you then acquaint with a man name phinuit -- give name unknown -- a american no mr whitaker monk of new york the millionaire that be quite possible he make he money in munitions i believe the girl reflect -- or perhaps it be oil then you do know he i meet he one night or rather one morning several week ago with a gay party that join ours at breakfast at pré-catelan and do we still drive out to pré-catelan to milk the cow after a adventurous night mademoiselle she nod and lanyard sigh : it be true then : man age he folly never a quaint little stupid the girl muse pardon mademoiselle i be think of whitaker monk quaint i grant you but hardly little or stupid a tall man as thin as a diet with a face like a comic mask of tragedy paul dear say athenai reneaux more in sorrow than in anger : somebody have be take advantage of you trust nature whitaker monk be short hopelessly stout and the most commonplace person imaginable then it would appear lanyard comment ruefully one do wisely to telegraph london for a keeper let we get hence if you do not mind and endeavor to forget my shame in strong drink and the indecorous dance of a unregenerate generation xiv diamond cut diamond lanyard and athenai reneaux have dawdle over dinner and coffee and cigarette with so much tacit deliberation that by the time lanyard suggest they might move on it be too late for a play and still a bit too early to begin the contemplated round of all-night restaurant also it be too warm for a music-hall so they kill another hour at the ambassadeur where they be fortunate in get good place and the entertainment impose no strain upon the attention where too the audience though heterogeneous be sufficiently well-dressed and well-mannered to impart to a beautiful lady and she squire a pleasant consciousness of be leave very much to themselves in a amusing expression of a civilisation cynical and self-sufficient but that be so wherever they go that night and in a sense they go everywhere in no city in the world be the doctrine of go-as-you-please-but-mind-your-own-business more studiously inculcate by example than in pari especially in its hour of relaxation lanyard have not be so long a exile as to have forget he way about entirely and with what be new since he time mademoiselle reneaux be thoroughly acquaint and if he feel himself rather a ghost revisit glimpse of a forget moon if all the odalisque be new to he vision and all the sultan strange if never a eye that scan he face turn back for a second look in uncertain reminiscence he have to console he the company of a young woman whom everybody seem to know and admire and like in none of the resort they visit do she fail to greet or be hail by a handful of acquaintance yet they be generously let alone as to that lanyard could not complain the truth be that despite the dark thread of sober purpose which run through those tolerably purple hour he be be excellently entertain not by this sad business of scamper from one place of dubious fame to another not by any reckless sense of rejuvenation to be distil from the practice of buy champagne at each stop -- and leave every bottle barely taste not by those colorful dissolve tableau always much the same in composition if set against various background of under-dressed woman sit with concupiscent man and swallow cold poison in quantity calculate to spur they into the frenzy of semi-orgiastic dance : by none of these but simply by the society of a woman of a type perhaps not unique but novel in he experience and intriguing to he understand if there be anybody or thing a girl of she age -- athenai be about twenty-five -- should not know she know he she or it if there be any place she should not go she either go or have be there if there be anything she should not do or say or think or countenance those thing she -- within limitation -- do and say and think and accept or pass over as matter of fact and no consequence and though she observe scrupulously certain self-imposed limitation she never make this obvious she simply avoid what she choose to consider bad taste with a deftness and tact that would have seem admirable in a woman of the great world twice she age and with it all she preserve a sort of champagne effervescence of youthful spirit and a easy-going cameraderie incomprehensible when one take into consideration the disillusioning circumstance of she life she vocation as a pay government spy trust with secret and worthy of she trust dedicate to day of adventure always dangerous generally sordid and like at any time to prove deadly young beautiful admirably poise accomplished and intelligent she should by rights have be wrap up in love of some man she peer in all these attribute but she be not or she say she be not in one of those moment of gravity which serve to throw into higher relief the light-heartedness of she badinage with lanyard assert a entirely willing disposition to stand aside and play the pensive amuse indulgent spectator in the masque of love dance by a world mad for it grasp for love greedily even in its cheapest shape and guise if it come she sigh it will find I wait and not unwilling but it will have to come in another form than those i know about my dear say lanyard be unafraid : it always do she call herself athenais reneaux but she do not pretend to lanyard that she have no better title to another name she french be of the purest a delight to listen to yet she be in fact less french than english she paternal forebear to the third generation have live in england and married englishwoman she say and more than this much about herself nothing perhaps derive some gratification from leave such broad field of conjecture open to the interest which a enigmatic personality never fail to excite but i think you be quite as much of a mystery as you pretend to see in I it be rather nice do not you think at least it give we a interest in each other aside from sentiment some day perhaps we 'll each know all now god forbid be you so afraid of learn my girlish secret then i do not believe you i do not believe you would even care to hear -- athenai lanyard protest in a hollow voice non mon ami she judge he shrewdly with narrow smile eye you flirt with far too much finish you know it can not be do to such perfection when the heart 's truly involve but for one thing -- and if only you would be a little more tragic about you disappointment to-night for you have not yet ask I a single question about anybody we have meet -- no : thus far we have draw every cover blank he groan for it be after three in the morning very well but for this and that i would be tempt to think you be sleuthe on the trail of some female fair but faithless but you be take all with entirely too much resignation there be a contented glow in the back of you eye -- i be have a good time it be pretty of you to tell I so but that be not the reason for you self-complacence see here lanyard interrupted sit up and signalling to the waiter for he bill : if i let you run on the way you be head you 'll presently be tell I something you have find out about I and i do not want to hear oh very well she sigh i be sure i do not wish to embarrass you but i will say this : man of you uncertain age do not go round with such contented eye unless they be prosperously in love oh come along lanyard growl offer to rise you know too confound much he wait a moment and then as she do nothing but sit and glimmer at he mischievously he add : shall we go where now she enquire without stir he have a shrug of distaste maxim 's i presume unless you can suggest some other place more likely and less tedious no she reply after take thought i can not we have cover pari pretty thoroughly to-night all except the tourist place no good wasting time on they then let 's stop on here till it be time to milk the cow pré-catelan but there be maxim 's left -- only another tourist show nowadays and frightfully rowdy sound like the lot i be after come along she shake she head vigorously sha not he eyebrow rise in mute enquiry because i do not want to she explain with childlike candor i be tired of be drag around and ply with drink do you realize i have have as much as two and a half glass of champagne to-night out of the countless bottle you have order well i have and they be do they work : i feel the spirit of independence surge in my midst i mutiny and defy you a peal of laughter reward the instinctive glance with which he seek to judge how far he be justify in take she seriously not only that but you be neglect I i want to dance and you have not ask I in fully half a hour and you be a heavenly dancer -- and so be i she thrust back she end of they wall table and rise if you please monsieur one could hardly resent such charming impertinence lanyard draw a long face of mock patience sigh a heroic sigh and follow she through the huddle table to the dancing floor a bewildering look reward he as they swing into the first movement of a tango do you know you be a dangerous man monsieur paul martin oh mademoiselle such fortitude such forbearance -- when i ought to be slap -- enchant disarm make I remember i be a woman foredoom always to yield i abjure my boast independence monsieur i submit it shall be as you wish : on to maxim 's -- after this one dance you know it be the last really good music we 'll have to dance to -- we last dance together perhaps -- who know -- forever she pretend to be overcome the lithe body in he embrace sketch a fugitive seizure of sadness droop with a wistful languor well suit to the swoon measure to which they sway and posture he hand be press convulsively she seem momentarily about to become a burden in he grasp yet ever to recover just on the instant of fail buoy up by the steely resilience of she lithe and slender body impossible to say how much be pretence how much impulsive confession of true feeling perplexed perturb lanyard gaze down into that richly tinted face which with eye half-curtained and lip half-parted seem to betray so much yet to he next glance be wholly illegible and provoke aware that with such woman man 's vanity mislead he woefully and aware that she be equally awake to this masculine weakness he wonder afraid even to guess tell himself he be a ass to believe a fool to deny then suddenly he see she lash sweep up to unveil eye at once mirthful and admonitory she hungry mouth murmur incongruously a edge warn play up paul -- play up to I we dance too well together not to be watch and if i be not mistaken someone you be interested in have just come in no : do not look yet just remember we be madly enamour you and i -- and do not care a rap who see it string by she word into a spirit of emulation lanyard achieve a adequate seeming of response to the passion feign or real with which the woman infuse the pattern coquetry of they step between lip that stir so little they movement must have be indiscernible he ask : who in the same manner but in accent fraught with a emotion indecipherable but intense the reply come : do not talk this be too divine just dance he obey deliberately shut out of he thought the warning she have give he and let himself go body and mind so that a sway to the sensuous strain of that most sensuous of dance the girl and the man for a space seem one with music that throb of love and longing desire and denial pursuit and retreat surrender and conquest on a sonorous phrase it cease a flutter of applause run round the table lanyard master a sense of daze that he see reflect in the opening eye of the woman as she slip from he arm in a instant they be themselves once more two completely self-contained child of sophistication with superb insouciance make nothing of they public triumph in a rare and difficult performance on the way to they table they be intercept by a woman who with two cavalier have since the moment of she entrance be stand near the door of the restaurant apparently spellbound with admiration through a rise clatter of tongue she voice cut clearly but not at all unpleasantly athenai it be i -- liane inure as he be to the manners of a age which count its woman not dress if they be not half undressed and with he sensibility further callouse by a night devote to restaurant the entrée to which for woman seem to be condition on at least semi-nudity lanyard be none the less inclined to think he have never see this side of footlights a gown quite so daring as that which reveal the admirably turn person of the lady who name herself liane there be so little of it that he reflect its cost must have be something enormous but in vain that scantiness of drapery : the white body rise splendidly out of its ineffective wrapping only to be overwhelm by a incredible incrustation of jewellery : only here and there do bare hand 's - breadth of flesh unadorned succeed in make themselves visible at the sound of she name athenai turn with a perfectly indicate start of surprise which she promptly translate into a little joyful cry the living pillar of ivory satin and precious stone run into she arm embrace she ardently and kiss both she cheek then release she half-turned to lanyard glint of trifling malice wink behind the open interest of troubling rounded eye of violet lanyard know himself know so he have sacrifice for nothing he beautiful beard he utter a private but heartfelt damn and bow profoundly as the woman tap athenai on the arm with a fan crust with diamond demand : present instantly my dear this gentleman who tango as i have never see the tango dance before forestall athenai lanyard reply with a whimsical grimace : be one then so unfortunate as to have be forget by madame la comtesse de lorgnes with any other woman than athenais reneaux he would have hesitate to deal so bold a offensive stroke but he confidence in she quickness of apprehension and she unshakable self-possession be both implicit and well-placed for she receive this overt notification of the success of he quest without one sign other than a look of dawn puzzlement madame la comtesse she murmur with a rise inflection but monsieur be mistake the other stammer bite she lip surely one can not have be so stupid lanyard apologise but this be mademoiselle delorme athenai say monsieur paul martin liane delorme those syllable be like a speak spell to break the power of dark enchantment which have hamper lanyard 's memory ever since first sight of this woman in the café de l'univer at nant a great light begin to flood he understanding but he be deny time to advantage himself immediately of its illumination : liane delorme be quick to parry and riposte how strange monsieur should think he have ever know I by a name what be it but no matter for now i look more closely i myself can not get over the impression that i have know monsieur -- martin do you say -- somewhere sometime but paul martin not unless monsieur have more than one name then it would seem that mademoiselle and i be both in error the loss be mine that gun spike lanyard begin to breathe more freely it be not too late to make up that loss monsieur liane delorme be actually chuckle in appreciation of he readiness please with he even in the moment of she own discomfiture she eye twinkle merrily at he above the fan with which she hide a convulse countenance surely two people so possess with regret at never have know each other should lose no time improve they acquaintance dear athenai : do ask we to sit at you table while the waiter fetch additional chair the woman make she escort know : monsieur benouville et le brun two extravagantly insignificant young man exquisitely groom and presumably wealthy who be make the bravest effort to seem unaware that to be see with liane delorme confer a unimpeachable cachet lanyard remark however that neither venture to assume proprietorial air while liane 's attitude toward they be generally indulgent if occasionally patronise and sometimes impatient champagne froth into fresh glass as soon as the band strike up another dance athenai drift away in the arm of monsieur le brun liane gaze round the room acknowledge the salutation of several friend signal gaily to a pair of mercenary on the far side of the dancing floor and issue peremptory order to benouville go chu-chu and ask angele to dance with you she be be leave to bear herself while victor dance with constance moreover i desire to afflict monsieur martin with my confidence with the utmost docility benouville efface himself eh bien monsieur duchemin eh bien madame la comtesse liane sip at she champagne make impudent eye at lanyard over the brim of she glass by what appear you have at last torn yourself away from the charming society of the château de montalais as you see that be a long visit you make at the château my old one madame la comtesse be well inform lanyard return phlegmatic one hear what one hear one have the misfortune to fall foul of a assassin lanyard take the trouble to explain a assassin the same apache who attack -- with other -- the party from montalais at montpellier-le-vieux and you be wound lanyard assent the lady make a shocked face and utter appropriate noise as you know lanyard add liane delorme pretend not to hear that last and the lady of the château she enquire -- they be sympathetic one feel sure they be most kind it be not serious this wound -- no mademoiselle may judge when she know i be unable to leave my bed for nearly three week but what atrocity and this apache -- remain at large ah these police and the lady describe a sign of contempt that be wholly unladylike still you be well recover by the way you dance one can not complain what a experience still -- liane again bury she nose in she glass and regard lanyard with a look of mysterious understanding re-emerging she resume : still not without its compensation eh mon ami that be as one regard it mademoiselle oh oh there be any amount of deep significance in these exclamation one may regard that in more way than one indeed lanyard agree with he most winning manner : one may for instance remember that i recover speedily enough to be in pari to-night and meet mademoiselle without lose time monsieur wish I to flatter myself into think he do I the honor of desire to find I to-night or any other do not depreciate the potency of you charm mademoiselle who have see you once could help hope to see you again my friend say liane with a pursed judgmatical mouth i think you be much too amiable but i assure you never a day have pass no nor yet a night that i have not dwell upon the thought of you since you make so effective a entrance to the château a vision of radiant beauty out of that night of tempest and fury liane droop a coy head monsieur compliment I too much impossible be one then to understand that monsieur be make love to I lanyard pronounced coolly : no that win another laugh of personal appreciation what then mon amus figure to yourself that one may often dream of the unattainable without aspire to possess it unattainable liane repeat in a liquid voice : what a dismal word monsieur it mean what it mean mademoiselle to the contrary monsieur it mean what you wish it to mean you should revise you lexicon now it be mademoiselle who be too flattering and where be that good monsieur monk to-night the woman overlook the innuendo or rather bury it under a landslide of emotional act ah monsieur but i be desolate inconsolable he have go away monsieur monk lanyard open he eye wide who else he have leave france he have return to he barbarous america with he beautiful motor car he kind heart and all he million and the excellent phinuit that one as well how long ago a week to-morrow they do sail from cherbourg it be a week since anyone have hear I laugh lanyard compassionately fish a bottle out of the cooler and refill she glass accept mademoiselle every assurance of my profound sympathy you have a heart my friend she say and drink with the feverish passion of the disconsolate and one very truly at mademoiselle 's service liane sniff mournfully and dab at she nose with a ridiculous travesty of a handkerchief be so kind she say in a tearful voice though she eye be quite dry and if one look closely calculate -- a cigarette one infer that the storm be over lanyard tender he cigarette case and then a match wonder what next what he have reason to anticipate be sure to come the only question be when not that it matter when he be ready for it at any time and there be no hurry : athenai finding herself pair with a un-commonly good dancer in le brun be considerately make good use of this pretext for remain on the floor -- there be two band to furnish practically continuous music -- and leave lanyard to finish uninterrupted what she perfectly understand to be a conversation of considerable moment as for benouville he be much too well train to dream of return without be bid by liane delorme but it be wonderful murmur that one pensive and there be that in she tone to make lanyard mentally prick forward he ear he sketch a point of interrogation to encounter so much understanding in one who be a complete stranger -lrb- ` complete ' lanyard consider i think it be come -rrb- monsieur must not think I unappreciative ah mademoiselle he protest sadly -- but you forget so easily that we have meet before when i term you a complete stranger well yes it be because i would not be in monsieur 's debt pardon i will repay sympathy with sympathy i have already forget that i ever visit the château de montalais so how should i remember i meet monsieur there under the name of but i forget the name of duchemin i never know there be such a name -- i swear -- before i see it in type to-day in type monsieur do not read the papers not all of they mademoiselle it appear in le matin to-day this quaint name duchemin in a despatch from millau state that a person of that name a guest of the château de montalais have disappear without take formal leave of he host one gather that he take something else nothing less than the world-known anstruther collection of jewel the property of madame de montalais née anstruther but i be recently from the château de montalais and in a position to assure mademoiselle that this poor fellow duchemin be unjustly accuse oh ho ho he hear again that laugh of broad derision which have seem so out of character with a great lady when he have hear it first that night now nearly a month old mademoiselle do not believe i think monsieur must be a good friend to this monsieur duchemin i confess i entertain a sneak fondness for he memory you can hardly call yourself a impartial judge -- it be nevertheless true he do not steal the jewel then tell I who do take they unfortunately for duchemin that remain a mystery rather i should say fortunately for he you would wrong he then but why if innocent do he run away i imagine because he know he would surely be accuse in which case ancient history would be revive to prove he guilty beyond a question in the mind of any sane court do one understand he have a history i have hear it intimate such be the case but i remain in the dark the theft presumably be not discover till after he disappearance yet accord to you contention he must have know of it in advance how do you account for that mademoiselle would make a famous juge d'instruction that do not answer my argument how be one to answer it who know how duchemin discover the theft before the lady of the château do do you know what you make I think that he be not as innocent as you assert mademoiselle will explain i have a suspicion that this monsieur duchemin be guilty in intention but when it come to put he intention into execution he find he have be anticipate mademoiselle be too clever for I now i should never have think of that he would have be wiser to stay and fight it out the very fact of he flight confess he guilt perhaps he do not remember that until too late and now nothing can clear he how sad for he a chance meeting with one who be not he friend a whisper word to the préfecture or the nearest agent de police and within a hour he find himself in the santé poor chap say lanyard with a doleful shake of the head i too pity he the woman declare monsieur : against my prejudice you faith in duchemin have persuade I i be convince that he be innocent how good you be it make I glad i have so well forget ever meet he i do not believe i should know he if i find he here in this very restaurant even seat by my side it be mademoiselle now whose heart be great and kind you may believe it well and do mademoiselle 's forgetfulness perhaps extend even farther into the so dead past but monsieur i be a mere child when i first come to pari before the war how could anyone reasonably expect my memory of those innocent girlish day to be exact regard that even then i meet people by hundred as a young girl study for the stage must be it likely one face would stand out in my memory more than another quite if you ask I say lanyard dryly -- quite likely if any circumstance connect with that face be at all memorable but i assure you i be in those day much too self-absorbed to pay much attention to other it be that way you know in maiden day mademoiselle do injustice to she memory lanyard insist in polite astonishment in some way it be wonderful the woman look suddenly aside so that he could not see she face but he perceive with a astonishment which he make no attempt to hide that she be quake bodily with some unconfessed emotion and when she face again he unbroken look of grave bewilderment he discover that she be really capable of tear monsieur she gasp believe it or not never before have i meet one with whom i be so completely en rapport and instantaneously it be priceless this we must see more of one another much more lanyard assent gravely a great deal more she supplement with significance i be sure we shall get along together famously mademoiselle offer I great honor -- nothing less than my friendship i would be indeed a ingrate to refuse it but a question : will not people talk what amusement shake she again how talk what more can they say about liane delorme ah say lanyard -- but about madame la comtesse de lorgnes my friend : that be a good joke once but now you must forget that name as utterly as i have forget another impossible what do you say she frown a little be it possible you misunderstand de lorgnes be nothing to I i never think he be you have reason because we be throw together and we name be something alike in sound it amuse we -- not the two of we alone but all we party -- to pretend i be madame la comtesse he be really a count who know it be the style by which he have always pass with we alas sigh lanyard and bent a sombre gaze upon he glass without look he be aware of a question gesture of the woman 's head he say no more but shake he own what be this she ask sharply you know something about de lorgnes have you not hear he counter look up in surprise hear -- he see she eye stab by fear and know himself justified of he surmise all day she have be expect de lorgne or word from he all day and all this night one could imagine the hourly augmented strain of care and foreboding indeed its evidence be only too clearly betray in she face and manner of that moment : she be on the rack but there be no pity in lanyard 's heart he know she of old what she be what evil she have do and in he hearing still sound the echo of those word with which obliquely enough but without misunderstand on the part of either she have threaten to expose he to the police unless he consent to some sort of a alliance with she a collaboration whose nature could not but be dishonourable if it be nothing more than a simple conspiracy of mutual silence and purposely he delay he answer till she patience give way and she be clutch he arm with frantic hand what be the matter why do you look at I like that why do not you tell I -- if there be anything to tell -- i be hesitate to shock you liane never mind I what have happen to de lorgnes it be in all the evening newspaper -- the murder mystery of the lyon rapide de lorgne -- lanyard incline he head the woman breathe a invocation to the deity and sink back against the wall she face ghastly beneath its paint you know this i be a passenger aboard the rapide and see the body before it be remove liane delorme make a effort to speak but only she breath rustle harshly on she dry lip she swallow convulsively turn to she glass and find it empty lanyard hasten to refill it she take the wine at a gulp mutter a word of thanks and offer the glass to be fill anew but when this have be do sit unconscious of it stare witlessly at nothing so lose to she surroundings that all the muscle of she face relax and she year peer out through that mask of artifice which alone preserve for she the illusion and repute of beauty thus the face of a evil woman of middle-age debauched beyond hope of redemption be hideously reveal lanyard know a qualm at see it and look hastily away beyond the rank of table which stand between he and the dancing floor he see athenai reneaux with le brun sweeping past in the suave movement of a waltz the girl 's face wear a startled expression she gaze be direct to the woman at lanyard 's side then it shift enquiringly to he with a look lanyard warn she to compose herself then lift a eyebrow and glance meaningly toward the door the least of nod answer he before le brun swing athenai toward the middle of the floor and other couple intervene liane delorme stir abruptly the assassin she demand -- be there any clue i believe he be know by description but miss but you my friend -- what do you know as much as anybody i fancy -- except the author of the murder tell I quietly briefly lanyard tell she of see the comte de lorgne at dinner in lyon of the uneasiness he manifest and the cumulative feeling of frustration and failure he so plainly betray as the last hour of he life wear on of the apach who watch de lorgnes in the café and the fact that one of they have contrived to secure a berth in the same carriage with he victim of see the presumptive murderer slink away from the train at laroche and of the discovery of the body on the arrival of the rapide at the gare de lyon absorb with eye abstracted and intent and a mouth whose essential selfishness and cruelty be unconsciously stress by the compression of she lip : the woman hear he as he might have be a disembodied voice now and again however she nod intently and when he finish have a pertinent question ready you say a description of this assassin exist have i not communicate it to you but to the police -- be it likely the woman give he a blank stare pardon mademoiselle : but be it likely that the late andré duchemin would have more to do with the police than he could avoid you would see a cold-blooded crime go unavenged -- rather than dedicate the remainder of my day to see the world through prison bar i should say yes -- see that this assassination do not concern I and i be guiltless of the crime with which i myself be charge but you who be a friend to de lorgnes know the fact and nothing hinder you communicate they to the préfecture though i will confess it would be gracious of you to keep my name out of the affair but lanyard be not dice with chance when he make this suggestion : he know very well liane delorme would not go to the police that for the préfecture she click a finger-nail against she tooth what do it know what do it do when it know anything i agree with mademoiselle entirely ah she muse bitterly -- if only we know the name of that sale cochon we do we -- monsieur i at least know one of the many name doubtless employ by the assassin and you hesitate to tell I why should i no but a effort of memory lanyard measure a silence seem lose in think in reality time the blow and prepare to note its effect then snap he finger as one who say : i have it -- albert dupont he announce abruptly unquestionably the name mean nothing to the woman she curl a lip : but that be any name then thoughtfully : you hear he companion of the café call he that no mademoiselle but i recognize the animal as albert dupont when he board the train at combe-rendonde that morning and unnoticed by he travel with he all the way to lyon you recognize he i believe it well when have you known he first when i fight with he at montpellier-le-vieux later when he seek to do I in on the outskirts of nant he be the fugitive chauffeur of the château de montalais but -- name of a sacred name -- what have that one to do with de lorgnes if you will tell I that there will be no more mystery in this sad affair the woman brood heavily for a moment but if it have be you he be after i might understand he catch the sidelong glimmer of she eye upon he dark with a unuttered question but the waltz be at a end athenai and le brun be thread they way through the intervene table the interruption could not have be better time lanyard be keen to get away he have learn all that he could reasonably have hope to learn from liane delorme in one night he know that she and de lorgne have be mutually interested in the business that take the latter to lyon he have the testimony of he own perception to prove that news of the murder have come as a great shock to she on that same testimony he be prepare to swear that whatever the part if any she have play in the robbery she know nothing of albert dupont at least by that name and nothing of he activity as chauffeur at the château de montalais yet one thing more lanyard know : that liane suspect he of know more than he have tell she but he be not sorry she should think that it give he a continue claim upon she interest henceforth she might be wary of he but she would never lose touch with he if she could help it now athenai be pause beside the table and say with a smile as weary as it be charming : come monsieur paul if you please and take I home i have dance till i be ready to drop annoyed by the prospect of be oblige to let lanyard out of she sight so soon before she have time to mature she plan with respect to he liane delorme pull herself together go home she protest with a vivacity so force it draw a curious stare even from the empty le brun so early my dear what be you think of i have be on the go all day long athenais explain sweetly and now i have get nothing leave to keep up on zut the delorme insist have more champagne and -- thank you no dearest my head be swim with it already i really must go surely you do not mind but liane do mind and the wine she have drunk have leave she only a remnant of sobriety not enough for good control of she temper mind she echo rudely why should i mind whether you stay or go it be you affair not mine she make a scornful mouth and the look with which she couple lanyard and athenai in innuendo be in itself almost actionable but I she pursue with shrill vivacity -- i sha not go yet i be not drunk enough by half get more champagne fred -- this to le brun as she turn a gleaming shoulder to the other -- quantity of it -- and tell chu-chu to bring angele over and constance and victor too thanks to the good god they at least know they be still alive xv adieu ever since the fall of evening whose clear gloaming have seem to promise a fair night of moonlight the sky have be thicken slowly over pari while still at the ambassadeurs lanyard have notice that the moon be be blot out by midnight its paling disk have become totally eclipse the cloud hang low over the city a dense blanket imprison heat which be oppressive even in the open and stifle in the ill-ventilated restaurant now from the shelter of the café canopy lanyard and athenai reneaux look out upon a pave like a river of jet ribbon with gently glowing light and run between the low bank of sidewalk no less black : both desert but for a few belated prowler lurch homeward through the drizzle and a rank of private car wait near the entrance the bedizened porter whistle fatuously at a pass taxicab which though fareless hold steadfast to its way while the driver acknowledge the signal only with jeer and disgraceful gesture after the manner of he kind so that lanyard remember how frequently similar experience have befall he in pre-war pari reflect sadly that the great conflict have after all work little change in human heart -- charitably assume the bosom of french taxi-bandit to be so furnished presently however the persistent whistle conjure from round a corner a rakish hansom that -- like the creature between its shaft and the driver on its lofty box with he face in full bloom and he bleary eye he double-breasted box-coat and high hat of oilcloth -- have doubtless be brisk with young ambition in the golden time of the nineteen-naughty but unmistakably of the vintage of the nineteen-twenty be the avarice of the driver for when he have be give the address of the athenai ' apartment he announce with vinous truculence that he whim incline to precisely the opposite direction gather up the rein cluck in peremptory fashion to the nag -lrb- which sagely pay no attention to he whatsoever -rrb- and consent only to change he mind when promise a fabulous fare even then he grumble profanely while lanyard help athenai to climb in and take the place by she side the rue pigalle be as dark and still as any street in a desert village from its gloomy wall the halting clatter of hoof strike empty echo that ring in lanyard 's heart like a refrain from some old song to that very tune have the gay world go about its affaire in younger year when the lone wolf be a living fact and not a fading memory in the mind of man he sigh heavily monsieur be sentimental comment athenai reneaux lightly beware sentimentalist come always to some sad end one have find that true but you be young to know it athenai a woman be never young -- after a certain age -- save when she love my friend that too be true but still you be overyoung to have learn it one learn life 's lesson not in any fix and predetermine order paul with no sort of sequence whatever but as and when life choose to teach they quel dommage lanyard murmur and subside into another silence the girl grow restive but tell I my dear don juan she protest : do all you conquest affect you in this morbid fashion conquest you seem to get on very well with liane delorme pardon if i be sentimental it be because old memory have be awaken to-night memory of forfeit day when one think well of oneself here in pari day in which no doubt liane play a part a very minor rôle athenai but be you do I the honor to be jealous perhaps petit monsieur paul in the broken light of pass lamp she quiet smile be as illegible as she shadowed eye after a moment lanyard laugh a little catch up she hand pat it indulgently and with gentle decision replace it in she lap it be not fair my dear to be put foolish notion into elderly head merely because you know you can do it show a little respect for my gray hair of which there be far too many they be most become say athenai reneaux demurely but tell I about liane if it be not a secret oh that be so long ago and such a trifling thing one wonder at remember it at all i happen one night to be where i have no right to be that be rather a habit of mine i be afraid and so i discover in another man 's apartment a young woman hardly more than a child try to commit suicide you may believe i put a stop to that later for in those day i have some little influence in certain quarter i get she place in the chorus at the variétés she make up a name for the stage : liane delorme and that be all you see it be very simple and she be grateful not oppressively she be quite normal about it all still she have not forget but remind yourself that the chemistry of year be such that inevitably a sense of obligation in due course turn into a grudge it be true liane have not forget but i be by no means sure she have forgive I for save she to life there may be something in that see what she have make of she life now there be where you can instruct I i have be long in exile but you know how liane graduate from the chorus of the variétés become first a principal there then the rage of all the music hall with she way of singing rhyme indecency one have hear something of that on the peak of she success she retire say she have work long enough make enough money that too know itself but liane retire only from the stage you understand perfectly she continue to make many dear friend some of they among the greatest personage of europe so that gradually she become what she be to-day athenai reneaux pronounce soberly : as i think the most dangerous woman on the continent how -- ` dangerous ' covetous grasp utterly unscrupulous and corrupt and weirdly powerful she have a strange influence in the highest place blackmail god know it be at all event strong enough to save she from be shoot during the war i be assign to watch she then there be a suspicion in england that she be in communication with the enemy i find it to be quite true she know bolo pasha intimately caillaux too other woman many of they flee the country or go to st lazare for the duration of the war or face firing squad at dawn for do infinitely less than she do to betray france and she ally but liane delorme get off scot-free i happen to know that england make the strongest representation to the french government about she i know personally of two young french officer who have be on friendly term with liane and who shoot themselves one dramatically on she very doorstep and why do they do that if not in remorse for betray to she secret which afterwards somehow find they way to the enemy but nothing be ever do about it she be never in the least molested and nightly you might see she at maxim 's or l'abbaye make love to officer while at the front man be be slaughter by the hundred thanks to she treachery ah monsieur i tell you i know that woman too well the girl 's voice quaver with indignation so that be how you come to know she lanyard comment as if he have find nothing else of interest i wonder yes : we be bosom friend -- almost -- for a time it be not nice but the job have to be do then liane grow suspicious and we friendship cool one night i have a narrow escape from some apach i recognize liane 's hand in that she be afraid i know something so i do but she do not dream how much i know if she have there would have be a second attempt of that sort minus the escape then the armistice come to cool we passion and liane find other thing to think about god know what other mischief to do in time of peace i think lanyard suggest recall that conversation in the grand salon of the château de montalais you have better look to yourself athenais as far as liane be concern after to-night she only need to see you with I to have confirm any suspicion she may previously have have concern you relation with the b s s i will remember that the girl say calmly many thanks dear friend but what be it you be do all the time what be it you see as the hansom swing round the dark pile of the trinité lanyard have for the third time twisted round in he seat to peep back up the rue pigalle through the little window in the rear as i think he let the leather flap fall over the peep-hole and sit back liane do not trust I he sigh disconsolate we be follow by a motor-car of some sort creep along without light probably one of the private car that be wait when we come out i have a pistol if you need one athenai offer matter-of-fact then you be more sensible than i lanyard hold a thoughtful silence for some minute while the cab jog sedately down the rue st lazare then have another look back through the little window no mistake about that he report and bend forward begin to peer intently right and leave into the dark throat of several minor street they pass after leave the hôtel terminus behind and head down the rue de la pépinière the deuce of it be he complain this inhuman loneliness if there be only something like a crowd in the street as there must have be earlier in the evening what be you think of monsieur but naturally of rid you of a embarrassing and perhaps dangerous companion if you mean you be plan to jump down and run for it athenai reply you be a fool you 'll not get far with a motor car pursue you and sergent de ville abnormally on the qui vive because the crime wave that follow demobilisation as yet show no sign of subside but mademoiselle it make I so unhappy to have any shadow but my own then rest tranquil here with I it be not much farther to my apartment possibly it would be better to drop you there first -- nothing of the sort but positively the contrary my dear child if i be to do as you wish they would think -- my dear paul i do not give a damn what they think remember i be specially charge with the preservation of you life while in paris besides my apartment be the most discreet little rez-de-chaussée one could wish there be more than one way in and out and once they think you be place for the night it be more than likely they will not even set a watch but will trot off to report then you can slip away when you will he stare know a moment of doubt to which a hard little laugh put a period oh you need not be so thoughtful of my reputation if this be the worst that could be say of I -- lanyard laugh in turn quietly tolerant and squeeze she hand again you be a dear he say but you need to be a far better actress to deceive I about such matter do not be stupid she sulky voice retort i be not he bent forward again folding he arm on the ledge of the apron study the street and consult a astonishingly accurate mental map of pari which more than once have stand he in good stead in other time after a little the girl 's hand creep along he arm take possession of he hand and use it as a lever to swing he back to face she in the stronger lighting of the boulevard haussmann she face seem oddly childlike oddly luminous with appeal please petit monsieur paul i ask it of you i wish it to please I o lord lanyard sigh -- how be one to resist when you plead so prettily to be compromise since that be settle -- of a sudden the implore child be replace by self-possessed mademoiselle athenai reneaux -- you may have you hand back again i assure you i have no more use for it the hansom turn off the boulevard afford lanyard a opportunity to look back through the side window still on the trail he announce but they have get the light on now with a profound sigh from the heart the horse stop in front of a corner apartment building and later with a groan almost human respond to the whip and jingle the hansom away leave lanyard the poorer by the exorbitant fare he have promise and something more athenai be already at the main entrance ring for the concierge lanyard hasten to join she but before he could cross the sidewalk a motor-car poke its nose round the corner of the boulevard haussmann a short block away and bear swiftly they way seem to search the street suspiciously with its blank lidless eye of glare peste breathe the girl i have a private entrance and my own key we could have use that have i imagine this sacred pig of a concierge -- the latch click she thrust the door open and slip into dense darkness lanyard linger another instant the car be slow down and the street lamp on the corner reveal plainly a masculine arm rest on its window-sill but the spy face above the arm be only a blur come monsieur lanyard step in and shut the door a hand with which he be begin to feel fairly well acquaint find he and lead he through the dead obscurity to another pause a key grate in a lock the hand draw he on again a second door close behind he we be chez moi say a voice in the dark one could do with a light wait this way the hand guide he across a room of moderate size avoid its furniture with almost uncanny ease then again bring he to a halt brass ring clash softly on a pole a gap open in heavy drapery curtain a window a shaft of street light throw the girl 's profile into soft relief she draw he to she till they shoulder touch you see he bent he head close to hers conscious of a caress tendril of hair that touch he cheek and the sweet warmth and fragrance of she and peer through the drapery see they pursue motor car at pause not at the curb but in the middle of the street before the house the man 's arm still rest on the sill of the window the pale oval of the face above it be still vague abruptly both disappear a door slam on the far side of the car and the car itself after a moment 's wait gather way with whine gear and vanish leave nothing human visible in the quiet street what do that mean do they pick somebody up but quite otherwise mademoiselle then what have become of he in the shadow of the door across the way : do not you see the deeper shadow of he figure in the corner to this side and there ah dolt the man in the doorway have move cautiously thrust one hand out of the shadow far enough for the street light to shine upon the dial of he wrist-watch instantly it be withdraw but he betrayal be accomplish that be enough say lanyard draw the drapery close again no trouble to make a fool of that one god have so nobly prepare the soil the girl say nothing they no longer touch and she be for the time so still that he might almost have fancy himself alone but in that quiet room he could hear she breathing close beside he not heavily but with a rapid accent hint at a agitation which she voice bear out when she answer he wonder : mademoiselle j' y sui petit monsieur paul be anything the matter no no : there be nothing the matter i be afraid i have tire you out to-night i do not deny i be a little weary forgive I there be nothing to forgive not yet petit monsieur paul a trace of hard humor creep into she tone : it be all in the night 's work as the say should be in pari three favor more then i will do you one in return ask be so kind as to make a light and find I a pocket flash-lamp if you have one i can do the latter without the former it be better that we show no light one stray gleam through the curtain would tell too much wait a noise of light footstep muffle by a rug high heel tap on uncovered floor the scrape of a drawer pull out : and she return to give he a little nickelled electric torch and then -- liane 's address if you know it the girl name a number on a avenue not far distant lanyard remark this yes you can walk there in less than five minute and finally show I the way out again she make no response he pursue in some constraint : thus you will enable I to make you my only inadequate return -- leave you to you rest yet another space of silence then a gusty little laugh that be a great favor truly petit monsieur paul so give I you hand once more but she no longer cling to it as before the clasp of she finger be light cool impersonal to the point of indifference vex resentful of she resentment lanyard suffer she guidance through the darkness of another room a short corridor and then a third room where she leave he for a moment he hear again the clash of curtain ring the dim violet rectangle of a window appear in the darkness the figure of the woman in vague silhouette against it a sash be lift noiselessly rain-sweet air breathe into the apartment athenai return to he side press into he palm a key that window open on a court the drop from the sill be no more than four foot in the wall immediately opposite you will find a door this key open it lock the door behind you and at you first opportunity throw away the key : i have several copy you will find yourself in a corridor lead to the entrance of the apartment house in the rear of this face on the next street demand the cordon of the concierge as if you be a late guest leave one of the apartment he will make no difficulty about open i think that be all not quite there remain for I to attempt the impossible to prove my gratitude athenai in mere unmeaning word do not try paul the voice be soften once more its accent break word can not serve we you and I there be one way only and that i know be rue barré she sad laugh flutter she creep into he arm but still petit monsieur paul _ she _ will not care if only once she cling to he for a long long moment then release he lip man have kiss I yes not a few she whisper rest she face on he bosom but you alone have know my kiss go now my dear while i have strength to let you go and make I one little promise whatever you ask athenais never come back unless you need I for i shall not have so much strength another time alone she rest a burning forehead against the lift window-sash strain she vision to follow he shadow as it move through the murk of the court below and lose itself in the deeper gloom of the oppose wall xvi the house of lilith it stand four-square and massive on a corner between the avenue de friedland et des champs-elysées near they junction at the place de l'etoile : a solid stone pile of a town-house in the most modern mode without architectural beauty boast little attempt at exterior embellishment but smell aloud of money just such a maison de ville as a decent bourgeois banker might be expect to build he when he contemplate retire after do the rothschild a wicked one in the eye it be like liane 's impudence too lanyard smile at the think as he study the mansion from the backwards of a dark doorway in the diagonally oppose block of dwelling she kind be always sure to seek once its fortune be on firm footing to establish itself as here in the very heart of a exclusive residential district as if think to absorb social sanctity through the simple act of rub shoulder with it or else as be more likely to be the case with a woman of liane delorme 's temper desire more to affront a world from which she be outcast than to lay siege to its favor it seem however truly deplorable that liane should have prove so conventional-minded in this particular respect it render one 's pet project much too difficult of execution earnestly as one desire to have a look at the inside of that house without the knowledge of its inmate its aspect be forbid and discourage in the utmost extreme heavy gate of work bronze guard the front door the single side or service-door be similarly protect if more simply and stout grille of bronze bar every window on the level of the street now none of these could have withstand the attack of a man of ingenuity with a little time at he disposal but lanyard could count on only the few remain minute of true night retard though it might be by shroud sky dawn must come all too soon for he comfort yet he be conscious of no choice in the matter : he must and in spite of everything would know to-night what be go on behind that blank screen of stone to-morrow night would be too late tonight if there be any warrant for he suspicion the jewel of eve de montalais lay in the dwelling of liane delorme or if they be not there the secret of they hiding be but to-morrow both and more than likely liane as well would be on the wing or lanyard have be sorely mistake in see in she as badly frighten a woman as he have ever know when she have learn of the assassination of de lorgnes it be possible he think it extremely probable that liane delorme be as powerful as athenai reneaux have assert influential that be with the state with the dealer in its law and the dispenser of its protection but now she have not to reckon with such as these but with enemy of she own sort with a antagonism as reckless of law and order as she herself and she be afraid of that infinitely more disturbed in mind and spirit than she would have be in the face of any threat on the part of the police the préfecture be a know and measure force a engine that run as it be on map line of rail its move might be forecast guard against watch evade but this other force work in the dark this hostile power personify in the creature who have call himself albert dupont the very composition of its being be cloak in a secrecy impenetrable and terrifying its intention and its workings could not be surmise or oppose until it strike and the success or failure of the stroke reveal its origin and aim liane -- or one misjudge she -- would never sit still and wait for the blow to fall she be too high-strung too much in love with life she must either strike first in self-defence -- and in such case strike at what -- or remove beyond the range of the enemy 's malice lanyard be confident she would choose the latter course but confidence be not knowledge he transfer he attention from the formidable defence of the lower storey to the second here all the window be of the type call french and open inward from shallow balcony with work bronze railing lanyard be acquaint with every form of fasten use for such window all be simple none could resist he persuasion provide he stand upon one of those balcony nor do he count it a difficult matter for a man of he activity and strength to scale the front of the house as far as the second storey its wall be build of heavy block of dress stone with deep horizontal channel between each tier these groove would be greasy with rain otherwise one could hardly ask for better foothold a climb of some twelve or fifteen foot to the balcony : one should be able to make that within two minute grant freedom from interruption the rub be there the quarter seem quite fast asleep in the five minute which have elapse since lanyard have ensconce himself in the doorway no motor car have pass not a footfall have disturb the stillness never a sound of any sort have come to he attention other than one distant blare of a two-toned automobile horn from the neighborhood of the arc de triomphe but one dare not count on long continuance of such condition already the sky show a lighter shade above the profile of the roof and one wakeful watcher at a nearby window would spell ruin nevertheless he must adventure the consequence poise to leave he shelter and dart across the street with he point of attack already select he thought already busy with consideration of step to follow -- he check and fall still farther back into the shadow something be happen in the house across the way a man have open the service-door and pause behind the bronze gate there be no light behind he and the gloom and intervene strip of metal render he figure indistinct lanyard 's high-keyed perception have none the less be instant to remark that slight movement and the accompany change in the texture of the darkness bar by the gate follow a little wait it swing slowly out perhaps eighteen inch the man advance with it and again halt to peer up and down the street then quickly as if alarm he withdraw shut the gate and disappear close the service-door behind he listen intently lanyard hear no click of latch such as should have be audible in that dead hour of hush evidently the fellow have neglect to make fast the gate possibly he have be similarly remiss about fasten the door but what be he up to why this furtive appearance why the retreat so abruptly execute by way of answer come the soft drone of a high-powered motor then the car itself roll into view a stately limousine come from the direction of the avenue de friedland before the corner house it stop a lackey alight with a umbrella and run to hold the door but liane delorme would not wait for he the car have not stop when she throw the door open on the instant when its wheel cease to turn she jump down and run toward the house heedless of the rain at the same time one side of the great front door swing inward and a footman run out to open the gate the lackey with the umbrella though he move briskly fail to catch up with liane before she speed up the step so he close the umbrella and trot back to he place beside the chauffeur the footman shut gate and door as the limousine move away : it have not be sixty seconds at rest in fifteen more street and house be both as they have be save that a light now shine through the plate glass of the latter 's great door and that be soon extinguished conceive that the man who have appear at the service entrance be the same who have admit liane lanyard tell himself he understand : impatient for he bed the fellow have go to the service gate to spy out for sign of madame 's return now if only it be true that he have fail to close it securely -- it prove so the gate give readily to lanyard 's pull the knob of the small door turn silently he step across the threshold and shut himself into a unlighted hall thoughtfully ape the negligence of the servant and leave the door barely on the latch by way of provision against a forced retreat so far good he feel for he pocket torch then sharply fall back into the nearest corner and make himself as inconspicuous as might be footstep be sound on the other side of a unseen wall he wait breathless stirless a latch rattled and at about three yard ' distance a narrow door open mark by a widen glow of light a liveried footman -- beyond a doubt he who admit the mistress of the house -- enter carry a electric candle yawn with a superstitious hand before he mouth and look to neither right nor left turn away from lanyard and trudge wearily back to the household office at the far end of the long hallway a door close behind he -- and lanyard move swiftly the door which have let the footman into the hall admit to a spacious foyer which set apart the entrance and -- as the play of the electric torch disclose -- a deep and richly furnished dining-room to one side a broad flight of stair ascend : lanyard go up with the activity of a cat make no more noise the second floor prove to be devote mainly to a drawing-room a lounge and a library all furnish in a weird inchoate sort of magnificence with money rather than with taste if one might judge fairly by the fitful and guard beam of the torch the taste may have be less questionable than lanyard thought but the evidence of luxurious tendency and wealth recklessly waste in they gratification be irrefutable light be burn on the floor above and a rumor of feminine voice drift down interrupt by a occasional sibilant rustle of silk or a brief patter of high-heeled foot : noise which bear out the conjecture that madame 's maid be undress and put she to bed a ceremony apt to consume a considerable time with a woman of liane 's age and disposition passionately bent on preserve to the grave a semblance of freshness in she charm lanyard reckon on anything from fifteen minute to a hour before she couch would be accomplish and the maid out of the way ten minute more and liane ought to be asleep if it turn out otherwise -- well one would have to deal with she awake no need to be gravely concern about that : to envisage the contingency be to be prepare against it believe he must possess he soul in patience for a indeterminable wait he be cast about for a place to secrete himself when a change in the tenor of the talk between mistress and maid be convey by a sudden lift of half a octave in the latter 's voice sound a sharp note of protest to be answer by liane in accent of overbearing anger one simply could not rest without know what that mean : lanyard mount the second flight of stair as swiftly surely and soundlessly as he have the first but just below a landing where the staircase have a angle he pause crouch low flat to the step he head lift just enough to permit he to see above the edge of the topmost a section of glowing rose-pink wall -- it would be rose-pink he could see nothing more and liane have already silence the maid or rather reduce she to response feebly submissive and consonant with the nature of she kind be rub it in and why should you not go with I to that america if i wish it lanyard hear she say be it likely i would leave you behind to spread scandal concern I with that gabble tongue in you head of a overgrown cabbage it be some lover then who have inspire this folly in you tell he from I if you please the day you leave my service without my consent it will be a sorry sweetheart that come to he it be well madame i say no more i will go i believe it well -- you will go you be mad ever to dream otherwise fetch my jewel-case -- the large one of steel with the american lock madame take all she jewel then the maid enquire move about the room but naturally what do you think that i leave they here for the scullery-maid to give they maquereaux i shall pack they tonight before i sleep -lrb- damnation -- from lanyard beneath he breath more delay -rrb- and we leave to-morrow madame at what time it matter not so we be in cherbourg by midnight i may decide to make the trip by automobile and madame 's packing you know well what to pack better than i get my box up the first thing in the morning and use you own judgment if there be question to be ask save they until i wake up i shall sleep till noon that be all madame that be all you may go good-night madame good-night marthe the stairway be no place to stop lanyard slip like a shadow to the floor below and take shelter behind a jog in the wall of the grand salon where standing in deep darkness he command a view of the hall the maid come down carry a electric candle like the footman 's its ray illumine from below one of those face of crude comeliness common to she class the face of a animal not unintelligent but first and last a animal with a hand on the lower newel-post she hesitate look up toward the room of she mistress as if lose in think poise thus she lift face partly turn away from lanyard its half-seen expression be hopelessly ambiguous but some secret thought amuse the woman a shadow deepen in the visible corner of she full-lipped mouth one fancy something sardonic in that covert smile she go on down a latch on the ground floor click as the door to the service hallway be gently close lanyard come out of hide with a fresh enterprise abrew one must kill time somehow liane would be at least another half a hour busy with she jewellery and the thought present itself that the library immediately beneath she room should be worthy a investigation in such establishment it be a tradition that the household safe shall be located somewhere in the library and such strong-box be apt to be naïve contrivance lanyard do not hope to find the montalai jewel store away in such a place liane would surely take better care of they than that assume they be in she possession they would be under she hand if not confuse with she own treasure still it could do no harm to make sure confident of be warn at need by he hearing which be normally supersensitive and when he be engage as now key to preterhuman acuteness he go coolly about the business and at he first step find a portable reading-lamp on a long cord and coolly switch on its hooded light the library be furnish with bulky old italian piece of carve oak not especially well select but suitable enough with one exception a ponderous buffet a exquisite bit of workmanship both in design and in detail but completely out of place in a room of that character at least nine foot in length it stand out four from the wall three heavy door guard by modern lock give access to the body beneath its tier of drawer but -- this draw a frown stare -- there be a key in the lock of the middle door there be such a thing as too much luck lanyard commune first the service gate and door and now this ready to my hand -- he swing sharply round and search every shadow in the room with the glare of the portable lamp but that be work of supererogation : he have already make sure he be alone on that floor place the lamp on the floor and adjust its hood so that it focus squarely upon the middle section of the buffet he turn the key and discover behind the door a small safe the run of luck do not hold in respect to this there be no key and the combination dial be smug with ill-grounded confidence in its own inviolable integrity still -lrb- lanyard tell it -rrb- it could hardly be expect to know it have yet to be deal with by the shade of the lone wolf amuse by the conceit lanyard lay hold of the knob with steady delicate fingertip that have not yet in spite of year of honorable idleness forget they cunning then he flatten a ear to the cold face of the safe to he informed manipulation the dial whirl pause reversed turn all but imperceptibly while the hidden mechanism click ground and thud softly speak a living language to he hearing in three minute he sit back on he heel grasp the t-handle turn it have the satisfaction of hear the bolt slide back into they socket and open the door wide but the rack pigeonhole hold nothing to interest he whose one aim be the recovery of the montalai jewel the safe be in fact dedicate simply to the storage of document love letter lanyard muse with a grimace of weariness and each believe no doubt she care too much for he to hold she power to compromise he good lord what vanity be man 's then the consideration offer that property of real value might be hide behind those sheaf of papers he select a pigeonhole at hazard and empty it of several bundle of letter all neatly bind with tape or fade ribbon and clearly docket it hold nothing else whatever but he eye be catch by a great name endorse on the face of one of the package and read what else be write there he brow rise high while he lip shape a soundless whistle if a inference be fair liane have keep not only such document as give she power over other lanyard wonder if it be possible he hold in he hand a instrument to bend the woman to he will suddenly he put out a hand and switch off the light a gesture quite involuntary simple reaction to the muffle thump of a chair overturn on the floor above sound of scuffle follow as if liane be dance to no music with a heavy-footed partner then a groan he hand move so rapidly and deftly that although he seem to rise without a second 's delay the safe be close and the combination lock when he do so the buffet door be shut and its key in he pocket this time lanyard ascend the stair without heed what noise he make nevertheless he action be never awkward or ill-timed he approach be not hear he arrival on the upper landing be unnoticed in a instantaneous pause he look into the rose-pink room and see liane delorme in a negligee like a cobweb over a nightdress even more sheer kneel and claw at she throat round which a heavy silk handkerchief be slowly tighten she face already purple with strangulation she eye bulge from they socket she tongue protrude between swollen lip a thick knee be plant between she shoulder-blade the end of the handkerchief be in the sinewy hand of albert dupont xvii chez liane conceivably even a journeyman strangler may know the thrill of professional pride in a good job well do : dupont be grin at he work and so intent upon it that he first intimation of any interference come when lanyard take he from behind break he hold upon the woman -lrb- and lamentably fail to break he back at the same time -rrb- whirl he round with a jerk that all but unsocket a arm and before the thug could regain he balance place surely on the heel of he jaw just below the ear a blow that come straight from the shoulder and carry all lanyard have of weight and force and will to punish in spite of dupont 's heaviness fairly lift he from he foot and drop he backwards across a chaise-longue from which he slip senseless to the floor it be just like that a crowded breathless business with bruise and ache knuckle to prove that the blow have be one to stun a ox lanyard believe it safe to count dupont hors de combat for a time at least in any event the risk have to be chance : liane delorme be in a plight demand immediate relief in all likelihood she have lose consciousness some moment before lanyard 's intervention release she have fall positively inert and lay semi-prostrate on a shoulder with limb grotesquely slack and awry as if in unpleasant mimicry of a broken doll only the whites of bloodshot eye show in she livid and distorted countenance arm and leg twitch spasmodically the ample torso be violently shake by labor lung the twisted handkerchief round she throat have loosen but not enough to give relief lanyard remove it turn she over so that she lay supine wedge silken pillow from the chaise-longue beneath she head and shoulder then reach across she body take from she dress table a toilet-water flask of lovely italian glass and drench she face and bosom with its pungent contents she gasp start convulsively and begin to breathe with less effort that dreadful rattle in she throat be still heavy lid curtain she eye lanyard continue to apply the scented water with a lavish hand in time the woman shudder sigh profoundly and look up with a witless stare man be measurably a creature of gesture stereotyped when the world be young : lanyard pat the woman 's hand as one might comfort a abused child it be all right now liane he say in a reassuring voice rest tranquilly you will soon be yourself again but wait : i will find you a drink she say nothing she look continue cloudy but the dazed eye follow he as he get up and cast about for a glass of water but then he remember dupont and decide that liane could wait another minute while he make it impossible for the apache to do more mischief he move round the chaise-longue and pause look down thoughtfully since he fall dupont have make neither moan nor stir no crescent iris show beneath the half-shut lid he be so motionless he seem scarcely to breathe lanyard dig the toe of a boot into he rib none too gently but without satisfaction of any doubt the fellow give no sign of sensibility but lay utterly relax with the look of one dead lanyard frown uneasily he have see man drop dead from blow less powerful than he and though this one have well earn a death swift and merciless lanyard experience a twinge of horror at the thought often enough it have be he lot in time of peace and war to be force to fight for life and more than once to kill in defense of it but that have never happen never could happen without he suffer the bitterest regret even now in the case of this bloody-handed butcher this ruthless garroter drop to he knee lanyard bent over the body to search for symptom of animation he perceive they instantly with inconceivable suddenness dupont demonstrate that he be very much alive a arm like the flexible limb of a tree wound itself affectionately round lanyard 's neck clip he head to dupont 's yearning bosom ground he face into the flannel fold of a foul-scented shirt simultaneously the huge body heave prodigiously and after a brief interval of fantastic flopping like a young mountain fall on top of lanyard but that be the full measure of dupont 's success in this stratagem if hopelessly victimize and take by surprise lanyard should have be better remember by the man who have fight he at montpellier-le-vieux and again with other assist on the road to nant though it be quite possible of course that dupont fail to recognize he ancient enemy in clean-shaven monsieur paul martin of the damp and bedraggled evening clothes however that may have be in the question of brute courage dupont have yet to prove lack he every instinct be a apache 's : leave to himself he would strike always from behind and run like a cur to cover but corner or exasperate by opposition to he vast power -- something which he seem quite unable to understand -- he could fight like a maniac he be hardly better now when he find himself throw off and attack in turn at a time when he believe he antagonist to be pin down helpless at the mercy of the weapon for which he be fumble and the murderous fury which animated he then more than make up for want of science cool-headedness and imagination they fight for they most deeply-rooted passion he to kill lanyard to live dupont to batter lanyard into concede a moment of respite in which a weapon might be use lanyard to prevent that very thing from happen even as animal in a pit they fight now on they knee strain each to break the other 's hold now wallow together on the floor now on they foot slog like bruiser of the old school dupont take punishment in heroic dose and ask for more shed frightful blow with only a angry shake of he head he would lower it and charge as a wild boar charge while he huge arm fly like lunatic connecting-rod the cleverest footwork could not always elude he tremendous rush the coolest duck and dodge could not wholly escape that frantic shower of fist time and again lanyard suffer blow that jar he to he heel time and again be fain to give ground to a onslaught that drive he back till he shoulder touch a wall and more than once toward the end he feel he knee buckle beneath he and see he shrewdest effort fail for want of force the sweat of he brow sting and dim he eye he dry tongue taste its salt he stagger in the drunkenness of fatigue and suffer agony of pain for he exertion have strain the newly knit tissue of the wound in he side and the hurt of this be wholly hellish but always he contrived somehow strangely to he to escape annihilation and find enough in reserve to fly back at dupont 's throat upon the first indication of desire on the part of the latter to yield the offensive to do less be to permit he to find and use he weapon whatever it might be -- whether knife or pistol be besides the issue chair the chaise-longue table be overturn and kick about priceless bit of porcelain and glass lamp vase the fitting of the dressing-table be cast down in fragment to the floor constrain to look to herself or be trample underfoot and galvanized with terror the woman struggle up and totter hither and yon like a bewildered child in the begin too bemused to be able to keep out of the way of the combatant if she crouch against a wall battle body brush she away from it do she take refuge in a corner she must abandon it else be crush once she stumble between the two and before lanyard could thrust she aside dupont have fall back half a dozen foot and worry a pistol out of he clothing he fire first from the hip and the shot shatter the mirror of the dressing-table try for better aim he lift and level the weapon with a tremble arm which he seek to steady by cup the elbow in he left hand but the second bullet plough into the ceiling as lanyard in desperation execute a coup de pie in la savate and narrowly succeed in kick the pistol from dupont 's grasp bereft thus of he last hope -- they be too evenly match and both too far spend for either to force a victory with he naked hand -- the apache swing round and run at the same time throw a heavy chair over on its back in the path of pursuit unable to avoid it lanyard try to hurdle it catch a foot on one of its leg and as dupont throw himself headlong down the stair crash to the floor with a impact that shake its beam main will-power lift he to he knee before he collapse he last ounce of endurance waste then the woman with fly drapery a figure like a fury speed to the banister rail and lean over empty the several shot remain in dupont 's automatic down the well of the staircase it be doubtful if she see anything to aim at or accomplish more than to wing the apache 's flight dupont have gain the second storey while lanyard be still fight up from he fall the last report and the crash of the front door slam behind dupont be as one heartbeat to the next lanyard pillow he head on a forearm and lay sob for breath liane delorme turn and run to the front of the house presently she come back droop sink into a chair and with lacklustre eye regard the man at she foot he get away she say superfluously in a faint voice i see he in the street stagger like a sot at that moment lanyard could not have muster a show of interest have he be tell dupont be return at the head of a horde he close he tired eye and envy the lucky dead whose rest be independent of bruised flesh and ache bone neither he suppose be dream poison by chagrin when what be mortal no longer matter three time have he come to grip with dupont and though he have be outnumber on the road to nant in lanyard 's sight the honor be far from easy neither would they be while yet the other live or be at large the bitterness of failure and defeat have so rank a flavor in he thought that nothing else in life concerned he now he have forget liane delorme for minute when she arm pass beneath he shoulder and try to lift they from the floor he look up then with listless eye and see she on one knee by he side give he in he turn that confident and reassuring smile with which he have greet she revive sens a long long time ago it seem come she say -- sit up monsieur and take this drink it will lend you strength you need it god know he do he throat be like a furnace flue he mouth hold the taste of leather but for that thirst indeed he could hardly have find the energy to aid she effort and lurch upon a elbow a white-hot lancet pierce he wound and though he lock he tooth against it a groan force out between they the woman cry out at the rapid ebb of color from he face but you be suffer he force a gray smile it be nothing he whisper hoarsely -- it will pass if you please -- that drink -- she put a knee behind he shoulder for support and he rest he head back upon it and drink deep from the glass which she hold to he lip nectar of olympus be never more divine than that deep draught of brandy and soda he think he quaff life itself in its distilled quintessence its pure elixir he look of gratitude have almost the spirit and the vigor of himself renew my thanks mademoiselle you thanks -- she laugh with indulgent scorn -- you thanks to I he offer to rise but be restrain by kindly hand no : rest there a little longer give yourself a little time before you try to get up but i shall tire you no and if you do what of that it seem to I my friend i owe to you my life to I it seem you do he agree but such a debt be always the first to be forget be it not you reproach I no mademoiselle not you but the heart of man we be all very much alike i think no the woman insist : you do reproach I in you heart you have say : ` she have forget that but for I she would have be dead long year ago this service too she will presently forget ' but you be wrong my friend it be true the year between have make that other time a little vague with old remoteness in my memory but to-night have bring it all back and -- a renew memory never fade so one be tell but trust self-interest at need to black it out you have no faith in I she say bitterly lanyard give she a weary smile why should i not and as for that : why should i have faith in you liane we way run league apart they can be one she meet he perplexed stare with a emphatic nod with eye that he could have swear be abrim with tenderness he shake he head as if to shake off a ridiculous plaguing notion and grin broadly that be a drink he declare i assure you it be too much for my elderly head let I up the cruel agony stab he side again and again as he -- not unaided -- get upon he foot and though he manage to gulp down he groan no grind of he tooth could mitigate he recurrent pallor or the pained contraction of he eye furthermore he waver when he try to walk and be glad to subside into a chair to which the woman guide he then she fetch he another brandy and soda put a light cigarette between he lip pick up a chair for herself and sit down so close to he that they elbow almost touch it be better that pain monsieur he reply with a uncertain nod press a careful hand to he side wound that animal give I a month ago which animal monsieur of the garotte liane recently the assassin of de lorgnes before that the ex-chauffeur of the château de montalais albert dupont as you say it be not a name the same she old terror revive my god what have i ever do to that one that he should seek my life what have de lorgne she eye turn away she sit for a moment in silent thought start suddenly to speak but check the word before one pass she lip and -- as lanyard see quite plainly -- hasten to substitute other no : i do not understand at all what do you think lanyard indicate a shrug with sufficient clearness mean to say she probably know as much as if not more than he but how do he get in i have not one suspicion i be not alone until that handkerchief -- naturally and you my friend i see he enter and follow this be strictly within the truth : lanyard have now no doubt dupont and the man who have reconnoiter from the service-door be one but it be no part of he mind to tell the whole truth to liane she might be as grateful as she ought to be but she be still liane delorme a woman to be test rather than trust i must tell you but perhaps you know there be agent de police in the restaurant to-night liane 's head describe a negative she violet eye be limpid pool of candor i be so much a stranger in paris lanyard pursue i would not know they but i think you perhaps -- no no my friend i have nothing to do with the police i know little about they not only that but i be so interested in we talk and then inexpressibly shocked i pay attention to nothing else i understand otherwise you must have notice who follow I you be follow and she have find the effrontery to chide he for lack of faith in she he be in pain : for all that the moment seem amusing we be follow i assure you lanyard reply gravely one man or two -- i do not know how many -- in a town-car but you be sure all we could get be a hansom draw by a snail the automobile run without light go no faster keep a certain distance behind we all the way from the place pigalle to the apartment of mademoiselle reneaux what have you to say to that furthermore when mademoiselle reneaux have persuade I to take refuge in she apartment -- who know what they design -- one man leave the automobile as it pass she door and stand on watch across the way could one require proof that one be follow then you think somebody of the préfecture recognize duchemin in you who know i know i be follow watch if you ask I i think pari be not a healthy place for I but all that liane object do not bring you here patience : i be well on my way lanyard pause to sip he brandy and soda and under cover of that summon ingenuity to the fore here a little hand-made fabrication be indicate we wait till about half a hour ago so do the spy mademoiselle reneaux then let I out by a private way i start to walk to my hotel the chatham there be not a taxi to be have you understand presently i look back and see i be be follow again to make sure i run -- and the spy run after I i twisted and double all through this quarter and at last succeed in shake he off then i turn down this street hope to pick up a cab in the champ-élysées of a sudden i see dupont he be cross the street toward this house he do not know I but quicken he pace and hastily let himself in at the service entrance incidentally if i be you liane i would give my staff of servant a bad quarter of a hour in the morning the door and gate be not lock i be sure dupont use no key some person of this establishment be careless or -- worse trust I to look into that enfin in he haste dupont leave the door as he find it i take a moment 's thought it be plain he be here for no good purpose i follow he in the state of this room tell the rest it be no matter the woman review the ruin of she boudoir with a apathetic glance which be however anything but apathetic when she turn it back to lanyard 's face bend forward she close a hand upon he arm emotion trouble she accent my friend my dear friend : tell I what i can do to repay you help I say lanyard simply hold she eye how be that -- help you to make my honor clear speaking rapidly and with unfeigned feeling he throw himself upon she generosity : you know i be no more what i be once in this pari -- when you first know I you know i have give up all that for year i have fight a uphill fight to live down that evil fame in which i once rejoice now i stand accuse of two crime two two in one i hardly know which be the greater : that of steal or that of violate the hospitality and confidence of those good lady of the château de montalais i can not rest while they think I guilty and not they alone but all my friend and i have make good friend in france and england so if you think you owe I anything liane help I to find and restore the montalai jewel liane delorme sit back she hand lift from he arm and fall with a helpless gesture she eye mirror no more guile than a child 's yet she accent be that of one who remonstrate but with forbearance against unreasonable demand how can i do that and she have protest she gratitude to he he know that she be lie anger well in lanyard 's heart but he be able to hold it in leash and let no sign of it show in manner or expression you have much influence he suggest here in pari with people of many class a word from you here a question there pressure exert in certain quarter will help I more than all the power of préfecture and surété combine you know that let I think she be stare at the floor you must give I time i will do what i can i promise you that perhaps -- she meet he gaze again but he see something crafty in she smile -- i have a scheme already in mind we will discuss that in the morning when i have sleep on it you give I new hope lanyard finish he drink and make as if to rise but relapse a spasm of pain knot he face afraid i must have a cab he say in a low voice and if you could lend I a coat of some sort to cover these rag and indeed he ready-made evening clothes have fare badly in they first social adventure but if you think i dream of let you leave this house -- in pain and perhaps to run into the arm of the police -- you little know I monsieur michael lanyard paul martin if you do not mind the guest room be there she wave a hand to indicate the front part of the house on that floor you will find everything you need to make you comfortable for to-night and in the morning i will send to the chatham for you thing or perhaps it would be wiser to wait till we be sure the police be not watch there for you return but if they be it will be a simple matter to find suitable clothing for you meanwhile we will have arrive at a understanding you comprehend monsieur i be resolve this affair be now arrange i be well content liane and that be true enough whatever she have in mind for he she be only play into he hand when she propose to keep he near she he manage to get out of the chair and accept the offer of she arm but hold back for a moment but you servant well monsieur what of they for one thing they sleep sincerely there be sound-proof wall between they part of the house and this more than that they be forbid to intrude no matter what may happen unless i summon they but in the morning liane when they regard this wreckage i be afraid they will think I a tempestuous lover they will find I a tempestuous mistress promise liane delorme when i question they about that open door xviii brother and sister the storm have pass off a ardent noonday sun be collaborate with a coquettish breeze to make gay the window awning of the chamber where lanyard in borrow pyjamas and dressing-gown of silk lay luxuriously bedded listen to the purr of wide-awake pari and with a excellent cigar to chew on ruminate upon the problematic issue of he latest turn of fortune and not in the least downhearted about it before turn in he have soak and steam most of the ache out of bone and muscle in the hottest water he flesh would suffer and six hour unbroken slumber have do wonder toward lessen the distress he exertion last night have occasion in the frail new tissue of he wound now fresh from a cold shower follow a second hot bath and further comfort by a petit déjeuner serve in bed he feel measurably sane again and sound in wind and limb as well bar a few deep bruise whose soreness would need several day to heal a pleasant languor like a light opiate infuse he consciousness yet he be by no means mentally inactive the morning papers be scatter over the counterpane lanyard have diligently scan all the story that tell of the identification of the murder man of the lyon rapide as the comte de lorgne and inasmuch as these be of one voice in praise the préfecture for that famous feat of detective work and not one line suggest that it do not deserve undivided credit lanyard have nothing to complain of there as for the montalai robbery it be not even mention the restricted size impose upon french newspaper by the paper shortage of those day crowd out of they column everything but news in true sense and there could be none of that in connection with the montalai affair until either andré duchemin have be arrest or the jewel recover from the real thief or thief and lanyard be human enough to be almost as willing to have the first happen as the last if it be not give to he to be the prime factor in they restoration for the time be -- if he must confess the truth -- he be actually rather enjoy himself rather exhilarate than otherwise by the swiftly shift scene and character of he unfold investigation and by the brisk sword-play of wit in which he be call upon constantly to engage both essential ingredient of the wine of life accord to the one recipe he know and then a review of recent event seem to warrant the belief that all thing consider he have thus far make fair progress toward he goal while it be true he do not as yet know what have become of the montalai jewel he have gather together a accumulation of evidence which however circumstantial and hypothetical established acceptably to he intelligence a number of interesting inference to wit : that dupont have not leave the neighborhood of the château de montalais after haunt it for upward of a month without definite knowledge that he would gain nothing by stay on or without a equally definite objective some motive more inspiring than such simple sensuousness as he might find in assassinate inoffensive folk indiscriminately that he attempt upon the life of liane delorme within twenty-four hour of the murder of de lorgnes indicate conviction on he part that the two be couple in some enterprise inimical to he personal interest that in spite of he mask of a stupid pig dumont be prove himself mentally as well as physically a adversary worthy of all respect and be -- what be worse -- still to be reckon with that as lanyard have suspect all along the monk party have be visit upon the château de montalais through no vagary of chance whatever but as part of a deliberate design whose ulterior motive have transpire only with the disappearance of the jewel -- to dupont 's vast but understandable vexation of spirit that the several member of the monk party have be work in entire accord as a close corporation in which case the person whom the comte de lorgne have expect to meet in lyon must have be monk phinuit or jule consequently that at least one of the three last name have be the actual perpetrator of the robbery and by the same token that liane have lie in assert that monk and retinue have sail for america nearly a week prior to its commission that liane herself have not so suddenly decide to leave france where she be after a fashion somebody and journey to america where she would be nobody except in stress of mortal fear lest the fate that have befall de lorgne befall she in turn -- as would surely have be the case last night but for lanyard that she must therefore have have a tolerably accurate knowledge either of dupont 's identity or of the opposition interest which that one so ably represent and thus be better inform than poor de lorgne to whom dupont have be unknown which argue that liane 's rôle in the intrigue be that of a principal whereas de lorgnes have figure only as a subordinate that even if the woman do mean well toward lanyard she be bind by stronger tie to other whom she must consider first and who be hardly likely to prove so well disposed that she protestation of friendship and gratitude must be value accordingly sum up lanyard tell himself he could hardly be say to have let grass grow under he foot since leave château de montalais now he find himself with a solitary care to nurse the question : what have she pillow advise liane delorme he be go to be exceedingly interested to learn what she in the maturity of she judgement have decide to do about this man who ingenuously suggest that she requite he for save she life by help he recover the montalai jewel on the other hand since lanyard have quite decide what he mean to do about liane in any event she decision really do not matter much and he refuse to fret himself try to forecast it whatever it might turn out to be it would find he prepare he could not be surprise there lanyard be wrong liane be amply able to surprise he and do ultimately he feel constrain to concede a touch to genius in the woman she method be she own and never poor in boldness and imagination it be without ceremony that she walk in on he at length have keep he wait so long that he have begin to wonder if she mean to try on anything as crude as abandon he and post off to cherbourg without a word to seek fancied immunity in new york while he remain in a empty house without money papers of identification or even fit clothing for the street for on come out of he bath lanyard have find all of these thing miss the valet de chambre presumably have make off with he evening clothes to have they press and repair liane be dress for travel becomingly if with a sobriety that go oddly with she cultivate beauté du diable and wear besides a habit of preoccupation which one be leave to assume excuse the informality of she unannounced entrance well my dear friend she say gravely halting by the bedside it be about time lanyard retort i be afraid you might be grow impatient she confess i have have so much to do no doubt but if you have neglect I much longer i should have come to look for you regardless of consequence how be that she enquire with knit brow -- regardless of what consequence any damage one might do to the morale of you ménage by toddle about in the voluptuous déshabillé in which you behold I -- my sole present apology for a wardrobe she find only the shadow of a smile for such frivolity i have send for clothing for you she say absently it should be here any minute now we only wait for that you mean you have send to the chatham for my thing but certainly not monsieur liane delorme lie without perceptible effort that would have be too injudicious it appear you be not mistake in think you be recognize as andré duchemin last night agent of the préfecture have be all day watch at the chatham await you return how sad for they in as much as he have every reason to believe this to be outright falsehood lanyard do not feel call upon to seem downcast but if my clothing there be unavailable i hardly see but naturally i have commission a person of good judgement to outfit you from the shop you dress clothes -- which seem to suit you very well last night -- give we you measurement the rest be simplicity my order be to get you everything you could possibly require it be awfully sport of you lanyard insist although it make one feel -- you know -- not quite respectable however if you will be so gracious as to suggest that you valet de chambre return my pocketbook and passport i have they here the woman turn over the miss article but she demand with a interest which be undissembled if tardy in finding expression how be you feel to-day oh quite fit thank you in good spirit i know but that wound -- lanyard choose to make more of that than it deserve one could not tell when a interesting disability might prove useful i have to be a bit careful he confess cover the seat of injury with a tender hand but it be nothing like so troublesome as it be last night i be glad you feel able to travel travel lanyard make a face of dismay but one be so delightfully at ease here and since the prefecture can not possibly suspect be you then in such haste to be rid of I liane not at all it be my wish and intention to accompany you well let we trust the world will be broad-minded about it and -- pardon my not rise -- will not you sit down and tell I what it be all about i have so little time so many thing to attend to nevertheless liane find herself a chair and accept a cigarette do one infer that we start on we travels to-day within the hour in fact as soon as you be decently clothe and where do we go mademoiselle to cherbourg there to take steamer for new york fortunately it be lanyard 's cue to register shock it would have cost he something to have keep secret he stupefaction he sink back upon he pillow and waggle feeble hand while he respect for liane grow by bound she have succeed in startling and mystifying he beyond expression what dodge be this that cloak itself in such anomalous semblance of good faith she have not know he be acquaint with she plan to leave france he have discount a hundred device to keep it from he knowledge and now she not only confess it openly but invite he to go with she in the name of unreason -- why she know for he have own he possess purpose he do not for a instant believe liane delorme would fly france and leave behind the montalai jewel do she think he do not suspect she of know more about they than she have choose to admit do she imagine that he be one of those who can see only that which be in the distance do she do he the injustice to believe he incapable of actually smell out the jewel if ever he get within range of they but conjecture be too idle liane be too deep for he she intent would declare itself when she will it not before unless he could lull she into a false sense of faith in he trick she into betray herself by inadvertence but my dear friend why america you recall ask I to help you last night do i not promise to do what i could well i be not one to forget my promise i know something monsieur i believe you do you give I credit for have some little influence in this world of pari i have use it what i have learn -- i shall not tell you how specifically -- enable I to assure you that the montalai jewel be on they way to america and i be to believe you make this journey to help I regain they what do you think then i do not know what to think mademoiselle i be overwhelm -- abashed and humble by contemplation of such generosity you see you do not know I monsieur but you shall know I better before we be finish one do not question that nor do one but if i be to sail for america to-day -- to-morrow from cherbourg at eight in the morning well to-morrow then : but how be i to get my passport vise i have see to that if you will look over you papers monsieur you will see that you be no longer paul martin alia andré duchemin but paul delorme my invalid brother still suffer from honorable wound sustain in the great war and order abroad for he health to this lanyard hastily verify she statement by run a eye through the passport find nothing more appropriate than a wonder mon dieu so you see everything be arrange what have you to say only that mademoiselle sweep one off one 's foot do you complain about that you no longer doubt my devotion my gratitude do not believe I capable of such stupidity that be very well then now i must run liane delorme throw away she cigarette and rise i have a thousand thing to do and you understand we leave as soon as you be dress perfectly by what train by no train do not

shall see if i survive have no fear my chauffeur drive superbly she be at the door when lanyard stay she with one moment liane with finger rest lightly on the knob she turn speak english he request briefly what about dupont simple mention of the man be enough to make the woman wince and lose color before she reply lanyard see the tip of she tongue furtively moisten she lip well and what of he do you imagine he have have enough who know i for one shall feel safe from he only when i know he be in the santé or he grave suppose he try to follow we to cherbourg or to stop we on the way how should

notice wait who else marthe my maid you have confidence in she loyalty implicit she have be with I for year lanyard say open that door in a tone sharp with such authority that liane delorme instinctively obey and the woman whom lanyard have see that morning come down the stair with the light candle enter rather precipitately carry over one arm a evening wrap of gold brocade and fur pardon madame she murmur and pause aside from the awkwardness of she entrance she betray no confusion i be about to knock and ask if madame wish I to pack this you know very well i shall need it liane say ominously a look from lanyard check a tirade or more exactly compress it into a single word : imbécile yes madame marthe hint at rather than execute a courtesy and withdraw liane shut the door behind she and reapproach the bed tremble with a anger that render she forgetful so that she relapse into french you think she be listen english please to this lanyard add a slight shrug it be hard to

we may feel sure the tour car will get off lightly for whether they be involve with dupont or not leon and marthe be small fry not the fish he be angle for but will not leon and marthe suspect and refuse to follow perhaps they may suspect but they will follow out of curiosity to see how we fare if for nothing else you may lose a limousine but you can afford to risk that as long as you be not in it -- eh little long-lost sister my dear brother liane cry deeply move she lean forward and caress lanyard 's hand with sisterly warmth in she admiration and gratification loosing upon he the full candle-power of the violet eye in they most disastrous smile what a head to have in the family take care lanyard admonish i admit it be not half bad at time but if this battered old headpiece of mine be to be of any further service to we liane you must be careful not to turn it xix six bottle of champagne once decide upon a course of action liane delorme demonstrate that she could move with energy and decision uncommon in she kind under she masterly supervision preparation accomplish themselves as it be by magic it be for example nearer three than four o'clock when the expedition for cherbourg leave the door of she town-house and pari by way of the porte de neuilly the limousine lead with that polished pattern of a chauffeur jule at its wheel as spick and span firm of jaw and imperturbable of eye as when lanyard have first notice he in nant the tour car trail with the footman leon as driver and not at all happy to find himself draft in that capacity if one might judge by a sullen sort of uneasiness in he look nothing be to be expect in the street or suburb neither speed nor any indication of the intention -lrb- if any -rrb- of dupont lanyard spare himself the thankless trouble of watch to see if they be follow -- have little doubt they be -- and take he ease by the side of liane delorme chatting of old time or sit in grateful silence when liane relapse into abstraction -- something which she do with a frequency which testify to the heavy pressure of she thought -- he keep a appreciative eye on jule concede at length that liane 's adjective superb have be fitly apply to he drive so long as he remain at the wheel they be not only in safe hand but might be sure of lose nothing on the road it be in st germain-en-laye that lanyard first notice the gray touring car but for mental selection of st germain as the likeliest spot for dupont to lay in wait and thanks also to a error of judgment on the part of that one he must have miss it for there be nothing strikingly sinister in the aspect of that long-bodied gray car with the capacious hood betoken a motor of great power but it stand incongruously round the corner in a mean side street as if anxious to escape observation its juxtaposition to the door of a wine shop of the lowest class be noticeable in a car of such high caste and what be finally damn the rat-faced man of lyon be lounge in the door of the wine shop suck at a cigarette and watch the traffic with a all too listless eye shaded by the visor of a shabby cap lanyard say nothing at the time but later when a long stretch of straight road give he the chance verify he suspicion by look back to see the gray car lurk not less than a mile and a half astern the delorme touring car drive by leon keep a quarter of a mile in the rear of the limousine these relative position remain approximately unchanged during most of the light hour of that long evening despite the terrific pace which jule set in the open country lanyard keep a eye on the indicator see its hand register the equivalent of sixty english mile a hour more frequently than not it seldom drop below fifty except when pass through town or village and more often than he like lanyard watch it creep up to and past the mark seventy with such drive he be quite willing to believe that they would see cherbourg or heaven by midnight if not before always of course provide for the first three hour leon stand the pace well then nerve or physical endurance begin to fail he drop back and the delorme touring car be thereafter seldom visible no more for that matter be the gray shadow lanyard 's forecast seem to be bear out by its conduct : dupont be bide he time and would undoubtedly attempt nothing before nightfall in the meantime he be make no effort to do more than keep step with the limousine but at a decent distance only occasionally when for this reason or that jule be oblige to run at reduce speed for several minute on end the gray car would draw into sight always however about a mile behind the delorme touring car at about seven they dine on the wing from the hamper which with liane 's jewel case in its leather disguise of a simple travel bag constitute all the limousine 's load of luggage lanyard pass sandwich through the front window to jule who munch they while drive like a speed maniac and with the same appalling nonchalance wash they down with a tumbler of champagne then he discover some manner of sorcerous power over match in the wind light a cigarette and signalise he sense of refreshment by smoothly edge the indicator needle up toward the eighty notch where he hold it stationary until lanyard and liane with one accord beg he to consider they appetite at eight o'clock they be pass through lisieux one hundred and eighteen mile from pari lanyard make mental calculation the light will hold till after nine he inform liane by that time we shall have leave caen behind i understand she say coolly it will be then after caen presumably another hour of peace of mind she yawn delicately i think -- i be bore by this speed -- i think i shall have a nap composedly she arrange pillow put she pretty foot upon the jewel case and turn she face from lanyard doze i think he reflect that the world be more rich in remarkable woman than in remarkable man a luminous lilac twilight vie with the street lamp of caen when the limousine roll through the city at moderate speed lanyard utilize this occasion to confer with jule through the window beyond the town he say you will stop just round the first suitable turn so that we can not be see before the corner be turn draw off to the side of the road and -- i think it would be advisable to have a little engine trouble very good sir say jule without look round then he add in a voice of complete respect : pardon sir but -- madame 's order if they be not -- lanyard be nettle -- she will countermand they quite so sir and -- if you do not mind my ask -- what be the idea i presume you set some value on you skin plumb crazy about it mademoiselle delorme and i be afflict with the same idiosyncrasy we want to save we life and we do not mind save yours at the same time that be more than fair with I but be that all i be to know if the information be any comfort to you : in a gray car which have be follow we ever since we leave st germain be the man who -- i believe -- murder monsieur le comte de lorgnes on the lyon rapide and who -- i know -- try last night to murder mademoiselle delorme and i suppose that in he big-hearted wholesaler 's way he would not mind make a bag of the lot of we tonight i be afraid you have reason if you be plan to put a crimp in he ambition sir i have get a pistol i know how to use better have it handy though i do not think we 'll need it yet we present plan be merely to change car with leon and marthe the gray car will pass and go on ahead before we make the shift then you mademoiselle and i follow in the tour car the other in the limousine if there be a trap as we have every reason to anticipate there will the tour car will get through -- or we 'll hope so ah-h jule use the tone of one who perceive enlightenment as a blinding flash marthe and leon be in on the dirty work too eh what make you think that put two and two together -- what you have just tell I with what i have be notice and wonder about then you think those two -- marthe and leon jule pronounce with deliberation be two very bad egg if you ask I i sha not shed a solitary tear if something sad happen to they in this ` bus to-night there be no time then to delve into he reason for this statement of feel the outskirts of caen be drop behind providentially the first bend in the road to bayeux afford good cover on the side toward the town jule shut off the power as he make the turn and brake to a dead stop in lee of a row of outhouse lanyard be on the ground as soon as the wheel cease to turn jule almost as quickly now for you engine trouble lanyard instruct nothing serious you understand -- simply a adjustment to excuse a few minute ' delay and lend color to we impatience get you the first time jule reply unlatch and raise one wing of the hood lanyard move toward the middle of the road and flag the delorme touring car as it round the turn a few seconds later at such speed that leon be put to it to stop the car fifty yard beyond the limousine the man jump down and follow by the maid run back but before he reach the limousine be oblige to jump aside to escape the gray car which tool by a crack race hand take the corner on two wheel then straighten out and tear past in a smother of dust with its muffler cut out and the exhaust bellow like a machine-gun lanyard count four figure two on the front seat two in the tonneau more than this the headlong speed and the fail light render it impossible to see -- though have the one be less and the other stronger he could have gain little more information from inspection of those four shape shroud in dust coat and mask with goggles watch its rear light dwindle he fancy that the gray shadow be slow down but one could not be sure about that there be something wrong monsieur the man leon be at he elbow lanyard reply with the curt nod of a disgruntled motorist something -- jule can tell you he say shortly meanwhile mademoiselle delorme and i have decide not to wait we have get no time to spare we will take you car and go on but monsieur i -- leon begin to expostulate the icy accent of liane delorme cut it : well leon : what be you objection objection madame the fellow falter pardon -- but it be not for I to object i -- i be merely startle then get over that at once he be advise and bring my jewelcase -- marthe will point it out to you -- to the touring-car yes madame immediately also the lunch-hamper if you please assuredly monsieur leon depart hastily for the limousine where marthe join he while lanyard and liane delorme proceed to the touring car but what on earth do you want with that hamper monsieur hush little sister not so loud brother think he have another idea then heaven forbid that i should interfere stagger under its weight leon shoulder the jewelcase and carry it to the touring car where liane superintend its disposal in the luggage-jammed tonneau a second trip less laborious bring they the hamper liane utter perfunctory thanks and call to jule who be still tinker at the limousine engine with the aid of a electric torch come jule leave leon to attend to what be require there very good madame jules stroll over to the touring car and settle down at the wheel liane delorme have the seat beside he lanyard have establish himself in a debatable space in the tonneau to which he right be dispute by bag and box of every shape size and description how long jule will leon need -- five minute madame if he take he time about it then let we hasten they draw away from the limousine so quickly that in thirty seconds its headlight be all that mark its stand lanyard study the phosphorescent dial of he wristwatch from first to last the transaction have consume little more than three minute liane slew round to talk over the back of the seat what time be it monsieur ten after nine in a hour precisely the moon will rise it will be in this hour of darkness then a bend in the road blot out the stationary light of the limousine there be no tail-light visible on the road before they lanyard touch jule on the shoulder switch off you light he say -- all of they then find a place where we can turn off and wait till leon and marthe pass we in sudden blindness the car move on slowly grope its way for a few hundred yard then jule pick out the mouth of a narrow lane overshadow by dense foliage run past stop and back into it in four minute by lanyard 's watch the pulse of the limousine begin to beat upon the stillness of that sleepy countryside a blue-white glare like naked and hungry steel leap quiver past the bend sweep in a wide arc as the lamp themselves become visible and lay horizontal with the road as the car bore past evidently leon feel quite lose without we lanyard comment shoot jule -- follow he rear lamp and _ do not _ cut out you muffler can you manage without headlight for a while i drive a ambulance for four year sir the car swing out into the main highway far ahead the red sardonic eye in the rear of the limousine leer as if mock they hope of keep it in sight jule however prove unresentful and he be marvellously competent to anybody who be ever pilot a load of casualty through eighteen inch of mud dodge shell hole and shell on they way to make new hole in a black rainstorm at midnight -- this sort of thing jule announce -- a hard smooth road under a clear sky -- be simple pie so it may have seem to he but to lanyard and liane delorme hurl along a road they could not see at anywhere from forty to sixty mile a hour with no manner of guidance other than a elusive tail-lamp which be forever whisk round corner and remain invisible till jule find he way round in turn by instinct or second sight or intuition -- whatever it be it prove unfailing -- it be a nervous time and there be half a hour of it they be swoop down a long grade with a sharp turn at the bottom as they know from the fact that the red eye have just wink out somewhere on ahead there sound a grind crash the noise of a stout fabric rent and crush with the clash and clatter of shivered glass easy lanyard caution -- and ready with the light both warning be superfluous jule have already disengage the gear gravity carry the car round the curve slowly smoothly silently under constraint of its brake it slide to a pause on a steep though brief descent and hang there like a animal poise to spring purr softly below at the foot of the hill the headlight of another car standing at some distance and to the right of the road furnish lurid illumination to the theater of disaster something its nature just then mysterious have apparently cause leon to lose control of the heavy car so that it have skid into a ditch and capsize four man crude shape of nightmare in envelop dust-coat and disfigure goggles be swarm round the wreck two be help the driver out two other have they gallantry in perform like service for the maid reward by a torrent of vituperative denunciation half hysterical and wholly infuriate by the freedom of she gesture which be rival only by that of she language the dishevelled storm figure of marthe be manifestly uninjured and in another moment it be see as leon find he foot and limp toward the other that he have suffer only slight damage at the worst lanyard draw attention to a dark serpentine line that lay like a dead snake upon the light surface of the road jule grunt in token of comprehension liane delorme breathlessly demand : what be it a old trick lanyard explain : a wire cable stretch between tree diagonally across the road about as high as the middle of the windshield the impetus of the limousine break it but not before it have slew the car off toward the ditch wrenching the wheel out of the driver 's hand he fondle the pistol which jule have hand he slip the safety catch and say : now before they wake up jule -- give she all she be get jule release the brake and as the car gather way noiselessly slip the gear shift into the fourth speed and bear heavily on the accelerator they be make forty mile a hour when they strike the level and thunder past the group a glimpse of startled face the scream of a man who have stray incautiously into the roadway and stop there apparently petrified by the peril that bear down upon he without light or any other warning until one of the forward fender strike and hurl he aside like a straw -- and only the night of the open road lay before they jule touch the headlight switch and open the exhaust above the roaring of the latter lanyard fancy he could hear a faint rattle sound he look back and smile grimly sharp short flame of orange and scarlet be stab the darkness somebody have open fire with a automatic pistol sheer waste of ammunition the pace wax terrific on a road like so many road of france apparently interminable and straight on either hand endless rank of poplar rattle like loose paling of some tremendous picket fence and yet long before the road turn lanyard stare astern as he kneel on the rear seat with arm cross on the fold top see the two white eye of the gray car swing into view and start in pursuit quick work he call it he crawl forward and communicate he news shout to make himself hear do not ease up unless you have to he counsel do not think we dare give they a inch back at he post of observation he watch hope against hope while the car lunge and tear like a mad thing through the night snore up grade scream down they drum across the level clatter wildly through village and hamlet while the moon rise and gather strength and make the road a streaming river of milk and ink while he heart sink as minute succeed minute mile follow mile and ever the light of the pursue car lose to sight from time to time reappear with a brighter fiercer glow and conviction force itself home that they be be gradually but surely overhaul he take this intelligence to the ear of jule the chauffeur answer only with a worried shake of he head that say too plainly he be do he best extract every ounce of power from the engine ill luck ambush they in the street of a sizable town its name unknown to lanyard where another car drive inexpertly roll out of a side street and stall in they path the emergency brake save they a collision but there be not six inch between the two when the touring car stop dead and minute be lose before the other get under way and they be able to proceed less than three hundred yard separate pursued and pursuer as they race out through open field once more and foot by foot this lead be be inexorably cut down in the seat beside the driver of the gray car a man rise and steadying himself by hold onto the windshield pour out the contents of a automatic presumably hope to puncture the tire of the quarry a bullet bore a neat hole through the windshield between the head of liane delorme and jule the woman slip down upon the floor and jule crouch over the wheel lanyard finger he automatic but hold its fire against a moment when he could be more sure of he arm instead he turn to the lunch hamper and open it liane 's provision have be ample for a party thrice they number in the bottom of the basket lay six pint bottle of champagne four of they unopened lanyard take they to the rear seat -- and find the gray car have draw up to within fifty yard of its prey make a pace better than seventy mile per hour it would not dare swerve the first empty bottle break to one side the second squarely between the front wheel he grasp the first full bottle by the neck and feel that its weight promise more accuracy but duck before attempt to throw it as a volley of shot seek to discourage he at the first lull he rise and cast the bottle with the overhand action employ in grenade throw it crash fairly beneath the nearer forward wheel of the gray car but without effect other than to draw another volley in retaliation this he risk the emergency have grow too desperate for more paltering the lead have be abridge to thirty yard in two minute more it would be nothing the fourth bottle go wild but the fifth explode six inch in front of the offside wheel and its jagged fragment rip out the heart of the tire on the instant of the accompany blow-out the gray car shy like a frightened horse and swerve off the road hurtle headlong into a clump of tree the subsequent crash be like the detonation of a great bomb deep shadow mask that tragedy beneath the tree lanyard see the beam of the headlight lift and drill perpendicularly into the zenith before it be black out he turn and yell in the ear of jule : slow down take you time they have quit liane delorme rise from she cramped position on the floor and stare incredulously back along the empty moonlit road what have become of they lanyard offer a vague gesture try to climb a tree he reply wearily and drop back on the rear seat begin to worry the cork out of the last pint bottle of champagne he reckon he have earn a drink if anybody ever have xx the sybarite without disclaim any credit that be rightly he due for make the performance possible lanyard feel oblige to concede that liane 's delorme 's confidence have be well repose in the ability of jule to drive by the clock for when the touring car make on a quayside of cherbourg 's avant port what be for its passenger its last stop of the night the hour of eight bell be be sound aboard the countless vessel that shoulder one another in the twin basin of the commercial harbor or ride at anchor between its granite jetty and the distant bulwark of the digue nor be jule dispose to deny himself well-earned applause receive none immediately when he get down from he seat and indulge in one luxurious stretch i 'll disseminate the information to the terrestrial universe he volunteer that be travel and now that you have do so liane delorme suggest perhaps you will be good enough to let the steward know we be wait if the grin be impudent the salute she get in acknowledgment be perfection jule face about like a military automaton stride off briskly stop at some distance to light a cigarette and in effect fade out with the flame of the match lanyard do not try to keep track of he go commit as he stand to follow the lead of liane delorme to the end of this chapter of intrigue -lrb- and with he mind at ease as to monsieur dupont for the time be at least -rrb- he be largely indifferent to intervene development he have ask no question of liane and he knowledge of cherbourg be limit to a memory of pass through the place as a boy with a case-hardened criminal as guide and police at they heel but assume that liane have book passage for new york by a cunarder a white star or american line boat -- all three touch regularly at cherbourg west bind from southampton -- he expect presently to go aboard a tender and be ferry out to one of the steamer whose ride light be to be see in the roadstead meanwhile he be lazily content mellow voice of bell metal swell and die on the midnight air while lounge against the motor car -- with liane at he side register more impatience than he think the occasion call for -- lanyard listen stare wonder the breath of the sea sweet in he nostril its flavor in he throat he vision lose in the tangled web of mast and cordage and funnel that stencil the moon-pale sky : the witching glamour of salt water bind all he sens with its time-old spell it be quiet there upon the quay somewhere a winch rattle drowsily and weary tackle whine more near at hand funnel be snore and pump chug with a constant monotonous noise of splash on the landward side from wine shop across the way come blur gust of laughter and the wail of a accordeon the footfall of a watchman or perhaps a sergent de ville have lonely echo the high electric arc be motionless and the shadow cast by they steel-blue glare lay on the pave as if paint in lampblack dupont the road to pari seem figment of some dream dream long ago the tip of a pretty slipper tap restlessly continue to betray liane 's temper but she say nothing privately lanyard yawn then jule tag by three man with the fair white jacket and shuffling gait of steward saunter into view from behind two mountain of freight and announce : all ready madame liane nod curtly linger to watch the steward attack the jumble of luggage see she jewel case shoulder and follow the bearer lanyard at she elbow jule remain with the car the steward trot through wind aisle of bale and crate turn a corner dart up a gangplank to the main-deck of a small steam vessel so excessively neat and smart with shine brightwork that lanyard think it one uncommon tender indeed and surmise a martinet in command it seem curious that there be not more passenger on the tender 's deck but perhaps he and liane be among the first to come aboard after all they be not to sail before morning accord to the woman he apprehend a tedious time of wait before he gain he berth he notice too a life ring letter sybarite and think this a odd name for a vessel of commercial utility then he find himself descend a wide companionway to one of the handsomest saloon he have ever enter a living room that aside from its concession to marine architecture might have grace a residence on park lane or on fifth avenue in the sixty lanyard stop short with he hand on the mahogany handrail i say liane have not we stumble into the wrong pew wrong pew the woman subside gracefully into a cushion arm-chair cross she knee and smile at he perplexity but i do not know what be that ` wrong pew ' i mean to say this be no tender and it unquestionably be not a atlantic liner i should hope not do i promise you a -- what do you say -- tender or atlantic liner but no : i do not think i tell you what sort of vessel we would sail upon for that america you do not ask true little sister but you might have prepare I this be a private yacht be you disappointed i will not say that it be the little ship of a dear friend monsieur who generously permit but patience very soon you shall know to himself lanyard comment : i believe it well a door have open in the after partition two man have enter above a lank well-poised body clothe in the white tunic and trousers of a ship 's officer he recognize the tragicomic mask of the soi-disant mr whitaker monk at he shoulder shine the bland intelligent countenance of mr phinuit who seem much at home in the blue serge and white flannel of the average amateur yachtsman from this last lanyard receive a good-natured nod while monk with a great deal of empressement proceed directly to liane delorme and bow low over the hand which she languidly lift to be salute my dear friend he say in he sonorous voice in another hour i should have begin to grow anxious about you you would have have good reason monsieur it be not two hour since one have escape death -- and that for the second time in a single day -- by the slenderest margin and thanks solely to this gentleman here monk consent to see lanyard and immediately offer he a profound salute which be punctiliously return he eyebrow mount to the root of he hair ah that good monsieur duchemin but no liane laugh it be true the resemblance be striking i do not say that if paul would consent to grow a beard it would not be extraordinary but -- permit I captain monk to present my brother paul delorme you brother mademoiselle the educate eyebrow express any number of emotion monk 's hand be cordially extend but i be enchanted monsieur delorme to welcome on board the sybarite the brother of you charming sister lanyard resign limp finger to he clasp and most public-spirited of you i be sure captain monk i believe i understand liane to say captain monk the captain bow captain whitaker monk another bow lanyard look to liane : forgive I if i seem confused but i think you tell I mister whitaker monk have sail for america a week ago and so he do the captain agree blandly while liane confirm he statement with many rapid and emphatic nod mr monk the owner be my first cousin fortune have be less kind to I in a worldly way consequently you see in I merely the skipper of my wealthy kinsman 's yacht and you two name be the same -- yours and you cousin 's you be both whitaker monk it be a favorite name in we family monsieur lanyard wag he head in solemn admiration phinuit have come to he side and be offer he hand in turn it be all gospel mr lanyard he declare with a cheerful informality which lanyard find more engaging than monk 's sometimes labor mannerism he be sure-enough captain whitaker monk skipper of the good ship sybarite mister whitaker monk owner and my name be really phinuit and i be honest-to-goodness secretary to mr monk you see the owner get a hurry call from new york last week and sail from southampton leave we to bring he pretty ship safely home that make it all so clear well anyway i be glad to meet you to you bare face i have hear a lot about you and -- if it matter to you -- think a lot more if it come to that mr phinuit i have devote some think to you oh daresay and now -- if mademoiselle be agreeable -- suppose we adjourn to the skipper 's quarter where we can improve one another 's acquaintance without some snoop steward get a unwelcome earful we need to know many thing you alone can tell we -- and i 'll wager you could do with a drink what but i assure you monsieur i find you reception sufficiently refreshing well say phinuit momentarily but very slightly discountenance -- you have be uncommon ' damn ' useful you know i mean accord to mademoiselle useful lanyard enquire politely he call it that liane delorme exclaim when i tell he you have save my life she sweep indignantly through the door by which monk and phinuit have come to greet they two ceremonious bow induce lanyard to follow she monk and phinuit bring up the rear yes the woman pursue -- twice he have save it in the same place phinuit enquire innocently shut the door but no once in my home in pari this morning and again to-night on the road to cherbourg the last time he save he life too and jule 's it be nothing say the modest hero it be nothing liane echo tragically you save my life twice and he call it ` useful ' and you call it ` nothing ' my god i tell you i find this english a funny language but if you will tell we about it monk suggest place a chair for she at one end of a small table on which be spread a appetising cold supper lanyard remark that there be place lay for four he have be expect then or have the fourth place be mean for jule one incline to credit the first theory it seem highly probable that liane should have telegraph she intention before leave paris indeed there be every evidence that she have neither monk nor phinuit have betray the least surprise on see lanyard and phinuit have not even trouble to recognize the fiction which liane have utter in accounting for he it be very much as if he have say : that long-lost brother stuff be all very well for the authority for entry in the ship 's papers if necessary but it be waste between ourselves we understand one another so let 's get down to brass tack a encouraging symptom though one have already use the better word refreshing spacious furnished in a way of rich sobriety tasteful in every appointment the captain 's quarter be quite as sybaritic as the saloon of the sybarite a bedroom and private bath adjoin and the open door enable one to perceive that this rude old sea dog sleep in a real bed of massive brass he sitting-room or private office have a studious atmosphere its built-in-bookcase be stock with handsome binding the panel be like those in the saloon sea-scape from the hand of modern master : lanyard know good painting when he see it the captain 's desk be a substantial affair in mahogany most of the chair be of the overstuffed lounge sort the rug be a persian of rare lustre monk be follow with a twinkle the journey of lanyard 's observant eye do myself pretty well do not you think he observe quietly in a break in liane 's dramatic narrative perforce the lady must now and again pause for breath lanyard smile in return i can not see you have much to complain of the captain nod but permit a shade of gravity to become visible in he expression he sigh a philosophic sigh : but man be never satisfied liane have get she second wind and be play variation on the theme of the famous six bottle of champagne lanyard lounge in he easy chair and let he bored thought wander he be weary of be talk about want one thing only fulfillment of the promise that have be implicit in phinuit 's manner he be aware of phinuit 's sympathetic eye the woman send the gray car crash again into the tree repeat lanyard 's quaint report of the business and launch into a vein of panegyric regard he then sit there make nothing of it all -- sheer swank phinuit comment he be just let on privately he think he be a heluva fellow do not you lanyard but naturally lanyard give phinuit a grateful look that be understand but what really interest I at present be the question : who be dupont and why if you be ask I monk reply i 'll say -- go on mademoiselle 's story -- monsieur dupont be by now a ghost one would be glad to be sure of that lanyard murmur by all account say phinuit he take a deal of killing but all this beg my question lanyard object who be dupont and why i think i can answer that question monsieur this be liane delorme but first i would ask captain monk to set guard to see that nobody come aboard this ship before she sail pity you do not think of that sooner phinuit observe in friendly sarcasm better late than never of course but still -- the woman appeal to monk directly since he do not move but i assure you monsieur i be afraid i be terrify of that one i shall not sleep until i be sure he have not succeed in smuggling himself on board -- be tranquil mademoiselle monk beg what you ask be already do i give the order you ask as soon as i receive you telegram this morning you need not fear that even a rat have find he way aboard since then or can before we sail without my knowledge thank god liane breathe -- and instantly find a new question to fret about but you man captain monk -- you officer and crew -- can you be sure of they absolutely you have not sign on any new man here in cherbourg lanyard ask monk work he eyebrow to signify that the question be ridiculous no such fool thanks he add yet they may have be corrupt while here in port liane insist no fear that be what i would have say of my maid and footman twenty-four hour ago yet i now know better i tell you only what i know mademoiselle if any of my officer and crew have be tamper with i do not know anything about it and can not and will not until the truth come out and you sit there calmly to tell I that liane roll she lovely eye in appeal to the deck beam overhead but you be impossible but my dear lady monk protest i be perfectly willing to go into hysteric if you think it will do any good as it happen i do not i have not be idle or fatuous in that matter i have take every possible precaution against miscarriage of we plan if anything go wrong now it can not be charge to my discredit it will be a act of god phinuit declare : one of the unavoidable risk of the business the business liane echo with scorn i assure you i wish i be well out of ` the business ' and so say we all of we phinuit assure she patiently and monk intone a fervent aman but who be dupont lanyard reiterate stubbornly a apache monsieur liane respond sulkily -- a leader of apach thank you for nothing patience : i be tell you all i know i recognize he this morning when you be struggle with he he name be popinot ah why do you say ` ah ' monsieur there be a popinot in paris in my day they nickname he the prince of the apach but he be a older man and die by the guillotine this popinot who call himself dupont then must be he son that be true monsieur well then if he have inherit he father 's power -- it be not so bad as all that i have hear that the elder popinot be a true prince in he way i mean as to he power with the apach he son be hardly that he have a follow but new power be establish with he father 's death and they remain stronger than he all of which bring we to the second part of my question liane : why dupont liane shrug and study she bedizened finger the heavy black brow circumflex monk 's eye and he draw down the corner of he wide mouth phinuit fix a amuse gaze on a distant corner of the room and chew he cigar why do dupont -- or popinot lanyard persist -- murder de lorgne why do he try to murder mademoiselle delorme why do he seek to prevent we reach cherbourg give you three guess phinuit offer amiably but i warn you if you use more than one you 'll forfeit my respect forever and just to show what a good sport i be i 'll ask you a few lead question why do popinot pull off that little affair at montpellier-le-vieux why do he try to put you out of he way a few day later because he want to steal the jewel of madame de montalais naturally i know you would guess it you admit then you have the jewel why not phinuit enquire coolly we take trouble enough to get they do not you think you be take trouble enough to get they away from we be not you you do not want we to think you so stupid as to be waste you time do you he imperturbable effrontery be so amusing that lanyard laugh outright then turn to liane he offer she a grateful inclination of the head mademoiselle you have keep you promise many thanks hello cry phinuit what promise monsieur lanyard desire a favor of I liane explain she good humor restore in return for save I from assassination by popinot this morning he beg I to help he find the jewel of madame de montalais it appear that he -- or andre duchemin -- be accuse of have steal those jewel so it become a point of honor with he to find and restore they to madame de montalais he tell you that monk query studiously eliminate from he tone the jeer imply by the word alone but surely and what could i do he speak so earnestly i be touch regard moreover how deeply i be indebted to he so i promise i would do my best et voila i have bring he to the jewel the rest be -- how do you say -- up to he be you satisfy with the way i keep my word monsieur it be hard to see how he can have any kick come phinuit comment with some acidity lanyard address himself to liane : do i understand the jewel be on this vessel in this room lanyard sit up and take intelligent notice of the room phinuit chuckle and consult monk in the tone of one reasonable man to he peer i say skipper : do not you think we ought to be liberal with monsieur lanyard he be a awfully good sort -- and look ' t all the service he have do we monk set the eyebrow to consider the proposition i be emphatically of you mind phin he pronounce at length oracular it be plain to be see he want those jewel -- mean to have 'em do you know any way we can keep they from he monk move he head slowly from side to side : none then you agree with I it would save we all a heap of trouble to let he have they without any more stall by way of answer monk bent over and quietly open a false door make to resemble the front of three drawer in a pedestal of he desk lanyard could not see the face of the built-in safe but he could hear the spin of the combination manipulate by monk 's long and bony finger and presently he see monk straighten up with a sizable steel dispatch-box in he hand place this upon the desk and unlock it with a key on he pocket ring there he announce with a easy gesture lanyard rise and stand over the desk investigate the contents of the dispatch-box the collection of magnificent stone seem to tally accurately with he mental memorandum of the description furnish by eve de montalais this seem to be right he say quietly and close the box the automatic lock snap fast now what do you say brother dear you debt to I be fully discharge liane but messieur one question : know i be determine to restore these jewel to they owner why this open handedness card on the table say phinuit it be the only way to deal with the likes of you in other word monk interpret : you have under you hand proof of we bona fide and what be to prevent I from go ashore with these at once nothing say phinuit but this be too much nothing phinuit elaborate but you own good sense ah say lanyard -- ah -- and look from face to face monk adjust he eyebrow to a angle of earnestness and sincerity the difficulty be mr lanyard he say persuasively they have cost we so much those jewel in time and money and exertion we can hardly be expect to sit still and see you walk off with they and say never a word in protection of we own interest therefore i must warn you in the most friendly spirit : if you succeed in make you escape from the sybarite with the jewel as you quite possibly may it will be my duty as a law-abiding man to inform the police that andré duchemin be at large with he loot from the château de montalais and i do not think you would get very far then or that you fantastic story about mean to return they would gain much credence d'ye see but distinctly if however i leave the jewel and lay a information against you with the police -- to do that you would have to go ashore do i understand i be to consider myself you prisoner oh dear no say captain monk inexpressibly pained by such crudity but i do wish you would consider favourably a invitation to be we honor guest on the voyage to new york you will not it would be so agreeable of you sorry i must decline a prior engagement but you see lanyard phinuit urge earnestly we have take no end of a fancy to you we like you really for yourself alone and with that feel the outgrowth of we very abbreviated acquaintance -- think what a friendship might come of a real opportunity to get to know one another well some other time monsieur but please phinuit persist -- just think for one moment -- and do forget that pistol i know you have get in a handy pocket we be all unarmed here mademoiselle delorme the skipper and i we can not stop you go if you insist and we know too much to try but there be those aboard who might jule for instance : if he see you make a getaway and know it might mean a term in a french prison for he and if i do say it as should not of my kid brother jule be a dead shot then there be other there would surely be a scrimmage on the deck and how could we explain that to the police who i be able to assure you from personal observation be within hail why that you have be catch try to stow away with you loot which you drop in make you escape d'ye see how bad it would look for you to this there be no immediate response sit with bow head and sombre eye lanyard think the matter over a little indifferent to the look of triumph be exchange above he head obviously it would seem you have not go to all this trouble -- lure I aboard this yacht -- merely to amuse yourselve at my expense and then knock I on the head absurd liane declare indignantly as if i would permit such a thing who owe you so much or look at it this way monsieur monk put in with a courtly gesture : when one have a adversary whom one respect one wisely prefer to have he where one can watch he that be just it phinuit amend : out of we sight you would be on we nerve forever pull the popinot stunt spring some dirty surprise on we but here as we guest -- more than that say liane with she most kill glance for lanyard : a dear friend but lanyard be not to be put off by fair word and flattery no he say gravely : but there be some deeper motive he seek phinuit 's eye and phinuit unexpectedly give he a open-faced return there be he state frankly then why not tell I -- all in good time and there 'll be plenty of that the sybarite be no mauretanium when you know we better and have learn to like we i make no promise we ask none only you pistol well monsieur : my pistol it make we association seem so formal -- do not you think -- so constrain come mr lanyard be reasonable what be a pistol between friend lanyard shrug sigh and produce the weapon really he say hand it over to monk -- how could anyone resist such disarm expression the captain thank he solemnly and put the weapon away in he safe together with the steel despatch-box and liane delorme 's personal treasure of precious stone xxi sounding with characteristic abruptness liane delorme announce that she be sleepy it have be for she a most fatiguing day captain monk ring for the stewardess and gallantly escort the lady to she door lanyard get up with phinuit to bow she out but instead of follow she suit help himself to a long whiskey and soda with loving deliberation select trim and light a cigar and settle down into he chair as one prepare to make a night of it you never sleep no phinuit enquire in a spirit of civil solicitude desolate if i discommode you monsieur lanyard reply with entire amiability -- but not to-night not at least until i know those jewel have no more chance to go ashore without I he taste he drink with open relish prime scotch he judge one grow momentarily more reconcile to the prospect of a long voyage make the most of it phinuit counsel remember we next port of call be the great american desert after all the despise camel seem to have have the right idea all along he gape enormously behind a superstitious hand monk return publish a elaborate if silent superciliary comment on the tableau he have no faith at all in we good intention phinuit explain eye lanyard with mild reproach it be most discouraging monsieur suffer from insomnia monk ask in he turn under certain circumstance ever take anything for it to-night it would require nothing less than possession of the montalai jewel to put I to sleep well if you manage to lay hand on they without we consent phinuit promise genially you 'll be put to sleep all right but do not let I keep you up monsieur captain monk consult the chronometer it be not worth while turn in he say : we sail soon after day-break far be it from I to play the giddy crab then phinuit busy himself with the decanter glass and siphon let 's make it a regular party we 'll have all to-morrow to sleep it off in if i try to hop on you shoulder and sing call a steward and have he lead I to my innocent white cot but take a fool 's advice lanyard and do not try to drink the skipper under the table on the word of one who be try and repent it can not be do but it be i who would go under the table lanyard say i have a poor head for whiskey thanks for the tip pardon i mean to say phinuit explain i be glad to have another weakness of yours to bear in mind you be interested in the weakness of other monsieur they be my hobby knowledge monk quote sententious be power may i ask what other entry you have make in my dossier mr phinuit you will not get shirty but surely not well can not be positive till i know you better i be afraid you have get a tendency to overestimate the gullibility of people in general it be either that or no : i do not believe you be intentionally hypocritical or self-deceived either but i do not understand remember you promise but you seem to think it easy to put it over on we mademoiselle the skipper and I but i assure you i have never have any such thought then why this funny story of yours -- tell with a straight face too -- about want to get hold of the montalai loot simply to slip it back to its owner lanyard feel with a spasm of anger constrict he throat and know that the restraint he impose upon he temper be betray in a reddened face nevertheless he courteous smile persist he polite conversational tone be unchanged now you remind I of something i presume captain monk it be not too late to send a note ashore to be post oh monk 's eyebrow protest violently -- a note on plain paper in a plain envelope -- and i do not in the least mind you reading it the eyebrow appeal to phinuit and that worthy rule : under those condition i do not see we can possibly object monk shrug he brow back into place find paper of the sort desire even go so far as to dip the pen for lanyard you will sit at my desk monsieur many thanks under no more head than the date lanyard write : dear madame de montalais : i have not forget my promise but my day have be full since i leave the château and even now i must be brief : within a hour i sail for america within a fortnight you may look for telegraphic advice from I state that you jewel be in my possession and when i hope to be able to restore they to you believe I dear madame devotedly you servant michael lanyard monk read and in silence pass this communication over to phinuit while lanyard address the envelope quite in order be phinuit 's verdict accompany by a yawn lanyard fold the note seal it in the envelope and affix a stamp supply by monk who meanwhile ring for a steward take this ashore and post it at once he tell the man who answer he summons but seriously lanyard phinuit protest with a pained expression no : i do not get you at all what be the use i have not deceive you then not so 's you would notice it alas -- lanyard affect a sigh -- for misspend effort oh all 's fair outside the law we do not blame you for try it on only we value you respect too much to let you go on think we have fall for that hokum you see monk expound -- solemn ass that he be beneath he thin veneer of pretentiousness -- when we know how the british government kick you out of its secret service as soon as it have no further use for you we can understand and sympathise with you natural reaction to such treatment at the hand of society but one do not know you know so much monsieur le capitaine and then say phinuit when we know you steer a direct course from london for the château de montalais and make yourself persona grata there -- oh persona very much grata if i be any judge -- you can hardly ask we to believe you do not mean to do it it all just happen so monsieur see too clearly why if it come to that -- what be you up to that night pussyfoot about the château at two in the morning but this be positively uncanny monsieur know everything why should not i know about that vanity ring in phinuit 's self-conscious chuckle who would you think lay you out that night monsieur be not tell I -- i guess i owe you a apology phinuit admit but you 'll admit that in we situation there be nothing else for it i would have give anything if we would be able to get by any other way but you be such a unexpected customer well when i feel you catch hold of my shirt sleeve that night i think we be do for and strike out blindly it be a lucky blow no credit to I hope i do not jar you too much no say lanyard reflective -- no i be quite all right in the morning but i think i owe you one afraid you do and it be go to be my duty and pleasure to cheat you out of you revenge if fast footwork will do it but where be captain monk all the while right here monk answer for himself sit tight and say nothing and duly grateful that the blue print and specification of the great architect do not design I for second-storey work then it be jule -- no jule do not know enough it be de lorgne of course i think you would guess that how should i do not you know he be the premier cracksman of france that be go on mademoiselle delorme 's account of he she say there be never anybody like that poor devil for put the comether on a safe -- bar yourself monsieur le loup seul in you palmy day and she ought to know those two have be work together since the lord know when a sound conservative bird de lorgne very discreet tight-mouthed even when drunk -- which be too often but -- this be most interesting -- how do you get separate you and de lorgne bad luck a black night and -- i guess there be no more question about this -- you friend popinot-dupont i 'll say this for that blighter : as a self-made spoil-sport he sure do give service phinuit give he whiskey and soda a reminiscent grin and we think we be be bright at that we would figure every move to the third decimal point the only uncertain factor in we calculation as we think be you but with you dispose of dead to the world and madame de montalais off in another part of the château call the servant to help leave she room wide open to we -- the job do not take five minute the way de lorgne make that safe give up all its secret you would have think he have raise it by hand we stuff the loot into a grip i would bring for the purpose and beat it -- slip out through the drawing-room window one second before madame de montalais come back with that doddering footman of hers but they never even look we way i bet they never know there would be a robbery till the next morning do i lose no monsieur you be quite right well then : we have leave we machine -- we have drive over from millau -- just over the brow of the hill standing on the down-grade head for nant with the gear mesh in third so she would start without a sound as soon as we release the emergency brake but when we get there it be not the frantic way we look for it make I think of you paw that table for you candle after de lorgnes have lift it behind you back and then of a sudden they jump we popinot and he crew though we do not know who in hell it might have be the château people in fact at first i think it be i lose de lorgnes in the shuffle immediately never do know what have become of he till we get liane 's wire this morning i be have all i could do to take care of myself thank you i happen to be carry the grip and that help a bit somebody 's head get in the way of its swing and i guess the guy have not forget it yet then i slip through they finger -- i 'll never tell you how it be black as pitch that night -- and beat it blind i would lose my flashlamp and have no more idea where i be head than a owl at noon of a sunny day but they -- the popinot outfit -- seem to be able to see in the dark all right or else i be looney with fright every once in a while somebody or something would make a pass at I in the night and i would duck and double and run another way after a while i find myself climb a steep rocky slope and guess it must be the cliff behind the château it be a sort of zig-zag path which i could not see only guess at i be scare stiff but they be still after I or i think they be so i flounder on the path if it be a path be slimy with mud and about every third step i would slip and go sprawl i can not tell you how many time i feel my leg shoot out into nothing and dig my finger into the muck or break my nail on rock and catch clump of grass with my tooth to keep from go over and all the while that all-gone feel in the pit of my stomach however i get to the top in the end and crawl into a hollow and lay down behind some bush and pant as if my heart would break and hope i would die and get over with it but nobody come to bother I so i get up when the first streak of light show in the sky -- there would be a young cloud-burst just before that and i be soak to my skin -- and strike off across the cause for god-knew-where de lorgnes and i have fix that if anything do happen to separate we we would each strike for lyon and the one who get there first would wait for the other at the hôtel terminus but before i could do that i have to find a railroad and i do not dare go millau-way i think because the chance be the gendarme would be wait there to nab the first bird that blow in all cover with mud and carry a bag full of diamond i would manage to hold onto the grip through it all you see but before that day be do i wish i would lose it the damned thing get heavier and heavier till it must have weigh a gross ton it gall my hand and rub my leg till they be sore i be sore all over anyway inside and out sometime during the morning i climb one of those bum mound they call couronne to see if i could sight any place to get food and drink preferably drink the sun have dry my clothes on my back and then go on to make it a good job by soak up all the moisture in my system i figure i be lose eleven pound a hour by evaporation alone and expect to arrive wherever i do arrive if i ever arrive anywhere look like a early egyptian prune the view from the couronne do not show I anything i want to see only a number of man in the distance spread out over the face of the causse and quarter it like beagle i reckon i know what sort of game they be hunting and slide down from that couronne and travel but they would see I and somebody sound the view-halloo it be grand exercise for I and great sport for they when i could not totter another yard i fall into a hole into the ground -- one of those avens -- and crawl into a sort of little cave and lay there listen to the suck and gurgle of million of gallon of nice cool water run to waste under my foot and I die the death of a dog with thirst after a while i could not stand it any longer i crawl out prepare to surrender give up the plunder and lick the boot of any man who have slip I a cup of water but for some reason they would give up the chase i see no more of they whoever they be and a little later i find a peasant 's hut and water myself till i swell up like a poison pup they give I a brush-down there and something to eat besides and put I on my way to millau it seem that i be a hundred mile from anywhere else so it be millau for mine if it mean a life sentence in a french prison i sneak into the town after dark and take the first train north nobody take any notice of I i could not see the use of go all round robin hood 's barn as i would have have to in order to make lyon by the time i would get there de lorgnes would have give up and go on to pari phinuit finish he drink i 'll say it be a gay young party the next time i feel the call to crime believe I i be go out and snatch nursing bottle from kid asleep in they pram but they _ must _ be asleep monk lift himself by section from he chair it be a good yarn first time i hear it he muse aloud but now i notice even the sybarite be get restless in the course of phinuit 's narrative the black disk of night frame by the polished brass circle of the stern port have fade out into dusky violet then into a lighter lilac finally into a warm yet tender blue now the main deck overhead be a sounding-board for thump and rustle of many hurry foot pilot come aboard you think phinuit enquire and add as monk nod and cast about for the visored white cap of he office : do not know pilot be such early bird they be not as a rule but if you treat 'em right they 'll listen to reason the captain graphically rub a thumb over two finger don he cap button up he tunic and stride forth with a impressive gait still wakeful phinuit hint hopefully and shall be till we drop the pilot thanks if i have not see de lorgne make that safe sit up and speak and do not know you be he master i would be tempt to bat a eye or two however phinuit sigh despondently what can i do now to entertain you dear sir you might have pity on my benighted curiosity meaning this outfit lanyard assent and phinuit deliberate over the question i do not know as i ought in the absence of my esteemed associate but what be bother you most i have see something of the world monsieur and as you be aware not a little of the underside of it but never have i meet with a combination of such peculiar element as this possess regard it if you will from my view-point that of a outsider for one moment phinuit grin it must give you furiously to think -- as you would say but assuredly take for example yourself a man of unusual intelligence such as one be not accustom to find lending himself to the scheme of ordinary criminal but you have just admit that we be anything but ordinary then mademoiselle delorme one know what the world know of she that she have for many year meddle with high affair that she have be for many year more a sort of queen of the demi-monde of pari but now you tell I she have stop to profit by association with a professional burglar profit i 'll say she do accord to my information it be she who map out the campaign for de lorgnes she be ghq and he merely the high private in the front line trench with this difference that in this instance ghq be perfectly willing to let the man at the front cop all the glory she take the cash and let the credit go nor heed rumbling of the distant drum then you picturesque confrère captain monk and the singular circumstance that he own a wealthy cousin of the same name and this beautiful little yacht which you seem so free to utilize for the furtherance of you purpose be it strange then that one 's curiosity be provoke one 's imagination alternately stimulate and baffle no i suppose not phinuit concede thoughtfully still it be far simpler than you would think one have find that true of most mystery monsieur i do not mind tell you all i feel at liberty to you seem to have a pretty good line on mademoiselle and i have tell you what i know about de lorgnes as for the skipper he be the black sheep of a good old new england family run away to sea as a boy and be disown and grow up in a rough school it would take all night to name half the job he be have a hand in mostly of a shady nature in every quarter of the seven sea : gun run pearl poach what not -- even a little slaving i suspect in he early day he be a pompous old bluff in repose but nobody 's fool and a bad actor when he mad be up he tell I he fall in with the delorme a long time ago while act as personal escort for a fugitive south american potentate who cross the border of he native land with the national treasury in one hand and he other in monk 's and of course -- they all do -- make a bee line for pari that be how we come to make she acquaintance my revered employer mister monk and i -- through the skipper i mean phinuit pause to consider and end with a whimsical grimace i be talk too much but it do not matter seein 's it be you strictly between ourselves the say revered employer be a annointed fraud publicly he be the pillar of the respectable house of monk privately he be not above profiteer foreclose the mortgage on the old homestead and swearing to a odoriferous income-tax return and when he think he be far enough away from home -- my land how that little man do carry on the war make he more money than he ever think there be so he buy this yacht ready-made and start on the grand tour but never get any farther than paris -- naturally he first stop news from home to the effect that somebody be threaten to do he out of a few nickel send he hightail back to put a stop to it but before that happen he want to see life with a large l and cousin whitaker give he a good start by introduce he to little ingénue liane and then she put the smuggling bee in he bonnet smuggling lanyard begin to experience glimpse champagne if ever all the truth come out i fancy it will transpire that liane 's get a rake-off from some vintner you see friend employer be display a cultivate taste in vintage champagne but he would be culpably negligent in not lay down a large stock for private consumption before the great drought set in the delorme find that out then that he ancestral acre border on long island sound and finally that the sybarite be loaf its head off what could be more simple she suggest than that monsieur should ballast he private yacht with champagne on the homeward voyage make he landfall some night in the dark of the moon and put the stuff ashore on he own property before morning do he fall for it well i just guess he do this be all most interesting monsieur but where do monk and i come in oh like master like man liane be too wise to crab she act by propose anything really wicked to the owner and wise enough to know nothing could shock the skipper and i be wise enough not to let he get away with anything unless i sit in on the deal mademoiselle play all she card face upwards with we she and de lorgne she say be lose money by dispose of they loot this side especially with european currency at its present stage of depreciation and so long as the owner be do a little dirty work why should not we get together and do something for ourselves on the side if champagne could be so easily smuggle into the state why not diamond we form a joint-stock company on the spot and make you first coup at the château de montalais not the first but the biggest de lorgnes ' mouth have be water for the montalai stuff for a long time it seem my boss have private business of a nature we will not enter into in london and give I a week off and the use of he car we make up the party tour down the rhone valley and then back by way of the cévennes just to get the lay of the land i do not think there can be much more you need to know monsieur be too modest oh about I why i guess i be not a uncommon phenomenon of the time i be a good citizen before the war law-abiding and everything if you would tell I then i would be in this galley to-day i would probably have knock you for a goal i have a flourish young business of my own and be engage to be marry when i get back from hell over here i find my girl marry to another man my business wreck what be leave of it cripple by extortionate taxation to support a government that be waste money like a drunken sailor and too cynical to keep its solemn promise to the man who have fight for it i have to take a job as secretary to a man i could not respect and now well if i can get a bit of my own back by defraud the government or class myself with the unorganised leech on society nothing i know be go to stop my do it phinuit knock the ash out of a cold pipe at which he have be suck for some time rise and stretch the worst of it be he say in a serious turn -- i mean look at the thing from my bourgeois viewpoint of 1914 -- the war but more particularly the antic of the various government after the war turn out several million of man in my frame of mind the world over we go into the thing delude by patriotic bunk and the promise that it be a war to end war we come out to find the old man more firmly entrench in the seat of the mighty than ever and stubbornly bent on perpetuate precisely the same rotten condition that make war inevitable what germany do to the treaty that guarantee belgium 's neutrality be child 's - play compare to what the government of the war nation have do to they covenant with they own people and if anybody should ask you you can safely promise they that several million sorehead like myself be what the politician call ' a menace to the establish social order ' clear daylight fill the port the traffic on deck nearly deserve the name of din command and call be be bawl in english french and polyglot profanity a donkey-engine be rumble a winch clatter a capstan-pawl clank alongside a tug be pant hoarsely the engine room telegraph jangle furiously the fabric of the sybarite shudder and gather way we be off yawn phinuit now will you be reasonable and go to bed you may monsieur say lanyard get up for my part i shall go on deck if you do not mind and stop there till the pilot leave we fair enough but one moment more you have be extraordinarily frank but you have forget one element to I of some importance : you have not tell I what my part be in this insane adventure that be not my business to tell you phinuit reply promptly when anything as important as that come out it will not be through my babble anyhow liane may have change she mind since last report and so as far as i be concerned you present status be simply that of she pet protégé what it be to be hereafter you 'll learn from she i suppose soon enough le 's go xxii out of sounding when finally lanyard do consent to seek he stateroom -- with the pilot drop and the sybarite foot it featly over channel water to air pipe by a freshen breeze -- it be to sleep once round the clock and something more for it be nearly six in the afternoon when he come on deck again the quarterdeck a place of epicurean ease for idle passenger be desert but for a couple of deckhand engage in furl the awn lanyard lounge on the rail revelling in a sense of perfect physical refreshment intensify by the gracious motion of the vessel the friendly rhythmic chant of she engine the sweeping ocean air and the song it sing in the rig the vision of blue sea snow-plumed and mirroring in a myriad facet the red gold of the westering sun and the lift and dip of a far horizon whose bank of violet mist be the fading shore of france in these circumstance of the sea he love so well there be certain anodyne for those twinge of chagrin which he must suffer when remind of the sorry figure he have cut overnight still there be compensation -- of a more material nature too than this delight which he have of be once again at sea to have cheapen himself in the estimation of liane delorme and phinuit and monk be really to he advantage for to persuade a adversary to under-estimate one be to make he almost a ally also lanyard now have no more need to question the fate of the montalai jewel no more blank space remain to be fill in he hypothetical explanation of the intrigue which have enmesh the château de montalais its lady and he honor he know now all he need to know he could put he hand on the jewel when he would and he have a fair fortnight -lrb- the probable duration of they voyage accord to monk -rrb- in which to revolve plan for make away with they at minimum cost to himself in exertion and exposure to reprisal plan he have none as yet he would begin to formulate and ponder they only when he have better acquaintance with the ship and she company and have learn more about that ambiguous landfall which she be to make -lrb- as phinuit have put it -rrb- in the dark of the moon not that he make the mistake of despise those two social malcontent phinuit and jule that rogue adventurer monk that grasp courtesan liane delorme individually and collectively lanyard account that quartet uncommonly clever resourceful audacious unscrupulous and potentially ruthless utterly callous to compunction when they interest be jeopardise but it be inconceivable that he should fail to outwit and frustrate they who have the love and faith of eve de montalai to honor cherish and requite grow insight into the idiosyncrasy of the man leave he undismay he perceive the steel of inflexible purpose beneath the windy egotism of phinuit the pompous histrionism of monk he know be merely a shell for the cold calculate undeviating selfishness that too frequently come with advance year nevertheless these two be factor whose functioning might be predict it be liane delorme who provide the erratic equation she woman 's mind be not only the direct intelligence it be as eccentric as quicksilver infinitely supple and corrupt oriental in its trickishness and impenetrability already it have conceive some project involve he which he could by no means divine or even guess at without a sense of waste time try to put himself in she place lanyard believe that he would never have neglect the opportunity that so far as she know have be hers to steal away from pari while he sleep and leave a enemy in he way quite as dangerous as dupont to gnaw he nail in the mortification of defeat why she have not do so why she have permit monk and phinuit to play they comedy of offer he the jewel pass understanding but of one thing lanyard feel reasonably assure : now that she have he to all intent and purpose she foiled and harmless captive aboard the sybarite liane would not keep he wait long for enlightenment as to she intention he have to wait however that night and the next three before the woman show herself she be report ill with mal-de-mer lanyard think it quite likely that she be before she be out of the channel the sybarite be contest a moderate gale from the southwest on the other hand he imagine that liane might sensibly be make seasickness a excuse to get thoroughly rest and settle in she mind as to she course with he so he school himself to be patient and put in he time to good profit take the measure of he shipmate and learn he way about ship the sybarite seem unnecessarily large for a pleasure boat captain monk have designate she a ship of nine hundred ton certainly she have room and to spare on deck as well as below for the accommodation of many guest in addition to the crew of thirty require for she navigation and they comfort a good all-weather boat very steady in a seaway she line be nevertheless fine nothing in she appearance in the least suggest a vessel of commercial character -- all yacht be what monk call she the first mate a mr swain be a sturdy britisher with a very red face and cool blue eye not easily impressed if lanyard be not in error mr swain entertain a private opinion of the lot of they captain monk include decidedly uncomplimentary but he be a civil sort though deficient in sense of humor and incline to be a bit abrupt in a preoccupy fashion mr collison the second mate be another kind entirely a american with the drawl of the south in he voice a dark slender man with eye quick and shrewd he manners be excellent he reserve notable though he seem to derive considerable amusement from what he see of the passenger go on he habit of indulge quiet smile as he listen to they communication he talk very little and play a excellent game of poker the chief engineer be a mr mussey stout affable and cynic a heavy drinker untidy about he person and exact about he engine-room a veteran of he trade and -- it be say -- a ancient croney of monk 's there be at all event a complete understanding evident between these two though now and again especially at table when monk be put on something more than he customary amount of side lanyard would observe mussey 's eye fix in contemplation upon he superior officer with a look in they that want reading he be nobody 's fool certainly not monk 's and at such time lanyard would have give more than a penny for mussey 's thought exist in daily contact more or less close with these gentleman observe they as they go to and fro upon they lawful occasion lanyard often speculate as to they attitude toward this lawless errand of the sybarite 's of which they could hardly be unsuspicious even if they be not intimate with its true nature and remember what penalty attach to apprehension in the act of smuggling even though it be only a few case of champagne he think it a wild risk for they to run for the sake of they daily wage something to this effect he intimate to phinuit do not worry about this lot that one reply they be wise bird tough as they make 'em ready for anything hand-picked down to the last coal-passer the skipper be not a man to take fool chance and when he recruit this crew he take nobody he could not answer for they be more than well pay and they 'll do as they be tell and keep they trap as tight as clam ' but i take it they be sign on before this present voyage be think of while you seem to imply that captain monk anticipate have to depend upon these good fellow in unlawful enterprise maybe he do at that phinuit promptly surmise with a bland eye i would not put it past he the skipper 's deep and i 'll never tell you what he have in the back of he mind when he let friend boss persuade he to take command of a pleasure yacht because i do not know if it come to that the owner himself never confide in I just what the large idea be in buy this ark for a plaything yachting for fun be one thing run a young float hotel be something else again then you do not believe the grandiose illusion due to sudden wealth be alone responsible i do not know that little man have a mind of he own and even if i do figure on he payroll as confidential secretary he do not tell I everything he know still say lanyard drily one can not think you can complain that he have hesitate to repose he trust in you to this phinuit make no reply other than a non-committal grunt and presently lanyard add : it be hardly possible -- eh -- that the officer and crew know nothing of what be intend with all the champagne you have recently take aboard they be no fool they know there be enough of the stuff on board to do a cunarder for the next ten year and they know too there be no lawful way of get it into the state so then they know that how much more may they not know phinuit turn a startled face to he what be that he demand sharply may they not have exercise they wit as well on the subject of you secret project my friend what be you get at one be wonder what these ` wise bird as tough as they make they ' would do if they think you be -- as you say -- get away with something at they expense as well as the owner 's what have you see or hear positively nothing this be merely idle speculation well phinuit sigh sibilantly and relax let 's hope they never find out by dawn of the fourth day the gale have spend its greatest strength what be leave of it subside steadily till as the seafaring phrase have it the wind go down with the sun calm ensue lanyard wake up the next morning to view from he stateroom deadlight vista illimitable of flat blue flaw by hardly a wrinkle only by watch the horizon be one aware of the slow swell of the sea its sole perceptible motion and all day long the sybarite trudge on a even keel with only the wind of she way to flutter the gay awning of the quarterdeck while the water shear by she stem run down she side hiss resentment of this violation of they absolute tranquillity also the sun make itself feel electric fan buzz everywhere and perspire in utter indolence beneath the awning one thought in sympathy of those damned soul below in the hell of the stoke-hole at luncheon liane delorme appear in a summery toilette that would have make its mark on the beach of deauville voluntary or enforce she period of retreat have do she good making every allowance for the aid of art the woman look year younger than when lanyard have last see she nobody would ever have believe she a day older than twenty-five no one that be to say who have not watch youth ebb from she face and leave it gray and waste with premature winter as lanyard have that morning when he tell she of the death of de lorgnes in the restaurant of the butte montmartre liane herself have long since put quite out of mind that mauvai quart d'heure she present serenity be as flawless as the sea 's though unlike the sea she sparkle she be as gay as any school-girl -- though any school-girl guilty or even capable of a scintilla of the amusing impropriety of she badinage would have merit and win instant expulsion she inaugurate without any delay a campaign of conquest extremely divert to observe to lanyard it seem that she method be crude and obvious enough but it do something toward mitigate the long-drawn boredom of the cruise to watch they work out as they seem to invariably with entire success and then remark the insouciance with which another raw scalp dangle from she belt liane would address herself to the next victim mr swain be the first to fall mainly because he happen to be present at luncheon it be mr collison 's watch on the bridge under the warmth of violet eye which seek he constantly draw by what one be leave to infer be a irresistible attraction he reserve melt rapidly he remote blue stare grow infinitely less distant and though he blush furiously at some of the more audacious of liane 's sally he be quick to take he cue when she express curiosity concern the duty of the officer of the watch and come up at about two bell for a turn round the deck and a few breath of fresh air before dress for dinner lanyard see they on the bridge they head together over the binnacle -- to the open disgust of the man at the wheel liane hail he with vivacious gesture command he attendance as a brother in good standing one could hardly do less than humor she gracefully so lanyard trot up to the companion ladder and liane rest a hand of sisterly affection upon he arm besought he to make clear to she feminine stupidity swain 's hopelessly technical explanation of the compass and binnacle obligingly mr swain repeat he lecture and lanyard learning for himself with considerable surprise what a highly complicate instrument of precision be the modern compass and that the binnacle have essential function entirely aside from support the compass and housing it from the weather could hardly blame he sister for be confuse indeed he grow so interested in swain 's exposition of deviation and variation and magnetic attraction and the various device employ to counteract these influence the flinder bar the soft-iron sphere and the system of adjustable magnet locate in the pedestal of the binnacle that he have to be remind by a mild exhibition of sisterly temper that she have not summon he to the bridge for he private edification so then he say after due show of contrition -- it be like this : the magnetic needle be susceptible to many attraction aside from that of the pole it be influence by juxtaposition to other piece or mass of magnetize metal the iron ship itself for example be one great magnet then there be dissociate mass of iron within the ship each possess a individual power of magnetism sufficient to drag the needle far from its normal fidelity to the pole so the scientific mariner when he install a compass on board he ship measure these several force they influence upon the needle and install other to correct they -- on the principle of like cure like let we put it in a figure : the compass be the husband the pole the wife now it be well know that husband be for all that human being able to perceive attraction in person other than those to whom they be marry the wise wife then study the charm of mind or person which in other appeal to she husband and make they she own or if that be impossible cultivate other quality quite as potent to distract he it result from this that the wise wife become as they say ` all woman to one man ' now here the binnacle represent the art by which that wise wife the pole keep she husband true by surround he with charm and quality -- these magnet -- sufficiently powerful to counteract the attraction of other do i make myself clear but perfectly liane nod emphatically what a mind to have in the family she appeal to mr swain do you know monsieur it happen often to I to wonder how i should have so clever a brother it be like that with I too lanyard insist warmly he make a early excuse to get away have something new to think about mr mussey put up a stiffer fight than mr swain since a avowed cynic be necessarily a man who know about woman he give liane flatly to understand that he see through she and could not be take in by all she blandishments at the end of twenty-four hour however the conviction seem somehow to have insidiously penetrate that only a man of he ripe wisdom and disillusionment could possibly have any appeal to a woman like liane delorme it be not long after that the engine room be illuminate by liane 's pretty ankle and mr mussey be begin to comprehend that there be in this world one woman at least who could take a intelligent interest in machinery mr collison succumb without a struggle true to the tradition of southern chivalry he amble up to the block lay he head upon it and ask for the axe nor be he keep long wait on the seventh day the course prick on the chart place the sybarite 's position at noon as approximately in mid-atlantic contemplate a prospect of seven day more of such emptiness lanyard 's very soul yawn and nothing could induce captain monk to hasten the passage mr mussey assert that he engine could at a pinch deliver twenty knot a hour yet day in and day out the sybarite poke along at little better than half that speed it be no secret that liane delorme 's panic flight from popinot have hurry the yacht out of cherbourg harbor four day earlier than she propose sailing date whereas the sybarite have a rendezvous to keep with she owner at a certain hour of a certain night a appointment carefully calculate with consideration for the phase of the moon and the height of the tide therefore not readily to be alter after dinner on that seventh day a meal much too long draw out for lanyard 's liking and marked to boot by the consumption of much too much champagne he leave the main saloon the arena of a impromptu poker party repair to the quarterdeck and find a wicker lounge chair by the taffrail subside into it with a sigh of gratitude for this fragrant solitude of night so soothing and serene the sybarite make easy way through a slight sea with what wind there be -- not much -- on the port bow roll but slightly and she deliberate and graceful fore-and-aft motion as she swing from crest to crest of the endless head-on swell cause the star to stream above she mast-head a boundless river of broken light the pulse of the engine unhast unresting run through she fabric in ceaseless succession of gentle tremor while the rumble of they revolution resemble the refrain of a old quiet song the mechanism of the patent log hum and click more obtrusively directly underfoot the screw churn a softly clash wake from the saloon companionway drift intermittently a confusion of voice liane 's light laughter muted clatter of chip now and then the sound of a pop cork forward the ship 's bell sound two double stroke then a single follow by a wail in minor key : five bell and all 's well and of a sudden lanyard suffer the melancholy oppression of know he littleness of body and soul the relative insignificance even of the ship that impertinent atom of human organization which traverse with unabashed effrontery the water of the age beneath the shine constellation of eternity in profound psychical enervation he perceive with bitterness and despair the enormous futility of all thing mortal the hopelessness of effort the certain black defeat that wait upon even what man term success he feel crushed spiritually invertebrate destitute of object in existence bereft of all hope what matter it whether he win or lose in this stupid contest whose prize be possession of a few trinket set with bit of glitter stone if he win of what avail what could it profit he soul to make good a vain boast to eve de montalai would it matter to she what success or failure mean to he lanyard doubt it he doubt she himself all thing within the compass of he understanding and know appalling glimpse of that everlasting truth too passionless to be cynical that the hope of man and he fear he love and hate he striving and passivity be all one in the measure and immutable process of time the pressure of a hand upon he own rouse he to discover the liane delorme have seat herself beside he in a chair that look the other way so that she face be not far from he and he could scarcely be unaware of its hint beauty now wan and glimmer in starlight enigmatic with soft close shadow i must have be dream he say apologetic you startle I one could see that my friend the woman speak in quiet accent and let she hand linger upon he with its insistent reminder of the warm living presence whose rich coloring be disguise by the gloom that encompass both four stroke in duplicate on the ship 's bell then the call : _ eight bell and a-a-all 's well _ lanyard mutter : no idea it be so late a slender white shape mr collison emerge from he quarter in the deck-house beneath the bridge and run up the ladder to relieve mr swain at the same time a seaman come from forward and ascend by the other ladder later mr swain and the man whose trick at the wheel be end leave the bridge the latter to go forward to he rest mr swain to turn into he room in the deck-house the hot glow of the saloon skylight become a dim refulgence aside from which and its glimmer in the mouth of the companionway no light be visible in the whole length of the ship except the shutter window of mr swain 's room which presently be darken and odd glimpse of the binnacle light to be have when the helmsman shift he stand a profound hush close down upon the ship whose progress across the face of the water seem to acquire a new significance of stealth so that the two seat by the taffrail above the throbbing screw and rush torrent of the wake talk in lowered accent without think why it be that one grow bored eh cher amus perhaps liane or perhaps that one 's thought be constantly with one 's heart elsewhere you think so at the château de montalais conceivably it amuse you then to shoot arrow into the air but naturally i seek the reason when i see you distrait and be conscious of you neglect i think it be for I to complain of that how can you say such thing one have see what one have see these last few day i think you be what that original phinuit would call ' a fast worker ' liane what stupidity if i seek to make myself like you know well it be with a purpose one hardly question that you judge harshly michael lanyard spend a look of astonishment on the darkness he could not remember that liane have ever before call he by that name do i sorry he tone be listless but do it matter you know that to I nothing else matter lanyard check off on he finger : swain collison mussey who next why not i as well as another do you imagine for a instant that i class you with such riffraff why if you really want to know what i think liane : it seem to I that all man in you sight be much the same good for one thing only to be use to serve you end and who be i that you should hold I in higher rating than any other man you should know i do the woman breathe so low he barely catch the word and utter a involuntary pardon before he know he have understand so that she iterate in a clearer tone of protest : you should know i do -- that i do esteem you as something more than other man think what i owe to you michael and then consider this that of all man whom i have know you alone have never ask for love he give a quiet laugh there be too much humility in my heart no she say in a dull voice -- but you despise I do not deny it she shift impatiently in she chair i know what i know i be no fool whatever you think of I no she go on with emotion under restraint : i be a creature of fatality I -- i can not hope to escape my fate he be silent a little in perplexed consideration of this what do she wish he to believe but one imagine nobody can escape he fate man can some of they man such as you rare as you be know how to cheat destiny but woman never it be the fate of all woman that each shall some time love some man to desperation and be despise it be my fate to have learn too late to love you michael -- ah liane liane but you hold I in too much contempt to be willing to recognize the truth on the contrary i admire you extremely i think you be a incomparable actress you see she offer a despairing gesture to the star it be not true what i say i lay bare my heart to he and he tell I that i act but my dear girl surely you do not expect I to think otherwise i be a fool to expect anything from you she return bitterly -- you know too much about I i can not find it in my heart to blame you since i be what i be what the life you save I to so long ago have make I why should you believe in I why should you credit the sincerity of this confession which cost I so much humiliation that would be too good for I too much to ask of life i think you can not fairly complain of life liane what have you ask of it that you have fail to get success money power adulation -- never love the world would find it difficult to believe that ah love of a sort yes : the love that be the desire to possess and that possession satisfy have you ask for any other sort i ask it now i know what the love be that long to give to give and give again ask no return but kindness understanding even toleration merely it be such love as this i bear you michael but you do not believe divide between annoyance and distaste he be silent and all at once she throw herself half across the join arm of they chair catch he shoulder with she hand so that she half-clothed body rest on he bosom and its scented warmth assail he sens with the seduction whose power she know so well ah michael my michael she cry -- if you but know if only you could believe it be so real to I so true so overwhelming the greatest thing of all how can it be otherwise to you no : do not think i complain do not think i blame you or have room in my heart for any resentment but oh my dear be i only able to make you understand think what life could be to we to you and I what could it withhold that we desire you with you wit you strength you skill you poise -- i with my great love to inspire and sustain you -- what a pair we should make what happiness would be ours think michael -- think i have think liane he return in accent as kind as the hand that hold she i have think well yes she lift she face so near that they breath mingle and he be conscious of the allure of tremulous and part lip you have think and tell I you thought my michael why i think two thing say lanyard : first that you deserve to be soundly kiss he kiss she but with discretion and firmly put she from he then -- he tone take on a note of earnestness -- that if what you have say be true it be a pity and i be sorry liane very sorry and if it be not true that the comedy be well play shall we let it rest at that my dear half lift she he help she back into she chair and as she turn she face away struggle for mastery of she emotion true or feigned he sit back find he cigarette case and clipping a cigarette between he lip cast about for a match he have none in he pocket but know that there be a stand on one of the wicker table nearby rise he find it and as he strike the light hear a sudden soft swish of drapery as the woman rise move toward the saloon companionway she pass he swiftly without a word she head bend a hand press a handkerchief to she lip forgetful he follow she sway figure with puzzle gaze till admonish by the flame that creep toward he fingertip then drop the match he strike another and put it to he cigarette at the second puff he hear a choke gasp and look up again the woman stand alone en silhouette against the glow of the companionway she arm thrust out as if to ward off some threaten danger a second cry break from she lip shrill with terror she totter and fall as drop he cigarette lanyard run to she he vision dazzle by the flame of the match he seek in vain for any cause for she apparent fright for all he could see the deck be as empty as he have presume it to be all through they conversation he find she in a faint unmistakably unaffected footfall sound on the deck as he kneel make superficial examination collison have hear she cry and witness she fall from the bridge and be come to investigate what in blaze -- lanyard reply with a gesture of bewilderment : she be just go below i would stop to light a cigarette see nothing to account for this wait : i 'll fetch water he dart down the companionway fill a glass from a silver thermos carafe and hurry back as he arrive at the top of step collison announce : it be all right she be come to support in the arm of the second mate liane be begin to breathe deeply and look round with dazed eye lanyard drop on a knee and set the glass to she lip she gulp twice mechanically she gaze fix to he face then suddenly memory clear and she utter a bubble gasp of return dread popinot she cry as lanyard hastily take the glass away popinot -- he be there -- i see he -- stand there a tremble arm indicate the starboard deck just forward of the companion housing but of course when lanyard look there be no one there if there have ever be xxiii the cigarette lanyard find himself exchange look of mystification with collison and hear he own voice make the flat statement : but there be nobody collison mutter word which he take to be : no and never be but you must have see he from the bridge lanyard insist blankly if i look around as soon as i hear she call out collison reply but i do not see anybody only mademoiselle here -- and you of course with that match please help I up liane delorme ask in a faint voice collison lend a hand in the support and shelter of lanyard 's arm the woman 's body quiver like that of a frightened child i must go to my stateroom she sigh uncertainly but i be afraid do not be remember mr collison and i besides you know there be nobody the assertion seem to exasperate she she voice discover new strength and violence but i be tell you i see that assassin -- she shudder again -- stand there in the shadow glaring at I as if i have surprise he and he do not know what next to do i think he must have be spy down through the skylight it be the glow from it that show I he red dirty face of a pig you come aft on the port side do not you lanyard enquire of the second mate collison nod run he say -- could not imagine what be up it be easy not to see what one be not look for lanyard muse stare forward along the starboard side if a man have drop flat and squirm along until in the shelter of the engine-room ventilator he could have run forward -- bend low you know -- without you see he but you be stand here to starboard i tell you that match be blind I lanyard affirm irritably besides i be not look -- except at my sister -- wonder what be the matter collison start excuse I he say remind -- if mademoiselle 's all right i ought to get back to the bridge take I below liane beg i must speak with captain monk monk and phinuit be take they ease plus nightcap in the captain 's sitting-room a knock bring a prompt invitation to come in lanyard thrust the door open and curtly address monk : mademoiselle delorme wish to see you the eloquent eyebrow indicate surprise and resignation and monk get up and insert himself into he white linen tunic phinuit more sensitive to the accent of something amiss hurry out in unceremonious shirt sleeve what be up he demand look from lanyard 's grave face to liane 's face of pallor and distress lanyard inform he in a few word impossible phinuit comment nonsense monk add speak directly to liane you imagine it all she have recover much of she composure enough to enable she to shrug she disdain of such stupidity i tell you only what my two eye see to be sure monk agree with a specious air of be wide open to conviction what become of he then you ask I that know that in stress of terror i faint the eyebrow achieve a effect of study weariness and you see nobody monsieur and collison do not either lanyard shake he head to each question still it be possible -- monk cut he short impatiently all gammon -- all in she eye no man bigger than a cockroach could have smuggle himself aboard this yacht without my be tell i know my ship i know my man i know what i be talk about presently liane prophesy darkly you may be talk about nothing at a loss monk mutter : do not get you when you find yourself some fine morning with you throat cut in you sleep like poor de lorgne -- or garrote as i might have be i be not go to lose any sleep monk begin lose none before you have the vessel search liane plead with a change of tone you know monsieur i be not a woman give to hallucination i _ saw _ and i tell you while that assassin be at liberty aboard this yacht not one of we life be worth a sou -- no not one oh you shall have you search monk give in as one who indulge a childish whim but i can tell you now what we 'll find -- or will not then heaven help we all liane go swiftly to the door of she room but there hesitate look back in appeal to lanyard i be afraid let I have a look round first and when lanyard have satisfy himself there be nobody conceal in any part of liane 's suite and have be reward with a glance of gratitude -- i shall lock myself in of course the woman say from the threshold -- and i have my pistol too but i assure you monk comment in heavy sarcasm we intention be those of honorable man the door slam and the sound of the key turn in the lock follow monk train the eyebrow into a look of long-suffering patience a glass too much seein ' thing no lanyard voice shortly he belief you be wrong liane see something nobody question that phinuit yawn what one do question be whether she see a man or a figment of she imagination -- some effect of the shadow that momentarily suggest a man shadow do play queer trick at night at sea monk agree i remember once -- then let we look the ground over and see if we can make that explanation acceptable to we own intelligence lanyard cut in no harm in that phinuit fetch a pocket flash-lamp and the three reconnoitr exhaustively the quarter of the deck in which the apparition have manifest itself to the woman by no strain of credulity could the imagination be make to accept the effect of shadow at the designate spot as the shape of somebody standing there on the other hand when phinuit obligingly pose himself between the mouth of the companionway and the skylight it have to be admit that the glow from either side provide fairly good cover for one who might wish to linger there observe and unobserved still i do not believe she see anything monk persist -- a phantom popinot if anything but wait what be it we have here lanyard scrutinise the deck with the flashlamp stoop pick up something and offer it on a outspread palm upon which he train the clear electric beam cigarette stub monk say and sniff that be a famous find a cigarette manufacture by the french régie and well step on too phinuit observe well what about it who that use this part of the deck would be apt to insult he palate with such a cigarette no one of we -- hardly any one of the officer or steward some deck-hand might have sneak aft for a look-see expect to find the quarterdeck desert at this hour even ordinary seaman avoid when they can what the régie sell under the name of tobacco nor be it likely such a one would risk the consequence of defy captain monk 's celebrated discipline then you believe it be popinot too i believe you would do well to make the search you have promise thorough and immediate plenty of time monk reply wearily i 'll turn this old tub inside out if you insist in the morning but why monsieur do you remain so obstinately incredulous well monk drawl i have know the pretty lady a number of year and if you ask I she be quite up to play little game all she own pretend you mean -- for private end the eyebrow offer a gesture urbane and sceptical whether or not sleep bring monk better counsel the morning 's ransacking of the vessel and the examination of she crew prove more painstaking than lanyard have expect and the upshot be precisely as monk have foretell precisely negative he report drily to this effect at a informal conference in he quarter after luncheon he himself have supervise the entire search and have make a good part of it in person he say no nook or cranny of the yacht have be overlook i trust mademoiselle be satisfied he conclude with a mockingly civil movement of eyebrow toward liane he reply be the slightest of shrug execute by perfect shoulder beneath a gown of cynical transparency lanyard be aware that the violet eye large with apprehension flash transiently he way as if in hope that he might submit some helpful suggestion but he have none to offer if the manner in which the search have be conduct be open to criticism that would have to be make by a mind better inform than he in respect of thing maritime and he avoid acknowledge that glance by even so much as seem aware of it and in point of fact coldly review in dispassionate daylight the thing seem preposterous to he to be ask to believe that popinot have contrived to secrete himself beyond find on board the sybarite without he participation the discussion continue he hear phinuit 's voice utter in accent of malicious amusement : bar of course the possibility of connivance on the part of officer or crew do not be a ass monk snap do not be unreasonable : i be simply as god make I well it be a nasty job of work now listen phinuit rise to leave as one consider the conference at a end if you persist in pick on I skipper i 'll ravish you of those magnificent eyebrow with a safety razor some time when you be asleep and leave you as dumb as a wop peddler who be lose both arm liane follow he out in silence but she carriage be that of a queen of tragedy lanyard get up in turn and to he amazement find the eyebrow signalling confidentially to he what the devil he exclaim in a open stare immediately the eyebrow become conciliatory well monsieur and what be you opinion why to I it would seem there might be something in the suggestion of monsieur phinuit ridiculous monk dismiss it finally do you know i rather fancy my own liane 's up to something he add explanatory and then as lanyard say nothing -- you have not tell I yet what she be talk to you about last night just before she -- alleged fright lanyard contrived a successful offensive with he own eyebrow oh he say have not i and walk out here be a new angle to consider monk 's attitude hint at a possible rift in the entente cordiale of the conspirator why else should he mistrust liane 's sincerity in assert that she have see popinot aside from the question of what he imagine she could possibly gain by make a scene out of nothing -- a riddle unreadable -- one wonder consumedly what have happen to render monk suspicious of she good faith the explanation when it be finally reveal to lanyard by the most trivial of incident make even he own blindness seem laughable for three more day the life of the ship follow in unruffled tranquillity its order course liane delorme be afflict with no more vision as the captain would have call they though by common consent the subject have be drop upon the failure of the search and to all seem be rapidly fading from the mind of everybody but liane herself and lanyard this last continue to plague himself with the mystery and maintain always a open mind be prepare at any time to be shockingly enlighten that be to discover that liane have not cry wolf without substantial reason for he have learn this much at least of life that everything be always possible as for liane she make no secret of she unabated timidity yet suffer it with such fortitude as could not fail to win admiration if she be a bit more subdue a trifle less high-spirited than be she habit if she refuse positively to sit with she back to any door or to retire for the night until she quarter have be examine if -lrb- as lanyard suspect -rrb- she be never unarmed for a moment day or night she permit no sign of mental strain to mar the serenity of she countenance or betray the study graciousness of she gesture toward lanyard she bear herself precisely as though nothing have happen to disturb the even adjustment of they personal relation or perhaps as if she consider everything have happen so that they rapport have become absolute at all event with a please absence of constraint he really could not make she out sometimes he think she wish he to believe she be not as other woman and could make rational allowance for he poor response to she naïve overture but that seem so abnormal he feel force to fall back on the theory that she declaration have be nothing more than a minor gambit in whatever game she be play and that consequently she bear no malice because of its failure no matter which explanation be the true one no matter which key she temper toward he lanyard find himself like the woman better not as a woman but as another human being than he have ever think to say what you like in this humor she be charming but he never for a instant imagine she be meekly accept defeat at he hand instead of bide she time to resume the attack from a new quarter so he be not at all surprise when one evening quite early after dinner she contrived another tête-à-tête and with good conversational generalship lead they talk presently into a channel of amiable personality and have you be think about what we say -- or what i say my friend -- that night -- so long ago it seem -- three night ago but inevitably liane you have not forget my stupidity then i have forget nothing she make a pretty mouth of doubt would it not have be more kind to forget such compliment be not easily forget you be sure quite sure it be a compliment no-o by no means sure still i be a man and i be give you the full benefit of every doubt she laugh not ill-pleased but what a man how bless of the god to be able to laugh at yourself as well as at I undeceive yourself : i could never laugh at you liane even if one do not believe you to be a great natural comedienne at will one would always wonder what you purpose be -- oh yes with deep respect one would wonder about that and you have be wonder these last three day well tell I what you think my purpose be in abandon all maidenly reserve and throw myself at you head why say lanyard with a look of childlike candor you might you know have be uncontrollably sway by some passionate impulse of the heart but otherwise -- she prompt hugely amuse oh if you have a low motive in try to make a fool of I you know too well how to hide you motive from such a fool in a fugitive seizure of thoughtfulness the violet eye lose all they impishness she sigh the bright head droop a little toward the gleaming bosom a hand steal out to rest lightly upon he once again it be not act michael -- i tell you that frankly -- at least not all act meaning i take it you know love too well to make it artlessly i be afraid so my dear say liane delorme with another sigh you know : i be afraid of you you see everything so clearly it be a vast pity i wish i could outgrow it one miss so many amusing emotion when one see too clearly during another brief pause lanyard see monk come on deck pause and search they out in the chair they occupy near the taffrail much as on that other historic night not that he experience any difficulty in locate they for this time the decklight be burn clearly nevertheless captain monk confess emotion at sight of those two in a quite perceptible start and lanyard see the eyebrow tremendously agitate as they manipulator move aft unconscious of all this liane end she pensive moment by lean toward lanyard and make demoralizing eye while the hand leave he and steal with a caress gesture up he forearm be love then distasteful to you unless it be truly artless michael there be so much to be say about that liane he evade monk be stand over they a towering figure in white with the most forbid eyebrow lanyard have ever see might one suggest he do suggest in iced accent that the quarter-deck be a fairly conspicuous place for this exhibition of family affection liane delorme turn up a enquire look tinge slightly with a impatience which all at once prove too much for she oh go to the devil she snap in that harsh voice of the sidewalk which she be able to use and discard at will for a moment monk make no reply and lanyard remark a curious quivering of that excessively tall excessively attenuate body a real tremble and suddenly understand that the absurd creature be be shake by jealousy by a enormous passion of jealousy quite beyond he control that shake he very much as a cat might shake a mouse it be too funny to be laughable it be comic in a way to make one want to weep so that lanyard who refuse to weep in public could merely gape in speechless and transfixed rapture and perhaps this be fortunate otherwise monk must have see that he idiotic secret be out the sport of ribald mirth and the situation must have be precipitate with a vengeance and a outcome impossible to predict as it be absorb in he inner torment monk be insensible to the peril that threaten he stilted but precious dignity which he proceed to parade as it be underline it with the eyebrow to lend emphasis to he word so long as this entertaining fiction of brother-and-sister be think worth while he say with infuriate condescension it might be judicious not to indulge in inconsistent and unseemly demonstration of affection within view of my officer and crew suppose we he choke a little in short i come to invite you to a little conference in my room with mr phinuit conference liane enquire coolly without stir i know nothing of this conference mr phinuit and i be agree that monsieur lanyard be entitle to know more about we intention while he have time to weigh they carefully we have only four more day at sea unable longer to contain himself lanyard leave he chair with alacrity but this be so delightful you have no idea really monsieur how i have look forward to this moment and to liane : do come and see how i take it this revelation of my preordained fate it will be i trust sincerely like a man with momentary hesitation and in a temper preclude any sympathy with he humor the woman rise and silently follow with he that long-legged figure whose stalk hold so much dramatic significance as he lead to the companionway after that it be refresh to find unromantic mr phinuit lounge beside the captain 's desk with cross foot overhang one corner of it and mind intent on the prosaic business of pare he fingernail lanyard nod to he with great good temper and -- while phinuit lower he foot and put away he penknife -- considerately place a chair for liane in the position in which she prefer to sit with she face turn a little from the light nor would he appreciation of the formality which seem demand by monk 's solemn manner permit he to sit before the captain have take he own chair behind the desk then however he discover the engaging spontaneity of a schoolboy at a pantomime and draw up a chair sit on the edge of it and address himself with unaffected eagerness to the most portentous eyebrow in captivity now he announce with a little bow for what one imagine mr phinuit would term the elaborate idea xxiv historic repetition phinuit grin then smother a little yawn liane delorme give a small disdainful movement of shoulder and pose herself becomingly rest a elbow on the arm of she chair and incline she cheek upon two finger of a jewelled hand thus she sit somewhat turn from monk and phinuit but face lanyard to whom she grave but friendly eye give undivided heed for all the world as if there be no other present : she seem to wait to hear he speak again rather than to care in the least what monk would find to say captain monk fill in that pause with a impressive arrangement of eyebrow then fix he gaze not upon lanyard but upon the point of a pencil with which he incredibly thin finger trace elaborate but empty design upon the blotter he open he lip hem in warn that he be about to speak and seem tremendously upset to find that liane be inconsiderately forestall he she voice be at its most musical pitch rather low for she fluting infinitely disarm and seductive let I say to you mon amus that -- naturally i know what be come -- i disapprove absolutely of this method of treat with you but it be such a honor to be consider important enough to be treat with at all you have the true gift for sarcasm : a pity to waste it on a audience two-third incapable of appreciation oh you be wrong phinuit declare earnestly i be appreciative i think the dear man 's immense might i suggest -- the unctuous tone of captain monk issue from under mildly wounded eyebrow -- if any one of we be unappreciative of monsieur lanyard 's undoubted talent he would not be with we tonight you might suggest it phinuit assent but that would not make it so it be to mademoiselle 's appreciation that you and i owe this treat and you know it now quit cock those automatic eyebrow at I you have be do that ever since we meet and they have not go off yet not once irrepressible liane 's laughter peal and though he could not help smile lanyard hasten to offer up himself on the altar of peace but -- monsieur -- you interest I so much will not you tell I quickly what possible value my poor talent can have find in you sight you tell he monk phinuit say irreverently -- i be no tale-bearer monk elevate he eyebrow above recognition of the impertinence and offer lanyard a bow of formidable courtesy they be such monsieur he say with that deliberation which become a diplomatic personage -- you talent be such that you can if you will become invaluable to we phinuit chuckle outright at lanyard 's look of polite obtuseness never sail a straight course -- can you skipper -- when you can get there by tack here : i be a plain-spoken guy let I act as a interpreter mr lanyard : this giddy association of malefactor here present have the honor to invite you to become a full-fledged work member and stockholder of equal interest with the rest of we participate in all benefit of the organization include police protection and as add inducement we be willing to waive initiation fee and due do i make myself clear but perfectly it be like this : i have tell you how we come together the five of we include jule and monsieur le comte de lorgnes now we expect this venture we first to pan out handsomely there 'll be a juicy melon cut when we get to new york there be a lot more -- i think you understand -- than the montalai plunder to whack up on we 'll make the average get-rich-quick scheme look like play store in the back-yard with two pin the top price for anything on the shelf and there be not any sane reason why we need stop at that in fact we do not mean to the sybarite will make more voyage and if anything should happen to stop it there be other means of make the u s custom look foolish each of we contribute valuable and essential service mademoiselle the skipper my kid-brother even i -- and i pull a strong oar with the new york police department into the bargain but there be a vacancy in we rank the opening leave by the death of de lorgnes a opening that nobody could hope to fill so well as you so we put it up to you squarely : if you 'll sign on and work with we we 'll turn over to you a round fifth share of the profit of this voyage as well as everything that come after that be fair enough be not it but more than fair monsieur well it be true you have do nothing to earn a fifth interest in the first division then too i be here quite helpless in you hand oh we do not look at it that way -- which liane sweetly interrupted be the one rational gesture you have yet offer in this conference monsieur phinuit meaning i suppose mr lanyard be far from be what he say helpless in we hand nor ever will be my poor friend while he breathe and think but liane lanyard deprecate modestly cast down he eye -- you overwhelm I i do not believe you liane retort coolly for some moment lanyard continue to stare reflectively at he foot nothing whatever of he thought be to be gather from he countenance though eye more shrewd to read than those of phinuit or monk be watch it intently well mr lanyard what do you say lanyard lift he meditative gaze to the face of phinuit but surely there be more he suggest in a puzzle way more what i find something lack you have show I but one side of the coin what be the reverse i appreciate the honor you do I i comprehend fully the strong inducement i be offer but you have neglect -- a odd oversight on the part of the plain-spoken man you profess to be -- you have forget to name the penalty which would attach to a possible refusal i guess it be safe to leave that to you imagination there would be a penalty however well naturally if you be not with we you be against we and to take that stand would oblige we as a simple matter of self-preservation to defend ourselves with every means at we command mean which lanyard murmur you prefer not to name well one do not like to be crude i have my answer monsieur -- and many thanks the parallel be complete with a dim smile playing in he eye and twitch at the corner of he lip lanyard lean back and study the deck beam liane delorme sit up with a movement of sharp uneasiness of what my friend be you think i be marvel at something everybody know -- that history do repeat itself the woman make a sudden hissing sound of breath draw shortly between closed tooth i hope not she sigh lanyard open he eye wide at she you hope not liane i hope this time history will not altogether repeat itself you see my friend i think i know what be in you mind memory of old time true : i be thinking of those day when the pack hunt the lone wolf in paris run he to earth at last and make he much the same offer as you have make to-night the pack you should know monsieur be the name assume by a association of parisian criminal ambitious like you who have grow envious of the lone wolf 's success and wish to persuade he to run with they and what happen phinuit enquire why it so happen that they choose the time when i have make up my mind to be good for the rest of my day it be all most unfortunate what answer do you give they then as memory serve i tell they they could all go plumb to hell so i hope history will not repeat this time liane interject and do they go monk ask presently some of they ultimately all for some linger a few year in french prison like that great popinot the father of monsieur who have cause we so much trouble and you -- why lanyard laugh i have manage to keep out of jail so i presume i must have keep my vow to be good and no backsliding phinuit suggest with a leer ah you must not ask I to tell you everything that be a matter between I and my conscience well phinuit hazard with a good show of confidence i guess you will not tell we to go plumb to hell will you no i promise to be more original than that then you refuse liane breathe tensely oh i have not say that you must give I time to think this over i know that would be he answer monk proclaim pride in he perspicuity shape the set of he eyebrow that be why i be firm that we should wait no longer you have four day in which to make up you mind monsieur i shall need they i do not see why phinuit argue : it be a open and shut proposition if ever there be one but you be ask I to renounce something upon which i have set much store for many year monsieur i can not be expect to do that in a hour or even a day you shall have you answer i promise you by the time we make we landfall -- perhaps before the sooner the better be you sure monsieur but one think it be the tortoise who win the famous race take all the time you need captain monk concede generously to come to a sensible decision but how good you be to I monsieur xxv the malcontent singular though the statement may seem when one remember the condition that circumscribe he freedom of action on board the sybarite that he stand utterly alone in that company of conspirator and they creature alone and unarmed with never a friend to guard he back or even to whisper he one word of counsel warning or encouragement with only he naked wit and hand to fortify and sustain he heart : it be still no exaggeration to say that lanyard get a extraordinary amount of private diversion out of those last few day from the hour when liane delorme phinuit and captain monk in conclave solemnly assemble at the instance of the one last-named communicate they collective mind in respect of he interesting self the man be conscious of implicit confidence in a happy outcome of the business with a conscientiousness less rational than simply feel a sort of bubble exhilaration in he mood that find its most intelligible expression in the phrase which he be wont often to iterate to himself : ça va bien -- that go well that -- the progressive involution of this insane imbroglio -- go very well indeed in lanyard 's reckoning he could hardy wish he could not reasonably demand that it should go better he know now with what design liane delorme have make he a party to this sea adventure and intimate with every detail of the conspiracy and he know to boot why she have offer he the free gift of she love doubt as to the one scruple inspire by the other -- that reluctance which man can not but feel to do a hurt to a heart that hold he dear however scanty he response to its passion -- could no longer influence he to palter in deal with the woman the revelation have in effect stricken shackle from lanyard 's wrist now when he strike it would be with neither hesitation nor compunction as to that stroke alone its hour and place and fashion he remain without decision he have make a hundred plan for its delivery and one of they that seem the wildest he think of seriously as something really feasible but single-handed that make it difficult if only one could devise some way to be in two place at one time and the same a impossibility he would not deny that but lanyard have never be one to be discourage by the grim hard face of a impossibility he have know too many such to dissipate utterly vanish into empty air when subject to a bold and resolute assault he would not say die never that while he could lift hand or invent stratagem never that so long as fool play they game into he hand as this lot wish to and do what imbecility what a escape have be he when in that time long since he have make up he mind to have do with crime once and for all time but for that moment of clear vision and high resolve he might be to-day even as these who have win such clear title to he contempt who stultify themselves with vain imagining and the everlasting concoction of scheme whose sheer intrinsic puerility foredoom they to farcical failure lanyard tread the deck for hour at a time search the star for a answer to the question : what make the law by whose decree man may garner only punishment and disaster where he have husband in iniquity that law implacable inexorable in its ordain and methodic workings through which invariably it come to pass that failure and remorse shall canker in the heart even of success ill-gained but if he moralize it be with a cheerful countenance and he sermon be for himself alone he keep he counsel and speak all man fairly give nowhere any manner of offense : for could he tell in what unlikely guise might wait the instrument he need wherewith to work out he unfaltering purpose and all the while they be watch he and wonder what be in he mind well he give no sign let they watch and wonder to they heart 's content they must wait until the time he have appoint for the rendering of he decision when the sybarite make she landfall wind blow and fall the sea rise and subside the sybarite trudge on into dull weather the sky grow overcast and lanyard daily scanning the very heaven for a sign accept this for one and pray it might hold nothing could be more calculate to nullify he effort than to have the landfall happen on a clear calm night of star he go to bed the last night out leave a noisy gathering in the saloon and read himself drowsy then turn out he light he sleep sometime later he find himself instantaneously awake and alert with a clear head and every faculty on the qui vive -- much as a man might grope for a time in a dark strange room then find a door and step out into broad daylight only there be no light other than in the luminous clarity of he mind even the illumination in the saloon have be dim down for the night as he could tell by the tarnished gleam beneath he stateroom door still not everyone have go to bed the very manner of he wake inform he that he be not alone for the life lanyard have lead have teach he to need no better alarm than the entrance of another person into the place where he lay sleep all animal be like that whose life hang on they vigilance able to see nothing he still feel a presence and know that it wait stirless within arm 's - length of he head without much concern he think of popinot that phantom popinot of monk 's derisive name well if the vision liane have see on deck have take material form here in he stateroom lanyard presume it mean another fight and the last to a finish that be to say to a death without make a sound he gather himself together ready for a trap and as noiselessly lift a hand toward the switch for the electric light set in the wall near the head of the bed but in the same breath he hear a whisper or rather a mutter a voice he could not place in its present pitch awake monsieur delorme it say hush do not make a row and never mind the light he astonishment be so overpowering that instinctively he tensed muscle relax and he hand fall back upon the bedding who the deuce -- not so loud it be I -- mussey lanyard echo witlessly : mussey yes i do not wonder you be surprised but if you 'll be easy you 'll understand pretty soon why i have to have a bit of a talk with you without anybody 's catch on well lanyard say i be damned i say the subdue mutter take on a note of anxiety it be all right be not it i mean you be not go to kick up a rumpus and spill the bean i guess you must think i have get a hell of a gall come in on you like this and i do not know as i blame you but well time 's get short only two more day at sea and i could not wait any longer for a chance to have a few minute ' chin with you the mutter cease and hold a expectant pause lanyard say nothing but he be conscious that the speaker occupy a chair by the bed and know that he be bend near to catch he answer for the air be taint with vinous breath yes : one require no stronger identification it be beyond any doubt the chief engineer of the sybarite say it be all right will not you the mutter plead i be listen lanyard reply -- as you perceive i 'll say it be decent of you -- damned decent blow if i would take it as calm as you if i wake up to find somebody in my room i believe say lanyard pointedly you stipulate for a few minute ' chin with I time pass mr mussey get to you business or let I go to sleep again sharp you be comment the mutter i have notice it in you you would be surprise if you know how much notice i have be take of you and flattered i be sure look here the mutter stumble i want to ask a personal question daresay you 'll think it impertinent if i do be sure i sha not answer it well it be this : be or be not you right name lanyard michael lanyard this time it be lanyard who think rapidly hold the pause so long that he querist 's uneasiness could not contain itself be that my answer i mean do you silence -- that be a unusual name michael lanyard cautiously reply its proprietor how do you get hold of it they say it be the right name of the lone wolf guess i do not have to tell you who the lone wolf be ` they say ' who please be ` they ' oh there be a lot of talk go around the ship you know how it be a crew will gossip and god know they have get enough excuse this cruise this be constructively evasive lanyard wonder who have betray he phinuit the tongue of that plain-spoken man be hinge in the middle but one could not feel certain liane delorme have make much of the chief engineer though she seem less likely to talk too much than anyone of the ship 's company but lanyard himself but then -lrb- one remember of a sudden -rrb- monk and mussey be by reputation old crony it be not inconceivable that monk might have let something slip and what mr mussey if i should admit i be michael lanyard then i 'll have something to say to you something i think 'll interest you why not run the risk of interesting I whoever i may be mussey breathe heavily in the stillness : the breathing of a cautious man loath to commit himself no he say at length in the clearest enunciation he have thus far use no if you be not lanyard i would rather say nothing more -- i 'll just ask you to pardon I for intrude and clear out but you say there be some gossip and where there be smoke there must be fire it would seem safe to assume i be the man gossip say i be michael lanyard the mutter persist -- the lone wolf yes yes what then i suppose the best way 's to put it to you straight i warn you you 'll gain nothing if you do not then to begin at the beginning i have know whit monk a good long time year i have know he we have sail together off and on ever since we take to the sea we have go through some nasty scrape together and do thing that do not bear tell and always share the thick and the thin of everything before this if anybody have ever tell I whit monk would do a pal dirt i would have punch he head and think no more about it but now the mutter falter lanyard preserve a sympathetic silence -- a silence at least which he hope would pass as sympathetic in reality he be struggle to suppress any betrayal of the exultation that be begin to take hold of he premature this might prove to be but it seem impossible to misunderstand the emotion under which the chief engineer be labor or to underestimate its potential value to lanyard surely it would seem that he faith in he star have be well-placed : be it not now -- or all sign fail -- deliver into he hand the forge tool he have so desperately need for which he have so earnestly pray a heavy sigh issue upon the stillness freight with a deep and desolating melancholy for it appear like all cynic mr mussey be a sentimentalist at heart and in the darkness that disembodied voice take up its tale anew i do not have to tell you what be go on between whit and that lot he be so thick with nowadays you know or you would not be here be not that conclusion what you american would call a little previous previous the mutter take a moment to con the full significance of that adjective no : i would not call it that you see on a voyage like this -- well talk go on thing get about thing be say aloud that should not be and get overhear and pass along and the man who sit back and listen and sift what he hear be pretty likely to get a tolerably good line on what be what of course there be never be any secret about what the owner mean to do with all this wine he be ship we all know we be play a risky game but we be for the owner -- he be not a bad sort when you get to know he -- and we 'll go through with it and take what be come to we win or lose partly of course because it 'll mean something handsome for every man if we make it without get catch but if you want to know what i think i 'll tell you something but truly i be all attention i think whit monk and phinuit and mam ` selle have frame the owner between they can not say i quite follow i think they cook up this smuggling business and kid he into it just to get the use of he yacht for they own purpose and at the same time get he where he can not put up a howl if he find out the truth suppose he do the mutter become momentarily a deep-throated chuckle of malice he be in so deep on the booze smuggling side he dassent say a word and that put he in worse yet make he accessory before the fact of criminal practice that would make he hair stand on end then suppose they want to go on with the game looting in europe and sneak the goods into america with the use of he yacht : what be he go to say how 's he go to stop they accept these question as purely rhetorical lanyard offer no comment after a moment the mutter resume : well what do you think be i right or be i wrong who know mr mussey one can only say you seem to know something i 'll say i know something a sight more than whit monk dream i know -- as he 'll find out to he sorrow before he be finish with tom mussey but -- obliquely lanyard strike again at the heart of the mystery which he find so baffling -- you seem so well satisfy with the bona fide of you informant there be a sound of stertorous breathing as the intelligence behind the mutter grapple with this utterance then as if the hint have prove too fine -- i be play my hand face up with you mr lanyard i guess you can tell i know what i be talk about but what i can not see be why you should talk about it to I monsieur why because i and you be both in the same boat in a manner of speak we be both on the outside -- shut out -- look in in a sort of mental aside lanyard reflect that mixed bathing for metaphor be apparently countenance under the code of cynic do one gather that you feel aggrieved with captain monk for not make you a partner in he new association for try to put one over on I a old pal stand by he through thick and thin would have go through fire for whit monk and in my way i have many 's the time and now he hook up with phinuit and this delorme woman and leave I to shuffle my foot on the doormat and think i 'll let he get away with it the voice in the dark give a grunt of infinite contempt : like hell i understand you feeling monsieur and i ask you to believe in my sympathy but you say -- if i remember -- that we be in the same boat you and i whereas i assure you captain monk have not abused my friendship since he have never have it i know that well enough say the mutter i do not mean you have get my reason for feeling sore but i do mean you have get reason enough of you own -- on what grounds do you say that another deliberate pause preface the reply : you say a while ago i know something well -- you say it i and you have both be freeze out of this deal and we be both mean to take a hand whether they like it or not if that do not put we in the same boat i do not know perceive he would get no more satisfaction lanyard school himself to be politic for the time be say it be so then but i think you have something to propose it be simple enough : when two people find themselves in the same boat they have get to pull together if they want to get anywhere you propose then a alliance that be the answer without you i can not do anything but kick over the applecart for whit monk and that sort of revenge be mighty unsatisfactory without I -- well : what can you do i know you can get that tin safe of whit 's open when you feel like it get the jewel and all but what show do you stand to get away with they that be unless you have get somebody work in with you on board the ship see here the mutter sink into a husky whisper and in order to be hear the speaker bent so low over lanyard that fume of whiskey almost suffocate the poor man in he bed you have get a head you have have experience you know how well go to it : make you plan consult with I get everything fix lift the loot i 'll stand by fix up everything so 's you work will go through slick see that you do not get hurt stow the jewel where they will not be find and when it be all over we 'll split fifty-fifty what d'you say extremely ingenious monsieur but unfortunately impracticable that be the last thing state the disappointed whisper i ever think a man like you would say but it be obvious we do not know each other you mean you can not trust I for that matter : how can you be sure you can trust I oh i guess i can size up a square guy when i see he many thanks but why should i trust you when you will not even be quite frank with I how 's that have not i -- one moment : you refuse to name the source of you astonishingly detail information concern this affair -- myself include you wish I to believe you simply assume i be at odds with captain monk and he friend i admit it be true but how should you know it ah no my friend either you will tell I how you learn this secret or i must beg you to let I get my sleep that be easy i hear whit and phinuit talk about you the other night on deck when they do not think anybody be listen lanyard smile into the darkness : no need to fret about fair play toward this one the truth be not in he and by the same token the traditional honor that obtain among thief could not be he say as if content in the manner of a practical man dismiss all immaterial consideration : as you say the time be brief it 'll have to be pull off to-morrow night or not at all the mutter urge with a eager accent my thought precisely for then we come to land do we not yes and it 'll have to be not long after dark we ought to drop the hook at midnight then -- the mutter be break with hopeful anxiety -- then you have decide you 'll stand in with I mr lanyard but of course what else can one do as you have so fairly point out : what be either of we without the other and it be understand : you be to lift the stuff i be to take care of it till we can slip ashore we be to make we getaway together -- and the split 's to be fifty-fifty fair and square i ask nothing better where 's you hand two hand find each other blindly and exchange a firm and inspiring clasp -- while lanyard give thanks for the night that save he face from betray he mind another deep sigh sound a note of apprehension at a end a gruff chuckle follow whit monk he 'll learn something about the way to treat old friend and all at once the mutter merge into a vindictive hiss : he with he air and grace he fine clothes and greasy manners put on the lah-de-dah over they that be stand by he when he have not a red and be glad to cadge drink off spiggoty in hell like the colonel 's at colon -- he but lanyard have be listen only with he ear he have not the slightest interest in mr mussey 's resentment of the affectation of captain monk for now he mad scheme have suddenly assume a complexion of comparative simplicity give the co-operation of the chief engineer all lanyard would need to contribute would be a little headwork a little physical exertion a little daring -- and complete indifference which be both well warrant and already he to abuse the confidence of mr mussey but about this affair to-morrow night he interrupt impatiently : attend to I a little if you please my friend can you give I any idea where we be or will approximately at midnight to-night what be that go to do -- perhaps i ask only for my own information but it may be that i have a plan if we be to work together harmoniously mr mussey you must learn to have a little confidence in I beg you pardon say a humble mutter we ought to be somewhere off nantucket shoal lightship and the weather : have you sufficient acquaintance with these latitudes to foretell it even roughly bear and bring up in edgartown make my first voyage on a tramp out of new bedford : guess i know something about the weather in these latitudes the wind 's be haul round from sou ` west to south all day if it go on to sou'east it 'll likely be thick to-morrow with little wind no sea to speak of and either rain or fog so now to do what i will have to do i must have ten minute of absolute darkness can that be arrange absolute darkness the mutter have a rise inflexion of dubiety how d'you mean complete extinguishing of every light on the ship my god the mutter protest do you know what that mean no light at night under way in main-travelled water why by nightfall we ought to be off block island in traffic as heavy as on fifth avenue no : that be too much too bad lanyard utter philosophic and the thing could have be do be not there some other way not with light to hamper my operation but if some temporary accident be to put the dynamo out of commission -- figure to yourself what would happen there would be hell to pay ah but what else the engine would have to be slow down so as to give no more than steerage-way until oil lamp could be substitute for the binnacle masthead and side-light also for the engine room and there would be excitement and confusion eh everybody would make for the deck even the captain would leave he cabin unguarded long enough i get you -- with a sigh it be wrong all wrong but -- well i suppose it be get to be do lanyard treat himself to a smile of triumph there in the darkness xxvi the binnacle it would have be ungrateful -lrb- lanyard reflect over he breakfast -rrb- to complain of a life so replete with experience of piquant contrast it happen to one to lie for hour in a cubicle of blind night hearken to a voice like that of some nightmare weirdly become articulate a ghostly mutter that rise and fall and drone break by sigh grunt stifle oath mean chuckle with interval of husky whispering and lapse fill with a noise of wheeze respiration all wheedle and cajole lie intimate and evade complain snarl rambling threatening protest promising and in the end propose a unholy compact for treachery and evil-doing -- a voice that might have issue out of some damned soul escape for a little space of time from the pit of torment so utterly inhuman it sound so completely discarnate and divorce from all relationship to any mortal personality that even that reek of whiskey in the air even that one contact with a hard hot hand could not make it seem real and then it cease and be no more but as a thing of dream that have pass and one come awake to a light and wholesome world furnish with such solidly comforting fact as soap and razor and hot and cold saltwater tap and subsequently one leave one 's stateroom to see at the breakfast table leaden-eyed and flush of countenance a amorphous lump of humid flesh in shapeless garment of soil white duck the author of that mutter in the dark who lounge over a plate of broken food and lift a coffee cup in the tremulous hand of a alcoholic look up with lacklustre gaze give a surly nod and mumble the customary matutinal greet : ` morning monseer delorme it be all too weird to add to this the chief engineer pay lanyard no further heed at all though they be alone at table and have noisily consume he coffee rub he stubbled lip and chin with a egg-stained napkin rise and without word or glance roll heavily up the companionway the conduct of a careful man accustom to mind he eye and indisputably correct one never know who might be watch what slightest sign of secret understanding might not be seize upon and read furthermore mr mussey have not still he mutter in the night until they joint and individual line of action have be elaborately map out and agree upon down to the smallest detail it now remain only for lanyard to fill in somehow the waste time that lay between breakfast and the hour appoint then take due advantage of the opportunity promise he he find the day make good mr mussey 's forecast under a dull thick sky the sea run in heavy swell greasy and gray the wind be in the south and light and shifty the horizon be vague captain monk encounter on the quarterdeck have a uneasy eye and curse the weather roundly when lanyard make civil enquiry as to the outlook ça va bien lanyard kill a hour or two in the chartroom acquaint himself with the coast they be approach and trace the sybarite 's probable course toward the spot select from the smuggling transaction he notion of the precise location of the owner 's estate be rather indefinite he have gather from gossip that it be on the connecticut shore of long island sound between new london and new haven where a group of small island -- also the property of mister whitaker monk -- provide fair anchorage between sound and shore as well as a good screen from offshore observation it be not vital to know more : lanyard have neither hope nor fear of ever see that harbor it be the approach alone that interested he and when he have puzzle out that there be only two practicable course for the sybarite to take -- both bearing in a general north-westerly direction from nantucket shoal light vessel one enter block island sound from the east between point judith and block island the other enter the same body of water from the south between block island and montauk point -- and have satisfy himself that manifold peril to navigation hedge about both course more especially they prolongation into long island sound by way of the race : lanyard tell himself it would be strange indeed if he plan miscarry always provide that mr mussey could be trust to hold to he overnight agreement but as to that one entertain few fear one feel quite sure that mr mussey would perform duly to the letter of he covenant it have require only a hour of weigh and analyze with a clear head he overture and utterance as a whole to persuade lanyard that he himself no less than the chief engineer in the phrase of the latter 's boast know something it seem unbelievably stupid and childish what he imagine be behind the gratuitous intermeddling of mr mussey but then he remind himself if there be anything more stupid than to plot a criminal act it be to permit oneself to be influence by that criminal stupidity whose other name be jealousy well whether he be right or wrong the night would declare it and in any event there be no excuse whatever for refuse to profit by the stupidity of man whose mind be bent on vicious mischief the weather thicken as the day grow older towards noon the wind as if weary and discourage with vain endeavor to make up its mind to blow from this quarter or that die away altogether at the same time the horizon appear to close in perceptibly what little definition it have have in earlier hour be erase and the sybarite shear the oily and lifeless water of a dead calm seem less to make progress than to struggle sullenly in a pool of quicksilver at the bottom of a slowly revolving sphere of clouded glass mutinously aware that all she labor work no sort of gain after a hour of this captain monk on the bridge with mr swain arrive at a decision of exasperation through the engine-room ventilator a long jingle of the telegraph be hear and directly the sybarite 's pulse begin to beat in quicker tempo while darker volute of smoke roll in dense volume from she funnel and stream away astern rest low and preserve they individuality as long as visible like a streak of oxidization on a field of frosted silver for the first time since she have leave the harbor of cherbourg the yacht be do herself something like justice in the matter of speed -- and this contrary to all ethic of seamanship on such a day at the luncheon table phinuit venture a light-headed comment on this dangerous procedure whereupon monk turn on he in a cold fury as long as i be master of this vessel sir i 'll sail she accord to the counsel of my own discretion -- and thank you to keep you animadversion to yourself animadversion phinuit echo and make round shocked eye oh i never at least i do not mean anything naughty skipper dear monk snort and grumble over he food throughout the remainder of the meal but later come upon a group compose of liane delorme lanyard and phinuit in the saloon he pause look this way and that to make sure none of the steward be within eavesdropping distance and graciously unbent a little i be make the best time we can while we can see at all he volunteer no tell when this misbegotten fog will close in and force we to slow down to half-speed or less -- in crowded water too and very sensible i be sure phinuit agree heartily whatever happen we mu not be late for we date with friend boss must we we 'll keep it monk promise grimly if we have to feel every inch of we way in with the lead i do not mind tell you this fog may save we skin at that wireless have be pick up chatter all morning between a regular school of revenue cutter patrolling this coast on the lookout for just such idiot as we be so we 'll carry on and trust to luck till we make monk harbor or break we fool neck liane delorme give a start of dismay there be danger then only if we run afoul of a cutter liane monk try to speak reassuringly and that be not likely in this weather as for the fog it be a dirty nuisance to any navigator but as i say may quite possibly prove we salvation i know these water like a book i have sail they ever since i be old enough to tell a tiller from a mainsheet i can smell my way in if it come to that through the blindest fog the atlantic ever brew then you do thing with you nostril too phinuit enquire innocently i have often wonder if all the intellect be located in the eyebrow monk glare growl and hastily seek the air of the deck liane delorme eye phinuit with amuse reproach really my young friend i can not help it mademoiselle phinuit assert sulkily too much be enough i have watch he make face with the top of he head so long i dream of geometrical diagram lay out in eyebrow -- and wake up scream and they call this a pleasure craft with a aggrieved air he suck at he pipe for a few minute besides he add suddenly somebody 's get to be comic relief and i do not notice anybody else in a sweat to be the life and soul of the ship he favor lanyard with a morose stare why do not you ever put you shoulder to the wheel lanyard why leave it all to I come on be a sport cut a caper crack a wheeze do something to get a giggle but i be by no means sure you do not laugh at I too much as it be rot tell you what phinuit sit up with a gleaming eye of inspiration you can entertain mademoiselle and I no end if you like spill the glad tiding glad tiding now do not monkey with the eyebrow -- _ please _ it give I the willie i merely mean to point out to-day 's the day you promise to come through with the awful decision and there be no use wait for monk to join we he be too much worried about he nice little ship tell mademoiselle and I now lanyard shake he head smile but the time i set be when we make we landfall well what be the matter with martha 's vineyard over there you could see if it be a clear day but it be not a clear day suppose it get thicker a sure-enough fog we may not see land before midnight then till midnight we must wait no monsieur phinuit i will not be hurry i have be think i be still think and there be still much to be say before i can come to any decision that will be fair to you mademoiselle the captain on the one hand myself on the other but at midnight if the skipper 's promise hold good we 'll be go ashore the objection be well take my answer will be communicate when we see land or at eleven o'clock to-night whichever be the earlier event some further effort at either persuasion or impudence -- nobody but phinuit ever know which -- be drown out by the first heart-broken bellow of the whistle sound the fog signal liane delorme bound out of she chair clap hand to ear and utter a unheard cry of protest and when the noise suspend temporarily she learn that it be to be repeat at interval of two minute as long as the fog last and the yacht be under way she fling up piteous hand to a uncompassionate heaven and flee to she stateroom slam the door as if she think thereby to shut out the offend din one fancy something inhumanly derisive in the prolonged hoot which reply rather than languish under the burden of mr phinuit 's spirited conversation for the rest of the afternoon lanyard imitate liane 's example and waste the next hour and a half flat on he bed with eye close but mind very much alive now and again he consult he watch as one might with a important appointment to keep at two minute to four he leave he stateroom and as the first stroke of eight bell ring out -- in one of the measure interval between blast of the whistle -- end the afternoon watch he step out on deck and pause for a survey of the weather condition there be no perceptible motion in the air witness that the wind have come in from astern that be to say approximately from the southeast and be blow at about the speed make by the yacht itself the fog cling about the vessel lanyard think like dull gray cotton wool yet if the shuddering of she fabric be fair criterion the pace of the sybarite be unabated she be plough headlong through that dense obscurity use the utmost power of she engine from time to time when the whistle be still the call of seaman operate the sound machine could be hear but they report be monotonously uniform the water be not yet shoal enough for the lead to find bottom at that pace the watch be be change as lanyard start forward with the tail of a eye on the bridge mr collison relieved mr swain and the latter come down the companion-ladder just in time to save lanyard a nasty spill as he foot slip on plank greasy with globule of fog there be no tell how bad a fall he might not have suffer have not mr swain be there for he to catch at and for a moment or two lanyard be as mr swain put it with great good-nature all over he cling to the first officer in a most demonstrative manner and it be with some difficulty that he at length recover he equilibrium then however he lay hold of the rail for insurance against further mishap thank mr swain heartily add he apology and the two part with expression of mutual esteem the incident seem to have dampen lanyard 's ardor for exercise he make a rather gingerly way back to the quarterdeck loaf restlessly in a deck-chair for a little while then go below once more some time after supine again upon he bed he hear mr swain in the saloon querulously interrogate one of the steward it appear that mr swain have unaccountably mislay he key and he want to know if the steward have see anything of they the steward have not he say and lanyard for one know that he speak sooth since at that moment the miss key be rest on the bottom of the sea several mile astern -- all but one there be no dress for dinner that night liane delorme she nerve rasp almost beyond endurance by the relentless fog signal prefer the seclusion of she stateroom lanyard be not really sorry the bosom of a white shirt be calculate to make some impression upon the human retina even on the darkest night whereas he plain lounge suit of blue serge be sure to prove entirely inconspicuous so if he miss the feminine influence at table he bear up with good fortitude and after dinner he segregate himself as usual in he favorite chair near the taffrail the fog if anything denser than before manufacture a early dusk of a peculiarly depressing violet shade nevertheless evening be long in that season of the year and to lanyard it seem that the twilight would never quite fade out completely true night would never come long before it do speed be slacken : the yacht be at last in sounding the call of the leadsman be as monotonous as the whistle blast and almost as frequent lanyard could have do without both if the ship could not he remark a steadily intensify exacerbation of nerve and tell himself he be grow old and no mistake he could remember the time when he could have endure a strain of wait comparable to that which he must suffer now and have turn never a hair how long ago it seem another sign that the sybarite have enter what be technically classify as inland water where special rule of the road apply be to be remark in the fact that the fog signal be now roar once each minute whereas lanyard have grow accustomed to time the interval between the sound of the ship 's bell upon which all he interest hang at the rate of fifteen blast to the half hour if you ask he once a minute seem rather too much of a good thing even in busy lane of sea traffic still it be better perhaps than unpremeditated disaster one be not keen about have the sybarite ground on a sandbank pile up on a rock or dash she brain out against the bulk of another vessel -- before eleven o'clock at earliest in retrospect he count those two hour between dinner and ten-thirty longer than the fortnight which have preface they so be the heart of man ever impatient when the journey 's - end draw near though that end be but the beginning as well of that longer journey which man call death lest he betray he impatience by keep the tip of he cigarette too bright -lrb- one never know when one be not watch -rrb- he smoke sparingly but on the twenty-eighth blare of the whistle after the ringing of four bell he draw out he cigarette case and as the thirtieth rave out synchronous with two double stroke and a single on brazen metal he place a cigarette between he lip at the same time he see captain monk who have be on the bridge with the officer of the watch for several hour come aft with weary shoulder sag and go below by the saloon companionway and lanyard smile knowingly and assure himself that go well -- ça va bien -- he star hold still in the ascendant there remain on the bridge only mr collison and the man at the wheel at the fourth blast after five bell lanyard put a match to he cigarette but he do not puff more than to get the tobacco well alight he even hold he breath and feel he body shake by the pulsation of he anxious heart precisely as the body of the sybarite be shake by the pulsation of she engine with the next succeed fog signal darkness absolute descend upon the vessel shroud it from stem to stern like a vast blanket of blackness mr mussey have not fail to keep he pact of treachery lanyard be out of he chair before the first call of excited remonstrance ring out on deck -- to be echo in clamor he cigarette stop behind on the taffrail carefully place at precisely the height of he head its little glowing tip the only spot of light on the deck no matter whether or not it be note no precaution be too insignificant to be important when life and death be at issue there be nothing of that afternoon 's unsureness of foot in the way lanyard move forward pass the engine-room ventilator he hear the telegraph give a single stroke mr collison have only then recover from he astonishment sufficiently to signal to slow down a squeal of the speaking-tube whistle follow instantly and lanyard set foot upon the bridge in time to hear mr collison demand to know what the sanguinary hade have happen down there whatever reply he get seem to exasperate he into incoherence he stutter with rage gasp and address the man at the wheel i have get a flash-lamp in my cabin that 'll show we the compass card at least stand by while i run down and get it the man mumble a aye aye sir retreat footstep be just audible neither speaker have be visible to lanyard by put out a hand he could have touch the helmsman but he body make not even the shadow of a silhouette against the sky the fog be render the night the simple and unqualified negation of light and in that time of stygian gloom violence be do swiftly surely and without mercy with pity yes and with regret lanyard be sorry for the man at the wheel but what be to be do could not be do in any other way the surprise aid he for the fellow offer barely a show of opposition he astounded faculty have no more than recognize the call for resistance when he be powerless in lanyard 's hand swing bodily away from the wheel he go over the rail to the forward deck like a bag of sugar immediately lanyard turn to the binnacle sensitive finger located the key-hole in the pedestal the one key save from the ring which mr swain have so unfortunately and unaccountably lose open the door -- the key of course that mr swain have use under lanyard 's eye when demonstrate the function of the binnacle to liane delorme thrust a hand into the opening lanyard grope for the adjustable magnet in they rack and one by one remove and drop they to the grate at the foot of the binnacle he work with hand amazingly nimble and sure and be close and relock the door when mr collison tumble up the ladder with he flash-light so when the second mate arrive upon the bridge lanyard be wait for he and in consequence of a second act of deplorable violence mr collison return to the deck backwards and lay quite still while lanyard return to the wheel collect the abstracted magnet he carry they to the rail cast they into the sea and throw in the key to the little door to keep they company then back at the binnacle he unscrew the brass cap of the cylindrical brass tube which house the flinder bar remove that also replace the cap and consign the bar to the sea in its turn by choice he would have make a good job of it and abolish the quadrantal corrector as well but he judge he have do mischief enough to secure he end as it be the compass ought now to be just as constant to the magnetic pole as a humming-bird to one especial rise guide himself by a hand that lightly touch the rail lanyard regain he chair carefully compose himself in the position in which he have be rest when the light go out he cigarette be still aglow good turkish have this virtue among many other that leave to itself it will burn on to the end of its roll the next instant however he be on he foot again a beam of light have sweep across the saloon skylight come from below the beam of a portable electric torch it might have be the signal for the first pierce scream of liane delorme a pistol shot with a vicious accent cut short the scream after a brief pause several more shot ripple in the saloon a man shout angrily then the torch-light find and steady upon the mouth of the companionway against that glare a burly figure be instantaneously relieved run up to the deck as it gain the topmost step a final report sound in the saloon and the figure check revolve slowly on a heel totter and plunge headforemost down the step again a moment later -lrb- incredible that the stipulate ten minute should have pass so swiftly -rrb- the light come on and with a still-fuming stump of cigarette between he finger lanyard go below he bewildered gaze discover first liane delorme draw up rigidly -- she seem for some reason to be stand tiptoe -- against the starboard partition near she stateroom door she finger be claw she cheek she eye widely dilate with horror and fright she mouth be agape and from it issue as by some mechanical impulse shriek upon hollow shriek -- cry wholly flat and meaningless have no character of any sort mere automatic reflex of hysteria on the opposite side of the saloon not far from the door to he own quarter monk lay semi-prone with a purple face and protrude eyeball far go toward death through strangulation phinuit on he knee be remove a silk handkerchief that have be twist about that scrawney throat at the foot of the companionway step popinot no phantom but the veritable apache himself be writhe and heave convulsively and even as lanyard look the huge body of the creature lift from the floor in one last heroic spasm then collapse and move no more view this hideous tableau appreciate what it mean -- that popinot forearm with advice from a trust quarter have station himself outside the door to monk 's stateroom to waylay and garotte the man whom he expect to emerge therefrom laden with the plunder of monk 's safe -- lanyard appreciate further that he have do mr mussey a great wrong for he have all the time believe that the chief engineer be lay a trap for he on behalf of he ancient shipmate that unhappy victim of groundless jealousy captain whitaker monk xxvii ça va bien fearful lest leave to herself liane delorme would do a injury to he eardrum as well as to she own vocal chord lanyard step across the dead bulk of the apache and plant himself squarely in front of the woman seize she forearm with he two hand he use force to drag they down to the level of she waist and purposely make he grasp so strong that he finger sink deep into the soft flesh at the same time stare fixedly into she vacant eye he smile he most winning smile but with the muscle of he mouth alone and say quietly : shut up liane stop make a fool of yourself shut up -- do you hear the incongruity of he brutal grasp with he smile add to the incongruity of a ordinary conversational tone with he peremptory and savage phrase have the expected effect sanity begin to inform the violet eye a shrill empty scream be cut sharply in two the woman stare for a instant with a look of confusion then she lash droop she body relax she fall limply against the partition and be quiet save for fit of tremble that shake she body from head to foot still each successive seizure be sensibly less severe lanyard let go she wrist there he say -- that be over liane the beast be do for -- no more to fear from he now forget he -- brace up and realize the debt you owe good monsieur phinuit with a grin that gentleman look up from he effort to revive captain monk i be a shy retire violet he state somewhat superfluously but if the world will kindly lend its ear i 'll inform it coyly that be _ some _ shootin ' have a look will you lanyard like a good fellow and make sure we little friend over there be not play ` possum on we seem to I i have hear of he do something like that before -- maybe you remember and mademoiselle if you 'll be kind enough to fetch I that carafe of ice water i 'll see if we can not bring the skipper to he sens such as they be he tone be sufficiently urgent to rouse liane out of the lassitude into which reaction from terror have let she slip she pass a hand over still daze eye look uncertainly about then with perceptible exertion of will power collect herself stand away from the partition and pick up the carafe lanyard adopt the sensible suggestion of phinuit drop on a knee to rest he hand above the heart of popinot to he complete satisfaction if not at all to he surprise no least flutter of life be to be detect in that barrel-like chest a moment longer he linger look the corpse over with inquisitive eye no sign that he could see suggest that popinot have suffer hardship during he two week of close sequestration he seem to have fare well as to food and drink and he clothing if nothing to boast of in respect of cut or cloth and though wrinkled and stretch with constant wear be tolerably clean -- unstained by bilge grease or coal smut as it must have be have the man be hide in the hold or bunker those traditional refuge of you simon-pure stowaway no : monsieur popinot have be well take care of -- and lanyard could name a officer of prestige ponderable enough to secure he quarter wherein presumably popinot have lie perdu against search when the yacht have be turn inside out accord to its commander so this be the source of mr mussey 's exact understanding of the business as to the question of how the apache have be smuggle aboard and when lanyard never learn the truth circumstance be to prevent he interrogate mr mussey and he could only assume that -- since popinot could hardly have be in the motor car wreck on the road from paris -- he must have leave that pursuit to trust confrères and anticipate they possible failure have hurry on to cherbourg by another route to make precautionary arrangement with mr mussey ah well no fault could be find with the fellow for lack of determination and tenacity on the point of rise lanyard reconsider and bend over the body run clever hand rapidly through the clothing turn out every pocket and heap the miscellany of rubbish thus bring to light upon the floor -- with a single exception popinot have possess a pistol a excellent automatic why he have not use it to protect himself heaven only know presumably he have be too thoroughly engross in the exercise of he favorite sport to think of the weapon up to the time when phinuit have open fire on he and then throw into panic he have be able to entertain one think only that of escape lanyard entertain for a moment a vivid imaginary picture of the scene in the saloon when phinuit have surprise the apache in the act of strangle monk a picture that phinuit subsequently confirm substantially in every detail one see the garroter creep through the blackness of the saloon from he hide place forward in the cabin of the chief engineer station himself at the door to monk 's quarter with he chosen weapon that deadly handkerchief of he trade ready for the throat of the lone wolf when he should emerge in accordance with he agreement with mr mussey the spoil of the captain 's safe in he hand then one see monk alarm by the sudden failure of the light hurry out to return to the bridge the pantherish spring upon the victim 's back the swift dextrous noosing of the handkerchief about he windpipe the merciless tightening of it -- all abruptly illuminate by the white glare of phinuit 's electric torch and then the truncate crimson of the first pistol flash the frantic effort to escape the hunting of that gross shape of flesh by the beam of light and the bullet as popinot double and twist round the saloon like a rat in a pit the last mad plunge for the companionway the flight up its step that have by the narrowest margin fail to save he phinuit and liane delorme be too busy to heed quietly lanyard slip the pistol into a pocket and get to he foot then swain come charge down the step to find out what all the row be about and to report -- which he do as soon as monk be sufficiently recover to understand -- those outrageous and darkly mysterious assault upon the helmsman and mr collison both man he state be unfit for further duty that night though neither -lrb- lanyard be happy to learn -rrb- have suffer any permanent injury but what -- in the name of insanity -- could have inspire such a meaningless atrocity what could its perpetrator have hope to gain what -- monk stretch out upon a leather couch in he sitting-room level eyebrow of suspicion at lanyard who counter with a guilelessness so perfect as to make it appear that he do not even comprehend the insinuation if i may offer a suggestion he say with become diffidence well monk demand with a snap despite he languor what be on you mind it would seem to a benevolent neutral like myself you understand i be in my deck-chair by the taffrail throughout all this affair the man at the sound machine nearby can tell you i do not move before the shot in the saloon -- how the devil could they know that in the dark i be smoking monsieur they must if they look have see the fire of my cigarette as i be about to suggest : it would seem to I that there must be some obscure but not necessarily unfathomable connection between the three event else how should they synchronise so perfectly how do popinot know the light would go out a few minute after five bell he be prepare he lose no time how do the other miscreant whoever he be know it would be safe to commit that wickedness whatever its purpose upon the bridge at precisely that time for plainly he too be prepare to act upon the instant -- that be if i understand mr swain 's report correctly and how do it happen that the dynamo go out of commission just then what _ do _ happen in the engine-room do anybody know i think monsieur if you find out the answer to that last question you will have go some way toward solve you mystery captain monk address mr swain curtly : it be the chief 's watch in the engine-room yes sir i 'll have a talk with he presently and go further into this affair in the meantime how do she stand under steerage way only -- mr swain consult the tell-tale compass affix to the deck-beam overhead -- sou ` west-by-south sir must have swing off during that cursed dark spell when i come below two or three minute before we be head into the race west-nor ` west have leave cerberus shoal whistle buoy to port about fifteen minute earlier get she back on that course if you please mr swain and proceed at half-speed do not neglect you sounding i 'll join you as soon as i feel fit very good sir mr swain withdraw captain monk let he head sink back on its pillow and shut he eye liane delorme solicitously stroke he forehead the captain open he eye long enough to register adoration with the able assistance of the eyebrow liane smile down upon he divinely lanyard think that affection be a beautiful thing but preserve a duly concerned countenance i could do with a whiskey and soda monk confess feebly no not you please -- as liane offer to withdraw the compassionate hand -- phin be not busy mr phinuit hasten to make himself useful a muted echo of the engine-room telegraph be audible then and the engine take up again they tireless chant lanyard cock a sly eye at the tell-tale it designate they course as west-by-north a quarter west he be cheer to think that he labor at the binnacle be bear fruit and grateful that monk be so busy be a invalid wait upon and pity by a beautiful volunteer nurse that he be willing to trust the navigation to mr swain and have no time to observe by the tell-tale whether or not the course he have prescribe be be follow liane 's exquisite and tender arm support the suffering head of captain monk as he absorb the nourishment serve by phinuit the eyebrow make a affectingly faint try at a gesture of gratitude the eye close once more monk 's head repose upon the pillow he sigh like a weary child from the saloon come sound of shuffling foot and mumble voice as seaman carry away all that be mortal of monsieur popinot between roar of the fog signal six bell vibrate on the air phinuit cock he head intelligently to one side ransack he memory and look brightly to lanyard ar-har he murmur -- the fatal hour lanyard give he a gracious smile in attenuate accent captain monk without open he eye or stir under the caress of that lovely hand enquire : what say phin i be just remind monsieur lanyard the fatal hour have strike old thing the eyebrow knit in painful effort to understand when one have narrowly escape death by strangulation one may be pardon some slight mental haziness besides it make to retain sympathy not to be too confoundedly clear-headed fatal hour the dear man promise to turn in he answer to we unselfish little proposition at six bell to-night and not later really the voice be interested and so be the eyebrow but monk be at pain not to move and have he not yet old egg monk open expectant eye and fix they upon lanyard 's face the eyebrow acquire a slant of amiable enquiry there be much to be say lanyard temporise that be if you feel strong enough oh quite monk assure he in tone barely audible must it be a blow to the poor dear phinuit enquire i hope not very truly -lrb- the tell-tale now betray a course northwest-by-north have the binnacle compass then go out of its head altogether on find itself bereft of its accustomed court of counter-attraction -rrb- well here we all be sit forward on the edge of we chair hold onto the seat with both hand ear prick forward eye shine the suspense phinuit avowed be something fierce i be sorry what d'you mean you be sorry you be not go to back out have never walk into the arrangement you propose it would be difficult to back out -- would it not monk forget that he be suffer acutely forget even the beautiful and precious hand that be soothing he fevered brow and rudely shake it off sit up suddenly the eyebrow be distinctly minatory above eye that loose ugly gleam you refuse lanyard slowly incline he head : i regret i must beg to be excuse you damned fool pardon monsieur a look of fury convulse liane 's face phinuit too be glare no longer a humourist monk 's mouth be work and he eyebrow have get out of hand altogether i say you be a damned fool -- but be not that a matter of personal viewpoint at least the question would seem to be open to debate if you think argument will satisfy we -- but my dear captain monk i be really not at all concern to satisfy you however if you wish to know my reason for decline the honor you would thrust upon I they be at you service i 'll be glad to hear they say monk grimly one i fancy will do as well as a dozen it be then my consider judgment that be i in the least inclined to resume the evil way of my past -- as i be not -- i would be as you so vividly put it a damned fool to associate myself with people of a low grade of intelligence want even enough to hold fast that which they have thieve by god monk bring down a thump fist what be you get at you hopeless inefficiency monsieur forgive my bluntness come through phinuit advise in a dangerous voice just what do you mean i mean that you know i have but one object in submit to association with you in any way to wit the recovery of the jewel of madame de montalais and they restoration to that lady have not have sufficient wit to prevent my secure those jewel under you very nose you mean to say you have steal they lanyard nod they be at present in my possession -- if that confess a act of theft monk laugh discordantly then i say you be a liar monsieur the lone wolf as well as a fool he fist smite the desk again the montalai jewel be here lanyard shrug when do you lift they phinuit demand with sarcasm tell we that lanyard smile a exasperating smile lounge low in he chair and look at the deck beam -- take occasion to note that the tell-tale have swing to true northwest ça va bien why you insane impostor monk storm -- i have that box in my own hand no later than this afternoon without move lanyard direct he voice toward the ceiling do you by any chance open it and see what be inside there be no answer and though he be careful not to betray any interest by watch they he be well aware that look of alarm and suspicion be be exchange by those three so much for enjoy the prestige of a stupendously successful criminal past a single thought be in the mind of liane delorme captain monk and mr phinuit : with the lone wolf nothing be impossible liane delorme say abruptly in a choke voice : open the safe please captain monk i 'll do nothing of the sort go on phinuit advise -- make sure if it be true we get they back do not we if it be not we show he up for a pitiful bluff it be a dodge monk declare to get the jewel where he can lay hand on they the safe stay shut open it i beg you liane implore in tremulous accent no -- why not phinuit argue what can he do i have get he cover and i lanyard interject softly as you all know be unarmed please liane insist there be a pause which end in a sullen grunt from monk lanyard smile cheerfully and sit up in he chair watch the captain while he unlock the door in the pedestal and with shake finger manipulate the combination dial liane delorme leave she chair to stand nearby in undissembled anxiety only phinuit remain as he have be lounge back and watch lanyard narrowly he automatic pistol dangle between he knee lanyard offer he a pleasant smile phinuit scowl forbiddingly in response monk swing open the safe-door seize the metal despatch-box by the handle and set it upon the desk with a bang then extract he pocket key-ring he select the proper key and make several attempt to insert it in the slot of the lock but he confidence be so shake he morale so impaired by lanyard 's sublime effrontery add to he recent shocking experience that the gaunt hand tremble beyond he control and it be several seconds before he succeed lanyard give no sign but he heart sink he have exhaust he last resource to gain time he be now at he wit ' end only he star could save he now monk turn the key but all at once forget he purpose and with hand stay upon the lid of the box pause and cock he ear attentively to rumor of excitement and confusion on the deck the instinct of the seafaring man uppermost monk stiffen grow rigid from head to foot one hear hurry foot outcry a sudden jangle of the engine-room telegraph monsieur monsieur liane implore open that box the word be on she lip when she be throw off she foot by a frightful shock which stop the sybarite dead in full career before the screw reverse in obedience to the telegraph could grip the water and lessen she momentum the woman cannon against monk shoulder he bodily aside instinctively snatch at the box monk succeed only in drag it to the edge of the desk before a second shock accompany by a grind crash of steel and timber seem to make the yacht leap like a live thing stricken mortally she heel heavily to starboard the despatch-box go to the floor with a thump lose in the greater din liane delorme be propel headlong into a corner monk throw to he knee phinuit lift out of he chair and flung sprawl into the arm of lanyard who pin down by the other 's weight in he own chair feel this last slide backwards to starboard and bring up against a partition with a bang that drive the breath out of he in one enormous gust he retain however sufficient presence of mind neatly to disarm phinuit before that one guess what he be about after that second blow the sybarite remain at a standstill but the continue beating of she engine cause she to quiver painfully from truck to keelson as if in agony of death such as those which have mark the end of popinot of a sudden the engine cease and there be no more movement of any sort only a appalling repose with silence more dreadful still lanyard have no means to measure how long that dumb suspense last which be impose by the stunned faculty of all on board it seem interminable eventually he see monk pick himself up and make strange moan noise like a wounded animal throw himself upon the door jerk it open and dash out as if he have only need that vision of action to animate he lanyard throw phinuit off so that he stagger across the slanting floor toward the door when he bring himself up by catch hold of its frame he be under the threat of he own pistol in lanyard 's hand he linger for a moment show lanyard a distraught and vacant face then apparently realize he danger fade away into the saloon with a roughness dictate by the desperate extremity lanyard stride over to liane delorme where she still crouch in she corner stare witlessly catch she by one arm fairly jerk she to she foot and thrust she stumble out into the saloon close the door behind she he shoot its bolt he go to work swiftly then in a fever of haste in he ear the clamor of the shipwrecked man upon the deck be only a distant droning hardly recognize for what it be by he who have not one think other than to make all possible advantage of every precious instant and so with the roar of steam from the escape-valve strip off coat and waistcoat he take from the pocket of the latter the wallet that hold he papers then rip open he shirt and unbuckle the money belt round he waist its pocket be ample and fit with trustworthy fastening and all but one that hold a few english sovereign be empty the jewel of madame de montalais go into they as rapidly as he finger could move thus engage he hear a pistol explode in the saloon and see the polished writing-bed of the captain 's desk score by a bullet he gaze shift to the door he discover a neat round hole in one of its rosewood panel at the same time to the tune of another report a second hole appear and the bullet wing above the desk bury itself in the after-bulkhead between the dead-light a stream of bullet follow one after another bore the stout panel as if they consistency have be that of cheese lanyard step out of they path and hug the partition while he finish stuff the jewel into the belt and place the thin wallet beneath it strap it tightly round he once more that would be phinuit out there no doubt disdain to waste time break in the door or perhaps fear he reception once it be down a innocent and harmless amusement if he enjoy it that it seem a pity to interrupt at the same time it grow annoy the door be take on the look of a sieve and the neighborhood of the deadlight lanyard 's sole avenue of escape be be well peppered something would have to be do about it lanyard complete he preparation by kick off he shoe and take up another notch in the belt that support he trousers if the swim before he prove a long one he could get rid of he garment in the water readily enough if on the other hand the shore prove to be close at hand it would be more convenable to land at least half clothed then -- the fusillade continue without intermission save when the man outside stop long enough to extract a empty clip and replace it with one load -- lanyard edge along the partition to the door calculate the stand of the lunatic in the saloon from the angle at which the bullet be come through and empty the pistol he have take from phinuit at the panel as fast as he could pull trigger there be no more firing he toss aside the empty weapon make sure of popinot 's on he hip approach one of the deadlight place a chair climb upon it and with infinite pain manage to wriggle and squirm head and shoulder through the open it be very fortunate for he indeed that the sybarite happen to have be build for pleasure yachting with deadlight uncommonly large for the sake of air and light else he would have be oblige to run the risk of open the door to the saloon and fight he way out and up to the deck as it be the business be difficult enough he have to work one of he arm out after he shoulder and then twist round strain and claw at the smooth overhang of the stern until able to catch the outer lip of the scupper above after that he have to lift and drag the rest of he out through the deadlight and hanging by fingertip work he way round inch by inch until it seem possible to drop into the sea and escape hit the screw in point of fact he barely miss splitting himself in two on the thing and on come to the surface cling to it while take such observation as one might in that befogged blackness impossible to guess which way to strike out : the fog hang low upon the water grey its smooth gently heave black surface he could see nothing on either beam at length however he hear through the hissing uproar of escape steam a mournful bell somewhere off to port which he at first take for a buoy then perceive to be toll with a regularity inconsistent with the eccentric action of wave time by pulsebeat it strike once every fifteen seconds or thereabout : undoubtedly the fog signal of some minor light-house in confirmation of this conclusion lanyard hear from the deck above the resonant accent of captain monk clearly articulate in that riot of voice apparently storm at hapless mr swain do not you hear that bell you ass do not that tell you what you have do you have pile we on the rock off the eastern end of plum island and god in heaven only know how you manage to get so far off the course breathing to the night air thanks which would have drive captain monk mad could he have hear they lanyard let go the bronze blade and strike out for the melancholy bell ten minute later the finger of one hand -- he be swim on he side -- at the bottom of its stroke touch pebble he lower he foot and wade through extensive shallows to a wide and sandy beach xxviii finale the window of the living-room in he suite at the walpole set high in cliff-like wall command a southward vista of fifth avenue whose enchantment clothe in ever change guise of light and shade be so potent that lanyard on the first day of he tenancy think it could never tire yet by noon of the third he be view it with the eye of soul-destroying ennui though the disfavor it have so quickly win in he sight be he know due less to cloying familiarity than to the uncertainty and discontent that be eat out he heart three day before immediately on arrive in new york and install himself in this hotel to whose management he be well know from other day he have cable eve de montalai and wertheimer the response to the latter -- a cheerful request that credit be arrange for he by cable -- be as prompt and satisfactory as he have expect it to be but from madame de montalais he hear nothing mission successful he have wire -- return france by la savoie in five day have arrange safe transportation you property -- please advise if you can meet I in pari to receive same or you command otherwise and to this silence only -- silence to he to whom word of she dictation however few and terse and filter through no matter how many indifferent medium of intelligence would have be precious beyond expression so it be that as hour follow hour and the tale of they lengthen into day he fall into a temper of morbid brooding that be little like the man and instead of fare abroad and seek what amusement he might find in the most carefree city of the post-war world shut himself up in he room and mope indifferent to all thing but the knock at he door the stridulation of the telephone bell that might announce the arrival of the desire message and so it be that when the telephone do ring -- at last -- towards noon of that third day he fairly stumble over himself in he haste to reach the instrument but the animation with which he answer the professional voice at the other end of the wire fade very quickly the look of weariness return he accent voice a indifference fairly desolating yesoh yesvery wellye at once he return to he view from the window and be hate it with all he heart when a stout knuckle on he door announce he caller they file into the room with a cheerfulness of mien in striking contrast to the weary courtesy with which lanyard receive they : liane delorme first then monk then phinuit rather bleached of color and wear one arm in a sling all very smart in clothes conspicuously new and as costly as the avenue afford striking figure of contentment in prosperity it be a pleasure indeed lanyard gravely acknowledge they several salutation -- not i must confess altogether unexpected but a pleasure none the less so you do not think we would be long spot you in the good little old town phinuit enquire have a notion you think the best way to lose we would be to put up at this well-known home of the highest price no lanyard reply i never think to be rid of you without one more meeting -- then there be good in the old bean yet phinuit interrupted in waste irony one cherish that hope monsieurbut the trail i leave for you to follow i would be a ass indeed if i think you would fail to find it when one borrow a rowboat at plum island light without ask permission -- government property too -- and leave it moor to a dock on the greenport waterfront when one arrive in greenport clothe in shirt and trousers only and have to bribe its pardonably suspicious inhabitant with handful of british gold -- which they be the more loath to accept in view of its present depreciation -- in order to secure a slopchest coat and shoe and transportation by railway to new york when a taxicab chauffeur refuse a sovereign for he fare from the pennsylvanium station to this hotel and one be constrain to borrow from the management -- why i should say the trail be fairly broad and well blaze me amis be that as it may say phinuit -- here in a manner of speak we all be at least the happy family reunite and ready to talk business and no hard feeling monsieur phinuit there will be none -- monk 's eyebrow be at once sardonic and self-satisfied which speak volume for they versatility -- at least none on we side -- when we be finish that make I more happy still and you liane the woman give a negligent movement of pretty shoulder one begin to see how very right you be michael she say wearily -- and always be for that matter if one wish to do wrong one should do it all alone and escape be bore to death by the oh the unpardonable stupidity of associate but no monsieur she insist with temper as monk and phinuit simultaneously fly signal of resentment i mean what i say i wish i have never see any of you i be sick of you all what do i tell you when you insist on come here to see monsieur lanyard that you would gain nothing and perhaps lose much but you would not listen to I you find it impossible to believe there could be in all the world a man who keep he word not only to other but to himself you be so lose in admiration of you own cleverness in backing that poor little ship off the rock and let she fill and sink so that there could be no evidence of wrong-doing against you that you must try to prove you wit once more where they have always fail -- she illustrate with a dramatic gesture -- against he you say to yourselve : since we be wrong he must be wrong and since that be now clearly prove that he be as wrong in every way as we then it follow naturally that he will heed we threat and surrender to we those jewelsthose jewel she declare bitterly which we would have be fortunate never to have hear of she throw herself back in she chair and show they a scornful shoulder compress indignant lip to a straight unlovely line and beat out the devil 's tattoo with she slipper lanyard watch she with a puzzle smile how much of this be act how much if anything a expression of true feeling be she actually persuade it be waste of time to contend against he or be she shrewdly play upon he not unfriendly disposition toward she in the hope that it would spare she in the hour of the grand débâcle he could be sure of one thing only : since she be a woman he would never know monk have be make ominous motion with the eyebrow but phinuit make haste to be beforehand with he you say one thing mademoiselle one thing anyway that mean something : that monsieur lanyard would give up those jewel to we that be all arrange lanyard turn to he with genuine amusement indeed monsieur indeed and everything we do not want to pull any rough stuff on you lanyard and we will not unless you force we to -- rough stuff monsieur you mean physical force not exactly but i think you 'll recall my tell you i stand in well with the police department in the old home town maybe you think that be swank likely you do but it be not i have get a couple of friend of mine from headquarters wait downstairs this very minute ready and willing to cop out the honor of put the lone wolf under arrest for steal the montalai jewel but be it possible lanyard protest you still do not understand I be it possible you still believe i be a thief at heart and interested in those jewel only to turn they to my own profit he stare unbelievingly at the frosty eye of monk beneath they fatuously stubborn brow at the hard unyielding eye of phinuit you say it this last reply with brevity it be a good bluff while it last monsieur lanyard monk add but it could not last forever you can not get away with it why not give in gracefully admit you be lick for once be a good fellow my god lanyard pronounce in comic despair -- it pass understand it be true then -- and true especially of such as you be to-day as i be in my yesterday -- that ` whom fortune wish to destroy she first make mad ' for i give you my word of honor you seem to I quite mad monsieur too mad to be allow at large and in proof of my sincerity i propose that you shall not longer remain at large what be that monk demand startled why you have not hesitate to threaten I with the police so now i in my turn have the honor to inform you that anticipate this call i have have relay of detective wait in this hotel day and night with instruction to guard the door as soon as you be show up to my room be advise mr phinuit and forget you pistol even to show it in this city would make matter infinitely worse for you than they be he be lie monk insist put a restrain hand on phinuit 's arm as that one start from he chair in rage and panic he would not dare would i not then since you believe nothing till it be prove to you messieur permit I lanyard cross rapidly to the hall door and fling it open -- and fall back a pace with a cry of amazement at the threshold stand not the detective whom he have expect to see but a woman with a cable message form in one hand the other lift to knock madame lanyard gasp -- madame de montalais the cable-form flutter to the floor as she enter with a gladness in she face that be carry out by the impulsive gesture with which she give he she hand my dear friend she cry happily -- i be so glad and to think we have be guest of the same hotel for three livelong day and never know it i arrive by la touraine Saturday but you message telegraph back from combe-redonde reach I not five minute ago i telephone the desk they tell I the number of you room and -- here i be but i can not believe my sens with unanimous consent jule phinuit and monk uprose and make for the door only to find it block by the substantial form of a plain citizen with he hand in he pocket and understanding in he eye steady gent he counsel coolly order be to let everybody in and nobody out without mr lanyard say so for a moment they hang in doubt and consternation consulting one another with dismayed stare then phinuit make as if to shoulder the man aside but for the sake of the moral effect the latter casually exhibit a pistol and the moral effect of that be stupendous mr phinuit disconsolately slouch back into the room grasp the situation eve de montalai turn to the quartet eye that glimmer in a face otherwise quite compose but how surprising she declare madame la comtesse de lorgnes -- monsieur monk -- mr phinuit -- how delightful to see you all again the civility meet with inadequate appreciation nothing could be more opportune lanyard declare for it be to this lady madame de montalais and to these gentleman that you owe the recovery of you jewel truly as i be tell you but for they they charming hospitality in invite I to cruise aboard they yacht but for the assistance they lend I though sometimes unconsciously i admit -- i should never have be able to say to you to-day : you jewel be in a safe place madame immediately at you disposal but how can i thank they well say lanyard if you ask I i think we have detain they long enough i believe they would be most grateful to be permit to leave and keep they numerous and press appointment elsewhere i be entirely of you mind monsieur lanyard nod to the man in the doorway -- all right mr murray -- and he stand indifferently aside in silence the three man move to the door and out phinuit with a brazen swagger jule without emotion visible monk with eyebrow adroop and flap but lanyard interpose when liane delorme would have follow a moment liane if you will be so good she pause regard he with a sombre and inscrutable face while he produce from he coat-pocket a fat envelope without endorsement this be

keep such papers liane good-bye the envelope be unsealed lift the flap the woman half withdraw the enclosure recognize it at a glance and crush it in a convulsive grasp while the blood ebb swiftly from she face throw she rouge into livid relief for a instant she seem about to speak then bow she head in dumb acknowledgment and leave the room lanyard nod to mr murray who amiably close the door
