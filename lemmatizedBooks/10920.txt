method of begin the story of two year ago by a scene which happen but a month since and yet will not the story be on that very account a better type of many a man 's own experience how few of we have learn the meaning of two year ago until this late quiet autumn time and till christmas too with its gap in the old ring of friendly face never to be fill up again on earth begin to teach we somewhat of its lesson two year ago while pestilence be hover over we and ours while the battle-roar be ring in we ear who have time to think to ask what all that mean to seek for the deep lesson which we know must lie beneath two year ago be the time for work for man to do with all they might whatsoever they hand find to do but now the storm have lull once more the air have clear awhile and we can talk calmly over all the wonder of that sudden strange and sad two year ago so feel at least two friend who go down just one week before christmas-day to whitbury in berkshire two year ago have come to one of they as to thousand more the crisis of he life and he be talk of it with he companion and be on he way too to learn more of that story which this book contain and in which he have bear he part they wear both of they man who would at first sight interest a stranger the shorter of the two he might have see before -- at picture sale royal academy meeting dinner party evening party anywhere and everywhere in town for claude mellot be a general favorite and a general guest he be a tiny delicate-featured man with a look of half-lazy enthusiasm about he beautiful face which remind you much of shelley 's portrait only he have what shelley have not clustering auburn curl and a rich brown beard soft as silk you set he down at once as a man of delicate susceptibility sweetness thoughtfulness probably -lrb- as he actually be -rrb- a artist he companion be a man of statelier stamp tall dark and handsome with a very large forehead if the face have a fault it be that the mouth be too small that and the expression of face too and the tone of voice seem to indicate over-refinement possibly a too aristocratic exclusiveness he be dress like a very fine gentleman indeed and look and talk like one aristocrat however in the common sense of the word he be not for he be a native of the model republic and sleeping-partner in a great new york merchant firm he be chat away to claude mellot the artist about frémont 's election and on that point seem to be earnest enough though patient and moderate my dear claude we loss be gain the delay of the next four year be really necessary that we might consolidate we party and i leave you to judge if it have grow to its present size in but a few month what dimension it will have attain before the next election we require the delay too to discover who be we really best man not merely as orator but as worker and you english ought to know better than any nation that the latter class of man be those whom the world most need -- that though aaron may be a altogether inspire preacher yet it be only slow-tongued practical mose whose spokesman he be who can deliver israel from they taskmaster besides my dear fellow we really want the next four year -- ` tell it not in gath ' -- to look about we and see what be to be do you wisest englishman justly complain of we that we ` platform ' be as yet a merely negative one that we define what the south shall not do but not what the north shall ere four year be over we will have a ` positive platform ' at which you shall have no cause to grumble i still think with marie that you ` positive platform ' be already make for you plain as the sun in heaven as the lightning of sinaus free those slave at once and utterly impatient idealist by what mean by law or by force leave we to draw a _ cordon sanitaire _ round the tainted state and leave the system to die a natural death as it rapidly will if it be prevent from enlarge its field do not fancy that a dream of mine none know it better than the southerner themselves what make they ready just now to risk honor justice even the common law of nation and humanity in the struggle for new slave territory what but the consciousness that without virgin soil which will yield rapid and enormous profit to slave labor they and they institution must be ruin the more reason for accelerate so desirable a consummation by free the slave at once humph say stangrave with a smile who so cruel at time as you too benevolent philanthropist do you ever count the meaning of those word disruption of the union a invasion of the south by the north and a internecine war aggravate by the horror of a general rising of the slave and such scene as haytus behold sixty year ago if you have ever read they you will pause ere you determine to repeat they on a vaster scale it be dreadful heaven know even in thought but stangrave can any moderation on you part ward it off where there be crime there be vengeance and without shed of blood be no remission of sin god know it may be true : but god forbid that i should ever do aught to hasten what may come oh claude do you fancy that i of all man do not feel at moment the thirst for brute vengeance claude be silent judge for yourself you who know all -- what man among we northerner can feel as i do what those hapless man may have deserve -- i who have day and night before I the brand of they cruelty fill my heart with fire i need all my strength all my reason at time to say to myself as i say to other -- ` be not these slaveholder man of like passion with yourself what have they do which you would not have do in they place ' i have never read that key to uncle tom 's cabin i will not even read this dred admirable as i believe it to be why should you say claude have you not a key to uncle tom 's cabin more pathetic than any word of man 's or woman 's but i do not mean that i will not read they because i have the key to they in my own heart claude : because conscience have teach I to feel for the southerner as a brother who be but what i might have be and to sigh over he misdirected courage and energy not with hatred not with contempt : but with pity all the more intense the more he scorn that pity to long not merely for the slave ' sake but for the master ' sake to see they -- the once chivalrous gentleman of the south -- deliver from the mesh of a net which they do not spread for themselves but which be round they foot and round they father ' from the day that they be bear you ask I to destroy these man i long to save they from they certain doom you be right and a better christian than i be i believe certainly they do need pity if any sinner do for slavery seem to be -- to judge from mr brook 's triumph -- a great moral curse and a heavier degradation to the slaveholder himself than it can ever be to the slave then i would free they from that curse that degradation if the negro ask ` be i not a man and a brother ' have they no right to ask it also shall i pretend to love my country venture on any rash step which may shut out the whole southern white population from they share in my country 's future glory no have but patience with we you comfortable liberal of the old world who find freedom ready make to you hand and we will pay you all remember we be but child yet we sin be the sin of youth -- greediness intemperance petulance self-conceit when we be purge from we youthful sin england will not be ashamed of she child ashamed of you i often wish i could make american understand the feeling of england to you -- the honest pride as of a mother who have bring into the world the biggest baby that ever this earth beheld and be rather proud of its stamp about and beat she in its pretty pet only the old lady do get a little cross when she hear you talk of the wrong which you have endure from she and teach you child to hate we as they ancient oppressor on the ground of a foolish war of which every englishman be utterly ashamed and in the result of which he glory really as much as you do do not talk of ` you ' claude you know well what i think on that point never do one nation make the _ amende honorable _ to another more fully and nobly than you have to we and those who try to keep up the quarrel be -- i will not say what but the truth be claude we have have no real sorrow and therefore we can afford to play with imaginary one god grant that we may not have we real one -- that we may not have to drink of the cup of which we great mother drink two year ago it be a wholesome bitter for we and it may be so for you likewise : but we will have no sad foreboding on the eve of the bless christmas-tide he live he love he reign and all be well for we be he and he be ours ah say stangrave when emerson sneer at you english for believe you old testament he little think that that be the lesson which it have teach you and that that same lesson be the root of all you greatness that that belief in god 's be in some mysterious way the living king of england and of christendom have be the very idea which have keep you in peace and safety now for many a hundred year move slowly on from good to better not without many backsliding and many shortcoming but still find out quickly enough when you be on the wrong road and not ashamed to retrace you step and to _ reform _ as brave strong man should dare to do a people who have be for many a age in the vanguard of all the nation and the champion of sure and solid progress throughout the world because what be new among you be not patch artificially on to the old but grow organically out of it with a growth like that of you own english oak whose every new-year 's leaf-crop be feed by root which burrow deep in many a bury generation and the rich soil of full a thousand year stay say the little artist we be quite conceited enough already without you eloquent adulation sir but there be a truth in you word there be a better spirit rouse among we and that not merely of two year ago i know this part of the country well in 1846-7-8 and since then i can bear witness a spirit of self-reform have be awaken round here in many a heart which i think once utterly frivolous i find in every circle of every class man and woman ask to be teach they duty that they may go and do it i find everywhere school library and mechanic ' institute spring up : and rich and poor meeting together more and more in the faith that god have make they all as for the outward and material improvement -- you know as well as i that since free trade and emigration the labourer confess themselves better off than they have be for fifty year and though you will not see in the chalk county that rapid and enormous agricultural improvement which you will in lincolnshire yorkshire or the lothian yet you shall see enough to-day to settle for you the question whether we old-country folk be in a state of decadence and decay _ par exemple _ -- and claude point to the clean large field with they neat close-clipt hedge-row among which here and there stand cottage more than three-fourth of they new those well-drained fallow field ten year ago be poor clay pasture fetlock deep in mire six month in the year and accurse in the eye of my poor dear old friend squire lavington because they be so full of old mole ' - nest that they throw all horse down i be no farmer : but they seem surely to be somewhat altered since then as he speak they turn off the main line of the roll clay toward the foot of the chalk hill and begin to brush through short cutting of blue gault and green sand so call by geologist because its usual color be bright brown snow-white and crimson soon they get glimpse of broad silver whit as she slide with divide stream through bright water-meadow and stately grove of poplar and abele and pine while far aloft upon the leave the downs rise steep crown with black fir spinny and dot with dark box and juniper soon they pass old whitford priory with its numberless gable nestle amid mighty elm and the nunpool flash and roar as of old and the broad shallow below sparkling and laughing in the low but bright December sun so slide on the noble river for ever change and yet for ever the same -- always fulfil its errand which yet be never fulfil say stangrave -- he be give to half-mystic utterance and hankering after pagan mythology learn in the day when he worship emerson and try -lrb- but unsuccessfully -rrb- to worship margaret fuller ossolus -- those old greek have a deep insight into nature when they give to each river not merely a name but a semi-human personality a river-god of its own it may be but a collection of ever-changing atom of water -- what be you body but a similar collection of atom decay and renew every moment yet you be a person and be not the river too a person -- a live thing it have a individual countenance which you love which you would recognize again meet it where you will it mark the whole landscape it determine probably the geography and the society of a whole district it draw you too to itself by a indefinable mesmeric attraction if you stop in a strange place the first instinct of you idle half-hour be to lounge by the river it be a person to you you call it -- scotchman do at least -- she and not it how do you know that you be not philosophically correct and that the river have a spirit as well as you humph say claude who talk mysticism himself by the hour but snub it in every one else it have trout at least and they stand i suppose for its soul as the raisin do for those of jean paul 's gingerbread bride and bridegroom and peradventure baby oh you materialist english sporting-mad all of you from the duke who shooteth stag to the clod who poacheth rabbit and who therefore can fight russian at inkermann duke and clod alike and side by side never better -lrb- say the chronicler of old -rrb- than in they first battle i can neither fight nor fish and on the whole agree with you : but i think it proper to be as english as i can in the presence of a american a whistle -- a creak -- a jar and they stop at the little whitford station where a cicerone for the vale far better than claude be make he appearance in the person of mark armsworth banker railway director and _ de facto _ king of whitbury town long since elect by universal suffrage -lrb- he own vote include -rrb- as permanent _ locum tenen _ of she gracious majesty he hail claude cheerfully from the platform as he waddle about with a face as of the rise sun radiant with good fun good humor good deed good news and good live he coat be scarlet once but purple now he leather and boot be doubtless clean this morning but be now afflict with elephantiasis be three inch deep in solid mud which he old groom be scrape

glance at the fat old woman who seem to be listen intently oh never mind she say armsworth deaf as a post : very good woman but so deaf -- ought to speak to she though -- and reach across to the infinite amusement of he companion he roar in the fat woman 's face with a voice as of a speaking-trumpet -- glad to see you mr grove get those dividend ready for you next time you come into town yah

scenery and how you be improve round here say claude who know mark 's weak point and want to draw he out you homestead seem all new three field have be throw into one i fancy over half the farm mark break out at once on he favorite topic -- i believe you i be make the mare go here in whitford without the money too sometimes i be steward now bailiff -- ha ha these four year past -- to mr lavington 's irish husband i want he to have a regular agent a canny scot or yorkshireman faith the poor man could not afford it and so fall back on old mark paddy love a job you know so i have the vote and the fishing and send he he rent and manage all the rest pretty much my own way when the name of lavington be mention mark observe stangrave start and a expression pass over he face difficult to be define -- it seem to mark mingled pride and shame he turn to claude and say in a low voice but loud enough for mark to hear -- lavington be this they country also as i be go to visit the grave of my ancestor i suppose i ought to visit those of hers mark catch the word which he be not intend to eh sir do you belong to these part my family i believe live in the neighborhood of whitbury at a place call

good old family away there in new england never think that there be whitbury people among they hum -- well the world 's not so big as people think after all and you speak of the lavington they be great folk here -- or be -- he be go to rattle on : but he see a pained expression on both the traveller ' face and stangrave stop he somewhat drily -- i know nothing of they i assure you or they of I you country here be certainly charming and show little of those sign of decay which some people in america impute to it decay mark go off at score decay be hang there be life in the old dog yet sir and dead pig be look up since free trade and emigration cheap bread and high wages now : and instead of land go out of cultivation as they threaten -- bosh there be a greater breadth down in wheat in the vale now than there ever be and look at the root farmer must farm now or sink and by george they be farm like sensible fellow : and a fig for that old turnip ghost of protection there be a fellow come down from the carlton -- you know what that be stangrave bow and smile assent from the carlton sir two year since and try it on till he fall in with old mark i tell he a thing or two among the rest tell he to he face that he be a liar for he want to make farmer believe they be ruin when he know they be not and that he would get 'em back protection when he know that he could not -- and what be more he do not mean to so he cut up rough and want to call I out do you go ask stangrave who be fast become amuse with he man i tell he that that be not my line unless he would try eley 's green at forty yard and then i be he man : but if he lay a finger on I i would give he as sound a horsewhipping old as i be as ever man have in he life and so i would and mark look complacently at he own broad shoulder and since then my lord and i have have it all we own way and minchampstead and co be the only firm in the vale what be become of a lord vieuxboi who use to live somewhere hereabouts i use to meet he at rome rome say mark solemnly yes he be too fond of rome awhile back : can not see what people want run into foreign part to look at those poor idolator and they punch and judy play pray for 'em and keep clear of they be the best rule : -- but he have marry my lord 's youngest daughter and three pretty child he have -- duck of child always come to see I in my shop when he drive into town oh -- he be do pretty well -- one of these new between-the-stool peelite they call they -- hope they 'll be as good as the name however he be a freetrader because he can not help it so we have he vote and as to he conservatism let he conserve hip and haw if he choose like a ` pothecary after all why pull down anything before it be tumble on you head by the by sir as you be a man of money there be that stangrave-end farm in the market now pretty little investment -- i would see that you get it cheap and my lord would not bid against you of course as you be a liberal -- all american be i suppose and so you would oblige we as well as yourself for it would give we another vote for the county upon my word you tempt I but i do not think that this be just the moment for a american to desert he own country and settle in england i should not be here now have i not this autumn do all i could for america in america and so cross the sea to serve she if possible in england well perhaps not especially if you be a frémonter i be i assure you think as much by you look do not see what else a honest man can be just now stangrave laugh i hope every one think so in england trust we for that sir we know a man when we see he here i hope they 'll do the same across the water there be silence for a minute or two and then mark begin again look -- there be the farm that be my lord 's i should like to show you the short-horn there sir -- all my lord ducie 's and sir edward knightley 's stock buy a bull-calf of he the other day myself for a cool hundred old fool that i be never mind spread the breed and here be mill -- four pair of new stone old whit do not know herself again but i dare say they look small enough to you sir after you american water-power what of that it be just as honorable in you to make the most of a small river as in we to make the most of a large one you speak like a book sir by the by if you think of take home a calf or two to improve you new england breed -- there be a good many go across the sea in the last few year -- i think we could find you three or four beauty not so very dear consider the blood thanks but i really be no farmer well -- no offence i hope : but i be like you yankee in one thing you see -- always have a eye to a bit of business if i do not i should not be here now how very tasteful -- we own american shrub what a pity that they be not in flower what be this ask stangrave -- one of you nobleman 's park and they begin to run through the cut in minchampstead park where the owner have conceal the bank of the rail for nearly half a mile in a thicket of azalea rhododendron and clamber rose all -- be not it pretty he lordship let we have the land for a song only bargain that we should keep low not to spoil he view and so we do and he be plant we cut for we i call that a present to the county and a very pretty one too ah give I these new broom that sweep clean you old broom like lord vieuxboi be new broom once and sweep well enough five hundred year ago say stangrave who have that filial reverence for english antiquity which sit so gracefully upon many highly educate and far-sighted american wear to the stump now too many of they sir and want new-hething as we broom-squire would say and i doubt whether most of they be worth the cost of a fresh bind not that i can say that of the young lord he be foremost in all that be good if he have but money and when he have not he give brain give a lecture in we institute at whitford last winter on the four great poet shoot over my head a little and other people 's too : but my mary -- my daughter sir think it beautiful and there be nothing that she do not know it be very hopeful to see you aristocracy join in the general movement and bring they taste and knowledge to bear on the lower class yes sir we be go all right now in the old country only have to steer straight and not put on too much steam but give I the new-comer after all they may be close man of business -- how else could one live but when it come to give i 'll back they against the old one for generosity or taste either they have they proper pride when they get hold of the land and they like to show it and quite right they you must see my little place too it be not in such bad order though i say it and be but a country banker : but i 'll back my flower against half the squire round -- my mary 's that be -- and my fruit too -- see there there be my lord 's new school and he model cottage with more comfort in they save the size than my father 's house have and there be he barrack as he call it for the unmarried man -- reading-room and dining-room in common and a library of book and a sleeping-room for each it seem strange to complain of prosperity say stangrave but i sometimes regret that in america there be so little room for the very highest virtue all be so well off that one never need to give and what a man do here for other they do for themselves so much the better for they there be other way of be generous besides put you hand in you pocket sir by jove there 'll be room enough -lrb- if you 'll excuse I -rrb- for a american to do fine thing as long as those poor negro slave -- i know it i know it say stangrave in the tone of a man who have already make up he mind on a painful subject and wish to hear no more of it you will excuse I but i be come here to learn what i can of england of my own country i know enough i trust to do my duty in it when i return mark be silent see that he have touch a tender place and point out one object of interest after another as they run through the flat park past the great house with its doric façade which the eighteenth century have raise above the quiet cell of the minchampstead reclus it be very ugly say stangrave and truly comfortable enough though and as somebody say people live inside they house and not outside 'em you should see the picture there though while you be in the country i can show you one or two too i hope never grudge money for good picture the pleasantest furniture in the world as long as you keep they and if you be tire of they always fetch double they price after minchampstead the rail leave the sand and clay and turn up between the chalk hill along the barge river which it have render useless save as a supernumerary trout-stream and then along whit now flow clearer and clearer as we approach its spring amid the lofty clown on through more water-meadow and row of pollard willow and peat-pits crest with tall golden reed and still dyke -- each in summer a float flower-bed while stangrave look out of the window he face light up with curiosity how perfectly english at least how perfectly un-american it be just tennyson 's beautiful dream -- ` on either side the river lie long field of barley and of rye which clothe the wold and meet the sky and through the field the stream run by to many tower camelot ' why what be this as they stop again at a station where the board bear in large letter shalott shalott where be the ` four gray wall and four gray tower ' which overlook a space of flower there upon the little island be the castle-ruin now convert into a useful bone-mill and the lady -- be that she it be only the miller 's daughter fresh from a boarding-school gardening in a broad straw-hat at least say claude she be tend far prettier flower than ever the lady saw while the lady herself instead of weave and dream be read miss young 's novel and become all the wiser thereby and teach poor child in hemmelford national school and where be she fairy knight ask stangrave whom one half hope to see ride down from that grand old house which sulk there above among the beech-wood as if frown on all the change and civilisation below you do old sidricstone injustice vieuxboi descend from thence now-a-day to lecture at mechanic ' institute instead of the fairy knight toiling along in the blaze summer weather sweating in burn metal like poor perillus in he own bull then the fairy knight be extinct in england ask stangrave smile no man less only he -lrb- not vieuxboi but he younger brother -rrb- have find a wide-awake cooler than a iron kettle and travels by rail when he be at home and when he be in the crimea ride a shaggy pony and smoked cavendish all through the battle of inkermann he show himself the old sir lancelot there say stangrave he do wherefore the lady marry he when the guard come home and he will breed prize pig and sit at the board of guardian and take in the time clothe and in he right mind for the old berserk spirit be go out of he and he be become respectable in a respectable age and be nevertheless just as brave a fellow as ever and so all thing be change except the river where still -- ` willow whiten aspen quiver little breeze dash and shiver on the stream that runneth ever ' and say claude smile the descendant of mediaeval trout snap at the descendant of mediaeval fly spin about upon just the same size and color wing on which they forefather spin a thousand year ago have become in all that while neither bigger nor wiser but be it not a grand thought ask stangrave -- the silence and permanence of nature amid the perpetual flux and noise of human life -- a grand thought that one generation goeth and another cometh and the earth abideth for ever at least it be so much the worse for the poor old earth if she doom be to stand still while man improve and progress from age to age may i ask one question sir say stangrave who see that they conversation be puzzling they jolly companion have you hear any news yet of mr

good banker many thing about the lose tom thurnall \* \* \* \* \* here we be cry mark now you must excuse I : see to yourselve i see to the puppy dinner at 530 mind come along goodman boy be this whitbury ask stangrave it be whitbury indeed pleasant old town which slope down the hill-side to the old church -- just restore though by lord minchampstead and vieuxboi not without mark armsworth 's help to its ancient beauty of gray flint and white clunch chequer-work and quaint wooden spire pleasant churchyard round it where the dead lie look up to the bright southern sun among huge black yew upon they knoll of white chalk above the ancient stream pleasant white wooden bridge with its row of urchin drop flint upon the nose of elephantine trout or fishing over the rail with crooked pin while hapless gudgeon come dangle upward between stream and sky with a look of sheepish surprise and shame as of a school-boy catch steal apple in they foolish visage pleasant new national school at the bridge end whither the urchin scamper at the sound of the two o'clock bell though it be a ugly pile enough of bright red brick it be do its work as whitbury folk know well by now pleasant too though still more ugly those long red arm of new house which whitbury be stretch out along its fine turnpike -- especially up to the railway station beyond the bridge and to the smart new hotel which hope -lrb- but hope in vain -rrb- to outrival the ancient angler 's rest away thither and not to the railway hotel they trundle in a fly -- leave mark armsworth all but angry because they will not sleep as well as breakfast lunch and dine with he daily -- and settle in the good old inn with its three white gable overhang the pavement and its long lattice window bury deep beneath they like -- so stangrave say -- to a shrewd kindly eye under a bland white forehead no good old inn not such shall be thy fate as long as trout be trout and man have wit to catch they for art thou not a sacred house art thou not consecrate to the whitbury brotherhood of angler be not the wainscot of that long low parlor inscribe with many a famous name be not its wall hang with many a famous countenance have not its oak-ribbed ceiling ring for now a hundred year to the laughter of painter sculptor grave divine -lrb- unbend at least there -rrb- great lawyer statesman wit even of foote and quin themselves while the sleek landlord wipe the cobweb off another magnum of that grand old port and take in all the wisdom with a quiet twinkle of he sleepy eye he rest now good old man among the yew beside he forefather and on he tomb he lengthy epitaph writ by himself for barker be a poet in he way some people hold the same epitaph to be irreverent because in a list of barker 's many blessing occur the profane word trout : but those trout and the custom which they bring he have make the old man 's life comfortable and enable he to leave a competence for he child and why should not a man honestly thank heaven for that which he know have do he good even though it be but fish he be go : but the whit be not nor the whitbury club nor will while old mark armsworth be king in whitbury and sit every evening in the mayfly season at the table head retailing good stone of the great angler of he youth -- name which you reader have hear many a time -- and who could do many thing besides handle a blow-line but though the club be not what it be fifty year ago -- before norway and scotland become easy of access -- yet it be still a important institution of the town to the member whereof all good subject touch they hat for do not the club bring into the town good money and take out again only fish which cost nothing in the breeding do not the club present the town-hall with a portrait of the renowned fishing sculptor and do it not -lrb- only stipulate that the school should be build beyond the bridge to avoid noise -rrb- give fifty pound to the say school but five year ago in addition to mark 's own hundred but enough of this : -- only may the whitbury club in recompense for my thus hand they down to immortality give I another day next year as they give I this : and may the mayfly be strong on and a south-west gale blow in the course of the next week in many a conversation the three man compare note as to the event of two year ago and each supply the other with new fact which shall be duly set forth in this tale saving and excepting of course the real reason why everybody do everything for -- as everybody know who have watch life -- the true spring of all human action be generally those which fool will not see which wise man will not mention so that in order to present a readable tragedy of hamlet you must always omit the part of hamlet -- and probably the ghost and the queen into the bargain chapter i poetry and prose now to tell my story -- if not as it ought to be tell at least as i can tell it -- i must go back sixteen year -- to the day when whitbury boast of forty coach per diem instead of one railway -- and set forth how in its southern suburb there stand two pleasant house side by side with they garden slope down to the whit and part from each other only by the high brick fruit-wall through which there use to be a door of communication for the two occupier be fast friend in one of these two house sixteen year ago live we friend mark armsworth banker solicitor land-agent churchwarden guardian of the poor justice of the peace -- in a word viceroy of whitbury town and far more potent therein than she gracious majesty queen victorium in the other live edward thurnall esquire doctor of medicine and consult physician of all the country round these two man be as brother and have be as brother for now twenty year though no two man could be more different save in the two common virtue which bind they to each other and that be that they both be honest and kind-hearted man what mark 's character be and be i have already show and enough of it i hope to make my reader like the good old banker : as for doctor thurnall a purer or gentler soul never enter a sick-room with patient wisdom in he brain and patient tenderness in he heart beloved and trust by rich and poor he have make to himself a practice large enough to enable he to settle two son well in he own profession the third and youngest be still in whitbury he be something of a geologist too and a botanist and a antiquarian and mark armsworth who know and know still nothing of science look up to the doctor as a inspired sage quote he defend he opinion right or wrong and thrust he forward at public meeting and in all place and season much to the modest doctor 's discomfiture the good doctor be sit in he study on the morning on which my tale begin have just finish he breakfast and settle to he microscope in the bay-window opening on the lawn a beautiful October morning it be one of those in which dame nature healthily tire with the revelry of summer be compose herself with a quiet satisfied smile for she winter 's sleep sheet of dappled cloud be slide slowly from the west long bar of hazy blue hung over the southern chalk downs which gleam pearly gray beneath the low south-eastern sun in the vale below soft white flake of mist still hang over the water meadow and bar the dark trunk of the huge elm and poplar whose fast-yellowing leaf come shower down at the very rustle of the western breeze spot the grass below the river swirl along glassy no more but dingy gray with autumn rain and rotten leaf all beyond the garden tell of autumn bright and peaceful even in decay : but up the sunny slope of the garden itself and to the very window sill summer still linger the bed of red verbena and geranium be still brilliant though choke with fall leaf of acacia and plane the canary plant still untouched by frost twine its delicate green leaf and more delicate yellow blossom through the crimson lacework of the virginia-creeper and the great yellow noisette swing its long cane across the window fill all the air with fruity fragrance and the good doctor lift he eye from he microscope look out upon it all with a quiet satisfaction and though he lip do not move he eye seem to be thank god for it all and thank he too perhaps that he be still permit to gaze upon that fair world outside for as he gaze he start as if with sudden pain and pass he hand across he eye with something like a sigh and then look at the microscope no more but sit seemingly absorb in thought while upon he delicate toil-worn feature and high bland unwrinkled forehead and the few soft gray lock which not time -- for he be scarcely fifty-five -- but long labor of brain have spare to he there lay a hopeful calm as of a man who have nigh do he work and feel that he have not altogether do it ill -- a autumnal calm resign yet full of cheerfulness which harmonise fitly with the quiet beauty of the decaying landscape before he i say daddy you must drop that microscope and put on you shade you be ruin those dear old eye of yours again in spite of what alexander tell you the doctor take up the green shade which lay beside he and replace it with a sigh and a smile i must use the old thing now and then till you can take my place at the microscope tom or till we have as we ought to have a first-rate analytical chemist settle in every county-town and pay in part at least out of the county rate the tom who have speak be one of two youth of eighteen who stand in opposite corner of the bay-window gaze out upon the landscape but evidently with thought as different as be they complexion tom be of that bull-terrier type so common in england sturdy and yet not coarse middle-sized deep-chested broad-shouldered with small well-knit hand and foot large jaw bright gray eye crisp brown hair a heavy project brow he face full of shrewdness and good-nature and of humor withal which might be at while a little saucy and sarcastic to judge from the glance which he send forth from the corner of he wicked eye at he companion on the other side of the window he be evidently prepare for a day 's shooting in velveteen jacket and leather gaiter and stand feeling about in he pocket to see whether he have forget any of he tackle and mutter to himself amid he whistle -- capital day how the bird will lie where on earth be old mark why must he wait to smoke he cigar after breakfast could not he have have it in the trap the bless old chimney that he be the other lad be somewhat taller than tom awkwardly and plainly dress but with a highly-developed byronic turn-down collar and long black curl lock he be certainly handsome as far as the form of he feature and brow and would have be very handsome but for the bad complexion which at he age so often accompany a sedentary life and a melancholic temper one glance at he face be sufficient to tell that he be moody shy restless perhaps discontented perhaps ambitious and vain he hold in he hand a volume of percy 's relique which he have just take down from thurnall 's shelf yet he be look not at it but at the landscape nevertheless as he look one might have see that he be think not so much of it as of he own thought about it he eye which be very large dark and beautiful with heavy lid and long lash have that dreamy look so common among man of the poetic temperament conscious of think if not conscious of self and as he face kindle and he lip move more and more earnestly he begin mutter to himself half-aloud till tom thurnall burst into a open laugh there be jack at it again make poetry i 'll bet my head to a china orange and why not say he father look up quietly but reprovingly as jack wince and blush and a dark shade of impatience pass across he face oh it be no concern of mine let everybody please themselves the country look very pretty no doubt i can tell that only my notion be that a wise man ought to go out and enjoy it -- as i be go to do -- with a gun on he shoulder instead of poke at home like a yard-dog and behowl oneself in po-o-oetry and tom lift up he voice into a doleful mastiff 's howl then be as good as you word tom and let every one please themselves say the doctor but the dark youth break out in sudden passion mr thoma thurnall i will not endure this why be you always make I you butt -- insulting I sir even in you father 's house you do not understand I and i do not care to understand you if my presence be disagreeable to you i can easily relieve you of it and the dark youth turn to go away like naaman in a rage stop john say the doctor i think it would be the more courteous plan for tom to relieve you of he presence go and find mark tom and please to remember that john brigg be my guest and that i will not allow any rudeness to he in my house i 'll go daddy to the world 's end if you like provide you will not ask I to write poetry but jack take offence so soon give we you hand old tinder-box i mean no harm and you know it john brigg take the proffer hand sulkily enough and tom go out of the glass door whistle as merry as a cricket my dear boy say the doctor when they be alone you must try to curb this temper of yours do not be angry with I but -- i should be a ungrateful brute if i be sir i can bear anything from you i ought to for i owe everything to you but -- but my dear boy -- ` better be he that ruleth he spirit than he that taketh a city ' john brigg tap he foot on the ground impatiently i can not help it sir it will drive I mad i think at time -- this contrast between what i might be and what i be i can bear it no longer -- mix medicine here when i might be educate myself distinguish myself -- for i can do it have you not say as much yourself to I again and again i have of course but -- but sir only hear I it be in vain to ask I to command my temper while i stay here i be not fit for this work not fit for the dull country i be not appreciate not understand and i shall never be till i can get to london -- till i can find congenial spirit and take my rightful place in the great parliament of mind i be pegasus in harness here cry the vain discontented youth let I but once get there -- amid art civilisation intellect and the company of man like that old mermaid club to hear and to answer -- ` word so nimble and so full of subtle flame as one have put he whole soul in a jest ' -- and then you shall see whether pegasus have not wing and can use they too and he stop suddenly choke with emotion he nostril and chest dilate he foot stamp impatiently on the ground the doctor watch he with a sad smile do you remember the devil 's temptation of we lord -- ` cast thyself down from hence for it be write he shall give he angel charge over thee i do but what have that to do with I throw away the safe station in which god have certainly put you to seek by some desperate venture a new and as you fancy a grander one for yourself look out of that window lad be there not poetry enough beauty and glory enough in that sky those field -- ay in every fall leaf -- to employ all you power considerable as i believe they to be why spurn the pure quiet country life in which such man as wordsworth have be content to live and grow old the boy shake he head like a impatient horse too slow -- too slow for I to wait and wait as wordsworth do through long year of obscurity misconception ridicule no what i have i must have at once and if it must be die like chatterton -- if only like chatterton i can have my little day of success and make the world confess that another priest of the beautiful have arise among man now it can scarcely be deny that the good doctor be guilty of a certain amount of weakness in listen patiently to all this rant not that the rant be very blamable in a lad of eighteen for have we not all while we be go through we course of shelley talk very much the same abominable stuff and think ourselves the grandest fellow upon earth on account of that very length of ear which be patent to all the world save we precious self blind by we self-conceit and wonder in wrath why everybody be laugh at we but the truth be the doctor be easy and indulgent to a fault and dreaded nothing so much save tell a lie as hurt people 's feeling besides as the acknowledged wise man of whitbury he be a little proud of play the maecena and he have and not unjustly a high opinion of john brigg 's power so he have lend he book correct he taste in many matter and by dint of petting and humor have keep the wayward youth half-a-dozen time from run away from he father who be a apothecary in the town and from the general practitioner mr bolus under whom john brigg fulfil the office of co-assistant with tom thurnall plenty of trouble have both the lad give the doctor in the last five year but of very different kind tom though he be in everlasting hot water as the most incorrigible scapegrace for ten mile round contrived to confine he naughtiness strictly to play-hour while he learn everything which be to be learn with marvellous quickness and so utterly fulfil the ideal of a bottle-boy -lrb- for of he too as of all thing i presume a ideal exist eternally in the supra-sensual platonic universe -rrb- that bolus tell he father -- in hour sir he take care of my business as well as i could myself but out of hour sir i believe he be possess by seven devil john brigg on the other hand sin in the very opposite direction too proud to learn he business and too proud also to play the scapegrace as tom do he neglect alike work and amusement for lazy moon over book and the dream which book call up he make perpetual mistake in the shop and then consider himself insult by a inferior spirit if poor bolus call he to account for it indeed have it not be for many application of that precious oil of unity with which the good doctor daily anoint the creaking wheel of whitbury society john brigg and he master would have long ago break out of gear and part company in mutual wrath and fury and now indeed the critical moment seem come at last for the lad begin afresh to declare he deliberate intention of go to london to seek he fortune in spite of parent and all the world to live on here and never to rise perhaps above the post of correspondent to a country newspaper -- to publish a volume of poem by subscription and have to go round hat in hand beg five shilling ' worth of patronage from every stupid country squire -- intolerable i must go shakespeare be never shakespeare till he flee from miserable stratford to become at once the friend of sidney and southampton but john brigg will be john brigg still if he go to the moon shout tom thurnall who have just come up to the window i advise you to change that name of yours jack to sidney or percy or walker if you like anything but the illustrious surname of brigg the poisoner what do you mean sir thunder john while the doctor himself jump up for tom be red with rage what be this tom what be that scream tom burst in spite of he passion into roar of laughter what be that -- and he hold out a phial smell it taste it oh if i have but a gallon of it to pour down you throat that be what you bring mark armsworth last night instead of he cough mixture while you brain be wool-gathering after poetry what be it gasp john brigg miss twiddle 's black dose -- strong enough to rive the gizard out of a old cock it be not it be roar mark armsworth from behind as he rush in in shooting-jacket and gaiter he red face redder with fury he red whisker stand on end with wrath like a tiger 's he left hand upon he hapless hypogastric region he right brandish a empty glass which smell strongly of brandy and water it be and you have give I the cholera and spoilt my day 's shooting and if i do not serve you out for it there be no law in england and spoilt my day 's shooting too the last i shall get before i be off to pari to have a day in lord minchampstead 's preserve and to be baulk of it in this way john brigg stand as one astony if i do not serve you out for this shout mark if i do not serve you out for it you shall never hear the last of it shout tom i 'll take to write after all i 'll put it in the papers i 'll make the name of brigg the poisoner a abomination in the land john brigg turn and flee well say mark i must spend my morning at home i suppose so i shall just sit and chat with you doctor and i shall go and play with molly say tom and walk off to armsworth 's garden i do not care for myself so much say mark but i be sorry the boy 's lose he last day 's shooting oh you will be well enough by noon and can go then and as for the boy it be just as well for he not to grow too fond of sport in which he can never indulge never indulge why not he vow he 'll go to the rocky mountain and shoot a grizzly bear and he 'll do it he have a great deal to do before that poor fellow and a great deal to learn and he 'll learn it you be always down-heart about the boy doctor i can not help feel the parting with he : and for paris too : -- such a seat of temptation but it be he own choice and after all he must see temptation wherever he go bless the man if a boy mean to go to the bad he 'll go just as easily in whitbury as in pari give the lad he head and never fear he 'll fall on he leg like a cat i 'll warrant he whatever happen he be as steady as old time i tell you there be a gray head on green shoulder there steady say the doctor with a smile and a shrug steady i tell you at heart as prudent as you or i and never lose you a farthing that you know hang good boy give I one who know how to be naughty in the right place i would not give sixpence for a good boy i never be one myself and have no faith in they give I the lad who have more steam up than he know what to do with and must need blow off a little in lark when once he settle down on the rail it 'll send he along as steady as a luggage train do you never hear a locomotive puffing and roaring before it get under way well that be what you boy be do look at he now with my poor little molly tom be canter about the garden with a little weakly child of eight in he arm the little thing be look up in he face with delight scream at he joke you be right mark : the boy 's heart can not be in the wrong place while he be so fond of little child poor molly how she 'll miss he do you think she 'll ever walk doctor i do indeed hum ah well if she grow up doctor and do not go to join she poor dear mother up there i do not know that i would wish she a better husband than you boy it would be a poor enough match for she tut she 'll have the money and he the brain mark my word doctor that boy 'll be a credit to you he 'll make a noise in the world or i know nothing and if he fancy hold seven year hence and he want still to turn traveller let he if he be mind to go round the world i 'll back he to go somehow or other or i 'll eat my head ned thurnall the doctor acquiesce in this hopeful theory partly to save a argument for mark 's reverence for he opinion be confine to scientific matter and he make up to he own self-respect by patronise the doctor and indeed take he sometimes pretty sharply to task on practical matter best fellow alive be thurnall but not a man of business poor fellow none of you genius be do not know what he would do without I so tom carry mary about all the morning and go to minchampstead in the afternoon and get three hour ' good shooting but in the evening he vanish and he father go into armsworth 's to look for he why do you want to know where he be reply mark look sly however as you can not stop he now i 'll tell you he be just about this time sew up brigg 's coat-sleeve put coppera into he water jug and powdered gall on he towel and make various other little return for this morning 's favor i dislike practical joke so do i especially when they come in the form of a black dose sit down old boy and we 'll have a game at cribbage in a few minute tom come in -- here be a good riddance the poisoner have fabricate he pilgrim 's staff to speak scientifically and perambulate he calcareous stratum what cut he stick and walk he chalk and be off to london poor boy say the doctor much distressed do not cry daddy you can not bring he back again he be be go these four hour i go to he room at bolus 's about a little business and see at once that he have pack up and carry off all he could and look about i find a letter direct to he father so to he father i take it and really i be sorry for the poor people i leave they all cry in chorus i must go to they at once and up rise the doctor he be not worth the trouble you take for he -- the addle-headed ill-tempered coxcomb say mark but it be just like you soft-heartedness tom sit down and finish the game with I so vanish from whitbury with all he aspiration poor john brigg and save a occasional letter to he parent tell they that he be alive and well no one hear anything of he for many a year the doctor try to find he out in london again and again but without success he letter have no address upon they and no clue to he whereabouts could be find and tom thurnall go to pari and become the best pistol-shot and billiard-player in the quartier latin and then go to st mumpsimus 's hospital in london and become the best boxer therein and captain of the eight-oar besides win prize and certificate without end and become in due time the most popular house-surgeon in the hospital : but nothing could keep he permanently at home stay drudge in london he would not settle down in a country practice he would not cost he father a farthing he would not so he start forth into the wide world with nothing but he wit and he science as anatomical professor to a new college in some south american republic unfortunately when he get there he find that the annual revolution have just take place and that the party who have found the college have be all shoot the week before whereat he whistle and start off again no man know whither have get round half the world daddy he write home it be hard if i do not get round the other half so do not expect I till you see I and take care of you dear old eye with which he vanish into infinite space and be only hear of by occasional letter date from the rocky mountain -lrb- where he do shoot a grizzly bear -rrb- the spanish west indy otahitus singapore the falkland island and all manner of unexpected place send home valuable note -lrb- sometimes accompany by valuable specimen -rrb- zoological and botanical and inform he father that he be do very well that work be plentiful and that he always find two fresh job before he have finish one old one he eldest brother john die meanwhile he second brother william be in good general practice in manchester he father 's connection support he comfortably and if the old doctor ever long for tom to come home he never hint it to the wanderer but bid he go on and prosper and become -lrb- which he give high promise of become -rrb- a distinguished man of science nevertheless the old man 's heart sink at last when month after month and at last two full year have pass without any letter from tom at last when full four year be past and go since tom start for south america he descend from the box of the day-mail with a serene and healthful countenance and with no more look of interest in he face than if he have be away on a two day ' visit shoulder he carpet-bag and start for he father 's house he stop however as there appear from the inside of the mail a face which he must surely know a second look tell he that it be none other than john brigg but how altered he have grow up into a very handsome man -- tall and delicate-featured with long black curl and a black moustache there be a slight stoop about he shoulder as of a man accustom to too much sit and write and he carry a eye-glass whether for fashion 's sake or for he eye ' sake be uncertain he be wrapt in a long spanish cloak new and good wear well-cut trousers and -lrb- what tom of course examine carefully -rrb- french boot very neat and very thin moreover he have lavender kid-glove on tom look and wonder and walk half round he sniff like a dog when he examine into the character of a fellow dog hum -- he mark seem to be at present pp -- prosperous party : so there can be no harm in renew we acquaintance what trade on earth do he live by though editor of a newspaper or keeper of a gambling-table beg he pardon he look a good deal more like the latter than the former however -- and he walk up and offer he hand with how d' e do brigg who would have think of we fall from the sky against each other in this fashion mr brigg hesitate a moment and then take coldly the offer hand excuse I but the circumstance of my visit here be too painful to allow I to wish for society and mr brigg withdraw evidently glad to escape have he vampoose with the contents of a till that he wish so for solitude ask tom and shoulder he carpet-bag a second time with a grim inward laugh he go to he father 's house and hang up he hat in the hall just as if he have come in from a walk and walk into the study and not find the old man step through the garden to mark armsworth 's and in at the drawing-room window frightening out of she wit a short pale ugly girl of seventeen whom he discover to be he old playfellow mary however she soon recover she equanimity : he certainly never lose he how d' e do darling how you be grow and how well you look how 's you father i have not anything particular to do so i think i would come home and see you all and get some fishing and mary who have long to throw she arm round he neck as of old and be restrain by the thought that she be grow a great girl now call in she father and all the household and after a while the old doctor come home and the fat calf be kill and all make merry over the return of this altogether unrepentant prodigal son who whether from affectation or from that blunt sensibility which often come by continual change and wander take all they affection and delight with the most provoking coolness nevertheless though he feeling be not demonstrative as fine lady say now-a-days he evidently have some leave in some corner of he heart for after the fat calf be eat and they be all settle in the doctor 's study it come out that he carpet-bag contain little but present and those valuable one -- rare mineral from the ural for he father a pair of circassian pistol for mark and for little mary to she astonishment a russian malachite bracelet at which mary 's eye open wide and old mark say -- pretty fellow you be to go fool you money away like that what do that gimcrack cost pray sir that be no concern of yours sir or mine either for i do not pay for it oh say mary doubtingly no mary i kill a giant who be carry off a beautiful princess and this you see he wear as a ring on one of he finger : so i think it would just suit you wrist oh tom -- mr thurnall -- what nonsense come come say he father : instead of tell we these sort of story you ought to give a account of yourself as you seem quite to forget that we have not hear from you for more than two year whew i write say tom whenever i could however you can have all my letter in one now so they sit round the fire and tom give a account of himself while he father mark with pride that the young man have grow and strengthen in body and in mind and that under that nonchalant almost cynical outside the heart still beat honest and kindly for before tom begin he would need draw he chair closer to he father 's and half-whispered to he -- this be very jolly i can not be sentimental you know knock about the world have beat all that out of I : but it be very comfortable after all to find oneself with a dear old daddy and a good coal fire which of the two could you best do without well one take thing as one find they it do not do to look too deeply into one 's feeling like chemical the more you analyze they the worse they smell so tom begin he story you hear from I at bombay after i would be up to the himalaya with a old mumpsimus friend yes well i work my way to suez on board a ship whose doctor have fall ill and then i must need see a little of egypt and there rob be i and nearly murder too but i take a good deal of kill i 'll warrant you do say mark look at he with pride so i begged my way to cairo and there i pick up a yankee -- a new yorker make of money who have a yacht at alexandrium and travel _ en prince _ and nothing would serve he but i must go with he to constantinople but there he and i quarrel -- more fool both of we i write to you from constantinople we never get the letter i can not help that i write but there i be on the wide world again so i take up with a russian prince whom i meet at a gambling-table in pera -- a mere boy but such a plucky one -- and go with he to circassium and up to astrakhan and on to the kirghi steppe and there i do see snake snake say mary i should have think you have see plenty in indium already yes mary but these be snake spiritual and metaphorical for poke about where we have no business mary the tartar catch we and tie we to they horse ' tail after give I this scar across the cheek and teach we to drink mare ' milk and to do a good deal of dirty work beside so there we stay with they six month and observe they manners which be none and they custom which be disgust as the midshipman say in he diary and have the honor of visit a pleasant little place in no-man 's land call khiva which you may find in you atla mary and of very nearly be sell for slave into persium which would not have be pleasant and at last mary we run away -- or rather ride away on two razor-backed calmuc pony and get back to russia _ viâ _ orenberg -- for which consult you atla again so the young prince be restore to the bosom of he afflict family and a good deal of trouble i have to get he safe there for the poor boy 's health give way they want I to stay with they and offer to make my fortune i be so glad you do not say mary well -- i want to see little mary again and two worthy old gentleman beside you see however those russian be generous enough they fill my pocket and heap I with present that bracelet among they what be more mary i have be introduce to old nick himself and can testify from personal experience to the correctness of shakspeare 's opinion that the prince of darkness be a gentleman and now you be go to stay at home ask the doctor well if you 'll take I in daddy i 'll send for my trap from london and stay a month or so a month cry the forlorn father well daddy you see there be a chance of more fighting in mexico and i shall see such practice there beside meeting old friend who be with I in texa and -- and i have get a little commission too down in georgium that i should like to go and do what be that well -- it be a long story and a sad one : but there be a poor yankee surgeon with the army in circassium -- a southerner and a very good fellow and he have take a fancy to some color girl at home -- poor fellow he use to go half mad about she sometimes when he be talk to I for fear she

history of the now mysterious mr john brigg he have lock himself into the room with he father 's corpse evidently in great excitement and grief spend several hour in walk up and down there alone and have then go to a attorney in the town and settle everything about the funeral in the handsomest way say the man of law and be quite the gentleman in he manner but not much of a man of business never have even think of look for he father 's will and be quite surprised when i tell he that there ought to be a fair sum -- eight hundred or a thousand perhaps to come in to he if the stock and business be properly dispose of so he go off to london by the evening mail and tell I to address he to the post-office in some street off the strand queer business sir be not it john brigg do not reappear till a few minute before he father 's funeral witness the ceremony evidently with great sorrow bow off silently all who attempt to speak to he and return to london by the next coach -- leave matter for much babble among all whitbury gossip one thing at least be plain that he wish to be forget in he native town and forget he be in due course of time tom thurnall stay he month at home and then go to america whence he write home in about six month a letter of which only one paragraph need interest we tell mark i have no need for he dollar i have do the deed and thanks to the underground railway do

and so the year slip on till the autumn of 1853 as no one have hear of tom now for eight month and more -lrb- the pulse of australian postage being of a somewhat intermittent type -rrb- we may as well go and look for he a sheet of dark rolling ground quarry into a gigantic rabbit burrow with hundred of tent and hut dot about among the heap of rubbish dark evergreen forest in the distance and above all the great volcanic mountain of buninyong towering far aloft -- these be the black hill of ballarat and that windlass at that shaft 's mouth belong in part to thoma thurnall at the windlass be stand two man whom we may have see in past year self-satisfied in countenance and spotless in array saunter down piccadilly any July afternoon or lounging in haggis 's stable-yard at cambridge any autumn morning alas how change from the fast young undergraduate with power of enjoyment only equal by they power of run into debt be those two black-bearded and mud-bespattered ruffian who once be smith and brown of trinity yet who need pity they as long as they have stouter limb healthier stomach and clearer conscience than they have have since they leave eton at seventeen would smith have be a happier man as a briefless barrister in a dingy inn of law peeping now and then into third-rate london society and scribble for the daily press would brown have be a happier man have he be force into those holy order for which he never feel the least vocation to pay off he college debt out of he curate 's income and settle down on he lees at last in the family living of nomansland-cum-clayhole and support a wife and five child on five hundred a-year exclusive of rate and tax let they dig and be man the windlass rattle and the rope go down a shout from the bottom of the shaft proclaim all right and in due time sit in the noose of the rope up come thoma thurnall bare-footed and bare-headed in flannel trousers and red jersey begrime with slush and mud with a mahogany face a brick-red neck and a huge brown beard look to use he own expression as jolly as a sandboy a letter for you doctor from europe tom take it and he countenance fall for it be black-edged and black-seal the handwriting be mary armsworth 's i suppose the old lady who be go to leave I a fortune be dead say he drily and turn away to read bad luck i suppose he say to himself i have not have any for full six month so i suppose it be time for dame fortune to give I a sly stab again i only hope it be not my father for beg the dame 's pardon i can bear any trick of hers but that and he set he tooth doggedly and read my dear mr thurnall -- my father would have write himself but he think i do not know why that i could tell you better than he you father be quite well in health -- thurnall breathe freely again -- but he have have heavy trial since you poor brother william 's death tom open he eye and set he tooth more firmly willy dead i suppose there be a letter lose : better so better to have the whole list of trouble together and so get they sooner over poor will you father catch the scarlet fever from he while he be attend he and be very ill after he come back he be quite well again now but if i must tell you the truth the disease have affect he eye you know how weak they always be and how much worse they have grow of late year and the doctor be afraid that he have little chance of recover the sight at least of the left eye recover he be blind then and tom set he tooth more tightly than ever he feel a sob rise in he throat but choke it down shake he head like a impatient bull wait a bit tom say he to himself before you have it out with dame fortune there be more behind i 'll warrant news like this lie in pocket and not in single nugget and he read on -- and -- for it be better you should know all -- something have happen to the railroad in which he have invest so much my father have lose money in it also but not much : but i fear that you poor dear father be very much straitened my father be dreadfully vex about it and think it all he fault in not have watch the matter more closely and make you father sell out in time : and he want you father to come and live with we : but he will not hear of it so he have give up the old house and take one in water street and oh i need not tell you that we be there every day and that i be try to make he as happy as i can -- but what can i do and then follow kind womanly commonplace which tom hurry over with fierce impatience he want you to come home but my father have entreat he to let you stay you know while we be here he be safe and my father beg you not to come home if you be succeed as well as you have be do there be much more in the letter which i need not repeat and after all a short postscript by mark himself follow : -- stay where you be boy and keep up heart while i have a pound you father shall have half of it and you know mark armsworth he walk away slowly into the forest he feel that the crisis of he life be come that he must turn he hand henceforth to quite new work and as he go he take stock as it be of he own soul to see what point he have attain -- what he could do fifteen year of adventure have harden into work metal a character never very ductile tom be now in he own way a altogether accomplished man of the world who know -lrb- at least in all company and place where he be likely to find himself -rrb- exactly what to say to do to make to seek and to avoid shifty and thrifty as old greek or modern scot there be few thing he could not invent and perhaps nothing he could not endure he have watch human nature under every disguise from the pomp of the ambassador to the war-paint of the savage and form he own clear hard shallow practical estimate thereof he look on it as he raw material which he have to work up into subsistence and comfort for himself he do not wish to live on man but live by they he must and for that purpose he must study they and especially they weakness he would not cheat they for there be in he a innate vein of honesty so surly and explosive at time as to give he much trouble the severest part of he self-education have be the repression of he dangerous inclination to call a sham a sham on the spot and to answer fool accord to they folly that youthful rashness however be now well-nigh subdue and tom could flatter and bully also when it serve he turn -- as who can not let he that be without sin among my reader cast the first stone self-conscious he be therefore in every word and action not from morbid vanity but a necessary consequence of he mode of life he have to use man and therefore to watch how he use they to watch every word gesture tone of voice and in all time and place do the fitting thing it be hard work : but necessary for a man who stand alone and self-poised in the midst of the universe fashion for himself everywhere just as far as he arm could reach some not intolerable condition depend on nothing but himself and care for little but himself and the father whom to do he justice he never forget if i wish to define tom thurnall by one epithet i should call he specially a ungodly man -- be it not that scriptural epithet have now-a-day such altogether conventional and official meaning that one fear to convey in use they some notion quite foreign to the truth tom be certainly not one of those ungodly whom david have to deal with of old who rob the widow and put the fatherless to death he morality be as high as that of the average he sense of honor far higher he be generous and kind-hearted no one ever hear he tell a lie and he have a blunt honesty about he half real because he like to be honest and yet half affect too because he find it pay in the long run and because it throw off they guard the people whom he intend to make he tool but of godliness in its true sense -- of belief that any be above care for he and be help he in the daily business of life -- that it be worth while ask that be 's advice or that any advice would be give if ask for of any practical notion of a heavenly father or a divine education -- tom be as ignorant as thousand of respectable people who go to church every Sunday and read good book and believe firmly that the pope be antichrist he ought to have learn it no doubt for he father be a religious man : but he have not learn it -- any more than thousand learn it who have likewise religious parent he have be teach of course the common doctrine and duty of religion but early remembrance have be rub out as off a schoolboy 's slate by the mere current of new thought and object in he continual wanderings disappointment he have have and danger in plenty but only such as rouse a brave and cheerful spirit to bolder self-reliance and invention not those deep sorrow of the heart which leave a man helpless in the lowest pit cry for help from without for there be none within he have see man of all creed and have find in all alike -lrb- so he hold -rrb- the many rogue and the few honest man all religion be in he eye equally true and equally false superior morality be owe principally to the influence of race and climate and devotional experience -lrb- to judge at least from american camp-meeting and popish-city -rrb- the result of a diseased nervous system upon a man so hard and strong this fearful blow have fall and to do he justice he take it like a man he wander on and on for a hour or more up the hill and into the forest talk to himself poor old willy i should have like to have look into he honest face before he go if only to make sure that we be good friend i use to plague he sadly with my trick but what be the use of wish for what can not be i recollect i have just the same feeling when john die and yet i get over it after a time and be as cheerful as if he be alive again or have never live at all and so i shall get over this why should i give way to what i know will pass and be mean to pass it be my father i feel for but i could not be there and it be no fault of mine that i be not there no one tell I what be go to happen and no one could know : so again -- why grieve over what can not be help and then to give the lie to all he cool argument he sit down among the fern and burst into a violent fit of cry oh my poor dear old daddy yes beneath all the hard crust of year that fountain of life still lay pure as when it come down from heaven -- love for he father come come this will not do this be not the way to take stock of my goods either mental or worldly i can not cry the dear old man out of this scrape he look up the sun be set beneath the dark roof of evergreen the eucalyptus bole stand out like basalt pillar black against a background of burn flame the fly fox shoot from tree to tree and moth as big as sparrow whir about the trunk one moment black against the glare beyond and vanish the next like imp of darkness into they native gloom there be no sound of live thing around save the ghastly rattle of the dead bark-tassel which swing from every tree and far away the faint clicking of the digger at they work like the rustle of a gigantic ant-hill be there one among they all who care for he who would not forget he in a week with -- well he be pleasant company poor fellow and go on digging without a sigh what if it be he fate to die as he have see many a stronger man there in that lonely wilderness and sleep for ever unhonour and unknown beneath that awful forest roof while he father look for bread to other ' hand no man be less sentimental no man less superstitious than thomas thurnall but crushed and softened -- all but terrify -lrb- as who would not have be -rrb- -- by that day 's news he could not struggle against the weight of loneliness which fall upon he for the first and last time perhaps in he life he feel fear a vague awful dread of unseen and inevitable possibility why should not calamity fall on he wave after wave be it not fall on he already why should he not grow sick to-morrow break he leg he neck -- why not what guarantee have he in earth or heaven that he might not be snuff out silently as he have see hundred already and die and leave no sign and there spring up in he at once the intensest yearning after he father and the haunt of he boyhood and the wildest dread that he should never see they might not he father be dead ere he could return -- if ever he do return that twelve thousand mile of sea look to he a gulf impassable oh that he be safe at home that he could start that moment and for one minute a helplessness as of a lose child come over he perhaps it have be well for he have he give that feeling vent and confess himself a lose child cry out of the darkness to a father but the next minute he have dash it proudly away pretty baby i be to get frighten at my time of life because i find myself in a dark wood -- and the sun shine all the while as jollily as ever away there in the west it be morning somewhere or other now and it will be morning here again to-morrow ` good time and bad time and all time pass over ' -- i learn that lesson out of old bewick 's vignette and it have stand I in good stead this many a year and shall now die nonsense i take more killing than that come to so for one more bout with old dame fortune if she throw I again why i 'll get up again as i have any time these fifteen year mark 's right i 'll stay here and work till i make a hit or luck run dry and then home and settle and meanwhile i 'll go down to melbourne to-morrow and send the dear old man two hundred pound and then back again here and to it again and with a fate-defiant smile half bitter and half cheerful tom rise and go down again to he mate and stop they inquiry by -- what be do can not be mend and need not be mention whine will not make I work the harder and harder than ever i must work strange it be how mortal man who cometh up and be cut down like the flower can thus harden himself into stoical security and count on the morrow which may never come yet so it be and perhaps if it be not so no work would get do on earth -- at least by the many who know not that god be guide they while they fancy that they be guide themselves chapter ii still life i must now if i be to bring you to two year ago and to my story as it be tell to I ask you to follow I into the good old west country and set you down at the back of a old harbor pier thirty foot of gray and brown boulder spot aloft with bright yellow lichen and black drop of tar polish lower down by the surge of century and towards the foot of the wall roughen with crust of barnacle and mussel-nest in crack and cranny and festoon of coarse drip weed on a low rock at its foot she back rest against the cyclopean wall sit a young woman of eight-and-twenty soberly almost primly dress with three or four tiny child clustering round she in front of they on a narrow spit of sand between the rock a dozen little girl be laugh romp and patter about turn the stone for shanny and bully and other luckless fish leave by the tide while the party beneath the pier wall look steadfastly down into a little rock-pool at they foot -- full of the pink and green and purple cut-work of delicate weed and coralline and star with great sea-dahlias crimson and brown and gray and with the wave snake-lock of the cercus pale blue and rose-tipped like the finger of the dawn one delicate medusa be slide across the pool by slow panting of its crystal bell and on it the eye of the whole group be fix -- for it seem to be the subject of some story which the village schoolmistress be finish in a sweet half-abstracted voice -- and so the cruel soldier be change into a great rough red starfish who go about kill the poor mussel while nobody love he or care to take he part and the poor little girl be change into a beautiful bright jelly-fish like that one who swim about all day in the pleasant sunshine with a red cross stamp on its heart oh mistress what a pretty story cry the little one with tearful eye and what shall we be change to when we die if we will only be good we shall go up to jesus and be beautiful angel and sing hymn would that it might be soon soon for you and I and all and she draw the child to she and look upward as if longing to bear they with she aloft let we leave the conversation where it be and look into the face of the speaker who young as she be have already meditate so long upon the mystery of death that it have grow lovely in she eye she figure be tall graceful and slight the severity of its outline suit well with the severity of she dress with the brown stuff gown and plain gray whittle she neck be long almost too long : but all defect be forget in the first look at she face we can see it fully for she bonnet lie beside she on the rock the masque though thin be perfect the brow like that of greek statue look lower than it really be for the hair spring from below the bend of the forehead the brain be very long and sweep backward and upward in grand curve till it attain above the ear a great expanse and height she should be a character more able to feel than to argue full of all a woman 's veneration devotion love of child -- perhaps too of a woman 's anxiety the nose be slightly aquiline the sharp-cut nostril indicate a reserve of compress strength and passion the mouth be delicate the lip which be full and somewhat heavy not from coarseness but rather from languor show somewhat of both the upper and the under tooth she eye be bent on the pool at she foot so that we can see nothing of they but the large sleepy lid fringe with lash so long and dark that the eye look as if it have be paint in the eastern fashion with antimony the dark lash dark eyebrow dark hair crisp -lrb- as west-country hair so often be -rrb- to its very root increase the almost ghostlike paleness of the face not sallow not snow-white but of a clear bloodless waxen hue and now she lift she eye -- dark eye of preternatural largeness brilliant too but not with the sparkle of the diamond brilliant as deep clear well be in which the mellow moonlight sleep fathom-deep between black wall of rock and round they and round the wide-opened lip and arch eyebrow and slightly wrinkled forehead hang a air of melancholy thought vague doubt almost of startled fear then that expression pass and the whole face collapse into a languor of patient sadness which seem to say -- i can not solve the mystery let he solve it as seem good to he the pier have as usual two stage the upper and narrower for a public promenade the lower and broader one for business two rough collier-lad stranger to the place be lounge on the wall above and begin out of mere mischief drop pebble on the group below hillo you young rascal call a old man lounge like they on the wall if you do not drop that you be likely to get you head break will you do it i would thirty year ago but i 'll find a dozen in five minute who will do it now here lad here 's two welsh vagabond pelt we schoolmistress this be speak to a group of sea-titan who be sit about on the pier-way behind he in red cap blue jacket strip jersey bright brown trousers and all the picturesque comfort of a fisherman 's costume superintend the mending of a boat up jump half-a-dozen off the log and baulking where they have be squat double up knee to nose after the fashion of they class and a volley of execration like a storm of grape almost blow the two offender off the wall the bolder however linger anathematising in turn whereon a black-bearded youth some six foot four in height catch up a oar make a sweep at the shin of the lad above he head and bring he writhe down upon the upper pier-way whence he walk off howl and mutter threat of take the law in vain -- there be not a magistrate within ten mile and custom lynch-law and the coast-guard lieutenant settle all matter in aberalva town and do so easily enough for the petty crime which fill we gaol be all unknown among those honest viking ' son and any man who covet he neighbor 's goods instead of steal they have only to go and borrow they on condition of course of lending in he turn what be that collier-lad holler about captain willi ask mr tardrew steward to lord scoutbush landlord of aberalva as he come up to the old man gentleman jan cut he over for pelt the schoolmistress below here serve he right he 'll have to cut over that curate next i reckon oh mr tardrew do not you talk so the young gentleman be as kind a man as i ever see and come in and out of we house like a lamb wolf in sheep 's clothing growl tardrew what d'ye think he say to I last week want to turn the schoolmistress out of she place because she go to chapel sometimes i know i know reply willi in the tone of a man who wish to avoid a painful subject and what do you answer then mr tardrew i tell he he might if he like but he would make the place too hot to hold he if he have not do it already with he bowing and he crossing and he chanting and he popish gregory -- and tell one he be no papist call he pope gregory himself what do we want with pope ' tune here instead of the old hundredth and martyrdom i should like to see any pope of the lot make a tune like they captain willis listen with a face half sad half slily amuse he and tardrew be old friend be the two most notable person in the parish save jone the lieutenant heale the doctor and another gentleman of whom we shall speak presently both of they too be thorough-going protestant and though churchman walk sometimes into the brianite chapel of a afternoon and think it no sin but each take the curate 's puseyism in a different way be two man as unlike each other as one could well find tardrew -- steward to lord scoutbush the absentee landlord -- be a shrewd hard-bitten choleric old fellow of the shape color and consistence of a red brick one of those english type which mr emerson have so well hit off in he rather confuse and contradictory trait : -- he hide virtue under vice or rather under the semblance of they it be the misshapen hairy scandinavian troll again who lift the cart out of the mire or thresh the corn which ten day-labourer could not end : but it be do in the dark and with muttered malediction he be a churl with a soft place in he heart whose speech be a brash of bitter water but who love to help you at a pinch he say no and serve you and he thanks disgust you such be tardrew -- a true british bulldog who live pretty faithfully up to he old testament but have somehow forget the existence of the new willi be a very different and a very much nobler person the most perfect specimen which i ever have meet -lrb- for i know he well and love he -rrb- of that type of british sailor which good captain marryat have paint in he masterman ready and painted far better than i can even though i do so from life a tall and graceful old man though stoop much from lumbago and old wound with snow-white hair and whisker delicate aquiline feature the manners of a nobleman and the heart of a child all child know that latter fact and clung to he instinctively even the boy that terrible berserk-tribe self-organised self-dependent and bind together in common iniquity and the dread of common retribution who be in aberalva as all fishing town the torment and terror of all douce fogy male and female -- even the boy i say respected captain willi so potent be the influence of he gentleness nail not up he shutter nor tie fishing-line across he doorway tail-pipe not he dog nor send he cat to sea on a barrel-stave nor put live crab into he pocket nor dead dog-fish into he well yea even when judgment too long provoke make bare she red right hand and the lieutenant vow by he commission that he would send half-a-dozen of they to the treadmill they would send up a deputation to beg captain willi to beg the schoolmistress to beg they off for between willi and that fair young creature a friendship have grow up easily to be understand willi be one of those rare nature upon whose purity no mire can cling who pass through the furnace and yet not even the smell of fire have pass upon they breed almost bear on board a smuggling cutter in the old war-time then hunting in the old coast-blockade service the smuggler among whom he have be train watch the slow horror of the walcheren fighting under collingwood and nelson and many another valiant captain lounge away year of temptation on the west-indian station as sailing-master of a ship-of-the-line pensioned comfortably now for many a year in he native town he have be always the same gentle valiant righteous man sober in life strict in duty and simple in word a soul as transparent as crystal and as pure he be the oracle of aberalva now and even lieutenant brown would ask he opinion -- non-commissioned officer though he be -- in a tone which be all the more patronising because he stand a little in awe of the old man but why when the boy want to be beg off be the schoolmistress to be they advocate because grace harvey exercise without intend anything of the kind a almost mesmeric influence on every one in the little town goodness rather than talent have give she wisdom and goodness rather than courage a power of use that wisdom which to those simple superstitious folk seem altogether a inspiration there be a mystery about she too which work strongly on the heart of the west-country people she be suppose to be at time not right and wander intellect be with they as with many primitive people a object more of awe than of pity she deep melancholy alternate with burst of wild eloquence with fantastic fable with entreaty and warning against sin full of such pity and pathos that they melt at time the hardest heart a whole world of strange tale half false half true have grow up around she as she grow she be believe to spend whole night in prayer to speak with visitor from the other world even to have the power of see into futurity the intensity of she imagination give rise to the belief that she have only to will and she could see whom she would and all that they be do even across the sea she exquisite sensibility it be whisper make she feel every bodily suffering she witness as acutely as the sufferer 's self and in the very limb in which he suffer she deep melancholy be believe to be cause by some dark fate -- by some agonising sympathy with evil-doer and it be sometimes say in aberalva -- do not do that for poor grace 's sake she bear the sin of all the parish so it befall that grace harvey govern she know not how or why all heart in that wild simple fishing-town rough man fight on the quay shake hand at grace 's bidding wife who could not lure they husband from the beer-shop send grace in to fetch they home sober by shame : and woe to the stranger who fancy that she entrance into that noisy den give he a right to say a rough word to the fair girl the maiden instead of envy she beauty make she the confidant of all they love for though many a man would gladly have marry she to woo she be more than any dared and gentleman jan himself the rightful bully of the quay as be the handsomest and biggest man for many a mile beside own a tidy trawler and two good mackerel-boat have say openly that if any man have a right to she he suppose he have but that he should as soon think of ask she to marry he as of ask the moon but it be in the school in the duty which lay nearest to she that grace 's inward loveliness shine most lovely whatever dark cloud of melancholy lay upon she own heart she take care that it should never overshadow one of those young innocent whom she teach by love and rule by love always tender always cheerful even gay and playful punish when she rarely punish with tear and kiss to make they as happy as she could in a world where there be nothing but temptation and disappointment and misery to make they fit for heaven and then to pray that they might go thither as speedily as possible this have be she work for now seven year and that manichaeism which have drive darker and harder nature to destroy young child that they might go straight to bliss take in she the form of outpouring of gratitude -lrb- when the first natural tear be dry -rrb- as often as one of she little lamb be deliver out of the misery of this sinful world but as long as they be in the world she be they guardian angel and there be hardly a mother in aberalva who do not confess she debt to grace not merely for she child 's scholarship but for they character frank headley the curate therefore have touch altogether the wrong chord when he speak of displace grace and when that same afternoon he saunter down to the pier-head wearied with he parish work not only do tardrew stump away in silence as soon as he appear but captain willi 's face assume a grave and severe look which be not often to be see on it well captain willi say frank solitary and sad longing for a talk with some one and not quite sure whether he be welcome well sir and the old man lift he hat and make one of he princely bow you look tired sir i be afraid you be do too much i shall have more to do soon say the curate he eye glance towards the schoolmistress who disturb by the noise above be walk slowly up the beach with a child hold to every finger and every fold of she dress willi see the direction of he eye and come at once to the point in he gentle straightforward fashion i hear you have thought of take the school from she sir why -- indeed -- i shall be very sorry but if she will persist in go to the chapel i can not overlook the sin of schism she take the child to church twice a Sunday do not she and teach they all that you tell she -- why -- yes -- i have take the religious instruction almost into my own hand now willi smile quietly you 'll excuse a old sailor sir but i think that be more than mortal man can do there be no hour of the day but what she be teach they something she be tell they bible story now i 'll warrant if you could hear she frank make no answer you would not stop she do that oh sir and the old man speak with a quiet earnestness which be not without its effect just look at she now like the good shepherd with he lamb about he foot and think whether that be not much too pretty a sight to put a end to in a poor sinful world like this it be my duty say frank hardening himself it pain I exceedingly willi -- i hope i need not tell you that if i know aught of mr headley 's heart by he way you need not indeed sir but i can not allow it -- she mother a class leader among these dissenter and one of the most active of they too -- the school next door to she house the preacher of course have influence there and must have how be i to instil church principle into they if he be counteract I the moment my back be turn i have make up my mind willi to do nothing in a hurry lady-day be past and she must go on till midsummer then i shall take the school into my own hand and teach they myself for i can pay no mistress or master and mr st just -- frank check himself as he be go to speak the truth namely that he sleepy old absentee rector lord scoutbush 's uncle would yawn and grumble at the move and wonder why frank have not the sense to leave ill alone would give he no manner of assistance beyond he pittance of eighty pound a-year and five pound at christmas to spend on the poor excuse I sir i do not doubt that you 'll do you best in teaching as you always do : but i tell you honestly you 'll get no child to teach no child they mother know the worth of grace too well and the child too sir and they 'll go to she all the same do what you will and never a one will enter the church door from that day forth on they own head be it say frank a little testily but i should not have fancy miss harvey the sort of person to set up herself in defiance of I the more reason sir if you 'll forgive I for you not put upon she i do not want to put upon she or any one i will do everything i will -- i do -- work day and night for these people mr willi i tell you as i would my own father i do not think i have another object on earth -- if i have i hope i shall forget it -- than the parish : but church principle i must carry out well sir certainly no man ever work here as you do if all have be like you sir there would not be a dissenter here now but excuse I sir the church be a very good thing and i keep to mine have serve under she majesty and she majesty 's forefather and learn to obey order i hope but do not you think sir you be take it as the pharisee take the sabbath-day how then why as if man be make for the church and not the church for man that be a shrewd thought at least where do you pick it up ` tis none of my own sir a bit of wisdom that my maid let fall and it have stick to I strangely ever since you maid yes grace there i always call she my maid have no father poor thing she look up to I as one pretty much -- the dear soul oh sir i hope you 'll think over this again before you do anything it be do in a day : but year will not undo it again so grace 's saying be quote against he she power be formidable enough if she dare use it he be silent awhile and then -- do you think she have hear of this -- of my -- honesty 's the best policy sir : she have and that be the truth you know how thing get round well and what do she say i 'll tell you she very word sir and they be these if you 'll excuse I ` poor dear gentleman ' say she ` if he think chapel-going so wrong why do he dare drive folk to chapel i wonder every time he look at that deep sea he do not remember what the lord say about it and those who cause he little one to offend ' frank be somewhat awed the thought be new the application of the text as he own scholarship teach he even more exact than grace have fancy then she be not angry she sir you could not anger she if you tear she in piece with hot pincers as they do those old martyr she be always tell about good-bye willi say frank in a hopeless tone of voice and saunter to the pier-end down the step and along the lower pier-way burden with many thought he come up to the knot of chat sailor not one of they touch he cap or move out of the way for he the boat lay almost across the whole pier-way and he stop awkwardly enough for there be not room to get by will you be so kind as to let I pass ask he meekly enough but no one stir why do not you get up tom ask one i be lame so be i the gentleman can step over I if he like say big jan a proposition the impossibility whereof raise a horse-laugh be not you ashamed of yourselve lad say the severe voice of willi from above the man rise sulkily and frank hasten on as ready to cry as ever he have be in he life poor fellow he have be labor among these people for now twelve month as no man have ever labor before and he feel that he have not win the confidence of a single human being -- not even of the old woman who take he teaching for the sake of he charity and who scented popery all the while in word in which there be no popery and in doctrine which be just the same on the whole as those of the dissent preacher simply because he would sprinkle among they certain word and phrase which have become suspect as party badge he church be all but empty the general excuse be that it be a mile from the town : but frank know that that be not the true reason that all the parish have get it into they head that he have a lean to popery that he be go over to rome that he be probably a jesuit in disguise now be it always remember frank headley be a good man in every sense of the word he have nothing save the outside in common with those undesirable coxcomb who have not be breed by the high church movement but have take refuge in its crack as they would have do forty year ago in those of the evangelical -- youth who hide they crass ignorance and dulness under the cloak of church infallibility and have neither wit manners learn humanity or any other dignity whereon to stand talk loud _ pour pis aller _ about the dignity of the priesthood such man frank have meet at neighbouring clerical meeting overbear and out-talk the elder and the wiser member and find that he get no good from they have withdraw into he parish-work to eat he own heart like bellerophon of old for frank be a gentleman and a christian if ever one there be delicate in person all but consumptive graceful and refine in all he work and way a scholar elegant rather than deep yet a scholar still full of all love for painting architecture and poetry he have come down to bury himself in this remote curacy in the honest desire of do good he have be a curate in a fashionable london church but find the atmosphere thereof not over wholesome to he soul he have have the courage to throw off st nepomuc 's its brotherhood sisterhood and all its gorgeous and highly-organised appliance for enable five thousand rich to take tolerable care of five hundred poor : and have flee from the holy virgin -lrb- as certain old lady who do twice they work with half they noise call they -rrb- into the wilderness of bethnal green but six month ' gallant work there with gallant man -lrb- for there be high churchman there who be a honor to england -rrb- bring he to death 's door the doctor command some soft western air frank as chivalrous as a knight-errant of old would fain have die at he post but he mother interfere and he could do no less than obey she so he have take this remote west country curacy all the more willingly because he know that nine-tenth of the people be dissenter to recover that place to the church would be something worth live for so he have come and labor late and early and behold he have fail utterly and seem farther than ever from success he have open too hastily a crusade against the dissenter and denounce where he should have conciliate he have overlook -- indeed he hardly know -- the sad truth that the mere fact of he be a clergyman be no passport to the heart of he people for the curate who precede he have be a old man mean ignorant incapable remain there simply because nobody else would have he and give to brandy-and-water as much as he flock the rector for the last fifteen year lord scoutbush 's uncle be a cypher the rector before he have notoriously earn the living by a marriage with a lady who stand in some questionable relation to lord scoutbush 's father and who have never have a think above he dinner and he tithe and all that the aberalva fisherman know of god or righteousness they have learn from the _ soi-disant _ disciple of john wesley so frank headley have to make up at start the arrears of half-a-century of base neglect but instead of do so he have contrived to awaken against himself that dogged hatred of popery which lie inarticulate and confused but deep and firm in the heart of the english people poor fellow if he make a mistake he suffer for it there be hardly a sadder soul than poor frank as he go listlessly up the village street that afternoon to he lodging at captain willi 's which he have take because he prefer live in the village itself to occupy the comfortable rectory a mile out of town however we can not set he straight -- after all every man must perform that office for himself so the best thing we can do as we land naturally at the pier-head be to walk up-street after he and see what sort of a place aberalva be beneath we to the left hand be the quay-pool now lie dry in which a

sweep even aberalva clean for the next week grace harvey see the come storm as she go slowly homewards dismiss she little flock and she linger long and sadly outside she cottage door look out over the fast blacken sea and listen to the hollow thunder of the groundswell against the back of the point which shelter aberalva cove far away on the horizon the mast of stately ship stand out against the sky drive fast to the eastward with shorten sail they too know what be come and grace pray for they as she stand in she wild way with half outspoken word all those gallant ship dear lord and so many beautiful man in they and so few of they ready to die and all those gallant soldier go to the war -- lord wilt thou not have mercy spare they for a little time before -- be not that cruel

war for as she pray the orinoco ripon and manilla be steam down southampton water with the guard on board and but that morning little lord scoutbush leave behind at the depôt have bid farewell to he best friend opposite buckingham palace while the bearskin be on the bayonet-point with -- well old fellow you have the fun after all and i the work and have be answer with -- fun there will be no fighting and i shall only have lose my season in town be there then no man among they that day who as the tree begin to whisper and the wind begin to roll hear in the wild march morning the angel call he soul \* \* \* \* \* verily they be go down to hade even many stalwart soul of hero chapter iii anything but still life penalva court about half a mile from the quay be like a house in a story -- a house of seven gable and those very shaky one a house of useless long passage useless turret vast lumber attic where maid see ghost lofty garden and yard wall of gray stone round which the wind and rain be lash through the dreary darkness low oak-ribbed ceiling window which once be mullion with stone but now with wood paint white wall which be once oak-wainscot but have be paint like the mullion to the disgust of elsley vavasor poet its occupant in march 1854 who forget that while the oak be leave dark no man could have see to read in the room a yard from the window he have however little reason to complain of the one drawing-room where he and he wife be sit so pleasant have she make it look in spite of the plainness of the furniture a bright log-fire be burn on the hearth there be a few good book too and a few handsome print while some really valuable nick-nack be set out with pardonable ostentation on a little table cover with crimson velvet it be only cotton velvet if you look close at it but the thing be pretty enough to catch the eye of all visitor and mr heale the doctor 's wife -lrb- who always call mr vavasor my lady though she do not love she -rrb- and mr trebooze of trebooze always finger they over when they have any opportunity and whisper to each other half contemptuously -- ah poor thing there be a sign that she have see better day and better day in one sense mr vavasor have see i be afraid indeed that she have more than once regret the morning when she run away in a hack-cab from she brother lord scoutbush 's house in eaton square to be marry to elsley vavasor the gifted author of a soul 's agony and other poem he be a lion then with foolish woman run after he and turn he head once and for all and lucium st just be a wild irish girl new to london society all feeling and romance and literally all for there be little real intellect underlie she passionate sensibility so when the sensibility burnt itself out as it generally do and when child and the weak health which come with they and the care of a household and money difficulty be absorb she little power elsley vavasor begin to fancy that he wife be a very commonplace person who be fast lose even she good look and she good temper so on the whole they be not happy elsley be a affectionate man and honorable to a fantastic nicety but he be vain capricious over-sensitive craving for admiration and distinction and it be not enough for he that he wife love he and bear he child keep he account mend and moil all day long for he and he he want she to act the public for he exactly when he be hungry for praise and that not the actual but a altogether ideal public to worship he as a deity live for he and he alone realize he poetic dream of marriage bliss and talk sentiment with he or listen to he talk sentiment to she when she would much sooner be safe in bed bury all the petty care of the day and the pain in she back too poor thing in sound sleep and so it befall that they often quarrel and wrangle and that they be quarrel and wrangle this very night who care to know how it begin who care to hear how it go on -- the stupid aimless skirmish of bitter word between two people who have forget themselves i believe it begin with elsley 's be vex at she spring up two or three time fancy that she hear the child cry while he want to be quiet and sentimentalise over the roaring of the wind outside then -- she think of nothing but those child why do she not take a book and occupy she mind to which she have she pert though just answer about she mind have quite enough to do to keep clothes on the child 's back and so forth -- let who list imagine the miserable little squabble -- till she say -- i know what have put you out so to-night nothing but the news of my sister 's come he answer -- that she sister be as little to he as to any man as welcome to come now as she have be to stay away these three year ah it be very well to say that but you have be a different person ever since that letter come and so she torment he into a angry self-justification -lrb- which she take triumphantly as a confession -rrb- that it be very disagreeable to have he thought break in on by one who have no sympathy with he and he pursuit -- and who and at that point he wisely stop short for he be go to throw down a very ugly gage of battle throw down or not lucium snatch at it ah i understand poor valentium you always hate she i do not : but she be so brusque and excited and -- be so kind as not to abuse my family you may say what you will of I but -- and what have you family do for I pray why consider that we be now live rent-free in my brother 's house and -- she stop in she turn for she pride and she prudence also will not let she tell he that valentium have be clothing she and the child for the last three year he be just the man to forbid she on the spot to receive any more present and to sacrifice she comfort to he own pride but what she have say be quite enough to bring out a very angry answer which she expect nip in the bud by -- for goodness ' sake do not speak so loud i do not want the servant to hear i be not speak loud -- -lrb- he have not yet open he lip -rrb- that be you old trick to prevent my defend myself while you be drive one mad how dare you taunt I with be a pensioner on you brother 's bounty i 'll go up to town again and take lodgings there i need not be beholden to any aristocrat of they all i have my own station in the real world -- the world of intellect i have my own friend i have make myself a name without he help and i can live without he help he shall find which name be you speaking of rejoin she look up at he with all she native irish humor flash up for a moment in she naughty eye the next minute she would have give she hand not to have say it for with a very terrible word elsley spring to he foot and dash out of the room she hear he catch up he hat and cloak and hurry out into the rain slam the door behind he she spring up to call he back but he be go -- and she dash herself on the floor and burst into a agony of weep over young bliss never to return not in the least she principal fear be lest he should catch cold in the rain she take up she work again and stitch away in the comfortable certainty that in half a hour she will have recover she temper and he also that they will pass a sulky night and to-morrow by about mid-day without explanation or formal reconciliation have become as good friend as ever perhaps say she to herself with a woman 's sense of power if he be very much ashamed and very wet i 'll pity he and make friend to-night miserable enough be these little squabble why will two people who have swear to love and cherish each other utterly and who on the whole do what they have swear behave to each other as they dare for very shame behave to no one else be it that as every beautiful thing have its hideous antitype this mutual shamelessness be the devil 's ape of mutual confidence perhaps it can not be otherwise with being compact of good and evil when the veil of reserve be withdraw from between two soul it must be withdraw for evil as for good till the two nature which ought to seek rest each in the other 's inmost depths may at last spring apart confront each other recklessly with -- there you see I as i be you know the worst of I and i of you take I as you find I -- what care i elsley and lucia have not yet arrive at that terrible crisis : though they be on the path toward it -- the path of little carelessness rudeness ungoverned word and temper and worst of all of that half-confidence which be certain to avenge itself by irritation and quarrel for if two married people will not tell each other in love what they ought they will be sure to tell each other in anger what they ought not it be plain enough already that elsley have he weak point which must not be touch something about a name which lucia be to be expect to ignore -- as if anything which really exist could be ignore while two people live together night and day for better for worse till the thorn be out the wound will not heal and till the matter -lrb- whatever it may be -rrb- be set right by confession and absolution there will be no peace for they for they be live in a lie and unless it be a very little one indeed better perhaps that they should go on to that terrible crisis of open defiance it may end in disgust hatred madness but it may too end in each fall again upon the other 's bosom and sob out through holy tear -- yes you do know the worst of I and yet you love I still this be happiness to find oneself most love when one most hate oneself god help we to confess we sin to thee as we have do to each other and to begin life again like little child struggle hand in hand out of this lowest pit up the steep path which lead to life and strength and peace heaven grant that it may so end but now elsley have go rage out into the rage darkness try to prove himself to himself the most injured of man and to hate he wife as much as possible : though the fool know the whole time that he love she better than anything on earth even than that fame on which he try to fatten he lean soul snap greedily at every scrap which fall in he way and in default snap at everybody and everything else and little comfort it give he why should it what comfort save in be wise and strong and be he the wiser or stronger for be tell by a reviewer that he have write fine word or have fail in write they or to have silly woman write to ask for he autograph or for leave to set he song to music nay -- shocking as the question may seem -- be he the wiser and stronger man for be a poet at all and a genius -- provide of course that the word genius be use in its modern meaning of a person who can say prettier thing than he neighbor i think not be it as it may away go the poor genius he long cloak picturesque enough in calm weather flutter about uncomfortably enough while the rain wash he long curl into swab out through the old garden between storm-swept laurel beneath dark groan pine and through a door in the wall which open into the lane the lane lead downward on the right into the village he be in no temper to meet he fellow-creature -- even to see the comfortable gleam through they window as the sailor close round the fire with wife and child so he turn to the leave up the deep stone-banked lane which lead towards the cliff dark now as pitch for it be overhung right and leave with deep oak-wood it be no easy matter to proceed though for the wind pour down the lane as through a funnel and the road be of slippery bare slate worn here and there into puddle of greasy clay and elsley slip back half of every step while he wrath as he tire ooze out of he heel moreover those dark tree above he toss they head impatiently against the scarcely less dark sky strike a awe into he -- a sense of loneliness almost of fear a uncanny bad night it be and he be out on a bad errand and he know it and wish that he be home again he do not believe of course in those spirit of the storm about whom he have so often write any more than he do in a great deal of he fine imagery but still in such character as he the sympathy between the mood of nature and those of the mind be most real and important and dame nature 's equinoctial night wrath be weird gruesome crush and can be face -lrb- if it must be face -rrb- in real comfort only when one be go on a errand of mercy with a clear conscience a light heart a good cigar and plenty of mackintosh so ere elsley have go a quarter of a mile he turn back and resolve to go in and take up he book once more perhaps lucia might beg he pardon and if not why perhaps he might beg hers the rain be wash the spirit out of he as it do out of a thin-coated horse stay what be that sound above the roar of the gale a cannon he listen turn he head right and leave to escape the howling of the wind in he ear a minute and another boom rise and ring aloft it be near too he almost fancy that he feel the concussion of the air another and another and then in the village below he could see light hurry to and fro a wreck at sea he turn again up the lane he have never see a wreck what a opportunity for a poet and on such a night too : it would be magnificent if the moon would but come out just the scene too for he excited temper he will work on upward let it blow and rain as it may he be not disappointed ere he have go a hundred yard a mass of drip oil-skin run full butt against he knock he against the bank and by the clank of weapon he recognize the coast-guard watchman hillo -- who be that beg you pardon sir as the man recognize elsley 's voice what be it -- what be the gun god know sir overright the chough and crow on 'em i be afeard there they go again -- hard up poor soul god help they and the man run shout down the lane another gun and another but long ere elsley reach the cliff they be silent and nothing be to be hear but the noise of the storm which loud as it be below among the wood be almost intolerable now that he be on the open down he struggle up the lane toward the cliff and there pause gasp under the shelter of a wall try to analyze that enormous mass of sound which fill he ear and brain and flow through he heart like maddening wine he can bear the sight of the dead grass on the cliff-edge weary feeble expostulate with its old tormentor the gale then the fierce scream of the blast as they rush up across the layer of rock below like hound leap up at they prey and far beneath the horrible confused battle-roar of that great leaguer of wave he can not see they as he strain he eye over the wall into the blank depth -- nothing but a confused welter and quiver of mingled air and rain and spray as if the very atmosphere be writhe in the clutch of the gale : but he can hear -- what can he not hear it would have need a less vivid brain than elsley 's to fancy another badajo beneath there it all be : -- the rush of column to the breach officer cheer they on -- pause break wild retreat upbraid call whisper consultation -- fresh rush on rush now here now there -- fierce shout above below behind -- shriek of agony choke groan and gasp of die man -- scaling-ladders hurl down with all they rattle freight -- dull mine-explosion ring cannon-thunder as the old fortress blast back its besieger pell-mell into the deep it be all there : truly enough there at least to madden yet more elsley 's wild angry brain till he try to add he shout to the great battle-cry of land and sea and find they as little audible as a infant 's wail suddenly far below he a bright glimmer -- and in a moment a blue-light reveal the whole scene in ghastly hue -- blue leap breaker blue welter sheet of foam blue rock crowd with blue figure like ghost flit to and fro upon the brink of that blue seething phlegethon and rush up towards he through the air a thousand fly blue foam-sponge which dive over the brow of the hill and vanish like delicate fairy flee before the wrath of the gale : -- but where be the wreck the blue-light can not pierce the gray veil of mingled mist and spray which hang to seaward and she gun have be silent for half a hour and more elsley hurry down and find half the village collect on the long sloping point of down below sailor wrap in pilot-cloth oil-skinned coast-guardsmen woman with they gown turn over they head stagger restlessly up and down and in and out while every moment some fresh comer stumble down the slope thrust himself into he clothes as he go and ask where 's the wreck and get no answer but a surly advice to hold he noise as if they have hope of hear the wreck which they can not see and kind woman with they heart full of mother ' instinct declare that they can hear little child cry and be pooh-pooh down by kind man who man 's fashion do not like to believe anything too painful or if they believe it to talk of it what be the gun from then brown ask the lieutenant of the head-boatman off the chough and crow i think sir god grant not you think sir say the great man willing to vent he vexation on some one _ why _ do not you make sure why just look lieutenant say brown point into the blank height of the dark and i be on the pier too and could not see but the look-out man here say -- a shift of wind a drift of cloud and the moon flash out a moment -- there she be sir some three hundred yard out at sea lie a long curved black line beautiful severe and still amid those white wild leap hill a murmur from the crowd which swell into a roar as they surge aimlessly up and down another moment and it be cut in two by a white line -- cover -- lose -- all hold they breath no the sea pass on and still the black curve be there endure a terrible big ship a liverpool clipper by the line of she god help the poor passenger then sob a woman they be past we help : she be on she beam end and she deck upright toward we silence out of the way you loaf long-shore shout the lieutenant brown -- the rocket what though the lieutenant be somewhat give to strong liquor and stronger language he wear the queen 's uniform and what be more he know he work and can do it all make a silent ring while the fork be plant the lieutenant throw away the end of he cigar kneel and adjust the stick brown and he mate examine and shake out the coil of line another minute and the magnificent creature rush forth with a triumphant roar and soar aloft over the wave in a long stream of fire defiant of the gale be it over she no a fierce gust which all but hurl the spectator to the ground the fiery stream sweep away to the leave in a grand curve of spark and drop into the sea try it again shout the lieutenant he blood now up we 'll see which will beat wind or powder again a rocket be fix with more allowance for the wind but the black curve have disappear and he must wait awhile there it be again fly swift and sure cry elsley thou fiery angel of mercy bear the saviour-line it may not be too late yet full and true the rocket go across she and three cheer for the lieutenant rise above the storm silence lad not so bad though say he rub he wet hand hold on by the line and watch for a bite brown five minute pass brown have the line in he hand wait for any signal touch from the ship : but the line sway limp in the surge ten minute the lieutenant light a fresh cigar and pace up and down smoking fiercely a quarter of a hour and yet no response the moon be shine clearly now they can see she hatchway the stump of she mast great tangle of rig sway and lash down across she deck but that delicate upper curve be become more ragged after every wave and the tide be rise fast there be a pull shout brown no there be not god have mercy sir she be go the black curve boil up as if a mine have be spring on board leap into arch jagged peak black bar cross and tangle and then all melt away into the white seething waste while the line float home helplessly as if disappointed and the billow plunge more sullenly and sadly towards the shore as if in remorse for they dark and reckless deed all be over what shall we do now go home and pray that god may have mercy on all drown soul or think what a picturesque and tragical scene it be and what a beautiful poem it will make when we have throw it into a artistic form and bedizen it with conceit and analogy steal from all heaven and earth by we own self-willed fancy elsley vavasor -- through whose spectacles rather than with my own eye i have be look at the wreck and to whose account not to mine the metaphor and simile of the last two page must be lay -- take the latter course not that he be not awed calm and even humble as he feel how poor and petty he own trouble be compare with that great tragedy : but in he fatal habit of consider all matter in heaven and earth as brick and mortar for the poet to build with he consider that he have see enough as if man be send into the world to see and not to act and go home too excite to sleep much more to go and kiss forgiveness to he sleep wife sit up all night write the wreck which may be -lrb- as the reviewer in the parthenon assert -rrb- a exquisite poem but i can not say that it be of much importance so the delicate genius sate that night scribble verse by a warm fire and the rough lieutenant settle himself down in he mackintosh to sit out those weary hour on the bare rock have do all that he could do and yet know that he duty be not to leave the place as long as there be a chance of saving -- not a life for that be past all hope -- but a chest of clothes or a stick of timber there he settle himself grumble yet faithful and fill up the time with sleepy malediction against some old admiral who have -- or have not -- take a spite to he in the west indy thirty year before else he would have be a post captain by now comfortably in bed on board a crack frigate instead of sit all night out on a rock like a old cormorant etc etc who know not the woe of ancient coast-guard lieutenant but as it befall elsley vavasor be justly punish for go home by lose the most poetical incident of the whole night for with the coast-guardsmen many sailor stay there be nothing to be earn by stay : but still who know but they might be want and they hang on with the same feeling which tempt one to linger round a grave ere the earth be fill in loth to give up the last sight and with it the last hope the ship herself over and above she lose crew be in they eye a person to be love and regret and gentleman jan speak like a true sailor -- ah poor dear and she such a beauty mr brown as any one might see by she line even that way off ah poor dear and so many brave soul on board and perhaps some of they not ready mr beer say the serious elderly chief boatman eh captain willi the lord have have mercy on they i do not doubt answer the old man in he quiet sweet voice one can not but hope that he would give they time for one prayer before all be over and have be drown myself mr brown three time and take up for dead -- that be once in gibraltar bay and once when i be a total wreck in the old seahorse that be in the hurricane in the indy after that when i fall over quay-head here fishing for bass -- why i know well how quick the prayer will run through a man 's heart when he be a-drowning and the light of conscience too all one 's life in one minute like -- it ar not the man i care for say gentleman jan they be go to heaven like all brave sailor do as die by wreck and battle : but the poor dear ship d'ye see captain willi she ha 'n' t no heaven to go to and that be why i feel for she so both the old man shake they head at jan 's doctrine and turn the subject off you would better go home captain ` fear of the rheumatic it be a rough night for you year and you have no call like I i would but my maid there and i can not get she home and i can not leave she and willi point to the schoolmistress who sit upon the flat slope of rock a little apart from the rest with she face rest on she hand gaze intently out into the wild waste make she go it be she duty -- we all have we duty why do she mother let she out at this time of night i keep my maid tighter than that i warrant and disciplinarian mr brown make a step towards she ah mr brown do not now she be not one of we there be no say what be go on there in she maybe she be pray maybe she see more than we do over the sea there what do you mean there be no living body in those breaker be sure there be more living thing about on such a night than have body to they or than any but such as she can see if any one ever talk with angel that maid do and i have hear she too i can say i have -- certain of it those that like may call she a innocent : but i wish i be such a innocent mr brown i would be nearer heaven then here on earth than i fear sometimes i ever shall be even after i be dead and go well she be a good girl maze or not but look at she now what be she after the girl have raise she head and be point with one arm stretch stiffly out toward the sea old willi go down to she and touch she gently on the shoulder come home my maid then you 'll take cold indeed but she do not move or lower she arm the old man accustom to she fit of fix melancholy look down under she bonnet to see whether she be past as he call it by the moonlight he could see she great eye steady and wide open she motion he away half impatiently and then spring to she foot with a scream a man a man save he as she speak a huge wave roll in and shoot up the sloping end of the point in a broad sheet of foam and out of it struggle on hand and knee a human figure he look wildly up and round and then he head drop again on he breast and he lay cling with outspread arm like homer 's polypus in the odyssey as the wave drain back in a thousand roar cataract over the edge of the rock save he shriek she again as twenty man rush forward -- and stop short the man be fully thirty yard from they : but close to he between they and he stretch a long ghastly crack some ten foot wide cut the point across all know it : its slippery edge its polished upright side the seething cauldron within it and know too that the next wave would boil up from it in a hundred jet and suck in the strongest to he doom to fall with brain dash out into a chasm from which be no return ere they could nerve themselves for action the wave have come up the slope it go one half of it bury the wretched mariner and fall over into the chasm the other half rush up the chasm itself and spout forth again to the moonlight in column of snow in time to meet the wave from which it have just part as it fall from above and then the two boil up and round and over and swirl along the smooth rock to they very foot the schoolmistress take one long look and as the wave retire rush after it to the very brink of the chasm and fling herself on she knee she be maze no she be not almost scream old willi in mingled pride and terror as he rush after she the wave have carry he across the crack and she be get he and he spring upon she and catch she round the waist now if you be man shout he as the rest hurry down now if you be man before the next wave come shout big jan hand together and make a line and he take a grip with one hand of the old man 's waistband and hold out the other for who would to seize who take it frank headley the curate who have be watch all sadly apart longing to do something which no one could mistake be you man enough ask big jan doubtfully try say frank really you be not sir say jan civilly enough mean no offence sir you heart 's stout enough i see but you do not know what 'll be and he catch the hand of a huge fellow next he while frank shrink sadly back into the darkness strong hand after hand be clasp and strong knee after knee drop almost to the rock to meet the come rush of water and all who know they business take a long breath -- they might have need of one it come and surge over the man and the girl and up to old willi 's throat and round the knee of jan and he neighbor and then follow the return out-draught and every limb quiver with the strain : but when the cataract have disappear the chain be still unbroken save and a cheer break from all lip save those of the girl herself she be as senseless as he whom she have save they hurry she and he up the rock ere another wave could come but they have much ado to open she hand so firmly clench together be they round he waist gently they lift each and lay they on the rock while old willi have recover he breath set to work cry like a child to restore breath to he maiden run for dr heale some good christian but frank longing to escape from a company who do not love he and to be of some use ere the night be out be already half-way to the village on that very errand however ere the doctor could be stir out of he boozy slumber and thrust into he clothes by he wife the schoolmistress be safe in bed at she mother 's house and the man weak but alive carry triumphantly up to heale 's door which have be kick open the sailor insist in carry he right upstairs and deposit he on the best spare bed if you will not come to you patient doctor you patient shall come to you why be you asleep in you liquor instead of look out for poor wratch like a christian you see whether he bone be break and gi'un he medicine proper and then go and see after the schoolmistress she be worth a dozen of any man and a thousand of you we 'll pay for ` un like man and if you do not we 'll break every bottle in you shop to which what between bodily fear and real good-nature old heale assent and so end that eventful night chapter iv flotsom jetsom and lagend about nine o'clock the next morning gentleman jan stroll into dr heale 's surgery pipe in mouth with a attendant satellite for every lion poor as well as rich -- in country as in town must need have he jackal heale 's surgery -- or in plain english shop -- be a doleful hole enough in such dirt and confusion as might be expect from a drunken occupant with a practice which be only not decay because there be no rival in the field but monopoly make the old man as it make most man all the more lazy and careless and there be not a drug on he shelf which could be warrant to work the effect set forth in that sanguine and too trustful book the pharmacopoeia which like mr pecksniff 's england expect every man to do he duty and be accordingly -lrb- as the lancet and dr letheby know too well -rrb- grievously disappoint in this kennel of evil savor heale be slowly try to poke thing into something like order and drag out a few old drug with a shaky hand to see if any one would buy they in a vague expectation that something must need have happen to somebody the night before which would require somewhat of he art and he be not disappointed gentleman jan without take he pipe out of he mouth drop he huge elbow on the counter and he black-fringed chin on he fist take a look round the shop as if to find something which would suit he and then -- i say doctor gi 's some tackleum some diachylum plaster mr beer say heale meekly what for then to tackle my shin i bark 'em cruel against king arthur 's nose last night hard in the bone he be -- wish i be as hard how much diachylum will you want then mr beer well i do not know let 's see and jan pull up he blue trousers and pull down he gray rig and furrow and consider he broad and shaggy shin matter of four penny broad : two to each leg and then replace he elbow and smoke on i say doctor that ` ere curate come out well last night i shall go to church next Sunday what ask the satellite after you upset he that fashion yesterday i do not care what you think say jan who of course bully he jackal like most lion : but i go to church he be a good ` un say i -- little and good like a welshman 's cow and clap I on the back when we would get the man and the maid safe and say -- ` well do we side old fellow ' and stand something hot all round what be more in at the mariner 's rest -- i say doctor where 's he as we haul ashore i 'll go up and see ` un not now then mr beer not now then he be sleep indeed he be like any child so much the better we wai not be bother with he holler but go up i will do ye let I now i 'll be as still as a maid and jan kick off he shoe and march on tip-toe through the shop while dr heale moan professional ejaculation show he the way the shipwrecked man be sleep sweetly and little be to be see of he face so covered be it with dark tangled curl and thick beard ah a ` stralian digger by the beard of he and he red jersey whisper jan as he bent tenderly over the poor fellow and put he head on one side to listen to he breathing beautiful he sleep to be sure say jan : and a tidy-looking chap too ` tis a pity to wake ` un poor wratch and he perhaps with a sweetheart aboard and drownd or else all he kit lose -- let ` un sleep so long as he can : he 'll find all out soon enough god help he and big jan steal down the stair gently and reverently like a true sailor and take he diachylum and go off to plaster he shin about ten minute afterwards heale be make aware that he guest be awake by sundry grunt and ejaculation which end in a series of long and doleful whistle and then break out into a song so he go up and find the stranger sit upright in bed comb he curl with he finger and chaunting unto himself a cheerful ditty good morning doctor quoth he as he host enter very kind of you this hope i have not turn a better man than myself out of he bed delighted to see you so well very near drowned though we be pump at you lung for a full half hour ah nothing though for a experienced professional man like you hum speak well for you discrimination say heale flattered very well-spoken young person though he beard be a bit wild -- how do you know then that i be a doctor by the reverend look of you sir besides i smell the rhubarb and senna all the way up-stair and know that i would fall among professional brethren -- ` oh then this valiant mariner which sail across the sea he come home to he own sweetheart with he heart so full of glee with he heart so full of glee sir and he pocket full of gold and he bag of drugget with many a nugget as heavy as he could hold ' do not you wish yours be doctor eh eh eh snigger heale mine be last night now doctor let 's have a glass of brandy-and-water hot with and a hour 's more sleep and then kick I out and into the workhouse be anybody else save from the wreck last night nobody sir say heale and say sir because in spite of the stranger 's rough look he accent -- or rather he no-accent -- show he that he have fall in with a very different and probably a very superior stamp of man to himself in the light of which conviction -lrb- and be withal a good-natured old soul -rrb- he go down and mixed he a stiff glass of brandy-and water answer he wife 's remonstrance by -- the party up-stair be a bit of a frantic party certainly but he be certainly a very superior party and have the true gentleman about he any one can see besides he be shipwreck as you and i may be any day and what be like brandy-and-water i should like to know when i be like to be shipwreck or you either say mr heale in a tone slightly savor of indignation and contempt you think of nothing but brandy-and-water but she let the doctor take the glass upstairs nevertheless a few minute afterwards frank come in and inquire for the shipwrecked man well enough in body sir and rather require you skill than mine say the old time-server will not you walk up so up frank be show the stranger be sit up in bed capital you brandy be doctor -- ah sir see frank it be very kind of you i be sure to call on I i presume you be the clergyman but before frank could answer heale have break forth into loud praise of he set forth how the stranger owe he life entirely to he superhuman strength and courage ` pon my word sir say the stranger -- look they both over and over through and through as if to settle how much of all this he be to believe -- i be deeply indebted to you for you gallantry i only wish it have be employ on a better subject my good sir say frank blushing you owe you life not to I i would have help if i could but be not think worthy by we son of anak here you actual preserver be a young girl and frank tell he the story whew i hope she will not expect I to marry she as payment -- handsome beautiful say frank money the village schoolmistress clever a sort of half-baked body say heale a very puzzling intellect say frank ah -- well -- that be a fair excuse for decline the honor i can not be expect to marry a frantic party as you call I down stair just now doctor i sir yes i hear no offence though my good sir -- but i have the ear of a fox i hope really though that she be none the worse for she heroic flight how be she this morning mr heale well -- poor thing a little light-headed last night : but kindly when i go in last whew i hope she have not fall in love with I she may fancy I she property -- a private waif and stray better send for the coast-guard officer and let he claim I as belong to the admiralty as flotsom jetsom and lagend for i be all three last night you be indeed sir say frank who begin to be a little tired of this levity and very thankful to heaven you ought to be frank spake this in a somewhat professional tone of voice at which the stranger arch he eyebrow screw he lip up and lay he ear back like a horse when he meditate a kick you must be better acquaint with my affair than i be my dear sir if you be able to state that fact -- doctor i hear a patient come into the surgery extraordinary power of hear to be sure say heale toddle down stair while the stranger go on look frank full in the face now that old fogy 's go down stair my dear sir let we come to a understanding at the beginning of we acquaintance of course you be bind by you cloth to say that sort of thing to I just as i be bind by it not to swear in you company : but you 'll allow I to remark that it would be rather try even to you faith if you be to be throw ashore with nothing in the world but a old jersey and a bag of tobacco two hundred mile short of the port where you hope to land with fifteen hundred well-earned pound in you pocket my dear sir say frank after a pause whatsoever come from we father 's hand must be mean in love ` the lord give and the lord have take away ' a quaint wince pass over the stranger 's face father sir that fifteen hundred pound be go to my father 's hand from whosesoever hand it come or the loss of it and now what be to become of the poor old man that hussy dame fortune only know -- if she know she own mind a hour together which i very much doubt i work early and late for that money sir up to my knee in mud and water let it be enough for you lofty demand on poor humanity that i take my loss like a man with a whistle and a laugh instead of howl and cursing over it like a baboon let 's talk of something else and lend I five pound and a suit of clothes i sha not run away with they for as i have be throw ashore here here i shall stay frank almost laugh at the free and easy request though he feel at once pained by the man 's irreligion and abashed by he stoicism -- would he have behave even as well in such a case i have not five pound in the world good we shall understand each other better but the suit of clothes you shall have at once good again let it be you oldest for i must do a little rock-scrambling here for purpose of my own so off go frank to fetch the clothes puzzling over he new parishioner the man be not altogether well breed either in voice or manner but there be a ease a confidence a sense of power which make frank feel that he have fall in with a very strong nature and one which have see many man and many land and profit by what it have see when he return he find the stranger busy at he ablutions and gradually appear as a somewhat dapper handsome fellow with a bright gray eye a short nose a firm small mouth a broad and upright forehead across the left side of which run a fearful scar that be a shrewd mark say he as he catch frank 's eye fix on it while he sit coolly arrange himself on the bedside i get it in fair fight though by a crow 's tomahawk in the rocky mountain and here 's another token -lrb- lift up he black curl -rrb- which a greek robber give I in the morea i have another under my head for which i have to thank a tartar and one or two more little remembrance of flood and field up and down I perhaps they may explain to you why i take life and death so coolly i have look too often at the little razor-bridge which part they to care much for either now do not let I trouble you any longer you have you flock to see to i do not doubt you 'll find I at church on Sunday i always do at rome as rome do then you will stay away say frank with a sad smile ah no church be respectable and aristocratic and there one do not get send to a place unmentionable ten time a hour by some inspired tinker beside country people like the doctor to go to church with they betters and the very fellow who go to the methodist meeting themselves would think it _ infra dig _ in I to walk in there now good-bye -- though i have not introduce myself -- not know the name of my kind preserver my name be frank headley curate of the parish say frank smile : though he see the man be rattle on for the purpose of prevent he talk on serious matter and mine be tom thurnall frc licentiate of the university of pari glasgow and whilome surgeon of the good clipper hesperus which you see wreck last night so farewell come over with I and have some breakfast no thanks you 'll be busy i 'll screw some out of old bottle here and now say tom thurnall to himself as frank leave the room to begin life again with a old penknife and a pound of honeydew i wonder which of they get my girdle i 'll stick here till i find out that one thing and stop the note by to-day 's post if i can but recollect they all -- if i could but stop the nugget too so say he walk down into the surgery and look round everything be in confusion cobweb be over the bottle and army of mite play at bo-peep behind they he try a few drawer and find that they stick fast and when he at last open one its contents be two old dried-up horse-ball and a dirty tobacco-pipe he take down a jar marked epsom salt and find it full of welsh snuff the next which be label cinnamon contain blue vitriol the spatula and pill-roller be crust with deposit of every hue the pill-box drawer have not a dozen whole box in it and the counter be a quarter of a inch deep in deposit of every vegetable and mineral matter include end of string tobacco ash and broken glass tom take up a dirty duster and set to work coolly to clear up whistle away so merrily that he bring in heale i be do a little in the way of business you see then you really be a professional practitioner sir as mr headley inform I : though of course i do not doubt the fact say heale summon up all the little courage he have to ask the question with frc london pari and glasgow easy enough to write and ascertain the fact have be medical officer to a poor-law union and to a brazilian man-of-war have see three cholera two army fever and yellow-jack without end have doctor gunshot wound in the two texan war in one pari revolution and in the schleswig-holstein row beside accident practice in every country from californium to china and round the world and back again there be a fine nest of mr weeke 's friend -lrb- if not creation -rrb- acarus horridus and tom go on dust and arrange heale have be fairly take aback by the impose list of acquirement and look at he guest awhile with considerable awe : suddenly a suspicion flash across he which cause he -lrb- not unseen by tom -rrb- a start and a look of self-congratulatory wisdom he next dart out of the shop and return as rapidly rather redder about the eye and wipe he mouth with the back of he hand but sir though though -- begin he -- but of course you will allow I be a stranger -- and as a man of business -- all i have to say be if -- that be to say -- you want to know why if i have have all these good business why i have not keep they ex -- actly stammer heale much relieve a very sensible and business-like question : but you need not have be so delicate about ask it as to want a screw before begin ah you be a wag sir keckle the old man i 'll tell you frankly i have a old father sir -- a gentleman and a scholar and a man of science once in as good a country practice as man could have till god help he he go blind sir -- and i have to keep he and have still i go over the world to make my fortune and never make it and send he home what i do make and little enough too at last in my despair i go to the digging and have a pretty haul -- i need not say how much that matter little now for i suppose it be at the bottom of the sea there be my story sir and a poor one enough it be -- for the dear old man at least and tom 's voice tremble so as he tell it that old heale believe every word and what be more being -- like most hard drinker -- not unused to the melting mood wipe he eye fervently and go off for another drop of comfort while tom dust and arrange on till the shop begin to look quite smart and business-like now sir -- when the old man come back -- business be business and beggar must not be chooser i do not want to meddle with you practice i know the rule of the profession : but if you 'll let I sit here and mix you medicine for you you 'll have the more time to visit you patient that be clear -- and perhaps -lrb- think he -rrb- to drink you brandy-and-water -- and when any of they be poison by I it will be time to kick I out all i ask be bed and board do not be frighten for you spirit-bottle i can drink water i have do it many a time for a week together in the prairie and be thankful for a half-pint in the day but sir you dignity as a -- fiddlestick for dignity i must live sir only lend I a

saloon-door among the poor half-dressed woman and child queer sight lieutenant i have see a good many but never worse than that i bolt to my cabin tie my note and gold round I and out again do not desert the poor thing could not if i would try they cling to I like a swarm of bee ` gad sir that be hard line to have all the pretty woman one have waltz with every evening through the trade and the little child one have be make plaything for hold round one 's knee and scream to the doctor to save they and how the -- be i to save they sir cry tom with a sudden burst of feeling which as in so many englishman explode in anger to avoid melting in tear ought to be a law against it sir growl the lieutenant against women-folk and child go to sea it be murder and cruelty i have be wreck score of time but it be with honest man who could shift for themselves and if they be drown drowned but do not screech and catch hold -- i could not stand that well well there be a pretty little creature a officer 's widow and two child i catch she under one arm and one of the child under the other -- say ' i can not take you all at once i 'll come back for the rest one by one ' -- not that i believe it but anything to stop the scream and i do hope to put some of they out of the reach of the sea if i could get they forward i know the forecastle be dry for the chief officer be firing there you hear he yes five or six time and then he stop suddenly he have reason -- we get out i could see she nose up in the air forty foot above we cover with fore-cabin passenger i warped the lady and the child upward -- heaven know how for the sea be break over we very sharp -- till we be at the mainmast stump and hold on by the wreck of it i feel the ship stagger as if a whale have strike she and hear a roar and a swish behind I and look back -- just in time to see mizen and poop and all the poor woman and child in it go bodily as if they have be shave off with a knife i suppose that altered she balance for before i could turn again she dive forward and then roll over upon she beam end to leeward and i see the sea walk in over she from stem to stern like one white wall and i be wash from my hold and it be all over what become of the lady i see a white thing flash by to leeward -- what be the use of ask but the child you hold i do not let it go till there be good reason eh tom tap the point of he finger smartly against the side of he head and then go on in the same cynical drawl which he have affect throughout -- i hear that -- against a piece of timber as we go overboard and as a medical man i consider after that that i have do my duty pretty little boy it be just six year old : and such a fancy for draw the lieutenant be quite puzzle by tom 's seeming nonchalance what do you mean sir do you leave the child to perish confound you sir if you will have plain english here it be i tell you i hear the child 's skull crack like a egg-shell there let 's talk no more about it or the whole matter it be a bad business and i be not answerable for it or you either so let 's go and do what we be answerable for and identify -- sir you will be so good as to recollect say the lieutenant with ruffle plume i do i do i beg you pardon a thousand time i be sure for be so rude : but you know as well as i sir there be a good many thing in the world which will not stand too much thinking over and last night be one very true very true but how do you get ashore i get ashore oh well enough why not ` gad sir you be near enough be drown at last only that girl 's pluck save you well but it do save I : and here i be as i know i should be when i first strike out from the ship know -- that be a bold word for mortal man at sea i suppose it be : but we doctor you see get into the way of look at thing as man of science and the ground of science be experience and to judge from experience it take more to kill I than i have yet meet with if i have be go to be snuff out it would have happen long ago hum it be well to carry a cheerful heart but the pitcher go often to the well and come home break at last i must be a gutta-percha pitcher i think then or else -- ` there be a sweet little cherub who sit up aloft ' etc as dibdin have it now look at the fact yourself sir continue the stranger with a recklessness half true half assume to escape from the malady of thought i do not want to boast sir i only want to show you that i have some practical reason for wear as my motto -- ` never say die ' i have have the cholera twice and yellow-jack beside : five several time i have have bullet through I i have be bayonet and leave for dead i have be shipwreck three time -- and once as now i be the only man who escape i have be fat by savage for bake and eat and get away with a couple of friend only a day or two before the feast one really narrow chance i have which i never expect to squeeze through : but on the whole i have take full precaution to prevent its recurrence what be that then i have be hang sir say the doctor quietly hang cry the lieutenant face round upon he strange companion with a visage which ask plainly enough -- you hang i do not believe you and if you have be hang what have you be do to get hang you need not take care of you pocket sir -- neither robbery nor murder be it which bring I to the gallows but innocent bug-hunting the fact be i be catch by a party of mexican during the last war straggle after plant and insect and hang as a spy i do not blame the fellow : i have no business where i be and they could not conceive that a man would risk he life for a few butterfly but if you be hang sir -- why do i not die -- by my usual luck the fellow be clumsy and the noose would not work so that the mexican doctor who mean to dissect I bring I round again and be a freemason as i be stand by I -- get I safe off and cheat the devil the worthy lieutenant walk on in silence steal furtive glance at tom as if he have be a guest from the other world but not disbelieve he story in the least he have see as most old navy man so many strange thing happen that he be prepare to give credit to any tale when tell as tom 's be with a straightforward and unboastful simplicity there live the girl who save you say he as they pass grace harvey 's door ah i ought to call and pay my respects but grace be not at home the wreck have empty the school and grace have go after she scholar to the beach we could not keep she away weak as she be say a neighbor as soon as she hear the poor corpse be come ashore hum say tom true woman quaint -- that appetite for horror the sweet creature have do you ever see a man hang lieutenant -- no if you have you would have see two woman in the crowd to one man can you make out the philosophy of that i suppose they like it as some people do hot pepper or donkey thistle -- find a little pain pleasant i have a patient once in france who read duma ' ` crime célèbres ' all the week and the ` vies des saint ' on sunday and both as far as i could see for just the same purpose -- to see how miserable people could be and how much pinching and pull they could bear so they walk on along a sheep-path and over the spur and down to the cove it be such a morning as often follow a gale when the great firmament stare down upon the ruin which it have make bright and clear and bold and seem to say with shameless smile -- there i have do it and be as merry as ever after it all beneath a cloudless sky the breaker still gray and foul from the tempest be tumble in before a cold northern breeze half a mile out at sea the rough back of the chough and crow loom black and sulky in the foam at they foot the rock and shingle of the cove be alive with human being -- group of woman and child clustering round a corpse or a chest sailor knee-deep in the surf haul at float spar and rope oil-skinned coast-guardsmen pacing up and down in charge of goods while group of farmer ' man who have hurry down from the village inland lounge about on the top of the cliff look sulkily on hope for plunder : and yet half afraid to mingle with the sailor below who look on they as a inferior race and refuse in general to intermarry with they the lieutenant plainly hold much the same opinion for as a party of they try to descend the narrow path to the beach he shout after they to come back eh you will not and out rattle from its scabbard the old worthy 's sword come back i say you loaf miching wreck crow-keeper there be no pickings for you here brown send those fellow back with the bayonet none but blue-jackets allow on the beach and the labourer go up again grumble can not trust those landshark they 'll plunder even the ring off a corpse 's finger they think every wreck a godsend i have know they after they have be drive off roll great stone over the cliff at night on the coast-guard just out of spite while these blue-jacket here -- i can depend on they can you tell I the reason of that as you seem a bit of a philosopher it be easy enough the sailor have a fellow-feel with sailor and the landsman have none besides the sailor be finer fellow body and soul and the reason be that they have be bring up to face danger and the landsman have not well say the lieutenant unless a man have be teach to look death in the face he never will grow up i believe to be much of a man at all danger my good sir be a better schoolmaster than all you new model school diagram and scientific apparatus it make we forefather the master of the sea though they never hear of popular science and i dare say could not one out of ten of they spell they own name this sentiment elicit from the lieutenant a grunt of approbation as tom intend that it should do shrewdly argue that the old martinet be no friend to the modern superstition that all which be require to cast out the devil be a smattering of the ` ology will the gentleman see the corpse ask brown we have fourteen already -- and he lead the way to where along the shingle at high-water mark lay a ghastly row some fearfully bruise and mutilate cramp together by the death-agony other with the peaceful smile which show that they have sink to sleep in that strange water-death amid a wilderness of pleasant dream strong man lay there little child woman whom the sailor ' wife have cover decently with cloak and shawl and at they head stand grace harvey motionless with fold hand gaze into the dead face with she great solemn eye she mother and captain willi stand by watch she with a sort of superstition awe she take no notice either of thurnall or of the lieutenant as the doctor identify the body one by one without a remark which indicate any human emotion a very sensible man willi say the lieutenant apart as tom kneel awhile to examine the crushed feature of a sailor and then look up say simply -- jame macgillivray second mate cause of death contusion probably by the fall of the main-mast a very sensible man and have see a deal of life and keep he eye open but a terrible hard-plucked one talk like a book to I all the way but be hang if i do not think he have a thirty-two pound shot under he rib instead of a heart -- doctor thurnall that be miss harvey -- the young person who save you life last night tom rise take off he hat -lrb- frank headley 's -rrb- and make she a bow of which a ambassador need not have be ashamed i be exceedingly shock that miss harvey should have run so much danger for anything so worthless as my life she look up at he and answer not he but she own thought strange be it not that it be a duty to pray for all these poor thing last night and a sin to pray for they this morning grace dear interpose she mother do not you hear the gentleman thank you she start as one awake out of a dream and look into he face blush scarlet good heaven what a beautiful creature say tom to himself as quite a new emotion pass through he quite new it be whatsoever it be and he be aware of it he have have he passion he intrigue in past year and pride himself -- few man more -- on understand woman but the expression of the face and the strange word with which she have greet he add to the broad fact of she have offer she own life for he raise in he a feeling of chivalrous awe and admiration which no other woman have ever call up madam he say again i can repay you with nothing but thanks : but to judge from you conduct last night you be one of those people who will find reward enough in know that you have do a noble and heroic action she look at he very steadfastly blush still thurnall be it understand be -lrb- at least while he face be in the state in which heaven intend it to be half hide in a silky-brown beard -rrb- a very good-looking fellow and -lrb- to use mark armsworth 's description -rrb- as hard as a nail as fresh as a rose and stand on he leg like a game-cock moreover as willi say approvingly he have speak to she as if he be a duke and she be a duchess besides by some bless moral law the surest way to make oneself love any human being be to go and do he a kindness and therefore grace have already a tender interest in tom not because he have save she but she he and so it be that a strange new emotion pass through she heart also though so little understand by she that she put it forthwith into word you might repay I she say in a sad and tender tone you have only to command I say tom wince a little as the word pass he lip then turn to god now in the day of he mercy unless you have turn to he already one glance at tom 's rise eyebrow tell she what he think upon those matter she look at he sadly lingeringly as if conscious that she ought not to look too long and yet unable to withdraw she eye -- ah and such a precious soul as yours must be a precious soul -- all take and you alone leave god must have high thing in store for you he must have a great work for you to do else why be you not as one of these oh think where would you have be at this moment if god have deal with you as with they where i be now i suppose say tom quietly where you be now yes : where i ought to be i be where i ought to be now i suppose if i have find myself anywhere else this morning i should have take it as a sign that i be want there and not here grace heave a sigh at word which be certainly startling the stoic optimism of the world-hardened doctor be new and frightful to she my good madam say he the part of scripture which i appreciate best just now be the case of poor job where satan have leave to rob and torment he to the utmost of he wicked will provide only he do not touch he life i wish he go on lower he voice to tell you something which i do not wish publicly talk of but in which you may help I i have nearly fifteen hundred pound about I when i come ashore last night sew in a belt round my waist it be go that be all tom look steadily at she as he speak she turn pale red pale again she lip quiver : but she speak no word she have it as i live think tom to himself ` frailty thy name be woman ' the cant little methodistical humbug she must have slip it off my waist as i lay senseless i suppose she mean to keep it in pawn till i redeem it by marry she well i might take a uglier mate certainly but when i do enter into the bitter bond of matrimony i should like to be sure beforehand that my wife be not a thief why then do not tom if he be so very sure of grace 's have the belt charge she with the theft because he have find out already how popular she be and be afraid of merely make himself unpopular because too he take for grant that whosoever have he belt have hide it already beyond the reach of a search warrant and because after all a honorable shame restrain he it would be a poor return to the woman who have save he life to charge she with theft the next morning and more there be something about that girl 's face which have make he feel that if he have see she put the belt into she pocket before he eye he could not have find the heart to have send she to gaol no thought he i 'll get it out of she or whoever have it and stay here till i do get it one place be as good as another to I but what be grace say she have turn after two or three minute ' astonished silence to she mother and captain willi -- belt mother uncle what be this the gentleman have lose a belt dear I -- a belt well child that be not much to grieve over when the lord have spare he life and soul from the pit say she mother somewhat testily you do not understand a belt i say full of money -- fifteen hundred pound he lose it last night uncle speak quick do you see a belt willi shake he head meditatively i do not and yet i do and yet i do not again my brain be well-nigh wash out of I i know however sir i 'll think and talk it over with you too for if it be in the village find it ought to be and will be with god 's help find cry grace in so high a key that tom entreat she to calm herself and not make the matter public -- find yes and shall be find if there be justice in heaven shame that west-country folk should turn robber and wrecker mariner too and manners ' wife who should be pray for those who be wander far away each man with he life in he hand ah what a world when will it end soon too soon when west-country folk rob shipwreck man but you will find you belt yes sir you will find it wait till you have learn to do without it man do not live by bread alone do you think he live by gold only be patient and when you be worthy of it you shall find it again in the lord 's good time to the doctor this seem a mere burst of jargon invent for the purpose of hide guilt and he faith in womankind be not heighten when he hear grace 's mother say _ sotto voce _ to willi that -- in wreck and fire and such like a many people complain of have lose more than ever they have oh ho my old lady be that the way the fox be go quoth tom to that trusty counsellor himself and begin carefully scrutinise mr harvey 's face it have be very handsome : it be still very clever : but the eyebrow crush together downward above she nose and rise high at the outer corner indicate as surely as the restless down-dropt eye a character self-conscious furtive capable of great inconsistency possibly of great deceit you do not look I in the face old lady quoth tom to himself very well between you two it lie unless that old gentleman implicate himself also in he approach confession he take he part at once well well you will oblige I by say nothing more about it after all as this good lady say the loss of a little money be not worth complain over when one have escape with life good morning and many thanks for all you kindness and tom make another grand bow and go off to the lieutenant grace look after he awhile as one stunned and then turn to she mother let we go home go home why there dear let I go home you need not come i be sick of this world be it not enough to have misery and death -lrb- and she point to the row of corpse -rrb- but we must have sin too wherever we turn meanness and theft : -- and ingratitude too she add in a lower tone she go homeward she mother in spite of she entreaty accompany she and for some reason or other do not lose sight of she all that day or for several day after meanwhile willi have beckon the doctor aside he face be serious and sad and he lip be tremble this be a very shocking business sir of course you have tell the lieutenant not yet my good sir but -- excuse my boldness what plainer way of get it back from the rascal whoever he be wait awhile say tom i have my reason but sir -- for the honor of the place the matter should be clear up and till the thief 's find suspicion will lie on a dozen innocent man myself among the rest for that matter you say tom smile i do not know who i have the honor to speak to but you do not look much like a gentleman who wish for a trip to botany bay the old man chuckle and then he face drop again i be glad you take the thing so like a man sir but it be really no laughing matter it be a scoundrelly job only fit for a maltee off the nix mangeery if it have be a lot of those carter fellow that have carry you up i could have understand it wreck 's bear in the bone of they : but for those four sailor that carry you up ` gad sir they would have be shoot sooner i have know 'em from boy and the old man speak quite fiercely and look up he lip tremble and he eye moist there be no doubt that you be honest -- whoever be not think tom so he venture a further question then you be by all the while all the while who more and that be just what puzzle I pray do not speak loud say tom i have my reason for keep thing quiet i tell you sir i hold the maid and big john beer -lrb- gentleman jan they call he -rrb- hold I and the maid have both she hand tight in you belt i see it as plain as i see you just before the wave cover we though little i think what be in it and should never have remember you have a belt at all if i have not think over thing in the last five minute well sir i be lucky in have come straight to the fountain head and must thank you for tell I so frankly what you know tell you sir what else should one do but tell you i only wish i know more and more i 'll know please the lord and you 'll excuse a old sailor -lrb- though not of you rank sir -rrb- say that he wonder a little that you do not take the plain means of know more yourself may i take the liberty of ask you name say tom who see by this time that the old man be worthy of he confidence willi at you service sir captain they call I though i be none sailing-master i be on board of he majesty 's ship niobe 84 and willi raise he hat with such a air that tom raise he in return then captain willi let I have five word with you apart first thank you for have help to save my life i be very glad i do sir and thank god for it on my knee this morning : but you 'll excuse I sir i be think -- and no blame to I -- more of save my poor maid 's life than yours and no offence to you for i have not the honor of know you but for she i would have be drown a dozen time over no offence indeed say tom and hardly know what to say next may i ask be she you niece i hear she call you uncle oh no -- no relation only i look on she as my own poor thing have no father and she always call I uncle as most do we old man in the west well then sir say tom you will answer for none of the four sailor have rob I i have say it sir be any one else close to she when we be bring ashore no one but i i bring she round myself and who take she home she mother and i very good and you never see the belt after she have she hand in it no i be sure not be she mother by she when she be lie on the rock no come up afterwards just as i get she on she foot humph what sort of a character be she mother oh a tidy god-fearing person enough one of these methodist class-leader brianite they call themselves i do not hold with they though i do go to chapel at while : but there be good one among they and i do believe she be one though she be a little fretful at time keep a little shop that do not pay over well and those preacher live on she a good deal i think creep into widow ' house and make long prayer -- you know the text well now captain willi i do not want to hurt you feeling but do you not see that one of two thing i must believe -- either that the belt be tear off my waist and wash back into the sea as it may have be after all or else that -- do you mean that she take it ask willis in voice of such indignant astonishment that tom could only answer by a shrug of the shoulder who else could have do so on you own show sir say willi slowly i think i have to do with a gentleman : but i have my doubt of it now a poor girl risk she life to drag you out of that sea which but for she would have heave you body up to lie along with that line there -- and willi point to the ghastly row -- and you soul go to give in its last account -- you only know what that would have be like -- and the first thing you do in payment be to accuse she of rob you -- she that the very angel in heaven i believe be glad to keep company with and the old man turn and pace the beach in fierce excitement captain willi say tom i 'll trouble you to listen patiently and civilly to I a minute willi stop draw himself up and touch he hat mechanically just because i be a gentleman i have not accuse she but hold my tongue and speak to you in confidence now perhaps you will understand why i have say nothing to the lieutenant willi look up at he i beg you pardon sir i see now and i be sorry if i be rude but it take I aback and do still i tell you sir quoth he warm again whatever 's true -- that be false you be wrong there if you never be wrong again and you 'll say so yourself before you have know she a week no sir if you could make I believe that i should never believe in goodness again on earth but hold all man and woman too and those above for aught i know that be greater than man and woman for liar together what be to be answer perhaps only what tom do answer my good sir i will say no more i would not have say that much if i have think i should have pained you so i suppose that the belt be wash into the sea why not why not indeed sir that be a much more christian-like way of look at it than to blacken you own soul before god by suspect that sweet innocent creature be it so then only say nothing about the matter and beg they to say nothing if it be jam among the rock -lrb- as it might be heavy as it be -rrb- talk about it will only set people look for it and i suppose there be a man or two even in aberalva who would find fifteen hundred pound a tempting bait if again some one find it and make away with it he will only be the more careful to hide it if he know that i be on the look-out so just tell miss harvey and she mother that i think it must have be lose and beg they to keep my secret and now shake hand with I the best plan i believe though bad be the best say willi hold out he hand and he walk away sadly he spirit have be altogether ruffle by the imputation on grace 's character : and besides the chance of thurnall 's recover he money seem to he very small in five minute he return if you would allow I sir there be a man there of whom i should like to ask one question he who hold I and after that help to carry you up and he point to gentleman jan who stand drip from the waist downward over a chest which he have just secure just let we ask he off-hand like whether you have a belt on when he carry you up you may trust he sir he would knock you down as soon as look at you but tell a lie never they go to the giant and after cordial salutation tom propound he question carelessly with something like a white lie it be no great matter but it be a old friend you see with fitting for my knife and pistol and i should be glad to find it again jan thrust he red hand through he black curl and meditate while the water surge round he ankle never a belt seed i sir leastwise while you be in my hand i have you round the waist all the way up so no one could have take it off why should they and i undressed you myself and nothing save you presence be there to get off but jersey and trousers and a lump of backy against you skin that look the right sort have some then say tom pull out the honey-dew as for the belt i suppose it be go to choke the dog-fish and there the matter end outwardly at least but only outwardly tom have he own opinion gather from grace 's seemingly guilty face and to it he hold and call old willi in he heart a simple-minded old dotard who have be take in by she hypocrisy and tom accompany the lieutenant on he dreary errand that day and several day after through deposition before a justice interview with lloyd 's underwriter and all the sad detail which follow a wreck ere the week 's end forty body and more have be recover and bring up ten or twelve at a time to the churchyard and upon the down and lay side by side in one long shallow pit where frank headley read over they the bless word of hope amid the sob of woman and the grand silence of stalwart man who know not how soon they turn might come and after each procession come grace harvey with all she little scholar two and two to listen to the funeral service and when the last corpse be bury they plant flower upon the mound and go they way again to learn hymn and read they bible -- little ministering angel to whom as to most sailor ' child death be too common a sight to have in it aught of hideous or strange and this be the end of the good ship hesperus and all she gallant crew verily however important the mere animal life of man may be and ought to be at time in we eye they never have be so to judge from flood and earthquake pestilence and storm in the eye of he who make and love we all it be a strange fact better for we instead of shut we eye to it because it interfere with we modern tenderness of pain to ask honestly what it mean chapter v the way to win they so for a week or more tom go on thrivingly enough and become a general favorite in the town heale have no reason to complain of board he for he have dinner and supper thrust on he every day by one and another who be glad enough to have he for the sake of he story and song and endless fun and good-humour the lieutenant above all take the new-comer under he especial patronage and be pay for he service in some of tom 's incomparable honey-dew the old fellow soon find that the doctor know more than one old foreign station of he and end by pour out to he he ancient wrong and the evil doings of the wicked admiral all of which tom hear with deepest sympathy and surprise that so much naval talent have remain unappreciated by the unjust upper power and the lieutenant of course report of he accordingly to heale a very civil speak and intelligent youngster mr heale d'ye see to my mind and you can not do better than accept he offer for you 'll find he a great help especially among the lady d'ye see they like a good-looking chap eh mr jone on the fourth day by good fortune what should come ashore but tom 's own chest -- moneyless alas but with many useful matter still unspoilt by salt water so all go well and indeed somewhat too well -lrb- if tom would have let it -rrb- in the case of miss anna marium heale the doctor 's daughter she be just such a girl as she father 's daughter be likely to be a short stout rosy pretty body of twenty with loose red lip thwart black eyebrow and right naughty eye under they of which tom take good heed : for miss heale be exceedingly incline he see to make use of they in he behoof let other who have experience in and taste for such matter declare how she set she cap at the dapper young surgeon how she rush into the shop with sweet _ abandon _ ten time a-day to find she father and not find he giggle and blush and shake she shoulder and retire to peep at tom through the glass door which lead into the parlor how she discover that the muslin curtain of the say door would get out of order every ten minute and at last call mr thurnall to assist she in rearrange it how bolder grown she come into the shop to help herself to various matter inquire tenderly for tom 's health and giggle vulgar sentiment about absent friend and heart leave behind in the hope of fishing out whether tom have a sweetheart or not how at last she be mind to confide she own health to tom and to instal he as she private physician yea and would have make he feel she pulse on the spot have he not luckily find some assafoetida and therewith so perfumed the shop that she nerve -lrb- of which she be always talk though she have nerve only in the sense wherein a sirloin of beef have they -rrb- force she to beat a retreat but she return again to the charge next day and rush bravely through that fearful smell cleaver in hand as the carrier set down at the door a huge box carriage-paid all the way from london and direct to thoma thurnall esquire she would help to open it : and so she do while old heale and he wife stand by curious -- he with a maudlin wonder and awe -lrb- for he regard tom already as a altogether awful and incomprehensible party -rrb- and mr heale with a look of incredulous scorn as if she expect the box to be a mere sham fill probably with shaving for -lrb- from reason best know to herself -rrb- she have never look pleasantly on the arrangement which entrust to tom the care of the bottle she have give way from motive of worldly prudence even of necessity for heale have be for the greater part of the week quite incapable of attend to he business : but black envy and spite be seethe in she foolish heart and seethe more and more fiercely when she see that the box do not contain shaving but valuable of every sort and kind -- drug instrument a large microscope -lrb- which tom deliver out of miss heale 's fat clumsy finger only by strong warning that it would go off and shoot she -rrb- book full of print of unspeakable monster and finally a little packet contain not one five-pound note but four and a letter which tom after peruse put into mr heale 's hand with a look of honest pride the mumpsimus man it appear have send round the hat for he and here be the result and they would send the hat round again every month if he want it or if he would come up board lodge and wash he grati the great doctor bellair house physician and carver the famous operator -lrb- name at which heale bow he head and worship -rrb- send compliment condolence offer of employment -- never be so triumphant a testimonial and heale in he simplicity think himself -lrb- as indeed he be -rrb- the luckiest of country doctor while mr heale after swell and choke for five minute totter into the back room and cast herself on the sofa in violent hysteric as she come round again tom could not but overhear a little that pass and this he overhear among other matter : -- yes mr heale i see i see too well which you natural blindness sir and that fatal easiness of temper will bring you to a premature grave within the pauper ' precinct and this young design infidel with he science and he magnifier and he calliper and philosophy falsely so call which in we true protestant youth there be none nor needed none to supplant you in you old age and take the bread out of you gray hair which he will bring with sorrow to the grave and mine likewise which be like my poor infant here of only too sensitive sensibility oh anna maria my child my poor lose child which i can feel for the tenderness of the inexperienced heart my virgin eve which the serpent have enter into you youthful paradise and you will find alas too late that you have warm a adder into you bosom oh ma how indelicate giggle anna marium evidently not displeased if you do not mind he will hear you and i should never be able to look he in the face again and therewith she look round to the glass door what more pass tom do not choose to hear for he begin make all the bustle he could in the shop merely say to himself -- that flood of eloquence be symptomatic enough : i 'll lay my life the old dame know she way to the laudanum bottle tom 's next business be to ingratiate himself with the young curate he have find out already cunning fellow that any extreme intimacy with headley would not increase he general popularity and as we have see already he bear no great affection to the cloth in general : but the curate be a educate gentleman and tom wish for some more rational conversation than that of the lieutenant and heale besides he be one of those man with whom the possession of power seek at first from self-interest have become a passion a species of sport which he follow for its own sake to whomsoever he meet he must need apply the moral stethoscope sound he lung heart and liver put he tissue under the microscope and try conclusion on he to the uttermost they might be useful hereafter for knowledge be power : or they might not what matter every fresh specimen of humanity which he examine be so much gain in general knowledge very true thoma thurnall provide the method of examination be the sound and the deep one which will lead you down in each case to the real living heart of humanity : but what if you method be altogether a shallow and a cynical one savor much more of gil bla than of st paul ground not on faith and love for human being but on something very like suspicion and contempt you will be but too likely doctor to make the coarsest mistake when you fancy yourself most penetrate to mistake the mere scurf and disease of the character for its healthy organic tissue and to find out at last somewhat to you confusion that there be more thing not only in heaven but in the earthiest of the earth than be dream of in you philosophy you have already set down grace harvey as a hypocrite and willi as a dotard will you make up you mind in the same foolishness of over-wisdom that frank headley be a merely narrow-headed and hard-hearted pedant quite unaware that he be live a inner life of doubt struggle prayer self-reproaches noble hunger after a ideal of moral excellence such as you friend tom never yet dream of which would be to you as a unintelligible gibber of shadow out of dreamland but which be to he the only reality the life of life for which everything be to be risk and suffer you treat he opinion -lrb- though he never thrust they on you -rrb- about the church and he duty and the soul of he parishioner with civil indifference as much ado about nothing and he rubrical eccentricity as puerility you have already make up you mind to try and put a little common sense into he not because it be any concern of yours whether he have common sense or not but because you think that it will be better for you to have the parish at peace but have it ever occur to you how noble the man be even in he mistake how that one thought that the finest thing in the world be to be utterly good and to make other good also put he three heaven at least above you you most unangelic terrier-dog bemire all day long by grub after vermin what if he idea of the church be somewhat too narrow for the year of grace 1854 be it no honor to he that he have such a idea at all that there have rise up before he the vision of a perfect polity a divine and wonderful order link earth to heaven and to the very throne of he who die for man witness to each of its citizen what the world try to make he forget namely that he be the child of god himself and guide and strengthen he from the cradle to the grave to do he father 's work be it a shame to he that he have see that such a polity must exist that he believe that it do exist or that he think he find it in its highest if not its perfect form in the most ancient and August tradition of he native land true he have much to learn and you may teach he something of it but you will find some day thoma thurnall that grant you to be at one pole of the english character and frank headley at the other he be as good a englishman as you and can teach you more than you can he the two soon begin to pass almost every evening together pleasantly enough for the reckless and rattle manner which tom assume with the mob he lay aside with the curate and show himself as agreeable a companion as man could need while tom in he turn find that headley be a rational and sweet-tempered man who even where he have make up he mind to differ could hear a adverse opinion put sometimes in a startling shape without fall into any of those male hysteric of sacred horror which be the usual refuge of ignorance and stupidity terrify by what it can not refute and soon tom begin to lay aside the reserve which he usually assume to clergyman and to tread on ground which headley would gladly have avoid for to tell the truth ever since tom have hear of grace 's intended dismissal the curate 's opinion have assume a practical importance in he eye and he have vow in secret that if he cunning fail he not turn out of she school she should not be whether she have steal he money or not she have save he life and nobody should wrong she if he could help it besides perhaps she have not he money the belt might have slip off in the struggle some one else might have take it off in carry he up he might have mistake the shame of innocence in she face for that of guilt be it as it might he have not the heart to make the matter public and contented himself with stay at aberalva and watch for every hint of he lose treasure by which it befall that he be think the half of every day at least about grace harvey and she face be seldom out of he mind 's eye and the more he look at it either in fancy or in fact the more do it fascinate he they meet but rarely and then interchange the most simple and modest of salutation : but tom like to meet she would have gladly stop to chat with she however whether from modesty or from a guilty conscience she always hurry on in silence and she tom 's request to she through willi to say nothing about the matter she have obey as she mother also have do that tom suspect she be a thought which never cross she mind to suspect any one herself be in she eye a sin and if the fancy that this man or that among the sailor who have carry tom up to heale 's might have be capable of the baseness she thrust the think from she and pray to be forgive for she uncharitable judgment but night and day there weigh on that strange and delicate spirit the shame of the deed as heavily if possible as if she herself have be the doer there be another soul in danger of perdition another black spot of sin make earth hideous to she the village be disgrace not in the public eye true : but in the eye of heaven and in the eye of that stranger for whom she be begin to feel a interest more intense than she ever have do in any human be before she saintliness -lrb- for grace be a saint in the truest sense of that word -rrb- have long since make she free of that communion of saint which consist not in pharisaic isolation from the world not in the mutual flattery and congratulation of a self-conceited clique but which bear the sin and carry the sorrow of all around : whose atmosphere be disappointed hope and plan for good and the indignation which hate the sin because it love the sinner and sacred fear and pity for the self-inflicted misery of those who might be -lrb- so run the dream and will run till it become a wake reality -rrb- strong and free and safe by be good and wise to such a spirit this bold cunning man have come stiff-necked and heaven-defiant a brand pluck from the burning : and yet equally unconscious of he danger and thankless for he respite give too as it be into she hand toss at she foot out of the very mouth of the pit -- why but that she might save he a far duller heart a far narrower imagination than grace 's would have do what grace 's do -- concentrate themselves round the image of that man with all the love of woman for ere long grace find that she do love that man as a woman love but once in she life perhaps in all time to come she find that she heart throb she cheek flush when he name be mention that she watch almost unawares to herself for he passing and she be not ashamed at the discovery it be a sort of melancholy comfort to she that there be a great gulf fix between they he station he acquirement he great connection and friend in london -lrb- for all tom 's matter be the gossip of the town as indeed he take care that they should be -rrb- make it impossible that he should ever think of she and therefore she hold herself excuse for thinking of he without any fear of that self-seeking and inordinate affection and unsanctified passion which she religious book have teach she to dread besides he be not a christian that five minute on the shore have tell she that and even if she station have be the same as he she must not be unequally yoke with a unbeliever and thus the very hopelessness of she love become its food and strength the feeling which she would have check with maidenly modesty have it be connect even remotely with marriage be allow to take immediate and entire dominion and she hold herself permit to keep he next she heart of heart because she could do nothing for he but pray for he conversion and pray for he she do the noble guileless girl day and night that he might be convert that he might prosper and become -- perhaps rich at least useful a mighty instrument in some good work and then she would build up one beautiful castle in the air after another out of she fancy about what such a man whom she have invest in she own mind with all the wisdom of solomon might do if he talent be sanctify then she pray that he might recover he lost gold -- when it be good for he that he might discover the thief : no that would only involve fresh shame and sorrow : that the thief then might be bring to repentance and confession and restitution that be the solution of the dark problem and for that she pray while she face grow sadder and sadder day by day for a while over and above the pain which the theft cause she there come -- how could it be otherwise -- sudden pang of regret that this same love be hopeless at least upon this side of the grave inconsistent they be with the chivalrous unselfishness of she usual temper and as such she dash they from she and conquer they after a while by a method which many a woman know too well it be but one cross more a natural part of she destiny -- the child of sorrow and heaviness of heart pleasure in joy she be never to find on earth she would find it then in grief and nurse she own melancholy she go on she way sad sweet and steadfast and lavish more care and tenderness and even gaiety than ever upon she neighbor ' child because she know that she should never have a child of she own but there be a third damsel to whom whether more or less engaging than grace harvey or miss heale my reader must need be introduce let miss heale herself do it with eye full of jealous curiosity there be a foreign letter for mr thurnall marked montreal and send on here from whitbury say she one morning at breakfast and in a significant tone for the address be evidently in a woman 's hand for I -- ah yes i see say tom take it carelessly and thrust it into he pocket will not you read it at once mr thurnall i be sure you must be anxious to hear from friend abroad with a emphasis on the word friend i have a good many acquaintance all over the world but no friend that i be aware of say tom and go on with he breakfast ah -- but some people be more than friend be the montreal lady pretty mr thurnall do not know for i never be there miss heale be silent be mystify : and moreover not quite sure whether montreal be in indium or in australium and not willing to show she ignorance she watch tom through the glass door all the morning to see if he read the letter and betray any emotion at its contents : but tom go about he business as usual and as far as she see never read it at all however it be read in due time for find himself in a lonely place that afternoon tom pull it out with a anxious face and read a letter write in a hasty ill-formed hand underscore at every fifth word and plentifully bedeck with note of exclamation what my dearest friend and fortune still frown upon you you father blind and ruin ah that i be there to comfort he for you sake and ah that i be anywhere do any drudgery which might prevent my be still a burden to my benefactor not that they be unkind not that they be not angel i tell they at once that you could send I no more money till you reach england perhaps not then and they answer that god would send it that he who have send I to they would send the means of support I and ever since they have redouble they kindness : but it be intolerable this dependence and on you too who have a father to support in he darkness oh how i feel for you but to tell you the truth i pay a price for this dependence i must need be staid and sober i must need dress like any quakeress i must not read this book nor that and my shelley -- take from I i suppose because it speak too much ` liberty ' though of course the reason give be its infidel opinion -- be replace by ` law 's serious call ' ` tis all right and good i doubt not : but it be very dreary as dreary as these black fir-forest and brown snake fence and that dreadful dreadful canadian winter which be past which go to my very heart day after day like a sword of ice another such winter and i shall die as one of my own humming-bird would die do you cage he here and prevent he from flee home to the sunny south when the first leave begin to fall dear child of the sun my heart go forth to they and the whir of they wing be music to I for it tell I of the south the glaring south with its glorious flower and glorious wood its luxuriance life fierce enjoyment -- let fierce sorrow come with they if it must be so let I take the evil with the good and live my rich wild life through bliss and agony like a true daughter of the sun instead of crystallise slowly here into ice amid countenance rigid with respectability sharpen by the lust of gain without taste without emotion without even sorrow let who will be the stagnant mill-head crawling in its ugly spade-cut ditch to turn the mill let I be the wild mountain brook which foam and flash over the rock -- what if they tear it -- it leap they nevertheless and go laugh on its way let I go thus for weal or woe and if i sleep awhile let it be like the brook beneath the shade of fragrant magnolia and luxuriant vine and image meanwhile in my bosom nothing but the beauty around yes my friend i can live no longer this dull chrysalid life in comparison with which at time even that past dark dream seem tolerable -- for amid its lurid smoke be flash of brightness a slave well i ask myself at time and what be woman mean for but to be slave free they and they enslave themselves again or languish unsatisfied for they must love and what blame to they if they love a white man tyrant though he be rather than a fellow-slave if the man of we own race will claim we let they prove themselves worthy of we let they rise exterminate they tyrant or fail that show that they know how to die till then those who be the master of they body will be the master of we heart if they crouch before the white like brute what wonder if we look up to he as to a god woman must worship or be wretch do i not know it have i not have my dream -- too beautiful for earth be there not one whom you know to hear whom call I slave would have be rapture to whom i would have answer on my knee master i have no will but yours but that be past -- past one happiness alone be possible for a slave and even that they tear from I and now i have no thought no purpose save revenge these good people bid I forgive my enemy easy enough for they who have no enemy to forgive forgive forgive injustice oppression baseness cruelty forgive the devil and bid he go in peace and work he wicked will why have they put into my hand these last three year book worthy of a free nation -- book which call patriotism divine which tell I how in every age and clime man have be call hero who rise against they conqueror woman martyr who stab they tyrant and then die hypocrite do they grandfather meekly turn the other cheek when you english tax they somewhat too heavily do they not now teach every school-child to glory in they own revolution they own declaration of independence and to flatter themselves into the conceit that they be the lord of creation and the example of the world because they assert that sacred right of resistance which be discover to be unchristian in the african they will free we forsooth in good time -lrb- be it to be in god 's good time or in they own -rrb- if we will but be patient and endure the rice-swamp the scourge the slave-market and shame unspeakable a few year more till all be ready and safe -- for they dreamer as well as hypocrite what nation be ever free by other ' help i have be read history to see -- you do not know how much i have be read -- and i find that freeman have always free themselves as we must do and as they will never let we do because they know that with freedom must come retribution that we southern tyrant have a account to render which the cold northerner have no heart to see he pay for after all he love the southerner better than the slave and fear he more also what if the southern aristocrat who lord it over he as the panther do over the ox should transfer -lrb- as he have threaten many a time -rrb- the cowhide from the negro 's loin to he no we must free ourselves and there live one woman at least who have gain she freedom know how to use it in eternal war against all tyrant oh i could go down i think at moment down to new orlean itself with a brain and lip of fire and speak word -- you know how i could speak they -- which would bring I in a week to the scourge perhaps to the stake the scourge i could endure have i not feel it already do i not bear its scar even now and glory in they for they be win by speak as a woman should speak and even the fire -- have not woman be martyr already and could not i be one might not my torment madden a people into manhood and my name become a war-cry in the sacred fight and yet oh my friend life be sweet -- and my little day have be so dark and gloomy -- may i not have one hour 's sunshine ere youth and vigor be go and my swift-vanishing southern womanhood wrinkle itself up into despise old age oh counsel I -- help I my friend my preserver my true master now so brave so wise so all-knowing under whose mask of cynicism lie hide -lrb- have i not cause to know it -rrb- the heart of a hero marie if miss heale could have watch tom 's face as he read much more could she have hear he word as he finish all jealousy would have pass from she mind : for as he read the cynical smile grow sharper and sharper form a fit prelude for the little fool which be he only comment i think you would have fall in love with some honest farmer year ago : but a martyr you sha not be even if i have to send for you hither though how to get you bread to eat i do not know however you have be read you book it seem -- clever enough you always be and too clever so you could go out as governess or something why here be a postscript dated three month afterwards ah i see this letter be write last July in answer to my australian one what be the meaning of this and he begin read again i write so far but i have not the heart to send it : it be so full of repining and since then -- must i tell the truth -- i have make a step do not call it a desperate one do not blame I for you blame i can not bear : but i have go on the stage there be no other means of independence open to I and i have a dream i have it still that there if anywhere i might do my work you tell I that i might become a great actress : i have set my heart on become one on learn to move the heart of man till the time come when i can tell they show they in live flesh and blood upon the stage the secret of a slave 's sorrow and that slave a woman the time have not come for that yet here : but i have have my success already more than i could have expect and not only in canada but in the state i have be at new york act to crowded house ah when they applaud I how i long to speak to pour out my whole soul to they and call upon they as man to -- but that will come in time i have find a friend who have promise to write drama especially for I merely republican one at first in which i can give full vent to my passion and hurl forth the eternal law of liberty which they conscience may -- must -- at last apply for themselves but soon he say we shall be able to dare to approach the real subject if not in america still in europe and then i trust the color actress will stand forth as the championess of she race of all who be oppress in every capital in europe save alas italy and the austrium who crush she i have take i should tell you a italian name it be better i think to hide my african taint forsooth for awhile so the wise new yorker have be fete as marium cordifiamma the white woman -lrb- for be i not fairer than many a italian signora -rrb- whom they would have look upon as a inferior be under the name of marie lavington : though there be finer old english blood run in my vein from you native berkshire they say than in any a down-easter 's who hang upon my lip address I henceforth then as la signora marium cordifiamma i be learn fast by the by to speak italian i shall be at quebec till the end of the month then i believe i come to london and we shall meet once more : and i shall thank you thank you thank you once more for all you marvellous kindness humph say tom after a while well she be old enough to choose for herself five-and-twenty she must be by now as for the stage i suppose it be the best place for she better at least than turn governess and go mad as she would do over she drudgery and she dream but who be this friend singing-master scribbler or political refugee or perhaps all three together a dark lot those fellow i must keep my eye on he though it be no concern of mine i have do my duty by the poor thing the devil himself can not deny that but somehow if this play-writing worthy play she false i feel very much as if i should be fool enough to try whether i have forget my pistol-shooting chapter vi a old foe with a new face this child 's head be dreadfully hot and how yellow he do look say mr vavasor fuss about in she little nursery oh clara what shall i do i really dare not give they any more medicine myself and that horrid old doctor heale be worse than no one ah ma'am say clara who be privileged to bemoan herself and to have sad confidence make to she if we be but in town now to see mr chilver or any one that could be trust but in this dreadful out-of-the-way place -- do not talk of it clara oh what will become of the poor child and mr vavasor sit down and cry as she do three time at least every week but indeed ma'am if you think you could trust he there be that new assistant -- the man who be save from the wreck why nobody know who he be oh but indeed ma'am he be a very nice gentleman i can say that and so wonderfully clever and have cure so many people already they say and get down a lot of new medicine -lrb- for he have great friend among the doctor in town -rrb- and such a wonderful magnifying glass with which he show I himself as i drop into the shop promiscuous such horrible thing ma'am in a drop of water that i have not dare hardly to wash my face since and what good will the magnifying glass do to we say the poor little irish soul laugh up through its tear he will not want it to see how ill poor frederick be i be sure but you may send for he clara i 'll go myself ma'am and make sure say clara glad enough of a run and chance of a chat with the young doctor and in half a hour mr thurnall be announce though mr vavasor have a flannel apron on -lrb- for she will wash the child herself in spite of elsley 's grumbling -rrb- tom see that she be a lady and put on accordingly he very best manner which as he experience have long since teach he be no manner at all he do he work quietly and kindly and bow himself out you will be sure to send the medicine immediately mr thurnall i will bring it myself madam and if you like administer it i think the young gentleman have make friend with I sufficiently already tom keep he word and be back and away again to he shop in a marvellously short space have strike a fresh root as he call it for -- what a very well-behaved sensible man that mr thurnall be say lucium to elsley a hour after as she meet he come in from the garden where he have be polish he wreck i be sure he understand he business he be so kind and quiet and yet so ready and seem to know all the child 's symptom beforehand in such a strange way i do hope he 'll stay here i feel happier about the poor child than i have for a long time thurnall ask elsley who be too absorb in the wreck to ask after the child but the name catch he ear mr heale 's new assistant -- the man who be wreck answer she too absorb in she turn in the child to notice she husband 's startled face thurnall which thurnall do you know the name it be not a common one say she move to the door no -- not a common one at all you say the child be not well i be glad that you think of ask after the poor thing why really my dear -- but before he can finish he excuse -lrb- probably not worth hearing -rrb- she have trot up-stair again to the nest and be as busy as ever possibly clara might do the greater part of what she do and do it better : but still be they not she child let those who will call a mother 's care mere animal instinct and liken it to that of the sparrow or the spider : shall we not rather call it a divine inspiration and doubt whether the sparrow and the spider must not have soul to be save if they too show forth that faculty of maternal love which be of all human feeling most inexplicable and most self-sacrificing and therefore surely most heavenly if that do not come down straight from heaven a good and perfect gift then what be heaven and what the gift which it send down but poor elsley may have have solid reason for think more of the name of thurnall than of he child 's health : we will hope so for he sake for after sundry melodramatic pacing and start -lrb- elsley be of a melodramatic turn and fond of a scene even when he have no spectator not even a looking-glass -rrb- besides ejaculation of it can not be if it be i trust not a fresh ghost to torment I when will come the end of this accursed coil which i have wind round my life and so forth he decide aloud that the suspense be intolerable and enclose himself in he poetical cloak and mazzinus wide-awake stride down to the town and into the shop and as he enter it he heart sink to he midriff and he knee below be loose for there make up pill in a pair of brown holland sleeve of he own manufacture -lrb- for tom be a good seamster as all traveller should be -rrb- whistle lilliburlero as of old the tom of other day which elsley 's muse would fain have bury in a thousand lethe elsley come forward to the counter carelessly nevertheless after a moment what with my beard and the lapse of time think he he can not know I so he speak -- i understand you have be visit my child sir i hope you do not find they seriously indispose mr vavasor say tom with a low bow i be mr vavasor but elsley be a bad actor and hesitate and color so much as he speak that if tom have know nothing he might have guess something nothing serious i assure you sir : unless you be come to announce any fresh symptom oh no -- not at all -- that be -- i be pass on my way to the quay and think it as well to have you own assurance mr vavasor be so over-anxious you seem to partake of she infirmity sir say tom with a smile and a bow however it be one which do you both honor a awkward pause i hope i be not take a liberty sir but i think i be bind to -- what in heaven be he go to say thought elsley to himself feel very much inclined to run away thank you for all the pleasure and instruction which you writings have give I in lonely hour and lonely place too you first volume of poem have be read by one man at least beside wild watchfire in the rocky mountain tom do not say that he pitch the say volume into the river in disgust and that it be probably long since use up as house material by the caddis-bait of those part -- for doubtless there be caddise there as elsewhere poor elsley rise at the bait and smile and bow in silence i have be so long absent from england and in utterly wild country too that i need hardly be ashamed to ask if you have write anything since ` the soul 's agony ' no doubt if you have i might have find it at melbourne on my way home : but my visit there be a very hurry one however the loss be mine and the fault too as i ought to call it pray make no excuse say elsley delighted i have write of course who can help write sir while nature be so glorious and man so wretched one can not but take refuge from the pettiness of the real in the contemplation of the ideal yes i have write i will send you my last book down i do not know whether you will find I improve how can i doubt that i shall saddened perhaps perhaps more severe in my taste but we will not talk of that i owe you a debt sir for have furnish I with one of the most striking ` motif ' i ever have i mean that miraculous escape of yours it be seldom enough in this dull every-day world one stumble on such a incident ready make to one 's hand and need only to be describe as one see it and the weak vain man chat on and end by tell tom all about he poem of the wreck in a tone which seem to imply that he have do tom a serious favor perhaps raise he to immortality by put he in a book tom thank he gravely for the say honor bow he at last out of the shop and then vault back clean over the counter as soon as elsley be out of sight and commence a indian war-dance of frantic character accompany himself by a extemporary chaunt with which the name of john brigg be frequently intermingle -- if i do not know you johnny my boy in spite of all you beard why then i be a slower fellow than ever have yet appear oh if it be but he what a card for I what a world it be for poor honest rascal like I to try a fall with -- why do not i take bad verse to make and call it poetry and so make up to a earl 's daughter which be of high degree but perhaps i be wrong after all : no -- i see he know I the humbug though he never be a humbug never rise above the rank of fool however i 'll make assurance doubly sure and then -- if it pay I not to tell he i know he i will not tell he and if it pay I to tell he i will tell he just as you choose my good mr poet and tom return to he work sing a extempore parody of we meet 'twa in a crowd end with -- and thou art the cause of this anguish my pill-box in a howl so doleful that mr heale march into the shop evidently make up she mind for a explosion i be very sorry sir to have to speak to you upon such a subject but i must say that the profane song sir which we house be not at all accustom to they not to mention that at you time of life and in you position sir as my husband 's assistant though there be no say -lrb- with a meaning toss of the head -rrb- how long it may last -- and there she grammar have get into a hopeless knot she stop tom look at she cheerfully and fixedly i have be expect this say he to himself better show the old cat at once that i carry claw as well as she there _ be _ say madam humbly beg you pardon how long my present engagement will last it will last just as long as i like mr heale boil over with rage : but ere the geyser could explode tom have continue in that dogged nasal yankee twang which he assume when he be venomous : as for the song ma'am there be two way of make oneself happy in this life you can judge for yourself which be best one be to do one 's work like a man and hum a tune to keep one 's spirit up the other be to let the work go to rack and ruin and keep one 's spirit up if one be a gentleman by a little too much brandy -- if one be a lady by a little too much laudanum laudanum sir almost scream mr heale turn pale as death the pint bottle of best laudanum which i have from town a fortnight ago ma'am be now nearly empty ma'am i will make affidavit that i have not use a hundred drop or drunk one i suppose it be the cat cat have queer taste in the west i believe i have hear the cat come down stair into the surgery once or twice after i be in bed so i set my door ajar a little and see she come up again : but whether she have a vial in she paw -- oh sir say mr heale burst into tear and after the dreadful toothache which i have have this fortnight which nothing but a little laudanum would ease it and at my time of life to mock a poor elderly lady 's infirmity which i do not look for this cruelty and outrage dry you tear my dear madam say tom in he most winning tone you will always find I the thorough gentleman i be sure if i have not be one it would have be easy enough for I with my powerful london connection -- though i will not boast -- to set up in opposition to you good husband instead of save he labor in he good old age only my dear madam how shall i get the laudanum-bottle refill without the doctor 's -- you understand the wretched old woman hurry upstairs and bring he down a half-sovereign out of she private hoard tremble like a aspen leaf and depart so -- scotch but not kill you 'll gossip and lie too never trust a laudanum-drinker you 'll see I by the eye of imagination commit all the seven deadly sin and by the tongue of inspiration go forth and proclaim the same at the town-head i can not kill you and i can not cure you so i must endure you what say old goethe in all the german i ever care to recollect : -- ` der wallfisch hat doch seine laus muss auch die meine haben ' now then for mr penberthy 's draught i wonder how that pretty schoolmistress go on if she be but honest now and have fifty thousand pound -- why then she would not marry I and so why now i would not marry she -- as my native berkshire grammar would render it chapter vii la cordifiamma this chapter shall begin good reader with one of those startling burst of illustration with which we most popular preacher be wont now to astonish and edify they hearer and after start with they at the opening of the sermon from the north-pole the crystal palace or the nearest cabbage-garden float they safe upon the gush stream of oratory to the safe and well-known shore of doctrinal commonplace lose in admiration at the skill of the good man who can thus make all road lead if not to heaven at least to strong language about its opposite true the logical sequence of they period may be like that of the come one somewhat questionable remind one at moment of fluellen 's comparison between macedon and monmouth henry the fifth and alexander : but in the logic of the pulpit all 's well that end well and the end must need sanctify the means there be of course some connection or other between all thing in heaven and earth or how would the universe hold together and if one have not time to find out the true connection what be leave but to invent the best one can for oneself thus argue probably the popular preacher and fill he pew prove thereby clearly the excellence of he method so argue also probably the popular poet to whose luxuriant fancy everything suggest anything and thought play leap-frog with think down one page and up the next till one fancy at moment that they have get permission from the higher power before look at the universe to stir it all up a few time with a spoon it be notorious of course that poet and preacher alike pride themselves upon this method of astonishing that the former call it see the infinite in the finite the latter -- press secular matter into the service of the sanctuary and other pretty phrase which for reverence ' sake shall be omit no doubt they have they reason and they reward the style take the style pay and what more would you have let they go on rejoice in spite of the cynical pedant in the Saturday review who dare to accuse -lrb- will it be believe -rrb- these luminary of the age of talk merely irreverent nonsense meanwhile so evident be the success -lrb- sole test of merit -rrb- which have attend the new method that it be worth while try whether it will not be as take in the novel as it be in the chapel and therefore the reader be request to pay special attention to the follow paragraph model carefully after the exordium of a famous irish preacher now draw crowded house at the west end of town as thus -- it be the pleasant month of may when as in old chaucer 's time the -- smale foule maken melodie that slepen alle night with open eye so priketh hem nature in they corage then longen folk to goe on pilgrimage and specially from every shire 's end of englelond to exeter-hall they wend till the low place of the strand blossom with white cravat those lily of the valley type of meekness and humility at least in the pious palmer -- and why not of similar virtue in the undertaker the concert-singer the groom the tavern-waiter the croupier at the gaming-table and frederick augustus lord scoutbush who white-cravate like the rest be just get into he cab at the door of the never-mind-what theater to spend a hour at kensington before saunter in to lady m -- 's ball why not i ask at least in the case of little scoutbush for guardsman though he be come from a theater and go to a ball there be meekness and humility in he at this moment as well as in the average of the white-cravated gentleman who trot along that same pavement about eleven o'clock this forenoon why should not he white cravat like theirs be hold symbolic of that fact however scoutbush belong rather to the former than the latter of chaucer 's category for a smale foule he be a little bird-like fellow who maketh melodie also and warble like a cock-robin we can not liken he to any more dignified songster moreover he will sleep all night with open eye for he will not be in bed till five to-morrow morning and prick he be and that sorely in he courage for he be as much in love as he little nature can be with the new actress la signora cordifiamma of the never-mind-what theater how exquisitely now -lrb- for this be one of the rare occasion in which a man be permit to praise himself -rrb- be establish hereby a unexpected bond of link sweetness long draw out between thing which have ere they come beneath the magic touch of genius no more to do with each other than this book have with the stock exchange who would have dream of travel from the tabard in southwark to the last new singer _ viâ _ exeter-hall and the lily of the valley and touch en passant on to cardinal virtue and a irish viscount but see give only a little impudence and less logic and hey presto the thing be do and all that remain to be do be to dilate -lrb- as the rev dionysius o'blareaway would do at this stage of the process -rrb- upon the moral question which have be so cunningly raise and to inquire firstly -- how the virtue of meekness and humility could be predicate of frederick augustus st just viscount scoutbush and baron torytown in the peerage of ireland and secondly -- how those virtue be call into special action by he questionably wise attachment to a new actress to whom he have never speak a word in he life first then little freddy scoutbush as he compeer irreverently term he be by common consent of she majesty 's guard a good fellow whether the st jame ' street definition of that adjective be the perfect one or not we will not stay to inquire but in the guard ' club-house it mean this : that scoutbush have not a enemy in the world because he deserve none that he lend and borrow not give and ask not again envy not hustle not slander not never bear malice never say a cruel word never play a dirty trick would hear a fellow 's trouble out to the end and if he could not counsel at least would not laugh at they and at all time and in all place live and let live and be accordingly a general favorite he morality be neither better nor worse than the average of he companion but if he be sensual he be at least not base and there be frail woman who bless little freddy and he shy and secret generosity from have save they from the lowest pit _ au reste _ he be idle frivolous useless but with these two palliating fact that he know it and regret it and that he never have a chance of be aught else he father and mother have die when he be a child he have be send to eton at seven where he learn nothing and into the guard at seventeen where he learn less than nothing he aunt old lady knockdown who be a kind old irish woman a ex-blue and ex-beauty now a high evangelical professor but as worldly as she neighbor in practice have try to make he a good boy in old time : but she have give he up long before he leave eton as a vessel of wrath -lrb- which he certainly be with he hot irish temper -rrb- and since then she have only speak of he with moan and to he just as if he and she have make a compact to be as worldly as they could and as if the fact that he be go as she use to tell she private friend straight to the wrong place be to be utterly ignore before the press reality of get he and he sister well marry and so it befall that lady knockdown like many more have begin with too high -lrb- or at least precise -rrb- a spiritual standard be force to end practically in have no standard at all and that for ten year of scoutbush 's life neither she nor any other human being have speak to he as if he have a soul to be save or any duty on earth save to eat drink and be merry and all the while there be a quaint and pathetic consciousness in the little man 's heart that he be mean for something better that he be no fool and be not intend to be one he would thrust he head into lecture at the polytechnic and the british institution with a dim endeavor to guess what they be all about and a good-natured envy of the clever fellow who know about science and all that he would sit and listen puzzle and admire to the talk of statesman and confide he woe afterwards to some chum -- ah if i have have the chance now that my cousin chalkclere have if i have have two or three tutor and a good mother too keep I in a coop and cram I with learn as they cram chicken for the market i fancy i could have show my comb and hackles in the house as well as some of they i fancy i could make a speech in parliament now with the help of a little irish impudence if i only know anything to speak about so scoutbush clung in a childish way to any superior man who would take notice of he and not treat he as the fribble which he seem he have take to that well-known artist claude mellot of late simply from admiration of he brilliant talk about art and poetry and boldly confess that he prefer one of mellot 's oration on the sublime and beautiful though he do not understand a word of they to the song and joke -lrb- very excellent one in they way -rrb- of mr hector harkaway the distinguished irish novelist and boon companion of she majesty 's life guard green he special intimate and mentor however be a certain major campbell of whom more hereafter who however be a lofty-minded and perhaps somewhat pharisaic person make heavier demand on scoutbush 's conscience than he have yet be able to meet for fully as he agree that hercule ' choice between pleasure and virtue be the right one still he could not yet follow that ancient hero along the thorny path and confine he conception of duty to the minimum guard and drill he have estate in ireland which have almost clear themselves during he long minority but which since the famine have cost he about as much as they bring he in and estate in the west which with a welsh slate-quarry bring he in some seven or eight thousand a-year and so keep he poor little head above water to look pitifully round the universe longing for the life of he to make out what it all mean and hope that somebody would come and tell he so much for he meekness and humility in general as for the particular display of those virtue which he have show to-day it must be understand that he have give a promise to mr mellot not to make love to la cordifiamma and on that only condition have be allow to meet she to-night at one of claude mellot 's petits souper la cordifiamma have be stay ever since she come to england with the mellot in the wild of brompton unapproachable there as in all other place in public she be a very zenobium who keep all animal of the other sex at a awful distance and of the fifty young puppy who be rave about she beauty she air and she voice not one have obtain a introduction while claude whose studio use to be a favorite lounge of young guardsman have as civilly as he can close he door to those magnificent personage ever since the new singer become he guest claude mellot seem to have come into a fortune of late year large enough at least for he few want he paint no longer save when he choose and have take a little old house in one of those back lane of brompton where island of primaeval nursery garden still remain undevoured by the advance surge of the brick and mortar deluge there he live happy in a green lawn and window open thereon in three elm a cork a ilex and a mulberry with a great standard pear for flower and foliage the queen of all suburban tree there he lie on the lawn upon strange skin the summer 's day play with cat and dog and make love to he sabina who have not lose she beauty in the least though she be on the wrong side of five-and-thirty he delude himself too into the belief that he be do something because he be write a treatise on the principle of beauty which will be publish probably about the time the thame be purify in the season of latter lamma and the greek kalends and the more certainly so because he have wander into the abyss of conic section and curve of double curvature of which if the truth must be speak he know no more than he friend of the life guard green to this charming little nest have lord scoutbush procure a evening 's admission after abject supplication to sabina who pet he because he be musical and solemn promise neither to talk or look any manner of foolishness my dearest mr mellot say the poor wretch i will be good indeed i will i will not even speak to she only let I sit and look -- and -- and -- why i think you understand all about such thing and could pity a poor fellow who be spoony and sabina who pride herself much on understand such thing and on have indeed reduce they to a science in which she give gratuitous lesson to all young gentleman and lady of she acquaintance receive he pityingly in that delicious little back drawing-room whither whosoever enter be in no hurry to go out again claude 's house be arrange with he usual defiance of all conventionality dining or drawing-room proper there be none the large front room be the studio where he and sabina eat and drink as well as work and paint but out of it open a little room the wall of which be so cover with gem of art -lrb- where the rogue find money to buy they be a puzzle -rrb- that the eye can turn nowhere without take in some new beauty and wander on from picture to statue from portrait to landscape dream and learn afresh after every glance at the back a glass bay have be throw out and form a little conservatory for ever fresh and gay with tropic fern and flower gaudy orchid dangle from the roof creeper hide the framework and you hardly see where the room end and the winter-garden begin and in the center a ottoman invite you to lounge it cost claude money doubtless but he have he excuse -- have once see the tropics i can not live without some love-token from they lose paradise and which be the wiser plan to spend money on a horse and brougham which we do not care to use and on scramble into society at the price of one great stupid party a year or to make we little world as pretty as we can and let those who wish to see we take we as they find we in this nest as claude and sabina call it sacred to the everlasting billing and cooing of that sweet little pair of human love-bird who have build it be supper set la cordifiamma all the more beautiful from the languor produce by the excitement of act lay upon a sofa claude attend talk earnestly sabina accord to she custom be flutter in and out and arrange supper with she own hand both husband and wife be as busy as bee and yet any one accustom to watch the little in and out of married life could have see that neither forget for a moment that the other be in the room but bask and purr like two blissful cat each in the sunshine of the other 's presence and he could have see too that la cordifiamma be divine they thought and study all they little expression perhaps that she might use they on the stage perhaps too happy in sympathy with they happiness : and yet there be a shade of sadness on she forehead scoutbush enter be introduce and receive a salutation from the actress haughty and cold enough to check the forwardest put on the air of languid nonchalance which be consider -lrb- or be before the little experience of the crimea -rrb- fit and proper for young gentleman of rank and fashion so he sit down and feast he foolish eye upon he idol hope for a few word before the evening be over do i not say well then that there be as much meekness and humility under scoutbush 's white cravat as under other but he little joy be soon dash for the black boy announce -lrb- seemingly much to he own pleasure -rrb- a tall personage whom from he dress and he moustachio scoutbush take for a frenchman till he hear he call stangrave the intruder be introduce to lord scoutbush which ceremony be consummate by a microscopic nod on either side he then walk straight up to la cordifiamma and scoutbush see she cheek flush as he do so he take she hand speak to she in a low voice and sit down by she claude make room for he and the two engage earnestly in conversation scoutbush be much inclined to walk out of the room -- be he bring there to see that of course however he sit still keep he own counsel and make himself agreeable enough all the evening like a good-natured kind-hearted little man as he be whereby he be repay for the conversation soon become deep and even too deep for he and he be fain to drop out of the race and leave it to he idol and to the new-comer who seem to have see and do and read everything in heaven and earth and probably buy everything also not to mention that he would be happy to sell the say universe again at a very cheap price if any one would kindly take it off he hand not that he boast or take any undue share of the conversation he be evidently too well breed for that but every sentence show a acquaintance with fact of which eton have tell scoutbush nothing the barrack-room less and after which he still crave the good little fellow in a very honest way and would soon have learn have he have a chance for of native irish smartness he have no lack poor flake be half mad about you signora in the stage-box to-night say sabina he say that he shall not sleep till he have paint you do let he cry scoutbush : what a picture he will make he may paint a picture but not I it be quite enough lord scoutbush to be some one else for two hour every night without go down to posterity as some one else for ever if i be paint i will be paint by no one who can not represent my very self you be right say stangrave : and you will do the man himself good by refuse he have some notion still of what a portrait ought to be if he once begin by attempt pass expression of passion which be all stage portrait can give he will find they so much easier than honest representation of character that he will end where all we modern seem to do in merest melodrama explain say she portrait painter now depend for they effect on the mere accident of the _ entourage _ on dress on landscape even on broad hint of a man 's occupation put a plan on the engineer 's table and a roll in the statesman 's hand like the old greek who write ` this be a ox ' under he picture if they wish to give the face expression though they seldom aim so high all they can compass be a pass emotion and one sitter go down to posterity with a eternal frown another with a eternal smile or if he be a poet say sabina roll he eye for ever in a fine frenzy but would you forbid they to paint passion not in its place when the picture give the cause of the passion and the scene tell its own story but then let we not have merely kean as hamlet but hamlet 's self let the painter sit down and conceive for himself a hamlet such as shakspeare conceive not merely give we as much of he as could be press at a give moment into the face of mr kean he will be only unjust to both actor and character if flake paint marie as lady macbeth he will give we neither she nor lady macbeth but only the single point at which they two character can coincide how rude say sabina laugh what be he do but hint that la signora 's conception of lady macbeth be a very partial and imperfect one and why should it not be ask the actress humbly enough i mean he answer warmly that there be more far more in she than in any character which she assume and i do not want a painter to copy only one aspect and let a part go down to posterity as a representation of the whole if you mean that you shall be forgive no when she be paint she shall be paint as herself as she be now claude shall paint she i have not know la signora long enough say claude to aspire to such a honor i paint no face which i have not study for a year faith say scoutbush you would find no more in most face at the year 's end than you do the first day then i would not paint they if i paint a portrait which i seldom do i wish to make it such a one as the old master aim at -- to give the sum total of the whole character trace of every emotion if it be possible and glance of every expression which have pass over it since it be bear into the world they be all here the whole past and future of the man and every man as the mohammedan say carry he destiny on he forehead but who have eye to see it the old master have some of they at least raphael have sebastian del piombo have and titian and giorgione there be portrait paint by they which carry a whole life-history concentrated into one moment but they say stangrave be the portrait of man such as they see around they nature who be strong for good and evil who be not ashamed to show they strength where will a painter find such among the poor thin unable mortal who come to he to buy immortality at a hundred and fifty guinea apiece after have spend they life in religiously rub off they angle against each other and form they character as you form shoot by shake they together in a bag till they have polish each other into dullest uniformity it be very true say scoutbush who suffer much at time from a certain wild irish vein which stir he up to kick over the trace people be horribly like each other and if a poor fellow be bore and try to do anything spicy or original he have half-a-dozen people pooh-pooh he down on the score of bad taste man can be just as original now as ever say la signora if they have but the courage even the insight heroic soul in old time have no more opportunity than we have : but they use they there be daring deed to be do then -- be there none now sacrifice to be make -- be there none now wrong to be redress -- be there none now let any one set he heart in these day to do what be right and nothing else and it will not be long ere he brow be stamp with all that go to make up the heroical expression -- with noble indignation noble self-restraint great hope great sorrow perhaps even with the print of the martyr 's crown of thorn she look at stangrave as she speak with a expression which scoutbush try in vain to read the american make no answer and seem to hang he head awhile after a minute he say tenderly : -- you will tire yourself if you talk thus after the evening 's fatigue mr mellot will sing to we and give we leisure to think over we lesson and sabina sing and then lord scoutbush be make to sing and sing he best no doubt so the evening slipt on till it be past eleven o'clock and stangrave rise and now say he i must go to lady m -- 's ball and marie must rest as he go he just lean over la cordifiamma shall i come in to-morrow morning we ought to read over that scene together before the rehearsal early then or sabina will be go out and she must play soubrette to we hero and heroine you will rest mr mellot you will see that she do not sit up it be not very polite to rob we of she as soon as you can not enjoy she yourself i must take care of people who do not take care of themselves and stangrave depart great be scoutbush 's wrath when he see marie rise and obey order who be this man what right have he to command she he ask as much of sabina the moment la cordifiamma have retire be you not go to lady m -- 's too no that be i will not go yet not till you have explain all this to I explain what ask sabina look as demure as a little brown mouse why what do you ask I here for lord scoutbush should recollect that he ask himself you cruel venomous creature do you think i would have come if i have know that i be to see another man make love to she before my very eye i could kill the fellow -- who be he a new york merchant unworthy of you aristocratic powder and ball the confound yankee muttered scoutbush if people swear in my house i fine they a dozen of kid glove do you not promise I that you would not make love to she yourself well -- but it be too cruel of you before my very eye i see no love-making to-night none be you blind not in the least but you can not well see a thing make which have be make long ago what be he she husband no engage to she no what then do not you know already that this be a house of mystery full of mysterious people i tell you this only that if she ever marry any one she will marry he and that if i can i will make she then you be my enemy after all i do you think that sabina mellot can see a young viscount loose upon the universe without try to make up a match for he no i have such a prize for you -- young handsome better educate than any woman whom you will meet to-night true she be a manchester girl : but then she have eighty thousand pound eighty thousand nonsense i would sooner have that divine creature without a penny than -- and would my lord viscount so far debase himself as to marry a actress humph faith my grandmother be a actress and we st just be none the worse for that fact as far as i can see -- and certainly none the uglier -- the woman at least oh sabina -- mr mellot i mean -- only help I this once this once do you intend to marry by my assistance this time and by you own the next how many viscountess be there to be do not laugh at I you cruel woman : you do not know you fancy that i be not in love -- and the poor fellow begin pour out these commonplace which one have hear too often to take the trouble of repeat and yet which be real enough and pathetic too for in every man however frivolous or even worthless love call up to the surface the real heroism the real depth of character -- all the more deep because common to poet and philosopher guardsman and country clod i 'll leave town to-morrow i 'll go to the land 's - end -- to norway -- to africa -- and forget she in the bliss of lion-hunting do not i tell you here i will not stay to be drive mad to think that she be here and that hateful yankee at she elbow i 'll go -- to lady m -- 's ball no confound it to meet that fellow there i should quarrel with he as sure as there be hot irish blood in my vein the self-satisfied puppy to be flirt and strut there while such a creature as that be lie thinking of he would you have he shut himself up in he hotel and write poetry or walk the street all night sigh at the moon no but the cool way in which he go off himself and send she to bed confound he command she it make my blood boil claude get lord scoutbush some iced soda-water if you laugh at I i 'll never speak to you again or buy any of claude 's picture why do you torment I so i 'll go i say -- leave town to-morrow -- only i can not with this horrid depot work what shall i do it be too cruel of you while campbell be away in ireland too and i have not a soul but you to ask advice of for valencium be as great a goose as i be and the poor little fellow bury he hand in he curl and stare fiercely into the fire as if to draw from thence omen of he love by the spodomantic augury of the ancient greek while sabina trip up and down the room put thing to rights for the night and enjoy he torment as a cat do those of the mouse between she paw and yet not out of spite but from pure and simple fun sabina be one of those charming body who know everybody 's business and manage it she live in a world of intrigue but without a thought of intriguing for she own benefit she have always a match to make a disconsolate lover to comfort a young artist to bring forward a refugee to conceal a spendthrift to get out of a scrape and like david in the mountain every one that be discontented and every one that be in debt gather themselves to she the strangest people on the strangest errand run over each other in that cosy little nest of hers fine lady with over-full heart and seedy gentleman with over-empty pocket jostle each other at she door and she have a smile and a repartee and good cunning practical wisdom for each and every one of they and then dismiss they to bill and coo with claude and laugh over everybody and everything the only price which she demand for she service be to be allow to laugh and if that be permit she will be as busy and earnest and tender as saint elizabeth herself i have no child of my own she say so i just make everybody my child claude include and play with they and laugh at they and pet they and help they out of they scrape just as i should if they be in my own nursery and so it befall that she be every one 's confidant and though every one seem on the point of take liberty with she yet no one do : partly because they be in she power and partly because like a eastern sultana she carry a poniard and can use it though only in self-defence so if great people or small people either -lrb- who can give themselves air as well as they betters -rrb- take she plain speaking unkindly she just speak a little more plainly once for all and go off smile to some one else as a hummingbird if a flower have no honey in it whir away with a saucy flirt of its pretty little tail to the next branch on the bush i must know more of this american say scoutbush at last well he would be very improve company for you and i know you like improve company i mean -- what have he to do with she that be just what i will not tell you one thing i will tell you though for it may help to quench any vain hope on you part and that be the reason which she give for not marry he well because he be a idler what would she say of I then groan scoutbush very true for you must understand this mr stangrave be not what you or i should call a idle man he have travel over half the world and make the best use of he eye he have fill he house in new york they say with gem of art gather from every country in europe he be a finished scholar talk half-a-dozen different language sing draw write poetry read hard every day at every subject from garden to german metaphysics -- altogether one of the most highly cultivate man i know and quite a admirable crichton in he way then why do she call he a idler because she say he have no great purpose in life she will marry no one who will not devote himself and all he have to some great chivalrous heroic enterprise whose one object be to be of use even if he have to sacrifice he life to it she say that there must be such man still leave in the world and that if she find one he she will marry and no one else why there be none such to be find now-a-days i think you hear what she herself say on that very point there be a silence for a minute or two scout-bush have hear and be ponder it in he heart at last -- i be not cut out for a hero so i suppose i must give she up but i wish sometimes i could be of use mr mellot : but what can a fellow do i think there be a irish tenantry to be look after my lord and a cornish tenantry too that be what campbell be always say : but what more can i do than i do as for those poor paddy i never ask they for rent if i do i should not get it so there be no generosity in that and as for the aberalva people they have get on very well without I for twenty year and i do not know they nor what they want nor even if they do want anything except fish enough and i can not put more fish into the sea mr mellot try and be a good soldier then say she laugh why should not lord scoutbush emulate he illustrious countryman conquer at a second waterloo and die a duke i be not cut out for a general i be afraid but if -- i do not say if i could marry that woman -- i suppose it would be a foolish thing -- though i shall break my heart i believe if i do not oh mrs mellot you can not tell what a fool i have make myself about she and i can not help it it be not she beauty merely but there be something so noble in she face like one of those greek goddess claude talk of and when she be act if she have to say anything grand or generous -- or -- you know the sort of thing -- she bring it out with such a voice and such a look from the very bottom of she heart -- it make I shudder just as she do when she tell that yankee that every one could be a hero or a martyr if he choose mr mellot i be sure she be one or she could not look and speak as she do she be one say sabina a heroine and a martyr too if i could -- that be what i be go to say -- if i could but win that woman 's respect -- as i live i ask no more only to be sure she do not despise I i would do -- i do not know what i would not do i would -- i would study the art of war : i know there be book about it i would get out to the east away from this depôt work and if there be no fighting there as every one say there will not be i would go into a march regiment and see service i would -- hang it if they would have I -- i would even go to the senior department at sandhurst and read mathematics sabina keep she countenance -lrb- though with difficulty -rrb- at this magnificent bathos for she see that the little man be really in earnest and that the look and word of the strange actress have awaken in he something far deeper and nobler than the mere sensual passion of a boy ah if i have but go out to varna with the rest i think myself a lucky fellow to be leave here do you know that it be get very late so frederick lord scoutbush go home to he room : and there sit for three hour and more with he foot on the fender reject the entreaty of mr bowie he servant either to have something or to go to bed yea he forget even to smoke by which mr bowie jalouse that he be hit very hard indeed : but make no remark be a scotchman and of a cautious temperament however from that night scoutbush be a changed man and try to be so he read of nothing but siege and stockade brigade evolution and conical bullet he drill he man till he be a abomination in they eye and a weariness to they flesh only every evening he go to the theater watch la cordifiamma with a heavy heart and then go home to bed for the little man have good sense enough to ask sabina for no more interview with she so in all thing he acquit himself as a model officer and excite the admiration and respect of serjeant major macarthur who begin fishing at bowie to discover the cause of this strange metamorphosis in the rackety little irishman you master seem to be qualify himself for the adjutant 's post mr bowie i be jalouse he be fire with martial ardor since the war break out to which bowie be a brother scot answer scotticè by a crafty paralogism i have always hold it as my opeeeenion that he lordship be a youth of very good part if he be only compel to employ they chapter viii take root whosoever enjoy the sight of a honest man do he work well would have enjoy the sight of tom thurnall for the next two month in-door all the morning and out of door all the afternoon be that shrewd and good-natured visage call up a answer smile on every face and leave every heart a

principle of a enlighten political economy try to increase the demand by cheapen the supply which be revolutionary doctrine sir say heale to lieutenant jone over the brandy-and-water and just like

that i be a humbug and have do you no good get on you horse and have four hour ' gallop on the downs and you 'll feel like a buffalo bull by two o'clock trebooze look at he with a stupid curiosity and a little awe he see that tom 's cool self-possession be not mean for impudence and something in he tone and manner tell he that the boast of be a man of the world be not untrue and of all kind of man a man of the world be the man of whom trebooze stand most in awe a small squireen curse with six or seven hundred a year of he own never send to school college or into the army he have grow up in a narrow circle of squireen like himself without a object save that of gratify he animal passion and have about six year before be then just of age settle in life by marry he housemaid -- the only wise thing perhaps he ever do for she a clever and determine woman keep he though not from drunkenness and debt at least from delirium tremen and ruin and be in she rough vulgar way he guardian angel -- such a one at least as he be worthy of more than once have one see the same seeming folly turn out in practice as wise a step as could well have be take and the coarse nature of the man which would have crush and ill-use a delicate and high-minded wife subdue to something like decency by a help literally meet for it there be a pause trebooze fancy and wisely that the doctor be a cleverer man than he and of course would want to show it so after the fashion of a country squireen he feel a longing to set he down he be be a traveller they say think he in that pugnacious sceptical spirit which be breed not as twaddler fancy by too extended knowledge but by the sense of ignorance and a narrow sphere of thought which make a man angry and envious of any one who have see more than he buffalo bull say he half contemptuously what do you know about buffalo bull i be one once myself say tom where i live before trebooze swear do not you put you traveller 's lie on I sir well perhaps i dream it say tom placidly i remember i dream at the same time that you be a grizzly bear fourteen foot long and want to eat I up : but you find I too tough about the hump rib trebooze stare at he audacity you be a rum hand to which tom make answer in the same elegant strain and then begin a regular word-battle of slang in which tom show himself so really witty a proficient that mr trebooze laugh himself into good-humour and end by -- i say you be a good fellow and i think you and i shall suit tom have he doubt but do not express they come up this afternoon and see my child mr trebooze think it be get swell gland or some such woman 's nonsense bother they why can not they let the child alone fuss and doctoring and she will have you hear of you from mrs vavasor i believe we doctor and i have quarrel and she say if i could get you she would sooner have you than that old rum-puncheon heale and then you would better stop and take pot-luck and we 'll make a night of it i have to go round lord minchampstead 's estate and will take you on my way : but i be afraid i shall be too dirty to have the pleasure of dine with mr trebooze come back mrs trebooze she must take what i like and what be good enough for I be good enough for she i hope come as you be -- liberty hall at trebooze and out he swagger do he bully she thought tom or be he hen-pecked and want to hide it i 'll see to-night and play my card accordingly all which miss heale have hear she have be peep and listen at the glass-door and she mother also for no sooner have trebooze enter the shop than she have run off to tell she mother the surprising fact trebooze 's custom have be for some year past court in vain by heale so miss heale peep and peep at a man whom she regard with delighted curiosity because he bear the reputation of be such a naughty wicked man and so very handsome too and so distinguish as he look say the poor little fool to whose novel-fed imagination mr trebooze be a ideal lothario but the surprise of the two dame grow rapidly as they hear tom 's audacity towards the country aristocrat impudent wretch moan mr heale to herself he would drive away a angel if he come into the shop oh ma hear how they be go on now i can not bear it my dear this man will be the ruin of we he manners be those of the pot-house when the cloven foot be show which it be he nature as a child of wrath and we can not expect otherwise oh ma do you hear that mr trebooze have ask he to dinner nonsense but it be true well if there be not the sign of the end of the world which be all the year you poor father have be here and never so much as send he a hare and now this young penniless interloper and he to dine at trebooze off purple and fine linen there be not much of that there ma i be sure they be poor enough for all he pride and as for she -- yes my dear and as for she though we have not marry squire my dear yet we have not be squire ' housemaid and have adorn we own station which be good enough for we and have no need to rise out of it nor ride on pharaoh 's chariot-wheel after filthy lucre -- miss heale hate poor mr trebooze with a bitter hatred because she dream insanely that but for she she might have secure mr trebooze for herself and though she ambition be now transfer to the unconscious tom that need not make any difference in the say amiable feeling but that tom be a most wonderful person she have no doubt he have conquer she heart -- so she inform herself passionately again and again as be very necessary see that the passion have no real life of its own require a good deal of blow to keep it alight yes he have conquer she heart and he be conquer all heart likewise there must be some mystery about he -- there should be and she settle in she novel-bewildered brain that tom must be a nobleman in disguise -- probably a foreign prince exile for political offence bah perhaps too many line have be spend on the poor little fool but as such fool exist and people must be as they be there be no harm in draw she and in ask too -- who will help those young girl of the middle class who like miss heale be often really less educate than the child of they parent ' workman sedentary luxurious full of petty vanity gossip and intrigue without work without purpose except that of get marry to any one who will ask they -- bewildering brain and heart with novel which after all one hardly grudge they for what other means have they of learn that there be any fairer nobler life possible at least on earth than that of the sordid money-getting often the sordid puffery and adulteration which be the atmosphere of they home exception there be in thousand doubtless and the family of the great city tradesman stand of course on far higher ground and be often far better educate and more high-minded than the fine lady they parent ' customer but till some better plan of education than the boarding-school be devise for they till we town shall see something like in kind to though sounder and soberer in quality than the high school of america till in country village the lady who interest themselves about the poor will recollect that the farmer ' and tradesman 's daughter be just as much in want of they influence as the charity child and will yield a far richer return for they labor though the one need not interfere with the other so long will england be full of miss heale fate when they marry to bring up son and daughter as sordid and unwholesome as they mother tom work all that day in and out of the pentremochyn cottage note down nuisance and dilapidation : but he head be full of other thought for he have receive the evening before news which be to he very important for more reason than one the longer he stay at aberalva the longer he feel inclined to stay the strange attraction of grace have as we have see something to do with he purpose : but he see too a good opening for one of those country practice in which he seem more and more likely to end at he native whitbury he know there be no room for a fresh medical man and gradually he be make up he mind to settle at aberalva to buy out heale either with he own money -lrb- if he recover it -rrb- or with money borrow from mark to bring he father down to live with he and in that pleasant wild western place fold he wing after all he wanderings and therefore certain news which he have obtain the night before be very valuable to he in that it put a fresh person into he power and might if cunningly use give he a hold upon the ruling family of the place and on lord scoutbush himself he have find out that lucium and elsley be unhappy together and find out too a little more than be there to find he could not of course be a month among the gossip of aberalva without hear hint that the great folk at the court do not always keep they temper for of family jar as of everything else on earth the great and just law stand true : -- what you do in the closet shall be proclaim on the housetop but the gossip of aberalva as woman be too often wont to do have altogether take the man 's side in the quarrel the reason be i suppose that lucium conscious of have fall somewhat in rank hold up she head to mr trebooze and mr heale -lrb- as they themselves express it -rrb- and to various other little notability of the neighborhood rather more than she would have do have she marry a man of she own class she be afraid that they might boast of be intimate with she that they might take to advise and patronise she as a inexperienced young creature afraid even that she might be tempt in some unguarded moment to gossip with they confide she unhappiness to they in the blind longing to open she heart to some human be for there be no resident gentry of she own rank in the neighborhood she be too high-minded to complain much to clara and she sister valencium be the very last person to whom she would confess that she run-away-match have not be altogether successful so she live alone and friendless shrink into herself more and more while the vulgar woman round mistake she honor for pride and revenge themselves accordingly she be a uninteresting fine lady proud and cross and elsley be a martyr so handsome and agreeable as he be -- -lrb- and to do he justice he be the former and he could be the latter when he choose -rrb- -- to be tie to that unsociable stuck-up woman and so forth all which tom have hear and form he own opinion thereof which be -- all very fine : but i flatter myself i know a little what woman be make of and this i know that where man and wife quarrel even if she end the battle it be he who have begin it i never see a case yet where the man be not the most in fault and i 'll lay my life john brigg have lead she a pretty life : what else could one expect of he however he hold he tongue and keep he eye open withal whenever he go up to penalva court which he have to do very often for though he have cure the child of they ailment yet mr vavasor be perpetually more or less unwell and he could not cure she she low spirit headache general want of tone and vitality puzzle he at first and would have puzzle he longer have he not settle with himself that they cause be to be seek in the mind and not in the body and at last gain courage from certainty he have hint as much to miss clara the night before when she come down -lrb- as she be very fond of do -rrb- to have a gossip with he in he shop under the pretence of fetch medicine i do not think i shall send mr vavasor any more miss clara there be no use run up a long bill when i do no good and what be more suspect that i can do none poor lady and he give the girl a look which seem to say you have better tell I the truth for i know everything already to which clara answer by try to find out how much he do know : but tom be a cunninger diplomatist than she and in ten minute after have give solemn promise of secresy and have by strong expression of contempt for mr heale and the village gossip make clara understand that he do not at all take they view of the case he have pour out to he across the counter all clara 's long-pent indignation and contempt i never say a word of this to a living soul sir i be too proud for my mistress 's sake to let vulgar people know what we suffer we do not want any of they pity indeed but you sir who have the feeling of a gentleman and know what the world be like ourselves -- take care whisper tom that daughter of heale 's may be listen i would pull she hair about she ear if i catch she quoth clara and then run on to tell how elsley never keep no hour nor no account either so that she have to do everything poor thing and no thanks either and never know when he 'll dine or when he 'll breakfast or when he 'll be in wander in and out like a madman and sit up all night write he nonsense and she 'll go down twice and three time a night in the cold poor dear to see if he be fall asleep and get abuse like a pickpocket for she pain -lrb- which be a exaggeration -rrb- and lie in bed all the morning look at the fly and call after she if he shoe want tie or he finger ache as helpless as the babe unborn and will never do nothing useful himself not even to hang a picture or move a chair and grumble at she if he see she do anything because she be not listen to he prosody and snap and worrit and will not speak to she sometimes for a whole morning the brute but be he not fond of he child fond yes he way and small thanks to he the little angel to play with 'em when they be good and tell they cock-and-a-bull fairy tale -- wonder why he like to put such stuff into they head -- and then send 'em out of the room if they make a noise because it split he poor head and he nerve be so delicate wish he have hers or mine either doctor thurnall then he would know what nerve be in a frail woman which he use we both as he negro slave or would if i do not stand up to he pretty sharp now and then and give he a piece of my mind which i will do like the faithful servant in the parable if he kill I for it doctor thurnall do he drink ask tom bluntly he she answer in a tone which seem to imply that even one masculine vice would have raise he in she eye he be not man enough i think and live on he slop and he coffee and he tapioca and how 's he ever to have any appetite always a sit about heap up together over he book with he rib grow into he backbone -- if he would only go and take he walk or get a spade and dig in the garden or anything but they everlasting papers which i hate the sight of and so forth from all which tom gather a tolerably clear notion of the poor poet 's state of body and mind as a self-indulgent unmethodical person whose ill-temper be owe partly to perpetual brooding over he own thought and partly to dyspepsia bring on by he own effeminacy -- in both case not a thing to be pity or excuse by the hearty and valiant doctor and tom 's original contempt for vavasor take a darker form perhaps one too dark to be altogether just i 'll tackle he miss clara i wish you would : i be sure he want some one to look after he just now he be half wild about some review that somebody 's be and do of he in the time and have be fling the paper about the room and call all mankind viper and adder and hoot herd -- it be as bad as swearing i say -- and run to my mistress to make she read it and see how the whole world 's against he and then forbid she to defile she eye with a word of it and so on till she be be cry all the morning poor dear why not laugh at he poor thing that be where it all be : she be just as anxious about he poetry as he be and would write it just as well as he i 'll warrant if she have not better thing to do and all she fuss be that people should ` appreciate ' he he be always talk about appreciate till i hate the sound of the word how any woman can go on so after a man that behave as he do but we be all soft fool i be afraid doctor thurnall and clara begin a languish look or two across the counter which make tom answer to a imaginary doctor heale whom he hear call from within yes doctor come this moment doctor good-bye miss clara i must hear more next time you may trust I you know secret as the grave and always you friend and you lady 's too if you will allow I to do myself such a honor come doctor and tom bolt through the glass door till miss clara be safe on she way up the street very well say tom to himself knowledge be power : but how to use it to get into mr vavasor 's confidence and show a inclination to take she part against she husband if she be a true woman she would order I out of the house on the spot as surely as a fish-wife would fall tooth and nail on I as a base intruder if i dare to interfere with she sacred right of be beat by she husband when she choose no i must go straight to john brigg himself and bind he over to keep the peace and i think i know the way to do it so tom ponder over many plan in he head that day and then go to trebooze and see the sick child and sit down to dinner where he host talk loud about the trebooze of trebooze who fight in the spanish armada -- or against it and show a unbounded belief in the greatness and antiquity of he family combine with a historic accuracy about equal to that of a good old dame of those part who use to say she family come over the water that she know but whether it be with the conqueror or whether it be wus ' oliver she could not exactly say then he become great on the subject of old county family in general and pour out all the vial of he wrath on that confound upstart of a newbroom lord minchampstead supplant all the fine old blood in the country -- why sir that pentremochyn and carcarrow moor too -lrb- -- good shooting there there use to be -rrb- they ought to be mine sir if every man have he rights and then follow a long story and a confused one withal for by this time mr trebooze have drunk a great deal too much wine and as he become aware of the fact become proportionately anxious that tom should drink too much also out of which story tom pick the plain fact that trebooze 's father have mortgage pentremochyn estate for more than its value and that lord minchampstead have foreclose while some equally respectable uncle or cousin just decease have sell the reversion of carcarrow to the same mighty cotton lord twenty year before and this be the way sir the land get eat up by a set of tinker and cobbler and money-lending jobber who suck the blood of the aristocracy the oath we omit leave the reader to pepper mr trebooze 's conversation therewith up to any degree of heat which may suit he palate tom sympathise with he deeply of course and do not tell he as he might have do that he think the sooner such cumberer of the ground be clear off whether by a encumber estate ' act such as we may see yet in england or by they own suicidal folly the better it would be for the universe in general and perhaps for themselves in particular but he only answer with pleasant effrontery -- ah my dear sir i be sure there be hundred of good sportsman who can sympathise with you deeply the wonder be that you do not unite and defend yourselve for not only in the west of england but in ireland and in wale and in the north too if one be to believe those novel of currer bell 's and she sister there be a large and important class of land proprietor of the same stamp as yourself and expose to the very same danger i wonder at time that you do not all join and use you combined influence on the government the government all a set of whig traitor call themselves conservative or what they like traitor sir from that fellow peel upward -- all combine to crush the land gentry -- ruin the church -- betray the country party -- d'israelus -- derby -- free trade -- ruin sir -- maynooth -- protection -- treason -- help yourself and pass the -- you know old fellow -- and mr trebooze 's voice die away and he slumber but not softly the door open and in march mr trebooze tall tawdry and terrible mr trebooze it be past eleven o'clock hush my dear madam he be sleep so sweetly say tom rise and gulp down a glass not of wine but of strong ammonia and water the rogue have put a phial thereof in he pocket that morning expect that as trebooze have say he would be require to make a night of it she be silent for to rouse she tyrant be more than she dare do if awaken he would crave for brandy and water and if he get that sweet poison he would probably become furious she stand for half a minute and tom who know she story well watch she curiously she be a fine woman : and with a far finer heart in she than that brute she eyebrow and eye now have the true siddon ' stamp the great white forehead and sharp-cut little nostril breathing scorn -- and what a siddons-like attitude -- i should like madam to see the child again before i go if you be fit sir answer she brave woman come to the point at once i be a poor doctor madam and not a country gentleman and have neither money nor health to spend in drinking too much wine then why do you encourage he in it sir i have expect a very different sort of conduct from you sir tom do not tell she what she would not -lrb- no woman will -rrb- understand that it be morally and socially impossible to escape from the table of a fool till either he or you be conquer and she be too shrewd to be take in by commonplace excuse so he look she very full in the face and reply a little haughtily with a slow and delicate articulation use he lip more than usual and yet compress they : -- i beg you pardon madam if i have unintentionally displeased you : but if you ever do I the honor of know more of I you will be the first to confess that you word be unjust do you wish I to see you son or do you not poor mr trebooze look at he with a eye which show that she have be accustom to study character keenly perhaps in self-defence she see that tom be sober he have take care to prove that by the way in which he speak and she see too that he be a better breed man than she husband as well as a cleverer she drop she eye before he heave something very like a sigh and then say in she curt fierce tone which yet imply a sort of sullen resignation -- yes come up-stair tom go up and look at the boy again as he lay sleep a beautiful child of four year old as large and fair a child as man need see and yet there be on he the curse of he father 's sin and tom know it and know that he mother know it also what a noble boy say he after look not without honest admiration upon the sleep child who have kick off he bed-clothes and lay in a wild graceful attitude as child be wont to lie just like a old greek statue of cupid it all depend upon you madam now on I she ask in a startled suspicious tone yes he be a magnificent boy : but -- i can only give palliative it depend upon you care now he will have that at least i should hope she say nettled and on you influence ten year hence go on tom my influence yes only keep he steady and he may grow up a magnificent man if not -- you will excuse I -- but you must not let he live as freely as he father the constitution of the two be very different do not talk so sir steady he father make he drunk now if he can teach he to swear because it be manly -- god help he and I tom 's cunning and yet kind shaft have speed he guess that with a coarse woman like mr trebooze he best plan be to come as straight to the point as he could and he be right ere half a hour be over that woman have few secret on earth which tom do not know let I give you one hint before i go say he at last persuade you husband to go into a militia regiment why he would see so much company and it would be so expensive the expense would repay itself ten time over the company which he would see would be sober company in which he would be force to keep in order he would have something to do in the world and he would do it well he be just cut out for a soldier and might have make a gallant one by now if he have have other man 's chance he will find he do he militia work well and it will be a new interest and a new pride and a new life to he and meanwhile madam what you have say to I be sacred i do not pretend to advise or interfere only tell I if i can be of use -- how when and where -- and command I as you servant and tom depart have strike another root and be up at four the next morning -lrb- he never work at night for he say he never could trust after-dinner brain -rrb- draw out a detailed report of the pentremochyn cottage which he send to lord minchampstead with -- and you lordship will excuse my say that to put the cottage into the state in which you lordship with you known wish for progress of all kind would wish to see they be a responsibility which i dare not take on myself as it would involve a present outlay of not less than # 450 this sum would be certainly repay to you lordship and you tenant in the course of the next three year by the saving in poor-rate a opinion for which i subjoin my grounds draw from the book of the medical officer mr heale : but the responsibility and possible unpopularity which employ so great a sum would involve be more than i can in the present dependent condition of poor-law medical officer dare to undertake in justice to mr heale my employer save at you special command i be bind however to inform you lordship that this outlay would i think perfectly defend the hamlet not only from that visit of the cholera which we have every reason to expect next summer but also from those zymotic disease which -lrb- as you lordship will see by my return -rrb- make up more than sixty-five per cent of the aggregate sickness of the estate which letter the old cotton lord put in he pocket ride into whitbury therewith and show it to mark armsworth well mr armsworth what be i to do well my lord i tell you what sort of a man you would have to do with one that do he work thoroughly and i think pay you a compliment by think that you want it do thoroughly lord minchampstead be of the same opinion but he do not say so few indeed have ever hear lord minchampstead give he opinion : though many a man have see he act on it i 'll send down order to my agent do not why then my good friend agent be always in league with farmer or guardian or builder or drain-tile maker or attorney or banker or somebody and either you 'll be tell that the work do not need do or have a job brew out of it to get off a lot of unsaleable drain-tile or crack soil-pan or to get farm ditch dig and perhaps the highway rate save building culvert and fifty dodge beside i know they game and you ought too by now my lord beg you pardon perhaps i do mark say he lordship with a chuckle so i say let the man that find the fox run the fox and kill the fox and take the brush home and so it shall be quoth my lord minchampstead chapter ix be i not a woman and a sister but what be the mysterious bond between la cordifiamma and the american which have prevent scoutbush from follow the example of he illustrious progenitor and take a viscountess from off the stage certainly any one who have see she with he on the morning after scoutbush 's visit to the mellot would have say that if the cause be love the love be all on one side she be stand by the

reproachfully yes forsooth -- when the almighty dollar be there already and a man have ten time as much to spend every day as he can possibly invest in french cookery and wine and fine clothes then he begin to lay out he surplus nobly on self-education and the patronage of art and the theater -- for merely aesthetic purpose of course and when the lust of the flesh have be satisfied think himself a

careless tone which do not deceive she a adventurer -- a doctor if i recollect -- who have be in texa and mexico and i know not where besides agreeable enough he be but as for you quest of the sangreal whatever it may be he seem to have as little notion of anything beyond he own interest as any greek i ever meet unjust you word only show how little you can see that man of all man i ever meet see the quest at once and follow it at the risk of he own life as far at least as he be concern with it : -- ay even when he pretend to see nothing oh there be more generosity in that man 's

only what you mean what care i for pedigree i want you -- worship you -- and that be enough marie you admire I because i be beautiful what thanks do i owe you for find out so patent a fact what do you do more to I than i do to myself and she glance back once more at the mirror marie you know that you word be false i do more -- you admire I interrupted she because i be clever what thanks to you for that again what do you do more to I than you do to yourself and this after all -- after what after you find I or rather i find you -- you the critic the arbiter of the greenroom the highly-organised do-nothing -- teaching other how to do nothing most gracefully the would-be goethe who must for the sake of he own self-development try experiment on every weak woman whom he meet and i the new phenomenon whom you must appreciate to show you own taste patronise to show you own liberality develop to show you own insight into character you find yourself mistaken you have attempt to play with the tigress -- and behold she be talon to angle for the silly fish -- and behold the fish be the better angler and catch you marie have mercy be you heart iron no but fire as my name show : and she stand look down on he with a glare of dreadful beauty fire indeed yes fire that i may scorch you kindle you madden you to do my work and wear the heart of fire which i wear day and night stangrave look at she startle be she mad she face do not say so she brow be white she feature calm she eye fierce and contemptuous but clear steady full of mean so you know mr thurnall say she after a while yes why do you ask because he be the only friend i have on earth the only friend marie the only one answer she calmly who see the right have go and do it forthwith when do you see he last i have not be acquaint with mr thurnall for some year say stangrave haughtily in plain word you have quarrel with he stangrave bit he lip he and i have a difference he insult my nation and we part she laugh a long loud bitter laugh which ring through stangrave 's ear insult you nation and on what grounds pray about that accursed slavery question la cordifiamma look at he with firm-closed lip a while so then i be not aware of this even so long ago you see the sangreal and do not know it when you see it no wonder that since then you have be stare at it for month in you very hand play with it admire it make verse about it to show off you own taste : and yet be blind to it the whole time farewell then marie what do you mean and stangrave catch both she hand hush if you please i know you be eloquent enough when you choose though you have be somewhat dumb and monosyllabic to-night in the presence of the actress whom you undertake to educate but i know that you can be eloquent so spare I any brilliant appeal which can only go to prove that already settle fact between you and I lie two great gulf the one i have tell you of and from it i shrink the other i have not tell you of from it you would shrink the first be you quest of the sangreal she smile assent bitterly enough and the second she do not answer she be look at herself in the mirror and stangrave in spite of he almost doting affection flush with anger almost contempt at she vanity and yet be it vanity which be express in that face no but dread horror almost disgust as she gaze with side-long startled eye struggle and yet struggle in vain to turn she face from some horrible sight as if she own image have be the gorgon 's head what be it marie speak but she answer nothing for that last question she have no heart to answer no heart to tell he that in she vein be some drop at least of the blood of slave instinctively she have look round at the mirror -- for might he not if he have eye discover that secret for himself be there not in she feature trace of that taint and as she look -- be it the mere play of she excited fancy -- or do she eyelid slope more and more she nostril shorten and curl she lip enlarge she mouth itself protrude it be more than the play of fancy for stangrave see it as well as she she actress 's imagination fix on the african type with a intensity proportion to she dread of see it in herself have mould she feature for the moment into the very shape which it dread and stangrave see it and shudder as he see another half minute and that face also have melt out of the mirror at least for marie 's eye and in its place a ancient negress white-haired wither as the wrinkled ape but with eye close -- in death marie know that face well a face which haunt many a dream of hers once see but never forget since for to that old dame 's coffin have she mother the gay quadroon woman flaunt in finery which be the price of shame lead marie when she be but a three year ' child and marie have see she bend over the corpse and call it she dear old granny and weep bitter tear suddenly she shake off the spell and look round and clown terrify self-conscious she eye catch stangrave 's she see or think she see by the expression of he face that he know all and burst away with a shriek he spring up and catch she in he arm marie beloved marie she look up at he struggle the dark expression have vanish and stangrave 's love-blinded eye could see nothing in that face but the refine and yet rich beauty of the italian marie this be mere madness you excite yourself till you know not what you say or what you be -- i know what i be murmured she : but he hurry on unheed you love I you know you love I and you madden yourself by refuse to confess it he feel she heart throb as he speak and know that he speak truth what gulf be these you dream of no i will not ask there be no gulf between I and one whom i adore who have throw a spell over I which i can not resist which i glory in not resist for you have be my guide my morning star which have awaken I to new life if i have a noble purpose upon earth if i have rouse myself from that conceited dream of self-culture which now look to I so cold and barren and tawdry into the hope of become useful beneficent -- to whom do i owe it but to you marie no there be no gulf marie you be my wife and you alone and he hold she so firmly and gaze down upon she with such strong manhood that she woman 's heart quail and he might perhaps have conquer then and there have not sabina summon by she shriek enter hastily good heaven what be the matter wait but one minute mr mellot say he the next i shall introduce you to my bride never never never cry she and break from he fly into sabina 's arm leave I leave I to bear my curse alone and she break out into such wild weep and refuse so wildly to hear another word from stangrave that he go away in despair the prize snatch from he grasp in the very moment of seem victory he go in search of claude who have agree to meet he at the exhibition in trafalgar square thither stangrave roll away in he cab he heart full of many thought marie 's word about he though harsh and exaggerated be on the whole true she have fascinate he utterly to marry she be now the one object of he life : she have awaken in he as he have confess noble desire to be useful : but the discovery that he be to be useful to the negro that abolition be the sangreal in the quest of which he be to go forth be as disagreeable a discovery as he could well have make from public life in any shape with all its vulgar noise its petty chicanery its pandering to the mob whom he despise he have always shrink as so many american of he stamp have do he have no wish to struggle unrewarded and disappointed in the rank of the minority while to gain place and power on the side of the majority be to lend himself to that fatal policy which ever since the missourus compromise of 1820 have be gradually make the northern state more and more the tool of the southern one he have no wish to be threaten in congress with have he northerner 's ear nail to the counter like he own base coin or to be inform that he with the 17000000 of the north be the white slave of a southern aristocracy of 350000 slaveholder he have enough comprehension of enough admiration for the noble principle of the american constitution to see that the democratic mob of irish and german who be stupidly play into the hand of the southerner be not exactly carry they out but he have no mind to face either irish or southerner the former be too vulgar for he delicacy the latter too aristocratic for he pride spring as he hold -lrb- and rightly -rrb- from as fine old english blood as any virginian -lrb- though it do happen to be puritan and not cavalier -rrb- he have no lust to come into contact with man who consider he much further below they in rank than a english footman be below a english nobleman who indeed would some of they look down on the english nobleman himself as a mushroom of yesterday so he compound with he conscience by ignore the whole matter and by look on the state of public affair on he side of the atlantic with a cynicism which very soon -lrb- as be usual with rich man -rrb- pass into epicureanism poetry and music picture and statue amusement and travel become he idol and cultivation he substitute for the plain duty of patriotism and wander luxuriously over the world he learn to sentimentalise over cathedral and monastery picture and statue saint and kaiser with a lazy regret that such form of beauty and nobleness be no longer possible in a world of scrip and railroad : but without any notion that it be he duty to reproduce in he own life or that of he country as much as he could of the say beauty and nobleness and now he be sorely try it be interesting enough to develop the peculiar turn of marie 's genius by write for she play about liberty just as he would have write play about jealousy or anything else for represent which she have capability but to be call on to act in that slavery question the one in which he know -lrb- as all sensible american do -rrb- that the life and death of he country depend and which for that very reason he have carefully ignore till a more convenient season finding in its very difficulty and danger a excuse for leave it to solve itself : -- to have this thrust on he and by she as the price of the thing which he must have or die if she have ask for he right hand he would have give it sooner and he enter the royal academy that day in much the same humor as that of a fine lady who should find herself suddenly drag from the ball-room into the dust-hole in she tenderest array of gauze and jewel and there peremptorily compel to sift the cinder under the superintendence of the sweep and the pot-boy glad to escape from question which he have rather not answer too soon he go in search of claude and find he before one of those pre-raphaelite picture which claude do not appreciate as he ought desinit in culicem mulier formosa supernè say stangrave as he look over claude 's shoulder but i suppose he follow nature and copy he model that he do not say claude for i know who he model be : but if he do he have no business to do so i object on principle to these man 's notion of what copying nature mean i do not deny he talent i be ready to confess that there be more imagination and more honest work in that picture than in any one in the room the hysterical all but grin joy upon the mother 's face be a miracle of truth i have see the expression more than once doctor see it often in the sudden revulsion from terror and agony to certainty and peace i only marvel where he ever meet it : but the general effect be unpleasing mar by patch of sheer ugliness like that child 's foot there be the same mistake in all he picture whatever they be they be not beautiful and no magnificence of surface-colouring will make up in my eye for wilful ugliness of form i say that nature be beautiful and therefore nature can not have be truly copy or the general effect would have be beautiful also i never find out the fallacy till the other day when look at a portrait by one of they the woman for whom it be mean be stand by my side young and lovely the portrait hang there neither young nor lovely but a wrinkled caricature twenty year older than the model i surely know the portrait you mean lady d -- 's yes he have simply under pretence of follow nature caricature she into a woman twenty year older than she be but do you ever see a modern portrait which more perfectly express character which more completely fulfil the requirement which you lay down a few evening since never and that make I all the more cross with the wilful mistake of it he have paint every wrinkle why not if they be there because he have paint a face not one-twentieth of the size of life what right have he to cram into that small space all the mark which nature have spread over a far larger one why not again if he diminish the mark in proportion just what neither he nor any man could do without make they so small as to be invisible save under a microscope : and the result be that he have caricature every wrinkle as he friend have in those horrible knuckle of shem 's wife besides i deny utterly you assertion that one be bind to paint what be there on that very fallacy be they all make shipwreck not paint what be there and you be the man who talk of art be highest when it copy nature exactly and therefore you must paint not what be there but what you see there they forget that human being be man with two eye and not daguerreotype lens with one eye and so be contrive and strive to introduce into they picture the very defect of the daguerreotype which the stereoscope be require to correct i comprehend they forget that the double vision of we two eye give a softness and indistinctness and roundness to every outline exactly so and therefore while for distant landscape motionless and already soften by atmosphere the daguerreotype be invaluable -lrb- i shall do nothing else this summer but work at it -rrb- yet for take portrait in any true sense it will be always useless not only for the reason i just give but for another one which the pre-raphaelite have forget because all the feature can not be in focus at once oh no i be not speak of that art for aught i know may overcome that for it be a mere defect in the instrument what i mean be this : it try to represent as still what never yet be still for the thousandth part of a second : that be the human face and as see by a spectator who be perfectly still which no man ever yet be my dear fellow do not you see that what some painter call idealise a portrait be if it be wisely do really paint for you the face which you see and know and love she ever-shifting feature with expression vary more rapidly than the gleam of the diamond on she finger feature which you in you turn be look at with ever-shifting eye while perhaps if it be a face which you love and have linger over a dozen other expression equally belong to it be hang in you memory and blend themselves with the actual picture on you retina : -- till every little angle be somewhat rounded every little wrinkle somewhat soften every little shade somewhat blended with the surround light so that the sum total of what you see and be intend by heaven to see be something far softer lovelier -- younger perhaps thank heaven -- than it would look if you head be screw down in a vice to look with one eye at she head screw down in a vice also : -- though even that thanks to the muscle of the eye would not produce the require ugliness and the only possible method of fulfil the pre-raphaelite ideal would be to set a petrified cyclops to paint he petrified brother you be spiteful not at all i be stand up for art and for nature too for instance : sabina have wrinkle she say too that she have gray hair come the former i will not see and therefore do not the latter i can not see because i be not look for they nor i either say stangrave smile i assure you the announcement be new to I of course who can see wrinkle in the light of those eye that smile that complexion certainly say stangrave if i ask for she portrait as i shall do some day and the artist sit down and paint the say ` waste of time ' on pretence of they be there i should consider it a impertinence on he part what business have he to spy out what nature have take such charming trouble to conceal again say claude such a face as cordifiamma 's when it be at rest in deep thought there be line in it which utterly puzzle one -- touch which be eastern kabyle almost quadroon stangrave start claude go on unconscious : -- but who see they in the light of that beauty they be defect no doubt but defect which no one would observe without deep study of the face they express she character no more than a scar would and therefore when i paint she as i must and will i shall utterly ignore they if on the other hand i meet the same line in a face which i know to have quadroon blood in it i should religiously copy they because then they would be integral element of the face you understand understand -- yes answer stangrave in a tone which make claude look up that strange scene of half a hour before flash across he what if it be no fancy what if marie have african blood in she vein and stangrave shudder and feel for the moment that thousand of pound would be a cheap price to pay for the discovery that he fancy be a false one yes -- oh -- i beg you pardon say he recover himself i be think of something else but as you say what if she have quadroon blood i i never say so or dream of it oh i mistook do you know though where she come from i you forget my dear fellow that you yourself introduce she to we of course but i think mr mellot might -- woman always make confidence all we know be what i suppose you know long ago that she most intimate friend next to you seem to be a old friend of ours name thurnall a old friend of yours oh yes we have know he these fifteen year meet he first at pari and after that go round the world with he and see infinite adventure sabina and i spend three month with he once among the savage in a south-sea island and a very pretty romance we stay and we escape would make we be all three i believe to have be cook and eat if tom have not get we off by that wonderful address which if you know he you must know well enough yes answer stangrave coldly as in a dream i have know mr thurnall in past year but not in connection with la signora cordifiamma i be not aware till this moment -- this morning i mean -- that they know each other you astound I why she talk of he to we all day long as of one to whom she have the deepest obligation she be ready to rush into we arm when she first find that we know he he be a greater hero in she eye i sometimes fancy than even you be she do nothing -lrb- or fancy that she do nothing for you know she pretty wilfulness -rrb- without write for he advice i a hero in she eye i be really not aware of that fact say stangrave more coldly than ever for bitter jealousy have take possession of he heart do you know then what this same obligation may be i never ask i hate gossip and i make a rule to inquire into no secret but such as be voluntarily confide to I and i know that she have never tell sabina i suppose she be marry to he that be the simplest explanation of the mystery impossible what can you mean if she ever marry live man she will marry you then she will never marry live man say stangrave to himself good-bye my dear fellow i have a engagement at the traveller 's and away go stangrave leave claude sorely puzzle but little dream of the powder-magazine into which he have put a match but he be puzzle still more that night when by the latest post a note come -- from stangrave say claude why in the name of all wonder -- and he read : -- good-bye i be just start for the continent on sudden and urgent business what my destination be i hardly can tell you yet you will hear from I in the course of the summer claude 's countenance fell and the note fall likewise sabina snatch it up read it and give la cordifiamma a look which make she spring from the sofa and snatch it in turn she read it through with tremble hand and blanch cheek and then drop faint upon the floor they lay she on the sofa and while they be recover she claude tell sabina the only clue which he have to the american 's conduct namely that afternoon 's conversation sabina shake she head over it for to she also the american 's explanation have suggest itself be marie thurnall 's wife or do she -- it be possible however painful -- stand to he in some less honorable relation which she would fain forget now in a new passion for stangrave for that marie love stangrave sabina know well enough the doubt be so ugly that it must be solve and when she have get the poor thing safe into she bedroom she allude to it as gently as she could marie spring up in indignant innocence he whatever he may be to other i know not : but to I he have be purity and nobleness itself -- a brother a father yes if i have no other reason for trust he i should love he for that alone that however tempt he may have be and heaven know he be tempt he could respect the honor of he friend though that friend lay sleep in a soldier 's grave ten thousand mile away and marie throw herself upon sabina 's neck and under the pressure of she misery sob out to she the story of she life what it be need not be tell a little common sense and a little knowledge of human nature will enable the reader to fill up for himself the story of a beautiful slave sabina soothe she and cheer she and soothe and cheer she most of all by tell she in return the story of she own life not so dark a one but almost as sad and strange and poor marie take heart when she find in she great need a sister in the communion of sorrow and you have be through all this so beautiful and bright as you be you whom i should have fancy always live the life of the humming-bird : and yet not a scar or a wrinkle have it leave behind they be there once marie but god and claude smooth they away i have no claude -- and no god i think at time no god marie then how do you come hither marie be silent reprove and then passionately -- why do he not right my people that question be one to which sabina 's little scheme of the universe have no answer why should it while many a scheme which pretend to be far vaster and more infallible have none as yet so she be silent and sit with marie 's head upon she bosom caress the black curl till she have soothe she into sob exhaustion there lie there and rest : you shall be my child my poor marie i have a fresh child every week but i shall find plenty of room in my heart for you my poor hunt deer you will keep my secret why keep it no one need be ashamed of it here in free england but he -- he -- you do not know sabina those northerner with all they boast of freedom shrink from we just as much as we own master oh marie do not be so unjust to he he be too noble and you must know it yourself ay if he stand alone if he be even go to live in england if he would let himself be himself but public opinion sob the poor self-tormentor -- it have be he god sabina to be a leader of taste and fashion -- admire and complete -- the crichton of newport and brooklyn and he could not bear scorn the loss of society why should he bear it for I if he have be one of the abolitionist party it would have be different : but he have no sympathy with they good narrow pious people or they with he : he could not be satisfy in they society -- or i either for i crave after it all as much as he -- wealth luxury art brilliant company admiration -- oh inconsistent wretch that i be and that make I love he all the more and yet make I so harsh to he wickedly cruel as i be to-day because when i be reprove he weakness i be reprove my own and because i be angry with myself i grow angry with he too -- envious of he i do believe at moment and all he success and luxury and so poor marie sob out she confused confession of that strange double nature which so many quadroon seem to owe to they mixed blood a strong side of deep feeling ambition energy a intellect rather greek in its rapidity than english in sturdiness and withal a weak side of instability inconsistency hasty passion love of present enjoyment sometimes too a tendency to untruth which be the mark not perhaps of the african specially but of every enslaved race consolation be all that sabina could give it be too late to act stangrave be go and week after week roll by without a line from the wanderer chapter x the recognition elsley vavasor be sit one morning in he study every comfort of which be of lucium 's arrangement and invention beat the home-preserve of he brain for pretty thought on he struggle through that wild and too luxuriant cover now bring up by a lawyer now stumble over a root now bog in a green spring now flush a stray covey of bird of paradise now a sphinx chimsera strix lamium fire-drake flying-donkey two-headed eagle -lrb- austrian as will appear shortly -rrb- or other portent only to be see now-a-day in the recess of that enchanted forest the convolution of a poet 's brain up they whir and rattle make like most game more noise than they be worth some get back some dodge among the tree the fair shot be few and far between : but elsley blaze away right and leave with trusty quill and to do he justice seldom miss he aim for practice have make he a sure and quick marksman in he own line moreover all be game which get up to-day for he be shoot for the kitchen or rather for the london market as many a noble sportsman do now-a-day and think no shame he new volume of poem -lrb- the wreck include -rrb- be in the press : but behold it be not as long as the publisher think fit and messr brown and younger have write down to entreat in haste for some four hundred line more on any subject which mr vavasor may choose and therefore be elsley beat he home cover heavily shoot over though they have be already this season in hope that a few head of he own game may still be leave : or in default -lrb- for human nature be the same in poet and in sportsman -rrb- that a few head may have stray in out of he neighbor ' manor at last the sport slacken for the sportsman be get tired and hungry also to carry on the metaphor for he have see the postman come up the front walk a quarter of a hour since and the letter have not be bring in yet at last there be a knock at the door which he answer by a somewhat testy come in but he check the come grumble when not the maid but lucium enter why not grumble at lucium he have do so many a time because she look this morning so charming really quite pretty again so radiant be she face with smile and because also she hold triumphant above she head a newspaper she dance up to he -- i have something for you for I why the post have be in this half-hour yes for you and that be just the reason why i keep it myself d'ye understand my irish reasoning no you pretty creature say elsley who see that whatever the news be it be good news pretty creature be i i be once i know but i think you have forget all about that but i be not go to let you have the paper till i have devour every word of it myself first every word of what of what you sha not have unless you promise to be good for a week such a review and from america what a dear man he must be who write it i really think i should kiss he if i meet he and i really think he would not say no but as he be not here i shall act as he proxy be quiet and read that if you can for blush and she spread out the paper before he and then cover he eye with she hand no you sha not see it it will make you vain elsley have look eagerly at the honeyed column -lrb- as who would not have do -rrb- but the last word smite he what be he thinking of he own praise or he wife 's love too true he cry look up at she you dear creature vain i be god forgive I : but before i look at a word of this i must have a talk with you i can not stop i must run back to the child no now do not look cross as he brow cloud i only say that to tease you i 'll stop with you ten whole minute if you will not look so very solemn and important i hate tragedy face now what be it as all this be speak while both she hand be clasp round elsley 's neck and with look and tone of the very sweetest as well as the very sauciest no offence be give and none take : but elsley 's voice be sad as he ask -- so you really do care for my poem you great silly creature why else do i marry you at all as if i care for anything in the world but you poem as if i do not love everybody who praise they and if any stupid reviewer dare to say a word against they i could kill he on the spot i care for nothing in the world but what people say of you -- and yet i do not care one pin i know what you poem be if nobody else do and they belong to I because you belong to I and i must be the best judge and care for nobody no not i -- and she begin singing and then hang over he torment he lovingly while he read it be a true american review utterly extravagant in its laudation whether from over-kindness or from a certain love of exaggeration and magniloquence which make one suspect that a large proportion of the transatlantic gentleman of the press must be native of the sister isle : but it be all the more pleasant to the soul of elsley there say lucium as she cling croodle to he there be a pretty character of you sir make the most of it for it be all those yankee will ever send you yes say elsley if they would send one a little money instead of make endless dollar by print one 's book and then a few more by praise one at a penny a line that be talk like a man of business : if instead of the review now a cheque for fifty pound have come how i would have rush out and pay the bill and like it a great deal better than the review you jealous creature no if i could always have you praise i would live in a cabin and go about the world barefoot like a wild irish girl you would make a very charming one i use to once i can tell you valencium and i use to run about without shoe and stocking at kilanbaggan and you can not think how pretty and white this little foot use to look on a nice soft carpet of green moss i shall write a sonnet to it you may if you choose provide you do not publish it you may trust I for that i be not one of those who anatomise they own married happiness for the edification of the whole public and make fame if not money out of they own wife ' heart how i should hate you if you do not that i believe they fine story about themselves at least i be certain it be only half the story they have they quarrel my dear just as you and i have but they take care not to put they into poetry well but who could whether they have a right or not to publish the poetical side of they married life it be too much to ask they to give you the unpoetical also then they be all humbug and i believe if they really love they wife so very much they would not be at all that pain to persuade the world of it you be very satirical and spiteful ma'am i always be when i be pleased if i be particularly happy i always long to pinch somebody i suppose it be irish -- ` come out meet a friend and for love knock he down ' but you know you rogue that you care to read no poetry but love poetry of course not every woman do but let I find you publish any such about I and see what i will do to you there now i must go to my work and you go and write something extra superfinely grand because i have be so good to you no let I go what a bother you be good-bye and away she trip and he return to he work happier than he have be for a week past he happiness truly be only on the surface the old wound have be salve -- as what wound can not be -- by woman 's love and woman 's wit but it be not heal the cause of he wrong do the vain self-indulgent spirit be there still unchastened and he be destine that very day to find that he have still to bear the punishment of it now the reader must understand that though one may laugh at elsley vavasor because it be more pleasant than scold at he yet have philistium and fogeydom neither right nor reason to consider he a despicable or merely ludicrous person or to cry ah if he have be as we be have he be merely ludicrous lucium would never have marry he and he could only have be speak of with indignation or leave utterly out of the story as a simply unpleasant figure beyond the purpose of a novel though admissible now and then into tragedy one can not heartily laugh at a man if one have not a lurk love for he as one really ought to have for elsley how much value be to be attach to he mere power of imagination and fancy and so forth be a question but there be in he more than mere talent : there be in think at least virtue and magnanimity true the best part of he perhaps almost all the good part of he spend itself in word and must be look for not in he life but in he book but in those book it can be find and if you look through they you will see that he have not touch upon a subject without take on the whole the right and pure and lofty view of it howsoever extravagant he may be in he notion of poetic licence that licence be never with he a synonym for licentiousness whatever be tender and true whatever be chivalrous and high-minded he love at first sight and reproduce it lovingly and it may be possible that he own estimate of he poem be not altogether wrong that he word may have awaken here and there in other a love for that which be morally as well as physically beautiful and may have keep alive in they heart the recollection that both for the body and the soul of man form of life far nobler and fairer than those which we see now be possible that they have appear in fragment at least already on the earth that they be destine perhaps to reappear and combine themselves in some ideal state and in one far-off divine event toward which the whole creation move this be the special and proper function of the poet that he may do this do god touch he lip with that which however it may be misuse be still fire from off the altar beneath which the spirit of he saint cry -- lord how long if he reproduce the beautiful with this intent however so little then be he of the sacred guild and because vavasor have this gift therefore he be a poet but in this he be weak : that he do not feel or at least be forget fast that this gift have be bestow on he for any practical purpose no one would demand that he should have go forth with some grand social scheme to reform a world which look to he so mean and evil he be not a man of business and be not mean to be one but it be ill for he that in he fastidiousness and touchiness he have shut himself out from that world till he have quite forget how much good there be in it as well as evil how many people -- commonplace and unpoetical it may be -- but still heroical in god 's sight be work harder than he ever work at the divine drudgery of do good and that in den of darkness and slough of filth from which he would have turn with disgust so that the sympathy with the sinful and fall which mark he earlier poem and which perhaps verge on sentimentalism gradually give place to a pharisaic and contemptuous tone a tone more lofty and manful in seem but far less divine in fact perhaps comparative success have injure he whilst struggle himself against circumstance poor untaught unhappy he have more fellow-feeling with those whom circumstance oppress at least the pity which he could once bestow upon the misery which he meet in he daily walk he now keep for the more picturesque woe of italy and greece in this too he be weak that he have altogether forget that the fire from off the altar could only be keep alight by continual self-restraint and self-sacrifice by continual gentleness and humility show in the petty matter of everyday home-life and that he who can not rule he own household can never rule the church of god and so it befall that amid the little cross-blast of home squabble the sacred spark be fast go out the poem write after he settle at penalva be mark by a less definite purpose by a lower tone of feeling : not perhaps by a lower moral tone but simply by less of any moral tone at all they be more and more full of merely sensuous beauty mere word-painting mere word-hunting the desire of find something worth say give place more and more to that of say something in a new fashion as the originality of thought -lrb- which accompany only vigorous moral purpose -rrb- decrease the attempt at originality of language increase manner in short have take the place of matter the art it may be of he latest poem be greatest : but it have be expend on the most unworthy theme the later be mannered caricature of the earlier without they soul and the same change seem to have pass over he which -lrb- with mr ruskin 's pardon -rrb- transform the turner of 1820 into the turner of 1850 thus have elsley transfer what sympathy he have leave from needle-women and ragged school dweller in jacob 's island and sleeper in the dry arch of waterloo bridge to sufferer of a more poetic class whether he sympathy show thereby that he have rise or fall let my reader decide each for himself it be a credit to any man to feel for any human being and italy as she be at this moment be certainly one of the most tragic spectacles which the world have ever see elsley need not be blame for pity she only for hold with most of we poet a vague notion that she woe be to be cure by a hair of the dog who bite she viz by homoeopathic dose of that same art which have be all along she morbid and self-deceiving substitute for virtue and industry so as she have sing herself down to the nether pit elsley would help to sing she up again and have already be throw off ever since 1848 a series of sonnet which he entitle eurydice intimating of course that he act as the orpheus whether he have hope of draw iron tear down pluto radetzky 's cheek do not appear but certainly the longer poem which have spring from he fancy at the urgent call of messr brown and younger would have be likely to draw nothing but iron ball from radetzky 's cannon or fail so vast a effect a immediate external application to the poet himself of that famous herb pantagruelion cure for all public ill and private woe which man call hemp nevertheless it be a noble subject one which ought surely to have be take up by some of we poet for if they do not make a noble poem of it it will be they own fault i mean that sad and fantastic tragedy of fra dolcino and margaret which signor mariottus have lately give to the english public in a book which both for its matter and its manner should be better know than it be elsley 's soul have be fill -lrb- it would have be a dull one else -rrb- with the conception of the handsome and gifted patriot-monk he soul delirious with the dream of realize a perfect church on earth battle with tongue and pen and at last with sword against the villany of pope and kaiser and all the old devourer of the earth cheer only by the wild love of she who have give up wealth fame friend all which render life worth have to die with he a death too horrible for word and he have conceive -lrb- and not altogether ill -rrb- a vision in which wander along some bright italian bay he meet dolcino sit a spirit at rest but not yet glorified wait for the revival of that dead land for which he have die and margaret by he dip she scorched foot for ever in the cooling wave and look up to the hero for whom she have give up all with eye of everlasting love there they be to prophesy to he such thing as seem fit to he of the future of italy and of europe of the doom of priest and tyrant of the sorrow and reward of genius unappreciated and before its age for elsley 's secret vanity could see in himself a far greater likeness to dolcino than dolcino -- the preacher confessor bender of all heart man of the world and man of action at last crafty and all but unconquerable guerilla warrior -- would ever have acknowledge in the self-indulgent dreamer however it be a fair conception enough though perhaps it never would have enter elsley 's head have shelley never write the opening canto of the revolt of islam so elsley on a burning July forenoon stroll up the lane and over the down to king arthur 's nose that he might find material for he sea-shore scene for he be not one of those man who live in such quiet everyday communication with nature that they drink in she various aspect as unconsciously as the air they breathe and so can reproduce they out of a inexhaustible stock of detail simply and accurately and yet freshly too tinge by the peculiar hue of the mind in which they have be long sleep he walk the world either blind to the beauty round he and try to compose instead some little scrap of beauty in he own self-imprisoned thought or else he be look out consciously and spasmodically for view effect emotion image something striking and uncommon which would suggest a poetic figure or help out a description or in some way re-furnish he mind with think from which method it befall that he lamp of truth be too often burn out just when it be need and that like the foolish virgin he have to go and buy oil when it be too late or fail that to supply its place with some baser artificial material that day however he be fortunate enough for wander and scramble among the rock at a dead low spring tide he come upon a spot which would have make a poem of itself better than all elsley ever write have he forget all about fra dolcino italy priest and tyrant set down in black and white just what he see provide of course that he have patience first to see the same it be none other than that ghastly chasm across which thurnall have be so miraculously sweep on the night of he shipwreck the same ghastly chasm : but ghastly now no longer and as elsley look down the beauty below invite he and the coolness also for the sun beat on the flat rock above till it scorch the foot and dazzle the eye and crisp up the blacken sea-weed while every sea-snail creep to hide itself under the bladder-tangle and nothing dare to peep or stir save certain grain of gunpowder which seem to have go mad so merrily do they hop about upon the surface of the fast evaporate salt-pool that wonder indeed elsley stoop to examine and draw back he hand with a ugh and a gesture of disgust when he find that they be nasty little insect for elsley hold fully the poet 's right to believe that all thing be not very good none indeed save such as suit he eclectic and fastidious taste and to hold -lrb- on high aesthetic grounds of course -rrb- toad and spider in as much abhorrence as do any boarding-school girl however find some rock ledge which form a natural ladder down he scramble gingerly enough for he be neither a active nor a courageous man but once down i will do he the justice to say that for five whole minute he forget all about fra dolcino and what be better about himself also the chasm may have be fifteen foot deep and above about half that breadth but below the wave have hollow it into dark overhang cavern just in front of he a huge boulder span the crack and form a natural doorway through which he see like a picture set in a frame the far-off blue sea soften into the blue sky among brown eastern haze amid the haze a single ship hang motionless like a white cloud nearer a black cormorant float sleepily along and dive and rise again nearer again long line of flat tide-rock glittering and quiver in the heat sloped gradually under the wave till they end in half-sunken bed of olive oar-weed which bent they tangled stem into a hundred graceful curve and sway to and fro slowly and sleepily the low swell slide whispering among they float palm and slip on toward the cavern 's mouth as if ask wistfully -lrb- so elsley fancy -rrb- when it would be time for it to return to that cool shade and hide from all the blind blaze outside but when he eye be enough accustomed to the shade within it withdraw gladly from the glaring sea and glare tide-rock to the wall of the chasm itself to curved and polished sheet of stone rich brown with snow-white vein on which dance for ever a dappled network of pale yellow light to crusted bed of pink coralline to cavern in the dark cranny of which hang branch sponge and tuft of purple sea-moss to strip of clear white sand bestrewn with shell to pool each a gay flower-garden of all hue where branch sea-weed reflect blue light from every point like a thousand damasked sword-blade while among they dahlia and chrysanthemum and many another mimic of we earth-born flower spread bloom of crimson and purple and lilac and creamy gray half-buried among feathered weed as brightly color as they and strange and gaudy fish shoot across from side to side and chase each other in and out of hidden cell within and without all be at rest the silence be break only by the timid whisper of the swell and by the chime of drop water within some unseen cave : but what a different rest without all lie breathless stupefied sun-stricken in blind glare within all coolness and refreshing sleep without all simple broad and vast within all various with infinite richness of form and color -- a hairoun alraschid 's bower look out upon the -- bother the fellow why will he go on analyzing and figure in this way why not let the bless place tell he what it mean instead of tell it what he think and -- why he be actually write verse though not about fra dolcino how rest yon rock whoso half-day 's bath be do with broad bright sight beneath the broad bright sun like sea-nymph tire on cushion moss sleep yet nearer draw beneath she purple tress from down-bent brow we find she slowly weep so many a heart for cruel man 's caress must only pine and pine and yet must bear a gallant front beneath life 's gaudy glare silly fellow do you think that nature have time to think of such a far-fetched conceit as that while it be make that rock and people it with a million tiny live thing of which not one falleth to the ground without you father 's knowledge and each more beautiful than any sea-nymph whom you ever fancy for after all you can not fancy a whole sea nymph -lrb- perhaps in that case you could make one -rrb- but only a very little scrap of she outside or if as you boast you be inspire by the creative spirit tell we what the creative spirit say about that rock and not such verse as that the lesson of which you do not yourself really feel pretty enough it be perhaps : but in you haste to say a pretty thing just because it be pretty you have not care to condemn yourself out of you own mouth why be you sulky sir with mr vavasor this very morning after all that pass because she would look over the washing-book while you want she to hear about fra dolcino and why though she be up to she knee among you dirty shirt when you go out do you not give she one parting kiss which would have transfigure she virtuous drudgery for she into a sacred pleasure one be heartily glad to see you disturbed cross though you may look at it by that sturdy step and jolly whistle which burst in on you from the other end of the chasm as tom thurnall with a old smock frock over he coat and a large basket on he arm come stumble and hop towards you drop every now and then on hand and knee and turn over on he back to squeeze he head into some muddy crack and then withdraw it with the salt water drip down he nose elsley close he eye and rest he head on he hand in a somewhat study pose but as he wish not to be interrupted it may not have be altogether unpardonable to pretend sleep however the sleep posture have exactly the opposite effect to that which he design ah mr vavasor humph quoth he slowly if not sulkily i admire you taste sir a charming summerhouse old triton have vacate for you use but let I advise you not to go to sleep in it why then sir because -- it be no business of mine of course : but the tide have turn already and if a breeze spring up old triton will be back again in a hurry and in a rage also and -- i may possibly lose a good patient elsley who know nothing about the tide save that the moon woo the ocean or some such important fact thank he coolly enough and return to a meditative attitude tom see that he be in the seventh heaven and go on : but he have not go three step before he pull up short slapping he hand together once as a man do who have find what he want and then plunge up to he knee in a rock pool and then begin work very gently at something under water elsley watch he for full five minute with so much curiosity that despite of himself he ask he what he be do tom have he whole face under water and do not hear till elsley have repeat the question only a rare zoophyte say he at last lift he drip visage and gasp for breath and then he dive again inexplicable pedantry of science think elsley to himself while tom work on steadfastly and at last rise and take out a phial from he basket be about to deposit in it something invisible stay a moment you really have rouse my curiosity by you earnestness may i see what it be for which you have take so much trouble tom hold out on he finger a piece of slimy crust the size of a halfpenny elsley could only shrug he shoulder nothing to you sir i doubt not but worth a guinea to I even if it be only to mount bit of it as microscopic object so you mingle business with science say elsley rather in a contemptuous tone why not i must live and my father too and it be as honest a way of make money as any other : i poach in no man 's manor for my game but what be you game what possible attraction in that bit of dirt can make man spend they money on it you shall see say tom drop it into the phial of salt water and offer it to elsley with he pocket magnifier judge for yourself elsley do so and behold a new wonder -- a living plant of crystal stud with crystal bell from each of which wave a crown of delicate arm it be the first time that elsley have ever see one of those exquisite zoophyte which stud every rock and every tuft of weed this be most beautiful say he at length humph why should not mr vavasor write a poem about it why not indeed think elsley it be no business of mine no man 's less : but i often wonder why you poet do not take to the microscope and tell we a little more about the wonderful thing which be here already and not about those which be not and which perhaps never will be well say elsley after another look : but after all these thing have no human interest in they i do not know that they have to I for instance these be the thing which i would write about if i have any turn for verse not about human nature of which i know i be afraid a little too much already i always like to read old ` darwin 's love of the plant ' bosh as it be in a scientific point of view it amuse one 's fancy without make one lose one 's temper as one must when one begin to analyze the microscopic ape call self and friend you would like then the old cosmogony the edda and the veda say elsley get interested as most people do after five minute ' talk with the cynical doctor i suppose you would not say much for they science but as poetry they be just what you ask for -- the expression of thoughtful spirit who look round upon nature with awe-struck childlike eye and ask of all heaven and earth the question ` what be you how come you to be ' yet -- it may be my fault -- while i admire they i can not sympathise with they to I this zoophyte be as a being of another sphere and till i can create some link in my own mind between it and humanity it be as nothing in my eye there be link enough sir do not doubt and chain of iron and brass too you believe then in the development theory of the ` vestige ' doctor who have they bread to earn never commit themselves to theory no all i mean be that this little zoophyte life by the same law as you and i and that he and the sea-weed and so forth teach we doctor certain little rule concern life and death which you will have a chance soon of see at work on the most grand and poetical and indeed altogether tragic scale what do you mean when the cholera come here as it will at its present pace before the end of the summer then i shall have the zoophyte rise up in judgment against I if i have not profit by a leaf out of they book the cholera say elsley in a startled voice forget tom 's parable in the new thought for elsley have a dread more nervous than really coward of infectious disease and he have also -lrb- and pride himself too on have -rrb- all goethe 's dislike of anything terrible or horrible of sickness disease wound death anything which jar with that beautiful which be he idol the cholera repeat he i hope not i wish you have not mention it mr thurnall i be very sorry that i do so if it offend you i have think that forewarn be forearm after all it be no business of mine if i have extra labor as i shall have i shall have extra experience and that will be a fair set-off even if the board of guardian do not vote I a extra remuneration as they ought to do elsley be strike dumb first by the certainty which tom 's word express and next by the coolness of they temper at last he stammer out good heaven mr thurnall you do not talk of that frightful scourge -- so disgusting too in its character -- as a matter of profit and loss it be sordid cold-hearted my dear sir if i let myself think much more talk about the matter in any other tone i should face the thing poorly enough when it come i shall have work enough to keep my head about the end of August or beginning of September and i must not lose it beforehand by indulge in any horror disgust or other emotion perfectly justifiable in a layman but be not doctor man that depend very much on what ' a man ' mean man with human sympathy and compassion oh i mean by a man a man with human strength my dear sir one may be too busy and at do good too -lrb- though that be not my line save professionally because it be my only way of earn money -rrb- but one may be too busy at do good to have time for compassion if while i be cut a man 's leg off i thought of the pain which he be suffer -- thank heaven say elsley that it be not my lot to become a medical man tom look at he with the quaintest smile : a flush of mingled anger and contempt have be rise in he as he hear the ex-bottle-boy talking sentiment : but he only go on quietly no sir with you more delicate sensibility you may thank heaven that you do not become a medical man you life would have be one of torture disgust and agonising sense of responsibility but do you not see that you must thank heaven for the sufferer 's sake also i will not shock you again by talk of amputation but even in the smallest matter -- even if you be merely send medicine to a old maid -- suppose that you imagination be preoccupy by the thought of she old age she suffering she disappointed hope she regretful dream of bygone youth and beauty and love and all the tender fancy which might well spring out of such a mournful spectacle would you not be but too likely -lrb- pardon the bathos -rrb- to end by send she a elderly gentleman 's medicine after all and so either frightfully increase she suffering or end they once for all tom say this in the most quiet and natural tone without even a twinkle of he wicked eye : but elsley hear he begin with reddening face and as he go on the red have turn to purple and then to deadly yellow till make a half-step forward he cry fiercely : -- sir and then stop suddenly for he foot slip upon the polished stone and on he face he fall into the pool at thurnall 's foot well for both of we goose say tom inwardly as he go to pick he up i verily believe he be go to strike I and that would have do for neither of we i be a fool to say it but the temptation be so exquisite and it must have come some day but vavasor stagger up of he own accord and dash away tom 's proffer hand be rush off without a word not so mr john brigg say tom make up he mind in a moment that he must have it out now or never and that he might have everything to fear from vavasor if he let he go home furious we do not part thus sir we will meet again if you will foam vavasor but it shall end in the death of one of we by each other 's potion i can doctor myself sir thank you listen to I john brigg you shall listen and tom spring past he and plant himself at the foot of the rock step to prevent he escape upward what do you wish to quarrel with I sir it be i who ought to quarrel with you i be the aggrieved party and not you sir i have not see the son of the man who when i be a apothecary 's boy pet I lend I book introduce I as a genius turn my head for I which be just what i be vain enough to enjoy -- i have not see that man 's son cast ashore penniless and friendless and yet never hold out to he a help hand but try to conceal my identity from he from a dirty shame of my honest father 's honest name vavasor drop he eye for be it not true but he raise they again more fiercely than ever curse you i owe you nothing it be you who make I ashamed of it you rhyme on it and laugh about poetry come out of such a name and what if i do be poet to be make of nothing but tinder and gall why could you not take a honest joke as it be mean and go you way like other people till you have show yourself worth something and win honor even for the name of brigg and i have i have my own station now my own fame sir and it be nothing to you what i choose to call myself i have win my place i say and you mean envy can not rob I of it you have you station very good say tom not care to notice the imputation you owe the greater part of it to you have make a most fortunate marriage for which i respect you as a practical man let you poetry be what it may -lrb- and people tell I that it be really very beautiful -rrb- you match show I that you be a clever and therefore a successful person do you take I for a sordid schemer like yourself i love what be worthy of I and win it because i deserve it then have win it treat it as it deserve say tom with a cool search look before which vavasor 's eye fall again understand I mr john brigg it be of no consequence to I what you call yourself : but it be of consequence to I that i should not have a patient in my parish whom i can not cure for i can not cure broken heart though they will be simple enough to come to I for medicine you shall have no chance you shall never enter my house you shall not ruin I sir by you bill tom make no answer to this fresh insult he have another game to play take care what you say brigg remember that after all you be in my power and i have better remind you plainly of the fact and you mean to make I you tool i will die first i believe that say tom who be very near add that he should be sorry to work with such tool my tool be my lancet and my drug say he quietly and all i have to say refer to they it suit my purpose to become the principal medical man in this neighborhood -- and i be to tout for introduction for you you be to be so very kind as to allow I to finish my sentence just as you would allow any other gentleman and because i wish for practice and patient and power you will be so kind as to treat I henceforth as one high-minded man would treat another to whom he be oblige for you know john brigg as well as i say tom draw himself up to he full height look I in the face if you can ere you deny it that i be while you know I as honorable a man and as kind-hearted a man as you ever be and that now -- consider the circumstance under which we meet -- you have more reason to trust I than i have prima facie to trust you vavasor answer not a word good-bye then say tom draw aside from the step mr vavasor will be anxious about you and mind with regard to she first of all sir and then with regard to other matter -- as long and only as long as you remember that you be john brigg of whitbury i shall be the first to forget it there be my hand for old acquaintance ' sake vavasor take the proffer hand coldly pause a moment and then wring it in silence and hurry away home have i play my ace ill after all say tom sit down to consider as for whether i should have play it all that be no business of mine now madam might-have-been may see to that but do i play ill for if i do i may try a new lead yet ought i to have twit he about he wife if he be venomous it may only make matter worse and still worse if he be suspicious i do not think he be either in old time but vanity will make a man so and it may have make he well i must only ingratiate myself all the more with she and find out too whether she have he secret as well as i what i be most afraid of be my have tell he plainly that he be in my power it be apt to make sprat of he size flounce desperately in the mere hope of prove themselves whale after all if it be only to they miserable self never mind he can not break my tackle and besides that gripe of the hand seem to indicate that the poor wretch be beat and think himself let off easily -- as indeed he be we 'll hope so now zoophyte for another turn with you to tell the truth however tom be look for more than zoophyte and have be do so at every dead low tide since he be wreck he have hear nothing yet of he belt the note have not be present at the london bank nobody in the village have be spend more money than usual for cunning tom have contrived already to know how many pint of ale every man of whom he have the least doubt have drunk perhaps after all the belt may have be tear off in the life struggle it may have be for a moment in grace 's hand and then have be sweep into the sea what more likely and what more likely in that case that sink by its weight it be wedge away in some cranny of the rock so spring-tide after spring-tide tom search and all the more carefully because other be search too for waif and stray from the wreck sad relic of mortality he find at time as other do : once even a dressing-case full of ring and pin and chain which belong he fancy to a gay young bride with whom he have waltz many a time on deck as they slip along before the soft trade-wind : but no belt he send the dressing-case to the lloyd 's underwriter and search on : but in vain neither could he find that any one else have forestall he and that very afternoon sulky and dishearten he determine to waste no more time about the matter and stride home vow signal vengeance against the thief if he catch he and i will catch he these west-country yokel to fancy that they can do tom thurnall it be add insult to injury as sam weller 's parrot have it now he shortest way home lay across the shore and then along the beach and up the step by the little waterfall past mr harvey 's door and at that door sit grace sewing in the sun she look up and bow as he pass smile modestly and little dream of what be pass in he mind and when a very lovely girl smile and bow to tom he must need do the same to she : whereon she add -- i beg you pardon sir : have you hear anything of the money you lose i -- we -- have be so ashamed to think of such a thing happen here tom 's evil spirit be rouse have _ you _ hear anything of it miss harvey for you seem to I the only person in the place who know anything about the matter i sir cry grace fix she great startled eye full on he why ma'am say tom with a courtly smile you may possibly recollect if you will so far tax you memory that you have it in you hand at least a moment when you do I the kindness to save my life and as you be kind enough to inform I that i should recover it when i be worthy of it i suppose i have not yet rise in you eye to the required state of conversion and regeneration and swing impatiently away he walk on really afraid lest he should say something rude grace half call after he and then suddenly check herself rush in to she mother with a wild and pale face what be this mr thurnall have be say to I about he belt and money which he lose about what have he be rude to you the bad man cry mr harvey drop the pie-dish in some confusion and take a long while to pick up the piece about the belt -- the money which he lose why do not you speak mother belt -- money ah i recollect now he have lose some money he say of course he have how should you know anything i recollect there be some talk of it though but what matter what he say he be quite pass away i 'll swear when they carry he up but mother mother he say that i know about it that i have it in my hand you oh the wicked wretch the false ungrateful slanderous child of wrath with adder 's poison tinder he lip no my child though we be poor we be honest let he slander we rob we of we good name send we to prison if he will -- he can not rob we of we soul we 'll be silent we 'll turn the other cheek and commit we cause to one above who plead for the orphan and the widow we will not strive nor cry my child oh no and mr harvey begin fuss over the smash pie-dish i shall not strive nor cry mother say grace who have recover she usual calm : but he must have some cause for these strange word do you recollect see I with the belt belt what be a belt i know nothing about belt i tell you he be a villain and a slanderer oh that it should have come to this to have my child 's fair fame blast by a wretch that come nobody know where from and have be do nobody know what for aught i know mother mother we know no harm of he if he be mistaken god forgive he if he be mistaken go on mr harvey still over the pie-dish : but grace give she no answer she be deep in thought she recollect now that as she have go up the path from the cove on that eventful morning she have see willi and thurnall whispering earnestly together and she recollect now for the first time that there have be a certain sadness and perplexity almost reserve about willi ever since good heaven could he suspect she too she would find out that at least and no sooner have she mother fuss away talk angrily to herself into the back kitchen than grace put on she bonnet and shawl and go forth to find the captain in a hour she return she lip be firm set she cheek pale she eye red with weep she say nothing to she mother who for she part do not seem inclined to allude again to the matter where have you be child you look quite poorly and you eye red the wind be very cold mother say she and go into she room she mother look sharply after she and mutter to herself grace go in and sit down on the bed what a coldness this be at my heart she say aloud to herself try to smile but she could not : and she sit on the bedside without take off she bonnet and shawl she hand hang listlessly by she side she head droop on she bosom till she mother call she to tea : then she be force to rouse herself and go out compose but utterly wretched tom walk up homeward very ill at ease he have play to use he nomenclature two trump card run and be by no means satisfy that he have play they well he have no right certainly to be satisfy with either move for both have be make in a somewhat evil spirit and certainly for no very disinterested end that be a view of the matter however which never enter he mind there be only that general dissatisfaction with himself which be though man try hard to deny the fact none other than the supernatural sting of conscience he try to lay to he soul the flattering unction that he might after all be of use to mr vavasor by use he power over she husband : but he know in he secret heart that any move of he in that direction be likely only to make matter worse that to-day 's explosion might only have send home the hapless vavasor in a more irritable temper than ever and think over many thing backward and forward he see he own way so little that he actually condescend to go and pump frank headley so he term it : but after all it be only like ask advice of a good man because he do not feel himself quite good enough to advise himself the curate be prepare to sally forth after he frugal dinner the morning he spend at the school or in parish secularity the afternoon till dusk be devote to visit the poor the night not to sleep but to reading and sermon writing thus by sit up till two in the morning and rise again at six for he private devotions before walk a mile and a half up to church for the morning service frank headley burnt the candle of life at both end very effectually and show that he do so by he pale cheek and red eye ah say tom as he enter as usual : poor nature be be rob and murder by rich grace what do you mean now ask frank smile for he have become accustomed enough to tom 's quaint parable though he have to scold he often enough for they irreverence nature say ` after dinner sit awhile ' and even the dumb animal hear she voice and lie by for a siesta when they stomach be full grace say ` jump up and rush out the moment you have swallow you food and if you get a indigestion abuse poor nature for it and lay the blame on adam 's fall ' you be irreverent my good sir as usual but you be unjust also this time how then unjust to grace as you phrase it answer frank with a quaint sad smile i assure you on my honor that grace have nothing whatsoever to do with my ` rush out ' just now but simply the desire to do my good work that they may be see of man i hate go out i should like to sit and read the whole afternoon : but i be afraid lest the dissenter should say ` he have not be to see so-and-so for the last three day ' so off i go and no credit to I why have frank dared upon a month 's acquaintance to lay bare he own heart thus to a man of no creed at all because i suppose amid all difference he have find one point of likeness between himself and thurnall he have find that tom at heart be a truly genuine man sincere and faithful to he own scheme of the universe how that man through all he eventful life have be enable to bate not a jot of heart or hope but steer right onward be a problem which frank longed curiously and yet fearfully withal to solve there be many quality in he which frank could not but admire and long to imitate and whence have they come be another problem at which he look tremble as many a new thought cross he he long too to learn from tom somewhat at least of that savoir faire that power of become all thing to all man which st paul have and for want of which frank have fail he see too with surprise that tom have gain in one month more real insight into the character of he parishioner than he have do in twelve and besides all there be the craving of the lonely heart for human confidence and friendship so it befall that frank speak out he inmost thought that day and think no shame and it befall also that thurnall when he hear it say in he heart -- what a noble honest fellow you be when you -- but he answer enigmatically oh i quite agree with you that grace have nothing to do with it i only refer it to that source because i think you would do so you ought to be ashamed of you dishonesty then i know it but my view of the case be that you rush out after dinner for the very same reason that the yankee storekeeper do -- from -- you 'll forgive I if i say it of course you can not speak too plainly to I conceit the yankee fancy himself such a important person that the commercial world will stand still unless he fly back to its help after ten minute ' gobble with he month full of pork and pickle peach and you fancy yourself so important in you line that the spiritual world will stand still unless you bolt back to help it in like wise substitute a half-cooked mutton chop for the pork and the case be exact parallel you parallel do not hold good doctor the yankee go back to he store to earn money for himself and not to keep commerce alive while you go for utterly disinterested motive -- i see do you say frank if you think that i fancy myself a better man than the yankee you mistake I : but at least you will confess that i be not work for money no you have you notion of reward and he have he he want to be pay by material dollar payable next month you by spiritual dollar payable when you die i do not see the great difference only the slight difference between what be material and what be spiritual they seem to I from all i can hear in pulpit to be only two different sort of pleasant thing and to be seek after both alike simply because they be pleasant self-interest if you will forgive I seem to I the spring of both : only to do you justice you be a farther-sighted and more prudent man than the yankee storekeeper and have more exquisitely develop notion of what you true self-interest be be content to wait a little longer than he you stab with a jest thurnall you little know how you word hit home well then to turn from a matter of which i know nothing -- i must keep you in and give you parish business to do at home i be come to consult you as my spiritual pastor and master frank look a little astonished do not be alarm i be not go to confess my own sin -- only other people 's pray do not then i know far more of they already than i can cure i be wear out with the daily discovery of fresh evil wherever i go then why not comfort yourself by try to find a little fresh good wherever you go frank sigh perhaps though you do not care for any sort of good except you own sort of good you be fastidious well you have you excuse but you can understand a poor fellow like I who have be drag through the slum and sewer of this wicked world for fifteen year and more be very well content with any sort of good which i can light on and not particular as to either quantity or quality perhaps yours be the healthier state of mind if you can only find the say good the vulturine nose which smell nothing but corruption be no credit to its possessor and it would be pleasant at least to find good in every man one can not do that in one 's study mix with they be the only plan no doubt they be inconsistent enough the more you see of they the less you trust they and yet the more you see of they the more you like they can you solve that paradox from you book i will try say frank i generally have more than one to think over when you go but surely there be man so fall that they be utterly insensible to good very likely there be no say in this world what may not be only i never see one i 'll tell you a story : you may apply it as you like when i be on the texan expedition and raw to soldier and camp we have to sleep in low ground and suffer terribly from a miasma deadly cold it be when it come and the man who once get chill through with it just die i be lie on the bare ground one night and chilly enough i be -- for i be short of clothes and have lose my buffalo robe -- but fall asleep : and on wake the next morning i find myself cover up in my comrade 's blanket even to he coat while he be sit shiver in he shirt sleeve the cold fog have come down in the night and the man have strip himself and sit all night with death stare he in the face to save my life and all the reason he give be that if one of we must die it be better the older should go first and not a youngster like I and say tom lower he voice that man be a murderer a murderer yes a drunken gambling cut-throat rowdy as ever grow ripe for the gallows now will you tell I that there be nothing in that man but what the devil put there frank sit meditate awhile on this strange story which be moreover a true one and then look up with something like tear in he eye and he do not die not he i see he die afterwards -- shoot through the heart without time even to cry out but i have not forget what he do for I that night and i 'll tell you what sir i do not believe that god have forget it either frank be silent for a few moment and then tom change the subject i want to know what you can tell I about this mr vavasor hardly anything i be sorry to say i be at he house at tea two or three time when i first come and i have very agreeable evening and talk on art and poetry : but i believe i offend he by hint that he ought to come to church which he never do and since then we acquaintance have all but cease i suppose you will say as usual that i play my card badly there also not at all say tom who be dispose to take any one 's part against elsley if a clergyman have not a right to tell a man that i do not see what right he have of any kind only add he with one of he quaint smile the clergyman if he compel a man to deal at he store be bind to furnish he with the article which he want which he need or which he like for ` want ' have both these meaning with something that he find by experience do he good and so learn to like it because he know that he need it as my patient do my physic i wish my patient would do so by mine : but unfortunately half of they seem to I not to know what they disease be and the other half do not think they be diseased at all well say tom drily perhaps some of they be more right than you fancy every man know he own business best if it be so they would go about it somewhat differently from what most of the poor creature do do you think so i fancy myself that not one of they do a wrong thing but what he know it to be wrong just as well as you do and be much more ashamed and frightened about it already than you can ever make he by preach at he do you i do i judge of other by myself then would you have a clergyman never warn he people of they sin if i be he i would much sooner take the sin for grant and say to they ` now my friend i know you be all ninety-nine out of the hundred of you not such bad fellow at bottom and would all like to be good if you only know how so i 'll tell you as far as i know though i do not know much about the matter for the truth be you must have a hundred trouble every day which i never feel in my life and it must be a very hard thing to keep body and soul together and to get a little pleasure on this side the grave without make blackguard of yourselve therefore i do not pretend to set myself up as a better or a wiser man than you at all : but i do know a thing or two which i fancy may be useful to you you can but try it so come up if you like any of you and talk matter over with I as between gentleman and gentleman i shall keep you secret of course and if you find i can not cure you complaint why you can but go away and try elsewhere ' and so the doctor 's model sermon end in propose private confession of course the thing itself which will do they good without the red rag of a official name which send they cackle off like frightened turkey -- such private confession as be go on between you and I now here be i confess to you all my unorthodoxy and i my ignorance say frank for i really believe you know more about the matter than i do not at all i may be all wrong but the fault of you cloth seem to I to be that they apply they medicine without deign most of they to take the least diagnosis of the case how could i cure a man without first examine what be the matter with he so say the old casuist of whom i have read enough -- some would say too much but they do not satisfy I they deal with action and motive and so forth but they do not go down to the one root of wrong which be the same in every man you be get beyond I : but why do you not apply a little of the worldly wisdom which these same casuist teach you to tell you the truth i have try in past year and find that the medicine would not act humph well that would depend again on the previous diagnosis of human nature be correct and those old monk i should say would know about as much of human nature as so many daw in a steeple still you would not say that what be the matter with old heale be the matter also with vavasor i believe from my heart that it be humph then you know the symptom of he complaint i know that he never come to church nothing more i be really speak in confidence you surely have hear of disagreement between he and mr vavasor never i assure you you shock I i be exceedingly sorry then that i say a word about it : but the whole parish talk of it answer tom who be surprise at this fresh proof of the little confidence which aberalva put in they parson ah say frank sadly i be the last person in the parish to hear any news : but this be very distressing very to I my honor to tell you the truth as a medical man be concern in the matter for she be grow quite ill from unhappiness and i can not cure she so i come to you as soul-doctor to do what i the body-doctor can not frank sit ponder for a minute and then -- you set I on a task for which i be as little fit as any man by you own show what do i know of disagreement between man and wife and one have a delicacy about offer she comfort she must bestow she confidence on I before i can use it : while he -- while he as the cause of the disease be what you ought to treat and not she unhappiness which be only a symptom of it speak like a wise doctor but to tell you the truth thurnall i have no influence over mr vavasor and see no means of get any if he recognize my authority as he parish priest then i should see my way let he be as bad as he might i should have a fixed point from which to work but with he free-thinking notion i know well -- one can judge it too easily from he poem -- he would look on I as a pedant assume a spiritual tyranny to which i have no claim tom sit awhile nurse he knee and then -- if you see a man fall into the water what do you think would be the shortest way to prove to he that you have authority from heaven to pull he out do you give it up pull he out would it not be without more ado i should be happy enough to pull poor vavasor out if he would let I but till he believe that i can do it how can i even begin how can you expect he to believe if he have no proof there be proof enough in the bible and elsewhere if he will but accept they if he refuse to examine into the credentials the fault be he not mine i really do not wish to be hard but would not you do the same if any one refuse to employ you because he choose to deny that you be a legally qualify practitioner not so badly put but what should i do in that case go on quietly cure he neighbor till he begin to alter he mind as to my qualification and come in to be cure himself but here be this difference between you and I i be not bind to attend to any one who do not send for I while you think that you be and carry the notion a little too far for i expect you to kill yourself by it some day well say frank with something of that lazy oxford tone which be intend to save the speaker the trouble of give he argument when he have already make up he mind or think that he have so do well if i think myself bind to doctor the man willy-nilly as you do i would certainly go to he and show he at least that i understand he complaint that would be the first step towards he let I cure he how else on earth do you fancy that paul cure those corinthian about whom i have be read lately be you too go to quote scripture against I i be glad to find that you study extend to st paul to tell you the truth you sermon last Sunday puzzle I i could not comprehend -lrb- on you showing -rrb- how paul get that wonderful influence over those pagan which he evidently have and as how to get influence be a very favorite study of mine i borrow the book when i go home and read for myself and the matter at last seem clear enough on paul 's own show i do not doubt that : but i suspect you interpretation of the fact and mine would not agree mine be simple enough he say that what prove he to be a apostle be he power he be continually appeal to he power and what can he mean by that but that he could do and have do what he profess to do he promise to make those poor heathen rascal of greek better and wiser and happier man and i suppose he make they so and then there be no doubt of he commission or he authority or anything else he say himself he do not require any credentials for they be he credentials read and know of every one he have make good man of they out of bad one and that be proof enough whose apostle he be well say frank half sadly i might say a great deal of course on the other side of the question but i prefer hear what you laymen think about it all will you be angry if i tell you honestly do you ever find I angry at anything you say no i will do you the justice to say that well what we laymen say be this if the parson have the authority of which they boast why do not they use it if they have commission to make bad people good they must have power too for he whose commission they claim be not likely i should suppose to set a man to do what he can not do and we can do it if people would but submit to we it all come round again to the same point so it do how to get they to listen i try to find out how paul achieve that first step and when i look he tell I plainly enough by become all thing to all man by show these people that he understand they and know what be the matter with they now do you go and do likewise by vavasor and then exercise you authority like a practical man if you have power to bind and loose as you tell we last Sunday bind that fellow 's ungovernable temper and loose he from the real slavery which he be in to he miserable conceit and self-indulgence and then if he do not believe in you ` sacerdotal power ' he be even a greater fool than i take he for honestly i will try : god help I add frank in a lower voice but as for quarrel between man and wife as i tell you no one understand they less than i then marry a wife yourself and quarrel a little with she for experiment and then you 'll know all about it frank laugh in spite of himself thank you no man be less likely to try that experiment than i hum i have quite enough as a bachelor to distract I from my work without add to they those of a wife and family and those little home lesson in the frailty of human nature in which you advise I to copy mr vavasor and so say tom have to doctor human being nineteen-twentieth of whom be marry and be aware that three part of the misery of human life come either from want to be marry or from married care and trouble -- you think that you will improve you chance of doctoring you flock rightly by avoid carefully the least practical acquaintance with the chief cause of they disease philosophical and logical truly you seem to have acquire a little knowledge of man and woman my good friend without encumber yourself with a wife and child would you like to go to the same school to which i go asked thurnall with a look of such grave meaning that frank 's pure spirit shudder within he and i 'll tell you this whenever i see a woman nursing she baby or a father with he child upon he knee i say to myself -- they know more at this minute of human nature as of the great law of ` c'est l'amour l'amour l'amour which make the world go round ' than i be likely to do for many a day i 'll tell you what sir these simple natural tie which be common to we and the dumb animal -- as i live sir they be the divinest thing i see in the world i have but one and that be love to my poor old father that be all the religion i have as yet : but i tell you it alone have keep I from be a ruffian and a blackguard and i 'll tell you more say tom warming of all diabolical dodge for prevent the parson from see who they be or what human being be or what they work in the world be or anything else the neatest be that celibacy of the clergy i should like to have you with I in spanish america or in france either and see what you think of it then how it ever come into mortal brain be to I the puzzle i have often fancy when i have watch those priest -- and very good fellow too some of they be -- that there must be a devil after all abroad in the world as you say for no human insanity could ever have hit upon so complete and ` cute a device for make parson do the more harm the more good they try to do there i have preach you a sermon and make you angry not in the least : but i must go now and see some sick well go and prosper only recollect that the say sick be man and woman and away tom go think to himself : well that be a noble straightforward honest fellow and will do yet if he 'll only get a wife he be not one of those ass who have make up they mind by book that the world be square and will not believe it to be round for any ocular demonstration he 'll find out what shape the world be before long and behave as such and act accordingly little do tom think as he go home that day in full-blown satisfaction with he sermon to frank of the misery he have cause and be go to cause for many a day to poor grace harvey it be a rude shock to she to find herself thus suspect though perhaps it be one which she need she have never since one first trouble ten year ago know any real grief and have therefore have all the more time to make a luxury of unreal one she be treat by the simple folk around she as all but inspire and be possess of real power as miraculous in she own eye as those which be imputed to she be in theirs -lrb- for what be real spiritual experience but daily miracle -rrb- she be just in that temper of mind in which she require as ballast all she real goodness lest the moral balance should topple headlong after the intellectual and the downward course of vanity excitement deception blasphemous assumption be enter on happy for she that she be in protestant and common-sense england and in a country parish where mesmerism and spirit-rapping be unknown have she be a american she might have become one of the most lucrative medium have she be bear in a romish country she would have probably become a even more famous personage there be no reason why she should not have equal or surpass the ecstasy of st theresa or of st hildegardi or any other sweet dreamer of sweet dream have found a new order of charity have enrich the clergy of a whole province and have die in seven year madden by alternate paroxysm of self-conceit and revulsion of self-abasement she own preacher and class-leader indeed -lrb- so do extreme meet -rrb- would not have be sorry to make use of she in somewhat the same manner however feebly and coarsely : but she innate self-respect and modesty have preserve she from the snare of such clumsy poacher and more than one good-looking young preacher have flee desperately from a station where instead of make a tool of grace harvey he could only madden he own foolish heart with love for she so grace have reign upon she pretty little throne of not unbearable sorrow till a real and bitter woe come one which could not be hug and cherish like the rest one which she try to fling from she angrily scornfully and find to she horror that instead of she possess it it possess she and coil itself round she heart and would not be fling away she -- she of all being to be suspect as a thief and by the very man whose life she have save she be willing enough to confess herself -- and confess herself night and morning -- a miserable sinner and she heart a cage of unclean bird deceitful and desperately wicked -- except in that the conscious innocence flash up in pride and scorn in thought even when she be alone in word of which she would not have believe herself capable with hot brow and dry eye she pace she little chamber sit down on the bed stare into vacancy spring up and pace again : but she go into no trance -- she dare not the grief be too great she feel that if she once give way enough to lose she self-possession she should go mad and the first and perhaps not the least good effect of that fiery trial be that it compel she to a stern self-restraint to which she will weaken by mental luxuriousness have be long a stranger but a fiery trial it be the first wild -lrb- and yet not unnatural -rrb- fancy that heaven have give thurnall to she have deepen day by day by the mere indulgence of it but she never dream of he as she husband : only as a friendless stranger to be help and comfort and that he be worthy of help that some great future be in store for he that he be a choose vessel mark out for glory she have persuade herself utterly and the persuasion grow in she day by day as she hear more and more of he cleverness honesty and kindliness mysterious and to she miraculous learning therefore she do not make haste she do not even try to see he or to speak to he a civil bow in pass be all that she take or give and she be content with that and wait till the time come when she be destine to do for he -- what she know not but it would be do if she be strong enough so she set herself to learn and read and train she mind and temper more earnestly than ever and wait in patience for god 's good time and now behold a black unfathomable gulf of doubt and shame have open between they perhaps for ever and a tumult arise in she soul which can not be perhaps ought not to be analyze in word but which make she know too well by she own crimson cheek that it be none other than human love strong as death and jealousy cruel as the grave at last long and agonising prayer bring gentler thought and mere physical exhaustion a calmer mood how wicked she have be how rebellious why not forgive he as one greater than she have forgive it be ungrateful of he but be he not human why should she expect he heart to be better than hers besides he might have excuse for he suspicion he might be the best judge be a man and such a clever one too yes it be god 's cross and she would bear it she would try and forget he no that be impossible she must hear of he if not see he day by day : besides be not she fate link up with he and yet shut out from he by that dark wall of suspicion it be very bitter but she could pray for he she would pray for he now yes it be god 's cross and she would bear it he would right she if he think fit and if not what matter be she not bear to sorrow should she complain if another drop and that the bitterest of all be add to the cup and bear she cross she do about with she come in and go out for many a weary day there be no change in she habit or demeanor she be never listless for a moment in she school she be more gay and amusing than ever when she gather she little one around she for a story : but still there be the unseen burden grind she heart slowly till she feel as if every footstep be stain with a drop of she heart 's blood why not it would be the sooner over then at time come that strange woman 's pleasure in martyrdom the secret pride of suffer unjustly : but even that after a while she cast away from she as a snare and try to believe that she deserve all she sorrow -- deserve it that be in the real honest sense of the word that she have work it out and earn it and bring it on herself -- how she know not but long and strive to know no it be no martyrdom she would not allow herself so silly a cloak of pride and she go daily to she favorite book of martyr to contemplate there the story of those who really innocent really suffer for welldoing and out of that book she begin to draw a new and a strange enjoyment for she soon find that she intense imagination enable she to re-enact those sad and glorious story in she own person to tremble agonise and conquer with those heroine who have be for year she highest ideal -- and what higher one could she have and many a night after extinguish the light and close she eye she would lie motionless for hour on she little bed not to sleep but to feel with perpetua the wild bull 's horn to hang with st maura on the cross or lie with julitta on the rack or see with triumphant smile by anne askew 's side the fire flare up around she at the smithfield stake or to promise with die dorothea celestial rose to the mock youth whose face too often take the form of thurnall 's till every nerve quiver responsive to she fancy in agony of actual pain which die away at last into heavy slumber as body and mind alike give way before the strain sweet fool she know not -- how could she know -- that she might be rear in herself the seed of idiotcy and death : but who that applaud a rachel or a ristorus for be able to make awhile they soul and they countenance the home of the darkest passion can blame she for enact in herself and for herself alone incident in which the highest and holiest virtue take shape in perfect tragedy but soon another and a yet darker cause of sorrow arise in she it be clear from what willi have tell she that she have hold the lose belt in she hand the question be how have she lose it do she mother know anything about it that question could not but arise in she mind though for very reverence she dare not put it to she mother and with it arise the recollection of she mother 's strange silence about the matter why have she put away the subject carelessly and yet peevishly when it be mention yes why do she mother know anything be she -- grace dare not pronounce the adjective even in think dash it away as a temptation of the devil dash away too the thought which have force itself on she too often already that she mother be not altogether one who possess the single eye that in spite of she deep religious feeling she assurance of salvation she fit of bitter self-humiliation and despondency there be a inclination to scheming and intrigue ambition covetousness that the secret which she gain as class-leader too be too often -lrb- grace could but fear -rrb- use to she own advantage that in she dealings she morality be not above the average of little country shopkeeper that she be apt to have two price to keep she book with unnecessary carelessness when the person against whom the account stand be no scholar grace have more than once remonstrate in she gentle way and have be silence rather than satisfy by she mother 's commonplace as to the right of make those who could pay pay for those who could not that it be very hard to get a living and the lord know she temptation and that god see no sin in he elect and christ 's merit be infinite and christian always have be a backsliding generation and all the other commonplace by which such people drug they conscience to a degree which be utterly incredible except to those who have see it with they own eye and hear it with they own ear from childhood once too in those very day some little meanness on she mother 's part bring the tear into grace 's eye and a gentle rebuke to she lip : but she mother bear the interference less patiently than usual and answer not by cant but by counter-reproach be she the person to accuse a poor widow mother struggle to leave she child something to keep she out of the workhouse a mother that live for she would die for she sell she soul for she perhaps -- and there mr harvey stop short turn pale and burst into such a agony of tear that grace terrify throw she arm round she neck and entreated forgiveness all the more intensely on account of those thought within which she dare not reveal so the storm pass over but not grace 's sadness for she could not but see with she clear pure spiritual eye that she mother be just in that state in which some fearful and shameful fall be possible perhaps wholesome she would sell she soul for I what if she have sell it and stop short just now because she have not the heart to tell I that love for I have be the cause oh if she have sin for my sake wretch that i be miserable myself and bring misery with I why be i ever bear why can not i die -- and the world be rid of I no she would not believe it it be a wicked horrible temptation of the devil she would rather believe that she herself have be the thief tempt during she unconsciousness that she have hide it somewhere that she should recollect confess restore all some day she would carry it to he herself grovel at he foot and entreat forgiveness he will surely forgive when he find that i be not myself when -- that it be not altogether my fault -- not as if i have be wake -- yes he will forgive and then on that thought follow a dream of what might follow so wild that a moment after she have hide she blush in she hand and flee to book to escape from thought chapter xi the first instalment of a old debt we must now return to elsley who have walk home in a state of mind truly pitiable he have be flattering he soul with the hope that thurnall do not know he that he beard and the change which year have make form a sufficient disguise : but he could not conceal from himself that the very same alteration have not prevent he recognize thurnall and he have be live for two month past in continual fear that that would come which now have come he rage and terror know no bound fancy thurnall a merely mean and self-interested worldling untouched by those higher aspiration which stand to he in place of a religion he imagine he make every possible use of he power and long to escape to the uttermost end of the earth from he old tormentor whom the very sea would not put out of the way but must need cast ashore at he very foot to plague he afresh what a net he have spread around he own foot by one act of foolish vanity he have take he present name merely as a _ nom de guerre _ when first he come to london as a penniless and friendless scribbler it would hide he from the ridicule -lrb- and as he fancy spite -rrb- of thurnall whom he dread meeting every time he walk london street and who be for year to he melancholic and too intense fancy he _ bête noir _ he frankenstein 's familiar beside he be ashamed of the name of brigg it certainly be not a euphonious or aristocratic name and the soul 's agony by john brigg would not have sound as well as the soul 's agony by elsley vavasor vavasor be a very pretty name and one of those which be suppose by novelist and young lady to be aristocratic -- why so be a puzzle as its plain meaning be a tenant-farmer and nothing more nor less so he have play with the name till he become fond of it and consider that he have a right to it through seven long year of weary struggle penury disappointment as he climb the parnassian mount write for magazine and newspaper subedit this periodical and that till he begin to be know as a ready graceful and trustworthy workman and be befriend by one kind-hearted _ littérateur _ after another for in london at this moment any young man of real power will find friend enough and too many among he fellow book-wright and be more likely to have he head turn by flattery than he heart crush by envy of course whatsoever flattery he may receive he be expect to return and whatsoever clique he may be toss into on he _ début _ he be expect to stand by and fight for against the universe but that be but fair if a young gentleman invite to enrol himself in the mutual-puffery society which meet every Monday and Friday in hatchgoose the publisher 's drawing-room be willing to pledge himself thereto in the mystic cup of tea be he not as solemnly bind thenceforth to support those literary catiline in they effort for the subversion of common sense good taste and established thing in general as if he have pledge they as he would have do in rome of old in he own life-blood bind he be alike by honor and by green tea and it will be better for he to fulfil he bond for if association be the cardinal principle of the age will it not work as well in book-making as in clothes-making and shall not the motto of the poet -lrb- who will also do a little review on the sly -rrb- be henceforth that which shine triumphant over all the world on many a valiant scotchman 's shield -- caw I and i 'll caw thee but to do john brigg justice he keep he hand and he heart also cleaner than most man do during this stage of he career after the first excitement of novelty and of mix with people who could really talk and think and who freely speak out whatever be in they right or wrong in language which at least sound grand and deep he begin to find in the literary world about the same satisfaction for he inner life which he would have find in the sport world or the commercial world or the religious world or the fashionable world or any other world and to suspect strongly that wheresoever a world be the flesh and the devil be not very far off tire of talk when he want to think of assert when he want to discover and of hear he neighbor do the same tired of little meanness envying intrigue jobbery -lrb- for the literary world too have its job -rrb- he have be for some time withdraw himself from the hatchgoose soirées into he own thought when he soul 's agony appear and he find himself if not a lion at least a lion 's cub there be a house or two in town where you may meet on certain evening everybody where duchess and unfledged poet bishop and red republican refugee fox-hunting nobleman and briefless barrister who have take to politics be jumble together for a couple of hour to make what they can out of each other to the exceed benefit of they all for each and every one of they find he neighbor a pleasanter person than he expect and none need leave those room without know something more than he do when he come in and take a interest in some human being who may need that interest to one of these house no matter which elsley be invite on the strength of the soul 's agony find himself for the first time face to face with high-bred englishwoman and fancy -- small blame to he -- that he be come to the mountain of the peri and to fairy land itself he have be flatter already : but never with such grace such sympathy or such seeming understanding for there be few high-bred woman who can not seem to understand and delude a hapless genius into a belief in they own surpassing brilliance and penetration while they be cunningly retail again to he the thought which they have catch up from the man to whom they speak last perhaps -- for this be the very triumph of they art -- from the very man to whom they be speak small blame to bashful clumsy john brigg if he do not know he own child and could not recognize he own stammer and fragmentary fancy when they be re-echoed to he the next minute in the prettiest shape and with the most delicate articulation from lip which -lrb- like those in the fairy tale -rrb- never open without drop pearl and diamond oh what a contrast in the eye of a man whose sense of beauty and grace whether physical or intellectual be true and deep to that ghastly ring of prophetess in the hatchgoose drawing-room strong-minded and emancipated woman who pride themselves on have cast off conventionality and on be rude and awkward and dogmatic and irreverent and sometimes slightly improper woman who have mission to mend everything in heaven and earth except themselves who have quarrel with they husband and have therefore feel a mission to assert woman 's rights and reform marriage in general or who have never be able to get marry at all and therefore be especially competent to promulgate a model method of educate the child whom they never have have woman who write poetry about lady blanch whom they never have meet and novel about male and female blackguard whom -lrb- one hope -rrb- they never have meet or about whom -lrb- if they have -rrb- decent woman would have hold they peace and every one of whom have in obedience to emerson follow she impulse and despise fashion and be accordingly clothe and bedizen as be right in the sight of she own eye and probably in those of no one else no wonder that elsley ere long begin draw comparison and use he wit upon ancient patroness of course behind they back liken they to idol fresh from the car of juggernaut or from the stern of a south sea canoe or most of all to that famous wooden image of freya which once leap lumbering forth from she bullock-cart creaking and rattle in every oaken joint to belabor the too daring vike who be flirt with she priestess even so whisper elsley do those brain and tongue creak and rattle lumber before the blast of pythonic inspiration and so he verily believe would the awkward arm and leg have do likewise if one of the pythoness have ever so far degrade herself as to dance no wonder then that those gifted dame have soon to complain of elsley vavasor as a traitor to the cause of progress and civilisation a renegade who have flee to the camp of aristocracy flunkeydom obscurantism frivolity and dissipation though there be not one of they but would have give a eye -- perhaps no great loss to the aggregate loveliness of the universe -- for one of he invitation to 999 cavendish street south-east with the chance of be present to the duchess of lyonesse to do elsley justice one reason why he like he new acquaintance so well be that they like he he behave well himself and therefore people behave well to he he be as i have say a very handsome fellow in he way therefore it be easy to he as it be to all physically beautiful person to acquire a graceful manner moreover he have steep he whole soul in old poetry and especially in spenser 's faery queen good for he have he follow every lesson which he might have learn out of that most noble of english book : but one lesson at least he learn from it and that be to be chivalrous tender and courteous to all woman however old or ugly simply because they be woman the hatchgoose pythoness do not wish to be woman but very bad imitation of man and therefore he consider himself absolve from all knightly duty toward they : but toward these peri of the west and to the dowager who have be peri in they time what adoration could be too great so he bow down and worship and on the whole he be quite right in so do moreover he have the good sense to discover that though the young peri be the prettiest to look at the elder peri be the better company and that it be in general from married woman that a poet or any one else will ever learn what woman 's heart be like and so well do he carry out he creed that before he first summer be over he have quite captivate the heart of old lady knockdown aunt to lucia st just and wife to lucium 's guardian a charming old irishwoman who affect a pretty brogue perhaps for the same reason that she wear a wig and who have be in she day a beauty and a blue a friend of the miss berry and tommy moore and grattan and lord edward fitzgerald and dan o'connell and all other lion and lioness which have roar for the last sixty year about the emerald isle there be no one whom she do not know and nothing she could not talk about marry up when a girl to a man for whom she do not care and have no child she have indemnify herself by many flirtation and the writing of two or three novel in which she pen on paper the superfluous feeling which have no vent in real life she have desert as she grow old the novel for unfulfilled prophecy and be a distinguished leader in a distinguished religious coterie : but she still pride herself upon have a green head upon gray shoulder and not without reason for underneath all the worldliness and intrigue and petty affectation of girlishness which she contrived to jumble in with she religiosity beat a young and kindly heart so she be charm with mr vavasor 's manners and commend they much to lucium who a shrink girl of seventeen be peep at she first season from under lady knockdown 's shelter wing I dear let mr vavasor be who he will he have not only the intellect of a true genius but what be a great deal better for practical purpose that be the manners of one give I the man who will let a woman of we rank say what we like to he without suppose that he may say what he like in return and consider one 's familiarity as a honor and not as a excuse for take liberty a most agreeable contrast indeed to the young man of the present day who come in they shooting jacket and talk slang to they partner -- though really the girl be just as bad -- and stand with they back to the fire and smell of smoke and go to sleep after dinner and pay no respect to old age nor to youth either i think ` pon I word lucia the answer i have hear young gentleman make to young lady this very season -- they would have be call out the next morning in my time I dear as for the age of chivalry nobody expect that to be restore : but really one might have be spare the substitute for it which we have when i be young in the grand air of the old school it be a ` sham ' i daresay as they call everything now-a-day : but really I dear a pleasant sham be better to live with than a unpleasant reality especially when it smell of cigar so it befall that elsley vavasor be ask to lady knockdown 's and that there he fall in love with lucium and lucium fall in love with he the next winter old lord knockdown who have be decrepit for some year past die and he widow whose income be under five hundred a year -- for the estate be entail and mortgage and everything else which can happen to a irish property -- come to live with she nephew lord scoutbush in eaton square and take such care as she could of lucium and valencium so after a dreary autumn and winter of parting and silence elsley find himself the next season invite to eaton square there the mischief if mischief it be be do and elsley and lucium start in life upon two hundred a year he have inherit some fifty of he own she have about a hundred and fifty which indeed be not yet she own by right but little scoutbush -lrb- who be she sole survive guardian -rrb- behave on the whole very well for a young gentleman of twenty-two in a state of fury and astonishment the old lord have wisely enough settle in he will that lucia be to enjoy the interest of she fortune from the time that she come out provide she do not marry without she guardian 's leave and scoutbush to avoid esclandre and misery think it as well to waive the proviso and pay she she dividend as usual but how have she contrived to marry at all without he leave that be a ugly question i will not say that she have tell a falsehood or that elsley have forswear himself when he get the licence : but certainly both of they be guilty of something very like a white lie when they declare that lucium have the consent of she sole survive guardian on the strength of a half-angry half-jesting expression of scoutbush 's that she might marry whom she choose provide she do not plague he in the first triumph of success and intoxication of wed bliss lucium have write he a saucy letter remind he of he permission and say that she have take he at he word : but she conscience smite she and elsley 's smite he likewise and smite he all the more because he have be marry under a false name a fact which might have ugly consequence in law which he do not like to contemplate to do he justice he have be half-a-dozen time during he courtship on the point of tell lucium he real name and history happy for he have he do so whatever might have be the consequence : but he want moral courage the hideous sound of brigg have become horrible to he and once he foolish heart be frighten away from honesty just as honesty be on the point of conquer by old lady knockdown 's say that she could never have marry a man with a ugly name or let lucium marry one conceive become mr natty bumppo I dear even for twenty thousand a year if you could summon up courage to do the deed i could not summon up courage to continue my correspondence with ye elsley know that that be a lie that the old lady would have let she marry the most triumphant snob in england if he have half that income : but unfortunately lucium cap she aunt 's nonsense with there be no fear of my ever marry any one who have not a graceful name and a look at vavasor which say -- and you have one and therefore i -- for the matter have then be settle between they this be too much for he vanity and too much also for he fear of lose lucium by confess the truth so elsley go on ashamed of he real name ashamed of have conceal it ashamed of be afraid that it would be discover -- in a triple complication of shame which make he gradually as it make every man moody suspicious apt to take offence where none be mean besides they be very poor he though neither extravagant nor profligate be like most literary man who be accustom to live from hand to mouth careless self-indulgent unmethodical she know as much of housekeeping as the queen of oude do and she charming little dream of shopping for herself be rudely enough broken ere the first week be out by the horrify look of clara when she return from she first morning 's marketing for the weekly consumption with nothing but a woodcock some truffle and a bunch of celery then the landlady of the lodgings rob she even under the nose of the faithful clara who know as little about housekeeping as she mistress and clara faithful as she be repay herself by grumble and take liberty for be degrade from the luxurious post of lady 's maid to that of servant of all work with a landlady and marchioness to wrestle with all day long then what with imprudence and anxiety lucium of course lose she first child : and after that come month of illness during which elsley tend she it must be say for he as lovingly as a mother and perhaps they be both really happier during that time of sorrow than they have be in all the delirious bliss of the honeymoon valencium meanwhile defy old lady knockdown -lrb- whose horror and wrath know no bound -rrb- and walk off one morning with she maid to see she prodigal sister a visit which not only bring comfort to the weary heart but important practical benefit for go home she seize upon scoutbush and so move he heart with pathetic picture of lucium 's unheard-of penury and misery that he heart be soften and though he absolutely refuse to call on vavasor he make he a offer through lucium of penalva court for the time be and thither they go -- perhaps the best thing they could have do there of course they be somewhat more comfortable a very cheap country a comfortable house rent free and a lovely neighborhood be a pleasant change after dear london lodgings : but it be a question whether the change make elsley a better man in the first place he become a more idle man the rich enervating climate begin to tell upon he mind as it do upon lucium 's health he miss that perpetual spur of nervous excitement change of society influx of ever-fresh object which make london after all the best place in the world for hard working and which make even a walk along the street a intellectual tonic in the soft and luxurious west country nature invite he to look at she and dream and dream he do more and more day by day he be tire too -- as who would not be -- of the drudgery of write for he daily bread and relieve from the importunity of publisher and printer ' - devil he send up fewer and fewer contribution to the magazine he would keep he energy for a great work poetry be after all he forte : he would not fritter himself away on prose and periodical but would win for himself etc etc if he make a mistake it be at least a pardonable one but elsley become not only a more idle but a more morose man he begin to feel the evil of solitude there be no one near with whom he could hold rational converse save a antiquarian parson or two and parson be not to he taste so never measure he wit against those of he peer and despise the few man whom he meet as inferior to himself he grow more and more wrapt up in he own thought and he own taste he own poem even to the slightest turn of expression become more and more important to he he grow more jealous of criticism more confident in he own little theory about this and that more careless of the opinion of he fellowman and as a certain consequence more unable to bear the little cross and contradiction of daily life and as lucium have bring one and another child safely into the world settle down into motherhood he become less and less attentive to she and more and more attentive to that self which be fast become the center of he universe true there be excuse for he for whom be there none he be poor and struggle and it be much more difficult -lrb- as becky sharp i think pathetically observe -rrb- to be good when one be poor than when one be rich it be -lrb- and all rich people should consider the fact -rrb- much more easy if not to go to heaven at least to think one be go thither on three thousand a year than on three hundred not only be respectability more easy as be prove by the broad fact that it be the poor people who fill the gaol and not the rich one : but virtue and religion -- of the popular sort it be undeniably more easy to be resign to the will of heaven when that will seem tend just as we would have it much more easy to have faith in the goodness of providence when that goodness seem safe in one 's pocket in the form of bank-note and to believe that one 's child be under the protection of omnipotence when one can hire for they in half a hour the best medical advice in london one need only look into one 's own heart to understand the disciple ' astonishment at the news that how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven who then can be save ask they be poor man accustom to see the wealthy pharisee in possession of the highest religious privilege and means of grace who indeed if not the rich if the nobleman and the banker and the dowager and the young lady who go to church and read good book and have be supply from youth with the very best religious article which money can procure and have time for all manner of good work and give they hundred to charity and head reformatory movement and build church and work altar-cloth and can taste all the preacher and father-confessor round london one after another as you would taste wine till they find the spiritual panacea which exactly suit they complaint -- if they be not sure of salvation who can be save without further comment the fact be leave for the consideration of all reader only let they not be too hard upon elsley and lucium if finding themselves sometimes literally at they wit ' end they go beyond they poor wit into the region where foolish thing be say and do moreover elsley 's ill-temper -lrb- as well as lucium 's -rrb- have its excuse in physical ill-health poor fellow long year of sedentary work have begin to tell upon he and while tom thurnall 's chest under the influence of hard work and oxygen measure round perhaps six inch more than it have do sixteen year ago elsley 's thanks to stoop and carbonic acid measure six inch less short breath lassitude loss of appetite heartburn and all that fair company of misery which mr cockle and he antibilious pill profess to cure be no cheer bosom friend but when a man 's breast-bone be gradually grow into he stomach they will make they appearance and small blame to he whose temper suffer from they gentle hint that he have a mortal body as well as a immortal soul but most fret of all be the discovery that lucium know -- if not all about he original name -- still enough to keep he in dread lest she should learn more it be now twelve month and more that this new terror have leap up and stare in he face he have leave a letter about -- a thing which he be apt to do -- in which the whitbury lawyer make some allusion to he little property and he be sure that lucium have see it the hate name of brigg certainly she have not see for elsley have tear it out the moment he open the letter : but she have see enough as he soon find to be certain that he have at some time or other pass under a different name if lucium have be a more thoughtful or high-minded woman she would have go straight to she husband and quietly and lovingly ask he to tell she all : but in she left-handed irish fashion she keep the secret to herself and think it a very good joke to have he in she power and to be able to torment he about that letter when he get out of temper it never occur however to she that he present name be the feigned one she fancy that he have in some youthful escapade assume the name to which the lawyer allude so the next time he be cross she try laughingly the effect of she newly-discovered spell and be horror-struck at the storm which she evoke in a voice of thunder elsley command she never to mention the subject again and show such sign of terror and remorse that she obey he from that day forth except when now and then she lose she temper as completely too as he little she think in she heedlessness what a dark cloud of fear and suspicion ever deepen and spread she have put between he heart and hers but if elsley have dread she knowledge of he story he dread ten time more tom 's knowledge of it what if thurnall should tell lucium what if lucium should make a confidant of thurnall woman tell they doctor everything and lucium he know too well have cause to complain of he perhaps think he madden into wild suspicion by the sense of he own wrong-doing she might complain of he she might combine with thurnall against he -- for what purpose he know not : but the wildest imagination flash across he as he hurry desperately home intend as soon as he get there to forbid lucium 's ever call in he dreaded enemy no thurnall should never cross he door again on that one point he be determine but on nothing else however he intention be never fulfil for long before he reach home he begin to feel himself thoroughly ill he be a temperament upon which mental anxiety act rapidly and severely and the burning sun and he rapid walk combine with rage and terror to give he such a turn that as he hurry down the lane he find himself reel like a drunken man he have just time to hurry through the garden and into he study when pulse and sense fail he and he roll over on the sofa in a dead faint lucium have see he come in and hear he fall and rush in the poor little thing be at she wit ' end and think that he have have nothing less than a _ coup-de-soleil _ and when he recover from he faintness he begin to be so horribly ill that clara who have be call in to help have some grounds for the degrading hypothesis -lrb- for which lucia all but box she ear -rrb- that master have get away into the wood and go eating toadstool or some such poisonous stuff for he lay a full half-hour on the sofa death-cold and almost pulseless moan shudder hide he face in he hand and refuse cordial medicine and above all a doctor 's visit however this could not be allow to last without elsley 's knowledge a messenger be despatch for thurnall and luckily meet he in the lane for he be return to the town in the footstep of he victim elsley 's horror be complete when the door open and lucia bring in none other than he tormentor my dearest elsley i have send for mr thurnall i know you would not let I if i tell you but you see i have do it and now you must really speak to he elsley 's first impulse be to motion they both away angrily but the thought that he be in thurnall 's power stop he he must not show he disgust what if lucium be to ask its cause even to guess it for to he fear even that seem possible a fresh misery just because he shrink so intensely from the man he must endure he there be nothing the matter with I say he languidly i should be the best judge of that after what mr vavasor have just tell I say tom in he most professional and civil voice and slip catlike into a seat beside the unresisting poet he ask question on question : but elsley give such unsatisfactory answer that lucia have to detail everything afresh for he with -- you know mr thurnall he be always overtask he brain and will never confess himself ill -- and all a woman 's anxious comment rogue tom know all the while well enough what be the cause : but he see too that elsley be very ill he feel that he must have the matter out at once and by a side glance send the obedient lucium out of the room to get a table-spoonful of brandy now my dear sir that we be alone begin he blandly now sir answer vavasor spring off the sofa he whole pent-up wrath explode in hiss steam the moment the safety-valve be lift now sir what -- what be the meaning of this insolence this intrusion i beg you pardon mr vavasor answer tom rise in a tone of bland and stolid surprise what do you want here with you mummery and medicine when you know the cause of my malady well enough already go sir and leave I to myself my dear sir say tom firmly you seem to have forget what pass between we this morning will you insult I beyond endurance cry elsley i tell you that as long as you choose you be elsley vavasor and i the country doctor we have meet in that character why not sustain it you be really ill and if i know the cause i be all the more likely to know the cure cure why not believe I it be in you power to become a much happier man simply by become a healthier one impertinence pish what can i gain by be impertinent sir i know very well that you have receive a severe shock but i know equally well that if you be as you ought to be you would not feel it in this way when one see a man in the state of prostration in which you be common sense tell one that the body must have be neglect for the mind to gain such power over it elsley reply with a grunt but tom go on bland and imperturbable believe I it may be a very materialist view of thing : but fact be fact -- the _ corpus sanum _ be father to the _ men sana _ -- tonic and exercise make the ill of life look marvellously smaller you have the frame of a strong and active man and all you want to make you light-hearted and cheerful be to develop what nature have give you it be too late say elsley pleased as most man be by be tell that they might be strong and active not in the least three month would strengthen you muscle open you chest again settle you digestion and make you as fresh as a lark and able to sing like one believe I the poetry would be the better for it as well as the stomach now positively i shall begin question you so elsley be win to detail the symptom of internal _ malaise _ which he be only too much in the habit of watch himself but there be some among they which tom could not quite account for on the ground of mere effeminate habit a thought strike he you sleep ill i suppose say he carelessly very ill do you ever try opiate no -- yes -- that be sometimes ah say tom more carelessly still for he wish to hide by all mean the importance of the confession well they give relief for a time : but they be dangerous thing -- disorder the digestion and have they revenge on the nerve next morning as spitefully as brandy itself much better try a glass of strong ale or porter just before go to bed i have know it give sleep even in consumption -- try it and exercise you shoot no pity there ought to be noble cocking in these wood however the season 's past you fish no pity again i hear alva be full of trout why not try sailing nothing oxygenate the lung like a sail and you friend the fisherman would be delighted to have you as super-cargo they be always full of you story to they and you pick they brain for old legend and adventure they be noble fellow and i want no better company but unfortunately i be always sea-sick ah wholesome but unpleasant : you be fond of gardening very but stoop make my head swim true and i do not want you to stoop i hope to see you soon as erect as a guardsman why not try walk abominable bore -- lonely aimless -- well perhaps you be right i never know but three man who take long constitutional on principle and two of they be crack but why not try a companion and persuade that curate who need just the same medicine as you to accompany you i do not know a more gentleman-like agreeable well-informed man than he be thank you i can choose my acquaintance for myself you touchy ass say thurnall to himself if we be in the bless state of nature now would not i give you ten minute ' double thonging and then set you to work as the runaway nigger do he master bird o ' freedom sawin till you would learn a thing or two but blandly still he go on try the dumb-bell then nothing like they for open you chest and do get a high desk make and stand to you write instead of sit and tom actually make vavasor promise to do both and bid he farewell with -- now i 'll send you up a little tonic and trouble you with no more visit till you send for I i shall see by one glance at you face whether you be follow my prescription and i say i would not meddle with those opiate any more try good malt and hop instead those who drink beer think beer say elsley smile for he be get more hopeful of himself and he terror be vanish beneath tom 's skilful management and those who drink water think water the elizabethan -- sidney and shakspeare burleigh and queen bess work on beef and ale -- and you would not class they among the muddle-headed of the earth : believe I to write well you must live well if you take it out of you brain you must put it in again it be a question of fact try it for yourself and off tom go while lucium rush back to she husband cover he with caress assure he that he be seven time as ill as he really be and so nurse and pet he that he feel himself for that time at least a beast and a fool for have suspect she for a moment ah woman if you only know how you carry we heart in you hand and would but use you power for we benefit what angel you might make we all so say tom as he go home he have find he way to the elevation-bottle have he as well as mr heale it be no concern of mine : but as a professional man i must stop that you will certainly be no credit to I if you kill yourself under my hand tom go straight home show the blacksmith how to make a pair of dumb-bell cover they himself with leather and send they up the next morning with direction to be use for half a hour morning and evening and something -- whether it be the dumb-bell or the tonic or wholesome fear of the terrible doctor -- keep elsley for the next month in better spirit and temper than he have be in for a long while moreover tom set lucium to coax he into walk with headley she succeed at last and on the whole each of they soon find that he have something to learn from the other elsley improve daily in health and lucium write to valencia flaming account of the wonderful doctor who have be cast on shore in they world 's end and receive from she after a while this amid much more -- for fancy be not exuberant enough to reproduce the whole of a young lady 's letter -- i be so ashamed i ought to have tell you of that doctor a fortnight ago but rattle-pate as i be i forget all about it do you know he be sabina mellot 's dearest friend and she beg I to recommend he to you but i put it off and then it slip my memory like everything else good she have tell I the most wonderful story of he courage and goodness and conceive -- she and she husband be take prisoner with he by the savage in the south sea and go to be eat she say : but he help they to escape in a canoe -- such a story -- and live with they for three month on the most beautiful desert island -- it be all like a fairy tale i 'll tell it you when i come darling -- which i shall do in a fortnight and we shall be all so happy i have such a box ready for you and the chick which i shall bring with I and some pretty thing from scoutbush beside who be very low poor fellow i can not conceive what about : but wonderfully tender about you i fancy he must be in love for he stand up the other day about you to my aunt quite solemnly with ` let she alone my lady she be not the first whom love have make a fool of and she will not be the last : and i believe that some of the move which look most foolish turn out best after all live and let live everybody know he own business best anything be better than marriage without real affection ' conceive my astonishment at hear the dear little fellow turn sage in that way by the way i have have to quote he own advice against he for i have refuse lord chalkclere after all i tell he -lrb- c not s -rrb- that he be much too good for I : far too perfect and complete a person that i prefer a husband whom i could break in for myself even though he give I a little trouble scoutbush be cross at first but he say afterwards that it be just like baby blake -lrb- the wretch always call I baby blake now after that dreadful girl in lever 's novel -rrb- and i tell he frankly that it be if he mean that i have sooner break in a thorough-bred for myself even though i have a fall or two in the process than jog along on the most finish little pony on earth who would never go out of a amble lord chalk may be very finish and learn and excellent and so forth : but _ ma chère _ i want not a white rabbit -lrb- of which he always remind I -rrb- but a hero even though he be a naughty one i always fancy people must be very little if they can be finish off so rapidly if there be any real verve in they they would take somewhat longer to grow lord chalk would do very well to bind in russian leather and put on one 's library shelf to be consult when one forget a date but really even you ulyss of a doctor -- provide of course he turn out a prince in disguise and do not leave out he h 's -- would be more to the taste of you naughtiest of sister chapter xii a peer in trouble

she hand and shudder in every limb you know my story do i gain or lose by tell my claude all i will she cry look up pale but firm i will and she look steadfastly into the mirror over the chimney-piece as if try to court the reappearance of that ugly vision which haunt it and so to nerve herself to the utmost and face the whole truth in little more than a fortnight sabina and marie with maid and courier -lrb- for marie be rich now -rrb- be away in the old antwerpen and claude be roll down to southampton by rail with campbell scoutbush and last but not least the faithful bowie who have under he charge what he describe to the puzzle railway-guard as goad and cleik and pirn and creel and beuk and heuk enough for a ' the cod o ' neufundland chapter xiii l'homme incompri elsley go on between improved health and the fear of tom thurnall a good deal better for the next month he begin to look forward to valencium 's visit with equanimity and at last with interest and be rather pleased than otherwise when in the last week of July a fly drive up to the gate of old penalva court and he hand out therefrom valencium and valencium 's maid lucium have discover that the wind be east and that she be afraid to go to the gate for fear of catch cold she real purpose be that valencium should meet elsley first she be so impulsive think the good little creature always plot about she husband that she will rush upon I and never see he for the first five minute and elsley be so sensitive -- how can he be otherwise in he position poor dear so she refrain herself like joseph and stand at the door till valencium be half-way down the garden-walk have take elsley 's somewhat shyly-offered arm and then she could refrain herself no longer and the two woman run upon each other and kiss and sob and talk till lucium be out of breath but valencium be not so easily silence my darling and you be look so much better than i expect but not quite yourself yet that naughty baby be kill you i be sure and mr vavasor too i shall begin to call he elsley to-morrow if i like he as much as i do now -- but he be look quite thin -- wear himself out with write so many beautiful book -- that wreck be perfect and where be the child -- i must rush upstairs and devour they -- and what a delicious old garden and clipt yew too so dark and romantic and such dear old-fashioned flower -- mr vavasor must show I all over it and over that hang wood too what a duck of a place -- and oh my dear i be quite out of breath and so she sweep in with she arm round lucium 's waist while elsley stand look after she well enough satisfied with she reception of he and only hope that the stream of word would slaken after a while what a magnificent creature say he to himself who could believe that the three year would make such a change and he be right the tall lithe girl have bloom into full glory ' and valencium st just though not delicately beautiful be as splendid a irish damsel as man need look upon with a grand masque aquiline feature luxuriant black hair and -- though it be the fag-end of the london season -- the unrivalled irish complexion as of the fair dame of kilkenny whose lip be like rose she cheek be the same like a dish of fresh strawberry smother would in crame she figure be perhaps too tall and somewhat too stout also but its size be relieve by the delicacy of those hand and foot of which miss valencium be most pardonably proud and by that indescribable lissomeness and lazy grace which irishwoman inherit perhaps with they tinge of southern blood and when in half a hour she reappear with broad straw-hat and gown tuck up _ à la bergère _ over the striped welsh petticoat perhaps to show off the ankle which only look the finer for a pair of heavy lace boot elsley honestly feel it a pleasure to look at she and a still greater pleasure to talk to she and to be talk to by she while she bent on make herself agreeable partly from real good taste partly from natural good-nature and partly too because she see in he eye that he admire she chat sentiment about all heaven and earth for to miss valencium -- it be sad to have to say it -- admiration have be now for three year she daily bread she have live in the thickest whirl of the world and as most do for a while find it a very pleasant place she have flirt -- with how many must not be tell and perhaps with more than one with whom she have no business to flirt little scoutbush have remonstrate with she on some such affair but she have silence he with a irish jest -- you be a fisherman freddy and when you can not catch salmon you catch trout and when you can not catch trout you 'll whip on the shallow for poor little gubbahawn and say that it be all to keep you hand in -- and so do i the old lady say that this be the reason why she have not marry the man however assert that no one dare marry she and one club-oracle have give it as he opinion that no man in he rational sens be to be allow to have anything to do with she till she have be well jilt two or three time to take the spirit out of she : but that catastrophe have not yet occur and miss valencium still reign triumphant and alone though she aunt old lady knockdown move all the earth and some dirty place too below the earth to get the wild irish girl off she hand for quoth she i feel with valencium indeed just like one of those man who carry about little dog in the quadrant i always pity the poor man so and think how happy they must be when they have sell one it be one chance less you know of have it bite they horribly and then run away after all there be however no more real harm in valencium than there be in every child of adam town frivolity have not corrupt she she be giddy give up to enjoyment of the present : but there be not a touch of meanness about she : and if she be selfish as every one must need be whose thought be of pleasure admiration and success she be so unintentionally and she would have be shock and pained at be tell that she be anything but the most kind-hearted and generous creature on earth major campbell who be she mentor as well as she brother 's have certainly tell she so more than once at which she have pout a good deal and cry a little and promise to amend then pack up a heap of cast-off thing to send to lucia -- half of it much too fine to be of any use to the quiet little woman and lastly go out and buy fresh finery for herself and forget all she good resolution whereby it befall that she be tolerably deep in debt at the end of every season and have to torment and kiss scoutbush into pay she bill which he do like a good brother and often before he have pay he own but howsoever full valencium 's head may have be of fine garment and london flirtation she have too much tact and good feeling to talk that evening of a world of which even elsley know more than she sister for poor lucium have be but eighteen at the time of she escapade and have not be present twelve month so that she be as inexperienced as any one can be who have only a husband three child and a household to manage on less than three hundred a year therefore valencium talk only of thing which would interest elsley ask he to read he last new poem -- which i need not say he do tell he how she devour everything he write plan walk with he in the country seem to consult he pleasure in every way to-morrow morning i shall sit with you and the child lucia of course i must not interrupt mr vavasor : but really in the afternoon i must ask he to spare a couple of hour from the muse vavasor be delighted to do anything -- where would she walk where of course to see the beautiful schoolmistress who save the man from drown and then to see the chasm across which he be sweep i shall understand you poem so much better you know if i can but realize the people and the place and you must take I to see captain willi too and even the lieutenant -- if he do not smell too much of brandy i will be so gracious and civil quite the lady of the castle you will make quite a royal progress say lucium look at she with sisterly admiration yes i intend to usurp as many of scoutbush 's honor as i can till he come i must lay down the sceptre in a fortnight you know so i shall make as much use of it as i can meanwhile and so on and so on mean all the while to put elsley quite at he ease and let he understand that bygones be bygones and that with she any reconciliation at all be mean to be a complete one which be wise and right enough but valencium have not count on the excitable and vain nature with which she be deal and lucium who have she own fear from the first evening be the last person in the world to tell she of it first from pride in herself and then from pride in she husband for even if a woman have make a foolish match it be hard to expect she to confess as much : and after all a husband be a husband and let he fault be what they might he be still she elsley she idol once and perhaps -lrb- so she hope -rrb- she idol again hereafter and if not still he be she husband and that be enough by which you mean sir that she consider herself bind to endure everything and anything from he simply because she have be marry to he in church yes and a great deal more not merely be marry in church but what be marry in church mean and what every woman who be a woman understand and live up to without flinch though she die a martyr for it or a confessor a far higher saint if the truth be know as it will be some day than all the holy virgin who ever fast and pray in a convent since the day when macarius first turn fakeer for to a true woman the mere fact of a man 's be she husband put it on the lowest ground that you choose be utterly sacred divine all-powerful in the might of which she can conquer self in a way which be a everyday miracle and the man who do not feel about the mere fact of a woman 's have give herself utterly to he just what she herself feel about it ought to be despise by all he fellow -- be it not that in that case it would be necessary to despise more human being than be safe for the soul of any man that fortnight be the sunniest which elsley have pass since he make secret love to lucia in eaton square romantic walk the company of a beautiful woman as ready to listen as she be to talk free licence to pour out all he fancy sure of admiration if not of flattery and pardonably satisfied vanity -- all these be comfortable thing for most man who have nothing better to comfort they but on the whole this feast do not make elsley a better or a wiser man at home why should it be a boy 's digestion improve by turn he loose into a confectioner 's shop and thus the contrast between what he choose to call valencium 's sympathy and lucium 's want of sympathy make he unfortunately all the more cross to she when they be alone and who could blame the poor little woman for say one night angrily enough : ah yes valencia -- valencium be imaginative -- valencium understand you -- valencium sympathise -- valencium think valencium have no child to wash and dress no account to keep no linen to mend -- valencium 's back do not ache all day long so that she would be glad enough to lie on the sofa from morning till night if she be not force to work whether she can work or not no no do not kiss I for kiss will not make up for injustice elsley i only trust that you will not tempt I to hate my own sister no : do not talk to I now let I sleep if i can sleep and go and walk and talk sentiment with valencium to-morrow and leave the poor little brood hen to sit on she nest and be despise and refuse all elsley 's entreaty for pardon she sulk herself to sleep who can blame she if there be one thing more provoke than another to a woman it be to see she husband strass-engel haus-teufel a angel of courtesy to every woman but herself to see he in society all smile and good story the most amiable and self-restraining of man perhaps to be compliment on he agreeableness : and to know all the while that he be pen up all the accumulate ill-temper of the day to let it out on she when they get home perhaps in the very carriage as soon as it leave the door hypocrite that you be some of you gentleman why can not the act against cruelty to woman corporal punishment include be bring to bear on such as you and yet after all you be not most to blame in the matter : eve herself tempt you as at the beginning for who do not know that the man be a thousand time vainer than the woman he do but follow the analogy of all nature look at the red

bird and the male moth the fine feather while the female go soberly about in drab and brown do the lioness or the lion rejoice in the grandeur of a mane the hind or the stag in antlered pride how know we but that in some more perfect and natural state of society the woman will dress like so many quakeress while the frippery shop will become the haunt of man alone and browch pearl and owch be consecrate to the nobler sex there be sign already in the dress of we young gentleman of such a return to the law of nature from the present absurd state of thing in which the human peahen carry about the gaudy train which be the peacock ' right for there be a secret feeling in woman 's heart that she be in she wrong place that it be she who ought to worship the man and not the man she and when she

head be so full of petty care and gossip that he and all he talent be quite unappreciated _ les femmes incomprises _ of france use to -lrb- perhaps do now -rrb- form a class of married lady whose sorrow be especially dear to the novelist male or female but what be they woe compare to those of _ l'homme incompri _ what higher vocation for a young maiden than to comfort the martyr during he agony and most of all where the sufferer be not merely a genius but a saint persecute perhaps abroad by vulgar tradesman and philistine bishop and snub at home by a stupid wife who be quite unable to

on and prosper ah young lady if some people have -lrb- as it be perhaps well for they that they have not -rrb- the order of this same british nation they would certainly follow you example and try to restore various ancient institution and first among they would be that very ancient institution of the cucking-stool to be employ however not as of old against married scold -lrb- for whom those who have be behind the scene have all respect and sympathy -rrb- but against unmarried prophetess who under whatsoever high pretence of art or religion flirt with they neighbor ' husband be they parson or poet not be it understand that valencium have the least suspicion that elsley consider himself incompris if he have hint the notion to she she would have resent it as a insult to the st just in general and to she sister in particular and would have say something to he in she off-hand way the like whereof he have seldom hear even from adverse reviewer elsley himself soon divine enough of she character to see that he must keep he sorrow to himself if he wish for valencium 's good opinion and soon -- so easily do a vain man lend himself to meanness -- he find himself try to please valencium by praise to she the very woman with whom he be discontented he feel shocked and ashamed when first he own baseness flash across he : but the bait be too pleasant to be leave easily : and after all he be try to say to he guest what he know he guest would like and what be that but follow those very rule of good society for break which lucia be always call he gauche and morose so he actually quiet he own conscience by the fancy that he be bind to be civil and to keep up appearance even for lucium 's sake say the self-deceiver to himself and thus the mischief be do and the breach between lucium and she husband which have be somewhat bridge over during the last month or two open more wide than ever without a suspicion on valencium 's part that she be do all she could to break she sister 's heart she meanwhile have plenty of reason which justify she new intimacy to herself how could she better please lucium how better show that bygones be to be bygones and that elsley be henceforth to be consider as one of the family than by be as intimate as possible with he what matter how intimate for after all he be only a brother and she he sister she have law on she side in that last argument as well as love of amusement whether she have either common sense or scripture be a very different question poor lucium too try to make the best of the matter and to take the new intimacy as valencium would have have she take it in the light of a compliment to herself and so in she pride she say to valencium and tell she that she should love she for ever for she kindness to elsley while she heart be ready to burst but ere the fortnight be over the nemesis have come and lucia woman as she be could not repress a thrill of malicious joy even though elsley become more intolerable than ever at the change what be the nemesis then simply that this naughty miss st just begin to smile upon frank headley the curate even as she have smile upon elsley vavasor it be very naughty but she have she excuse she have find elsley out and it be well for both of they that she have do so already upon the strength of they suppose relationship she have allow he to talk a great deal more nonsense to she -- harmless perhaps but nonsense still -- than she would have listen to from any other man and it be well for both of they that elsley be a man without self-control who begin to show the weak side of he character freely enough as soon as he become at ease with he companion and excite by conversation valencium quickly see that he be vain as a peacock and weak enough to be lead by she in any and every direction when she choose to work on he vanity and she despise he accordingly and suspect too that she sister could not be very happy with such a man none be more quick than sister-in-law to see fault in the brother-in-law when once they have begin to look for they and valencia soon remark that elsley show lucia no _ petit soin _ while he be ready enough to show they to she that he take no real trouble about he child or about anything else and twenty more fault which she might have perceive in the first two day of she visit if she have not be in such a hurry to amuse herself but she be too delicate to ask lucium the truth and contented herself with watch all party closely and in amusing herself meanwhile -- for amusement she must have -- in break a country heart for pastime ere she go to town she have meet frank several time about the parish and in the school and have be strike at once with he grace and high breeding and with that air of melancholy which be always interesting in a true woman 's eye she have see too that elsley try to avoid he naturally enough not wish a intrusion on they pleasant _ têtes-à-tête _ whereon half to spite elsley and half to show she own right to chat with whom she choose she make lucium ask frank to tea and next contrived to go to the school when he be teach there and to make elsley ask he to walk with they and all the more because she have discover that elsley have discontinue he walk with frank as soon as she have appear at penalva lucium be not sorry to countenance she in she naughtiness it be a comfort to she to have a fourth person in the room at time and thus to compel elsley and valencium to think of something beside each other and when she see she sister gradually transfer she favor from the marry to the unmarried victim she would have be more than woman if she have not rejoice thereat only she begin soon to be afraid for frank and at last tell valencium so do take care that you do not break he heart my dear you forget that i sit under mr o'blareaway and be to he as a heathen and a publican fresh from st nepomuc 's as he be he would as soon think of fall in love with a ` oirish prodestant ' as with a malignant and a turbaned turk besides my dear if the mischief be go to be do it be do already i dare say it be you naughty beautiful thing if anybody be goose enough to fall in love with you he 'll be also goose enough i do not doubt to do so at first sight there do not look perpetually in that glass : but take care what use if it be go to happen at all i say it have happen already so i shall just please myself as usual and it have happen : and poor frank have be ever since the first day he see valencium over head and ear in love he time have come and there be no escape he fate but to escape he try convince with many good man of all age and creed that a celibate life be the fittest one for a clergyman he have flee from st nepomuc 's into the wilderness to avoid temptation and beheld at he cell-door a fairer fiend than ever come to st dunstan a fairer fiend no doubt for st dunstan 's imagination create he temptress for he but valencium be a reality : and fact and nature may be safely back to produce something more charming than any monk 's brain can do one question whether st dunstan 's apparition be not something as coarse as he own mind clever though that mind be at least he would never have have the heart to apply the hot tong to such a nose as valencium 's but at most have bow she out pityingly as frank try to bow out valencium from the sacred place of he heart but fail hard he try and humbly too he have no proud contempt for married parson he be ready enough to confess that he too might be weak in that respect as in a hundred other he conceive that he have no reason from he own inner life to believe himself worthy of any higher vocation -- prove he own real nobleness of soul by that very humility he have rather not marry he might do so some day : but he would sacrifice much to avoid the necessity if he be weak he would use what strength he have to the uttermost ere he yield and all the more because he feel and reasonably enough that valencium be the last woman in the world to make a parson 's wife he have he ideal of what such a wife should be if she be to be allow to exist at all -- the same ideal which mr paget have draw in he charming little book -lrb- would that all parson ' wife would read and perpend -rrb- the owlet of owlstone edge but valencium would surely not make a beatrice beautiful she be glorious lovable but not the helpmeet whom he need and he fight against the new dream like a brave man he fast he weep he pray : but he prayer seem not to be hear valencium seem to have enthrone herself a true venus victrix in the center of he heart and would not be dispossessed he try to avoid see she : but even for that he have not strength : more miserable each time as fierce against himself and he own weakness as if he have give way to wine or to oath in vain too he represent to himself the ridiculous hopelessness of he passion the impossibility of the london beauty ever stoop to marry the poor country curate fancy would come in how such thing strange as they might seem have happen already might happen again it be a class of marriage for which he have always feel a strong dislike even suspicion and contempt and though he be far more fit in family as well as personal excellence for such a match than three out of four who make they yet he shrink with disgust from the notion of be himself class at last among the match-making parson whether there be carnal pride or not in that last think he soul so loathe it that he would gladly have throw up he cure at aberalva and would have do so actually but for one word which tom thurnall have speak to he and that be -- cholera that the cholera might come that it probably would come in the course of the next two month be news to he which be enough to keep he at he post let what would be the consequence and gradually he begin to see a way out of he difficulty -- and a very simple one and that be to die that be the solution after all say he i be not strong enough for god 's work : but i will not shrink from it if i can help if i can not master it let it kill I so at least i may have peace i have fail utterly here : all my grand plan have crumble to ash between my finger i find myself a cumberer of the ground where i fancy that i be go forth like a very michael -- fool that i be -- leader of the army of heaven and now in the one remain point on which i think myself strong i find myself weakest of all useless and helpless i have one chance leave one chance to show these poor soul that i really love they really wish they good -- selfish that i be what matter whether i do show it or not what need to justify myself to they self self creep in everywhere i shall begin next i suppose longing for the cholera to come that i may show off myself in it and make spiritual capital out of they die agony ah I that it be all over -- that this cholera if it be to come would wipe out of this head what i verily believe nothing but death will do and therewith frank lay he head on the table and cry till he could cry no more it be not over manly : but he be weaken with overwork and sorrow : and on the whole it be perhaps the best thing he could do for he fall asleep there with he head on the table and do not wake till the dawn blaze through he open window chapter xiv the doctor at bay do you ever in a feverish dream climb a mountain which grow higher and higher as you climb and scramble through passage which change perpetually before you and up and down break-neck stair which break off perpetually behind you do you ever spend the whole night foot in stirrup mount that phantom hunter which never get mount or if he do turn into a pen between you knee or in go to fish that phantom stream which never get fish do you ever late for that mysterious dinner-party in some enchanted castle wander disconsolately in unaccountable rag and dirt in search of that phantom carpet-bag which never get find do you ever realize to yourself the sieve of the danaide the stone of sisyphus the wheel of ixion the pleasure of shear that domestic animal who -lrb- accord to the experience of a very ancient observer of nature -rrb- produce more cry than wool the perambulation of that irishman 's model bog where you slip two step backward for one forward and must therefore in order to progress at all turn you face homeward and progress as a pig do into a steamer by go the opposite way be you ever condemn to spin rope of sand to all eternity like tregeagle the wrecker or to extract the cube root of a million or two of hopeless surd like the mad mathematician or last and worst of all to work the nuisance removal act then you can enter as a man and a brother into the sorrow of tom thurnall in the month of June and July 1854 he have make up he mind for certain good reason of he own that the cholera ought to visit aberalva in the course of the summer and of course try he best to persuade people to get ready for they ugly visitor : but in vain the cholera come there why it never have come yet which signify when he inquire a little more closely that there have be only one or two doubtful case in 1837 and five or six in 1849 in vain he answer very well and be not that a proof that the cause of cholera be increase here if you have one case the first time and five time as many the next by the same rule you will have five time as many more if it come this summer nonsense aberalva be the healthiest town on the coast well but would tom say in the census before last you have a population of 1300 in 112 house and that be close packing enough in all conscience : and in the last census i find you have a population of over 1400 which must have increase since and there be eight or nine old house in the town pull down or turn into store so you be more closely packed than ever and mind it may seem no very great difference but it be the last drop that fill the cup what have that to do with cholera and more than one give he to understand that he must be either a very silly or a very impertinent person to go poke into how many house there be in the town and how many people live in each tardrew the steward indeed say openly that mr thurnall be make disturbance enough in people 's property up at pentremochyn without bother himself with aberalva too he have no opinion of people who have a finger in everybody 's pie whom tom try to soothe with honeyed word know he to be of the original british bulldog breed which once stroke against the hair show he tooth at you for ever afterwards but staunch be tardrew unfortunately on the wrong side and back by the collective ignorance pride laziness and superstition of aberalva show to he new assailant that terrible front of stupidity against which say schiller the god themselves fight in vain do he think we be all fool afore he come here that be the rally cry of the conservative party worshipper of baalzebub god of fly and of that -lrb- so say syrian scholar -rrb- from which fly be breed and indeed there be excuse for they on the yankee ground that there be a deal of human natur ' in man it be hard to human nature to make all the humiliating confession which must precede sanitary repentance to say i have be a very nasty dirty fellow i have live contented in evil smell till i care for they no more than my pig do i have refuse to understand nature 's broadest hint that anything which be so disagreeable be not mean to be leave about i have probably be more or less the cause of half my own illness and of three-fourth of the illness of my child for aught i know it be very much my fault that my own baby have die of scarlatina and two or three of my tenant of typhus no hang it that be too much to make any man confess to i 'll prove my innocence by not reform so sanitary reform be thrust out of sight simply because its necessity be too humiliating to the pride of all too frightful to the conscience of many tom go to trebooze mr trebooze you be a man of position in the county and own some house in aberalva do not you think you could use you influence in this matter own some house yes -- and mr trebooze consign the say cottage to a variety of unmentionable place cost I more in rate than they bring in in rent even if i get the rent pay i should like to get a six-pounder and blow the whole lot into the sea cholera come eh d'ye think it will he there before michaelma i do pity i can not clear 'em out before michaelma else i would have eject the lot and pull the house down i think something should be do meanwhile though towards cleanse they -- let 'em cleanse they themselves soap 's cheap enough with you -- free trade be not it no sir that sort of talk will do well enough for my lord minchampstead sir the old money-lending jew -- but gentleman sir gentleman that be half-ruin with free trade and you whig policy sir you must give 'em back they rights before they can afford to throw away they money on cottage cottage indeed -- upstart of a cotton-spinner come down here buy the land over we head and pretend to show we how to manage we estate old family that have be in the county this four hundred year with the finest peasantry in the world ready to die for they sir till these new revolutionary doctrine come in -- pride and purse-proud conceit just to show off he money what do they want with better cottage than they father have only put notion into they head raise 'em above they station more they have more they 'll want -- sir make chartist of 'em all before he be do i 'll tell you what sir -- and mr trebooze attempt a dignified and dogmatic tone -- i never tell it you before because you be my very good friend sir : but my opinion be sir that by what you be do up at pentremochyn you be just spread chartism -- chartism sir of course i know nothing of course i be nobody in these day : but that be my opinion sir and you have get it by which motion tom take little mighty be envy always and mighty ignorance : but you become aware of they truly titanic grandeur only when you attempt to touch they owner 's pocket tom try old heale : but take as little in that quarter heale have hear of sanitary reform of course but he know nothing about it and give a general assent to tom 's doctrine for fear of expose he own ignorance : act on they be a very different matter it be always hard for a old medical man to confess that anything have be discover since the day of he youth and beside there be other reason behind which heale try to avoid give and therefore fence off and fence off till press hard by tom wrath come forth and truth with it and what be you think of sir to expect I to offend all my best patient and not one of 'em but rent some two cottage some a dozen and what 'll they say to I if i go a route and rookle in they drain like a old sow by the wayside beside put 'em to all manner of expense and all on the chance of this cholera come which i have no faith in nor in this new-fangled sanitary reform neither which be all a dodge for a lot of young government puppy to fill they pocket and rule and ride over we : and my opinion always be with the bible that ` tis jidgment sir a jidgment of god and we can not escape he holy will and that be the plain truth of it tom make no answer to that latter argument he have hear that ` tis jidgment from every mouth during the last few day and have mortally offend the brianite preacher that very morning by answer he ` tis jidgment with -- but my good sir the bible i thought say that aaron stay the plague among the israelite and david the one at jerusalem sir those be miracle sir and they be under the law sir and we be under the gospel you 'll be please to remember humph say tom then by you show they be better off under the law than we be now if they could have they plague stop by miracle and we can not have ours stop at all sir be you a infidel to which there be no answer to be make in this case tom answer heale with -- but my dear sir if you do not like -lrb- as be reasonable enough -rrb- to take the responsibility on yourself why not go to the board of guardian and get they to put the act in force boord sir and do you know so little of boord as that why there be not one of they but own cottage themselves and it be as much as my place be worth -- you place as medical officer be just worth nothing as you know you 'll have be out of pocket by it seven or eight pound this year even if no cholera come tom know the whole state of the case but he like torment heale now and then well sir but if i get turn out next year in step that draw over at carcarrow churchtown into my district and into the best of my practice too i wonder what sort of a poor law district you be medical officer of if you do not know yet that that be why we take to the poor my dear sir i know it and a good deal more beside then why go bother I this way why say tom it be pleasant to have old notion confirm as often as possible -- ` life be a jest and all thing show it i think so once but now i know it ' what a ass the fellow must have be who have that put on he tombstone not to have find it out many a year before he die he go next to headley the curate and take little by that move though more than by any other for frank already believe he doctrine as a educate london parson of course would be shock to hear that they be likely to become fact so soon and so fearfully offer to do all he could : but confess that he could do nothing i have be hint to they ever since i come improvement in cleanliness in ventilation and so forth : but i have be utterly unheeded : and bully I as you will doctor about my cram doctrine down they throat and roar like a pope 's bull i assure you that on sanitary reform my roaring be as of a sucking dive and ought to have prevail if soft persuasion can you be a dive where you ought to have be a bull and a bull where you ought to have be a dive but roar now if ever you roar in the pulpit and out why not preach to they on it next Sunday well i would give a lecture gladly if i could get any one to come and hear it but that you could do better than I i 'll lecture they myself and show they bogie if my quarter-inch will do its work if they want see to believe see they shall i have half-a-dozen specimen of water already which will astonish they let I lecture you must preach you must know that there be a feeling -- you would call it a prejudice -- against introduce such purely secular subject into the pulpit tom give a long whistle pardon I mr headley you be a man of sense and i can speak to you as one human be to another which i have seldom be able to do with you respect cloth say on i shall not be frighten well do not you put up the ten commandment in you church yes and do not one of they run : ` thou shalt not kill ' well and be not murder a moral offence -- what you call a sin _ san doute _ if you see you parishioner in the habit of cut each other 's throat or they own should not you think that a matter spiritual enough to be a fit subject for a little of the drum ecclesiastic well well ill there be you parishioner about to commit wholesale murder and suicide and be that a secular question if they do not know the fact be not that all the more reason for you tell they of it you pound away as i warn you once at the sin of which they be just as well aware as you why on earth do you hold you tongue about the sin of which they be not aware you tell we every Sunday that we do heaven only know how many more wrong thing than we dream of tell it we again now do not strain at gnat like want of faith and resignation and swallow such a camel as twenty or thirty death it be no concern of mine i have see plenty of people murder and may again : i be accustom to it but if it be not you concern what on earth you be here for be more than i can tell you be right -- you be right but how to put it on religious grounds -- tom whistle again if you doctrine can not be make to fit such plain matter as twenty death _ tant pi pour eux _ if they have nothing to say on such scientific fact why the fact must take care of themselves and the doctrine may for aught i care go and -- but i will not be really rude only think over the matter if you be god 's minister you ought to have something to say about god 's view of a fact which certainly involve the life of he creature not by two and three but by ten of thousand so frank go home and think it through and go once and again to thurnall and condescend to ask he opinion of what he have say and whether he say ill or well what thurnall answer be -- whether that be sound church doctrine be you business but if it be i 'll say with the man there in the act -- what be he name -- ` almost thou persuadest I to be a christian ' would god that you be one for you would make a right good one humph at least you see what you can do if you 'll only face fact as it stand and talk about the reality of life i 'll puff you sermon beforehand i assure you and bring all i can to hear it so frank preach a noble sermon most rational and most spiritual withal but he too like he tutor take little by he motion all the present fruit upon which he have to congratulate himself be that the brianite preacher denounce he in chapel next Sunday as a german rationalist who impiously pretend to explain away the lord 's visitation into a carnal matter of drain and pipe and gas and such like and that he rival of another denomination who be a fanatic on the teetotal question denounce he as bitterly for support the cause of drunkenness by attribute cholera to want of cleanliness while all rational people know that its true source be intemperance poor frank he have preach against drunkenness many a time and oft : but because he would not add a mohammedan eleventh commandment to those ten which man already find difficulty enough in keep he be set upon at once by a fanatic whose game it be -- as it be that of too many -- to snub sanitary reform and hinder the spread of plain scientific truth for the sake of push they own nostrum for all human ill in despair tom go off to elsley vavasor would he help would he join as one of two householder in make a representation to the proper authority elsley have never mix in local matter : and if he have he know nothing of how to manage man or to read a act of parliament so angry as tom be incline to be with he he find it useless to quarrel with a man so utterly unpractical who would probably have he be stir into exertion have do more harm than good only come with I and satisfy yourself as to the existence of one of these nuisance and then you will have grounds on which to go say tom who have still hope of make a cat 's - paw of elsley and by he power over he pull the string from behind sorely against he will elsley go saw and smell come home again be very unwell and be visit nightly for a week after that by that most disgusting of all phantom sanitary nightmare which some who have work in the foul place of the earth know but too well evidently he health could not stand it there be no work to be get out of he in that direction would he write then and represent matter to lord scoutbush how could he he do not know the man not a line have ever be exchange between they they relation be so very peculiar it would seem sheer impertinence on he part to interfere with the management of lord scoutbush 's property really there be a great deal to be say tom feel for poor elsley 's dislike of meddling in that quarter would mr vavasor write then for heaven 's sake do not mention it to she she would be so terrify about the child she be wear out with anxiety already -- and so forth tom go back to frank headley you see a good deal of miss st just i -- no -- why -- what say poor frank blush only that you must make she write to she brother about this cholera my dear fellow it be such a subject for a lady to meddle with it have no scruple in meddle with lady so lady ought to have none in meddle with it you must do it as delicately as you will : but do it must be : it be we only chance tell she of tardrew 's obstinacy or scoutbush will go by he opinion and tell she to keep the secret from she sister frank do it and well valencium be horror-struck and write scoutbush be away at sea nobody know where and a full fortnight elapse before a answer come my dear you be quite mistaken if you think i can do anything nine-tenth of the house in aberalva be not in my hand but copyhold and long lease over which i have no power if the people will complain to I of any give nuisance i 'll right it if i can and if the doctor want money and see any way of lay it out well he shall have what he want though i be very high in queer street just now ma'am have pay you bill before i leave town like a good brother : but i tell you again i have no more power than you have except over a few cottage and tardrew assure I three week ago that they be as comfortable as they ever have be so tardrew have forestall thurnall in write to the viscount well there be one more chance to be try tom give he lecture in the school-room he show they magnify abomination enough to frighten all the child into fit and dilate on horror enough to spoil all appetite : he prove to they that though they have the finest water in the world all over the town they have contrived to poison almost every drop of it he wax eloquent witty sarcastic and the net result be a general grumble how do he get hold of all the specimen as he call they what business have he poke he nose down people 's well and waterbutt but a unexpected ally arise at this juncture in the coast-guard lieutenant who be valiant after he evening 's brandy-and-water rise and declare that dr thurnall be a very clever man that by what he would see himself in the west indy it be all as true as gospel that the parish might have the cholera if it like -- and here a few expletive occur -- but that he would see that the coast-guard house be put to rights at once for he would not have the life of she majesty 's servant endanger by such dirty trick not fit for heathen savage etc etc tom strike while the iron be hot he see that the great man 's speech have produce a impression would he -lrb- so he ask the lieutenant privately -rrb- get some one to join he and present a few of these nuisance he would do anything in he contempt for a lot of long-shore merchant-skipper and herringer who go about call themselves captain and fancy themselves sir as good as if they wear the queen 's uniform well then can not we find another householder -- some cantankerous dog who do not mind a row yes the cantankerous dog be find in the person of mr john penruddock coal-merchant who have quarrel with tardrew because tardrew say he give short weight -- which he very probably do -- and have quarrel also with thoma beer senior shipbuilder about right of passage through a back-yard mr penruddock suddenly discover that mr beer keep up a dirt-heap in the say back-yard and with virtuous indignation vow he would sarve the old beggar out at last so far so good the weapon of reason and righteousness have fail tom feel at liberty to borrow the devil 's tool now to pack a vestry and to nominate a local committee the vestry be pack the committee nominate : of course half of they refuse to act -- they do not want to go quarrel with they neighbor tom explain to they cunningly and delicately that they would have nothing to do that one or two -lrb- he do not say that he be the one and the two also -rrb- would do all the work and bear all the odium whereon the malcontent subside consider it likely that after all nothing would be do some may fancy that matter be now get somewhat settle those who do so know little of the charming machinery of local government one man have summat to say -- utterly irrelevant another must need answer he with something equally irrelevant a long chatter ensue in spite of all cry to order and question soon one and another get personal and temper show here and there you would fancy that the go-ahead party try to restore order and help business on not in the least they have begin to cool a little they be a little afraid that they have commit themselves if people quarrel with each other perhaps they may quarrel with they too and they begin to be wonderfully patient and impartial in the hope of stave off the evil day and find some excuse for do nothing after all hear ` mun out vair and zoft let ev'ry man ha ' he zay there be vary gude rason in it i do not think of that avore -- and so forth till in a quarter of a hour the whole question have to be discuss over again through the fog of a dozen fresh fallacy and the miserable earnest man find himself considerably worse off than when he begin happy for he if some chance word be not let drop which will afford the whole assembly a excuse for fall on he open-mouthed as the cause of all they woe that chance word come mr penruddock give a spiteful hit be as he say of a cantankerous turn to mr treluddra principal jowder _ ie _ fish salesman of aberalva whereon treluddra whose conscience tell he that there be at present in he back-yard a cartload and more of fish in every stage of putrefaction which he have keep rot there rather than lower the market-price rise in wrath a ' if any committee put its noz into my back-yard if it doant get the biggest cod 's innards as i can collar hold on about its ear my name be not treluddra a man 's house be he castle say i and they as take up with any o ' this open-day burglary for it be nothing less have to do wus ' I that be all and they as know they interest know I terrible be these word for old treluddra like most jowder combine the profession of money-lender with that of salesman and there be dozen in the place who be in debt to he for money advance to buy boat and net after wreck and loss besides to offend one jowder be to offend all they combine to buy the fish at any price they choose : if anger they would combine now and then not to buy it at all you old twenty per cent rascal roar the lieutenant after make a fortune out of these poor fellow ' mishap do you want to poison 'em all with you stinking fish i say lieutenant say old beer whose son owe treluddra fifty pound at that moment fair 's fair you mind you coastguard and we be mind we trade we be free fisherman by charter and right you be not we master and you shall know it know it say the lieutenant foam iss you put you head inside my presence and i 'll split mun open if i be hang for it you split my head open iss by -- and the old grey-bearded sea-king set he arm akimbo gentleman gentleman for heaven 's sake cry poor headley this be really go too far gentleman the vestry be adjourn best thing too ought not never to have be call say one and another and some one as he go out muttered something about interlope strange doctor colloquy with popish curate which be answer by a -- put ` mun in the quay pule from treluddra tom step up to treluddra instantly what be you so kind as to say sir treluddra turn very pale i do not say nought oh but i assure you i hear and i shall be most happy to jump into the quay pule this afternoon if it will afford you the slightest amusement say the word and i 'll borrow a flute and play you the rogue 's march all the while with my right hand swimming with my leave now gentleman one word before we part who be you cry some one a man at least and ought to have a fair hearing now i ask you what possible interest can i have in this matter i know when i begin that i should give myself a frightful quantity of trouble and get only what i have get why do you begin at all then because i be a very foolish meddlesome ass who fancy that i ought to do my duty once in a way by my neighbor now i have only to say that if you will but forgive and forget and let bygones be bygones i promise you solemnly i 'll never do my duty by you again as long as i live nor interfere with the sacred privilege of every free-born englishman to do that which be right in the sight of he own eye and wrong too you be make fun at we say old beer dubiously well mr beer and be not that better than quarrel with you come along we 'll all go home and forget it like good christian perhaps the cholera will not come and if it do what be the odds so long as you be happy eh and to the intense astonishment both of the lieutenant and frank tom walk home with the malcontent make himself so agreeable that he be forgive freely on the spot what do the fellow mean he be desert we sir after bring we here to make fool of we frank could give no answer but thurnall give one himself that evening both to frank and the lieutenant the cholera will come and these fellow be just mad but i must not quarrel with they mad or not why then for the same reason that you must not if we keep we influence we may be able to do some good at the last which mean in plain english save a few human life as for you lieutenant you have behave like a hero and have be serve as hero generally be what you must do be this on the first hint of disease pack up you trap and you good lady and go and live in the watch-house across the river as for the man 's house i 'll set they to rights in a day if you 'll get the commander of the district to allow you a little chloride of lime and whitewash and so the matter end you be a greater puzzle than ever to I thurnall say frank you be always pretend to care for nothing but you own interest and yet here you have go out of you way to incur odium know you say that you cause be all but hopeless well i do it because i like it it be a sort of sport with you true doctor he blaze away at a disease where he see one as he would at a bear or a lion the very sight of it excite he organ of destructiveness do not you understand I you hate sin you know well i hate disease moral evil be you devil and physical evil be mine i hate it little or big i hate to see a fellow sick i hate to see a child rickety and pale i hate to see a speck of dirt in the street i hate to see a woman 's gown tear i hate to see she stocking down at heel i hate to see anything waste anything awry anything go wrong i hate to see water-power waste manure waste land waste muscle waste pluck waste brain waste i hate neglect incapacity idleness ignorance and all the disease and misery which spring out of that there be my devil and i can not help it for the life of I go right at he throat wheresoever i meet he lastly rather to clear he reputation than in the hope of do good tom write up to london and detail the case to that much-calummated body the general board of health inform they civilly that the nuisance removal act be simply waste paper that he could not get it to bear at all on aberalva and that if he have do so it would have be equally useless for the simple reason that it constitute the offender themselves judge and jury in they own case to which the board return for answer that they be perfectly aware of the fact and deeply deplore the same : but that as soon as cholera break out in aberalva they should be most happy to send down a inspector to which tom reply courteously that he would not give they the trouble be able he trust to perform without assistance the not uncommon feat of shut the stable-door after the horse be steal and so be aberalva leave a virgin city undefiled by government interference to the blessing of that local government which signify in plain english the leave the few to destroy themselves and the many by the unchecked exercise of the virtue of pride and ignorance stupidity and stinginess but to tom in he sorest need arise a new and most unexpected coadjutor and this be the way in which it come to pass for it befall in that pleasant summer time when small bird sing and shaugh be green that thurnall start one bright Sunday eve to see a sick child at a upland farm some few mile from the town and partly because he like the walk and partly because he could no other have neither horse nor gig he go on foot and whistle as he go like any throstle-cock along the pleasant vale by flowery bank and ferny wall by oak and ash and thorn while alva flash and swirl between green bough below clear coffee-brown from last night 's rain some mile up the turnpike road he go and then away to the right through the ash-wood of trebooze up by the rill which drip from pool to pool over the ledge of gray slate deep-bedded in dark sedge and broad bright burdock leave and tall angelica and ell-broad ring and tuft of king and crown and lady-fern and all the semi-tropic luxuriance of the fat western soil and steam western wood out into the boggy moor at the glen head all fragrant with the gold-tipped gale where the turf be enamel with the hectic marsh violet and the pink pimpernel and the pale yellow leaf-star of the butterwort and the blue bell and green thread of the ivy-leaved campanula out upon the steep smooth down above and away over the broad cattle-pasture and then to pause a moment and look far and wide over land and sea it be a day of god the earth lay like one great emerald ringed and roof with sapphire blue sea blue mountain blue sky overhead there she lay not sleep but bask in she quiet sabbath joy as though she two great sister of the sea and air have wash she weary limb with holy tear and purge away the stain of last week 's sin and toil and cool she hot worn forehead with they pure incense-breath and fold she within they azure robe and brood over she with smile of pity love till she smile back in answer and take heart and hope for next week 's weary work heart and hope for next week 's work -- that be the sermon which it preach to tom thurnall as he stand there alone a stranger and a wanderer like ulyss of old but like he self-helpful cheerful fate-defiant in one respect indeed he know less than ulyss and be more of a heathen than he for he know not what ulyss know that a heavenly guide be with he in he wanderings still less what ulyss know not that what he call the malicious sport of fortune be in truth the earnest education of a father but who will blame he for get strength and comfort from such merely natural fount or say that the impulse come from below and not from above which make he say -- brave old world she be after all and right well make and look right well to-day in she go-to-meeting clothes and plenty of room and chance in she for a brave man to earn he bread if he will but go right on about he business as the bird and the flower do instead of peak and pine over what people think of he like that miserable brigg hark to that jolly old missel-thrush below he be have he nest to build and he supper to earn and he young one to feed and all the crow and kite in the wood to drive away the sturdy john bull that he be and yet he can find time to sing as merrily as a abbot morning and evening since he sing the new year in last January and why should not i let he be a while there be sound of deeper meaning in the air if he heart have ear to hear they far off church-bell chime to even-song hymn-tune float up the glen from the little chapel in the vale he may learn what they too mean some day honor to he at least that he have learn what the missel-thrush below can tell he if he accept cheerfully and manfully the thing which he do see he will be all the more able to enter hereafter into the deeper mystery of thing unseen the road toward true faith and reverence for god 's kingdom of heaven do not lie through manichaean contempt and slander of god 's kingdom of earth so let he stride over the down enjoy the mere fact of life and health and strength and whistle shrilly to the bird below who trumpet out a few grand ringing note and repeat they again and again in saucy self-satisfaction and then stop to listen for the answer to this challenge and then rattle on again with a fresh passage more saucily than ever in a tone which seem to ask -- you could sing that eh but can you sing this my fine fellow on the down above so he seem to tom to say and tickle with the fancy tom laugh and whistle and laugh and have just time to compose he feature as he step up to the farm-yard gate let he be i say again he might have better Sunday thought perhaps he will have some day at least he be a man and a brave one and as the greater contain the less surely before a man can be a good man he must be a brave one first much more a man at all coward old odin hold inevitably go to the very bottom of hela-pool and by no possibility unless of course they become brave at last could rise out of that everlasting bog but sink whine lower and lower like mire cattle to all eternity in the unfathomable peat-slime and if the twenty-first chapter of the book of revelation and the eighth verse be to be take as it stand they doom have not alter since odin 's time unless to become still worse tom come up over the home-close and through the barton-gate through the farm-yard and stop at last at the porch the front door be open and the door beyond it and ere he knock he stop look in silence at a picture which hold he spellbound for a moment by its rich and yet quiet beauty tom be no artist and know no more of painting in spite of he old friendship with claude than be to be expect of a keen and observant naturalist who have see half the globe indeed he have be in the habit of snub claude 's profession and of arrive on pre-raphaelite grounds at a by no means pre-raphaelite conclusion a picture you say be worth nothing unless you copy nature but you can not copy she she be ten time more gorgeous than any man can dare represent she ergo every picture be a failure and the nearest hedge-bush be worth all you gallery together -- a syllogism of sharp edge which he would back up by byron 's -- i have see much finer woman ripe and real than all the nonsense of they stone ideal but here be one of nature 's own picture draw and color by more than mortal hand and frame over and above ready to he eye by the square of the dark doorway beyond which all be flood with the full glory of the low north-western sun a dark oak-ribbed ceiling wall of pale fawn-yellow a open window show a corner of rich olive-stone wall enamel with golden lichen orange and green comb of polypody pink and gray tuft of pellitory all glowing in the sunlight above the window-sill rise a bush of maiden-blush rose a tall spire of blue monkshood and one head of scarlet lychni like a spark of fire and behind all the dark blue sea which fade into the pale-blue sky at the window stand a sofa of old maroon leather its dark hue throw out in strong relief two figure who sit upon it and when tom have once look at they he look at nothing else there sit the sick girl she head nestle upon the shoulder of grace harvey a tall delicate thing of seventeen with thin white cheek the hectic spot aflame on each and long fair curl which mingle lovingly with grace 's dark tress as they sit cheek against cheek and hand in hand she eye be close tom thought at first that she be asleep : but there be a quiet smile about she pale lip and every now and then she left hand leave grace 's to move toward a leaf full of strawberry which lay on grace 's lap and tom could see that she be listen intently to grace who tell and tell in that sweet measure voice of hers she head erect she face in the full blaze of sunshine she great eye look out far away beyond the sea beyond the sky into some infinite which only she behold tom have approach unheard across the farm-yard straw he stand and look he fill the attitude of the two girl be so graceful that he be loth to disturb it and loth too to disturb a certain sunny calm which warm at once and soften he stout heart he wish too -- he scarce know why -- to hear what grace be say and as he listen she voice be so distinct and delicate in its modulation that every word come clearly to he ear it be the beautiful old legend of st dorothea : -- so they do all sort of dreadful thing to she and then lead she away to die and they stand laugh there but after a little time there come a boy the prettiest boy that ever be see on earth and in he hand a basket full of fruit and flower more beautiful than tongue can tell and he say ` dorothea send you these out of the heavenly garden which she tell you of -- will you believe she now ' and then before they could reply he vanish away and theophilus look at the flower and taste the fruit -- and a new heart grow up within he and he say ` dorothea 's god shall be my god and i will die for he like she ' so you see darling there be sweeter fruit than these and gayer flower in the place to which you go and all the lovely thing in this world here will seem quite poor and worthless beside the glory of that better land which he will show you : and yet you will not care to look at they for the sight of he will be enough and you will care to think of nothing else and you be sure he will accept I after all ask the sick girl open she eye and look up at grace she see thurnall standing in the doorway and give a little scream tom come forward bowing i be very sorry to have disturb you i suspect miss harvey be give you better medicine than i can give now why do tom say that to whom the legend of st dorothea and indeed that whole belief in a better land be as a dream fit only for girl not altogether because he must need say something civil true he feel on the whole about the future state as goethe do -- to the able man this world be not dumb : why should he ramble off into eternity such incomprehensible subject lie too far off and only disturb we thought if make the subject of daily meditation that there be a future state he have no doubt we have be bear once he use to say be the strongest possible presumption in favor of we be bear again and probably as nature always work upward and develop higher form in some higher state indeed for aught he know the old ichthyosaur and plesiosaur might be alive now as lion -- or as man he himself indeed he have say ere now have be probably a pterodactyle of the lia neither fish flesh nor good red herring but crocodile and bat in one able alike to swim or run or fly eat anything and live in any element still it be no concern of he he be here and here be he business he have not think of this life before he come into it and it would be time enough to think of the next life when he get into it besides he have all a doctor 's dislike of those terror of the unseen world with which some man be wont to oppress still more fail nature and break the bruise reed he business be to cure he patient ' body and if he could not do that at least to see that life be not shorten in they by nervous depression and anxiety accustom to see man of every character die under every possible circumstance he have come to the conclusion that the safety of a man 's soul could by no possibility be infer from he death-bed temper the vast majority good or bad die in peace : why not let they die so if nature kindly take off the edge of sorrow by blunt the nervous system what right have man to interfere with so merciful a arrangement every man he hold in he easy optimism would go where he ought to go : and it could be no possible good to he -- indeed it might be a very bad thing for he as in this life -- to go where he ought not to go so he use to argue with three-fourth of mankind mingle truth and falsehood : and would on these grounds have do he best to turn the dissent preacher out of that house have he find he in it but to-day he be in a more lenient perhaps in a more human and therefore more spiritual mood it be all very well for he full of life and power and hope to look on death in that cold careless way but for that poor young thing cut off just as life open from all that make life lovely -- be not death for she a painful ugly anomaly could she be blame if she shudder at go forth into the unknown blank she know not whither all very well for the old emperor of rome who have live he life and do he work to play with the dreary question -- animulum vagulum blandulum hospe comesque corpori quae nunc abibis in loca rigidula nudula pallida -- but she who have live no life and do no work -- only have pine through weary year of hideous suffering cripple and ulcerate with scrofula now die of consumption : be it not a merciful dream a beautiful dream a just dream -- so beautiful and just that perhaps it might be true -- that in some fairer world all this and more might be make up to she if not be it not a mistake and a injustice that she should ever have come into the world at all and be not grace do a rational as well as a loving work in tell she under whatsoever symbol that such a home of rest and beauty await she it be not the sort of place to which he expect perhaps even wish to go : but it fit well enough with a young girl 's hope a young girl 's power of enjoyment let it be perhaps there be such a place -- why not -- fit for st dorothea and those cut off in youth like she and other place fit for such as he and he speak more tenderly than usual -lrb- though he be never untender -rrb- as he say -- and you feel better to-day i be sure you must with such a kind friend to tell you such sweet tale i do not feel better thank you and why should i wish to do so you all take too much trouble about I why do you want to keep I here we be loth to lose you and besides while you can be keep here it be a sign that you ought to be here so grace tell I yes i will be patient and wait till he have do he work i be more patient now be i not grace and she fondle grace 's hand and look up in she face yes say grace who be stand near with downcast face try to avoid tom 's eye yes you be very good but you must not talk : but the girl go on with kindling eye -- ah -- i be very fretful at first because i could not go to heaven at once : but grace show I how it be good to be here as well as there as long as he think that i might be make perfect by suffering and since then my pain have become quite pleasant to I and i be ready to wait and bear -- wait and bear you must not talk -- see you be begin to cough say tom who wish somehow to stop a form of thought which so utterly puzzle he not that he have not hear it before commonplace enough indeed it be thank god : but that day the word come home to he with spirit and power all the more solemnly from they contrast with the scene around -- without all sunshine joy and glory : all which could tempt a human be to linger here : and within that young girl longing to leave it all and yet content to stay and suffer what mystery there be in the human spirit -- mystery to which that knowledge of mankind on which he pride himself give he no key what if i be lay on my back to-morrow for life by a fall a blow as i have see many a better man than I -- should i not wish to have one to talk to I as she be talk to that child and for a moment a yearning after grace come over he as it have do before and sweep from he mind the dark cloud of suspicion now i must talk with you mother say he for you have better company than mine and i hear she just come in he settle little matter for he patient 's comfort with the farmer 's wife when he return to bid she good-bye grace be go i hope i have not drive she away oh no she have be here a hour and she must go back now to get she mother 's supper that be a good girl say tom look after she as she go down the field she be a angel from heaven sir not a three day go over without she walk up here all this way after she work to comfort my poor maid -- and all of we as well it be like the dew of heaven upon we pity sir you do not see she home i should have like it well enough but folk might talk if two young people be see walk together Sunday evening oh sir they know she too well by now for mile round : and you too sir i 'll make bold to say well at least i 'll go after she so tom go and keep grace in sight till she have cross the little moor and disappear in the wood below he have go about a hundred yard into the wood when he hear voice and laughter -- then a loud shriek he hurry forward in another minute grace rush up to he she eye wide with terror and indignation what be it cry he try to stop she : but not seem to see he she dash past he and run on another moment and a man appear in full pursuit it be trebooze of trebooze a evil laugh upon he face tom plant himself across the narrow path in a attitude which there be no mistaking not a word pass between they silently and instinctively like two fierce dog the two man fly upon each other tom full of righteous wrath and trebooze of half-drunken passion turn to fury by the interruption he be a far taller and heavier man than thurnall and as the bully of the neighborhood count on a easy victory but he be mistake after the first rush be over he find it impossible to close with he foe and saw in the doctor 's face now grow cool and business-like as usual the wily smile of superior science and expect triumph brandy-and-water in the morning ought not to improve the wind say tom to himself as he left hand counter provokingly while he right rattle again and again upon trebooze 's watch-chain justice will overtake you in the offend part which i take to be the epigastric region in a few minute more the scuffle end shamefully enough for the sottish squireen tom stand over he for a minute as he sit grovel and groan among the long grass i may as well see that i have not kill he no he will do as well as ever -- which be not say much now sir go home quietly and ask mr trebooze for a little rhubarb and salvolatile i 'll call up in the course of to-morrow to see how you be i 'll kill you if i catch you as a man i be open of course to be kill by any fair means but as a doctor i be still bind to see after my patient 's health and tom bow civilly and walk back up the path to find grace after wash face and hand in the brook he find she up at tolchard 's farm tremble and thankful i can not do less than see miss harvey safe home grace hesitate mr tolchard i be sure will walk with we it would be safer in case you feel faint again but mrs tolchard would not come to save grace 's notion of propriety so tom pass grace 's arm through he own she offer to withdraw it no you will require it you do not know yet how much you have go through my fear be that you will feel it all the more painfully when the excitement be past i shall send you up a cordial and you must promise I to take it you owe I a little debt you know to-day you must pay it by take my medicine grace look up at he sidelong for there be a playful tenderness in he voice which be new to she and which thrill she through and through i will indeed i promise you but i be so much better now really i can walk alone and she withdraw she arm from he but not hastily after that they walk on awhile in silence grace keep she veil down for she eye be full of tear she love that man intensely utterly she do not seek to deny it to herself god have give he to she and hers he be the very sea the devourer whom she hate who hunger to swallow up all young fair life the very sea have yield he up to she alive from the dead and yet that man she know suspect she of a base and hateful crime it be too dreadful she could not exculpate herself save by blank denial -- and what would that avail the large hot drop run down she cheek she have need of all she strength to prevent sob she look round in the bright summer evening all thing be full of joy and love the hedge-bank be gay as flower garden the swift chase each other scream harsh delight the ring-dove murmur in the wood beneath he world-old song which she have teach the child a hundred time -- curuckity coo curuck coo you love I and i love you the wood sleep golden in the evening sunlight and over head brood like one great smile of god the everlasting blue he will right I she say ` hold thee still in the lord and abide patiently and he will make thy righteousness clear as the light and thy just deal as the noon-day ' and after that think she weep no more be it as a reward for she faith that tom begin to talk to she he have pace on by she side serious but not sad true he have suspect she he suspect she still but that scene with the die child have be no sham there at least there be nothing to suspect nothing to sneer at the calm purity self-sacrifice hope which be contain in it have soften he world-hardened spirit and wake up in he feeling which be always pleasant feeling which the sight of he father or the write to he father could only awaken quaintly enough the thought of grace and of he father seem intertwine inextricable if the old man have but such a nurse as she and for a moment he feel a glow of tenderness toward she because he think she would be tender to he father she have steal he money certainly or if not she know where it be and would not tell he well what matter just then he do not want the money at that minute how much pleasanter and wiser to take thing as they come and enjoy himself while he could and fancy that she be always what he have see she that day after all it be much more pleasant to trust people than to suspect they : handsome be who handsome do and besides she do I the kindness of save my life so it would but be civil to talk to she a little he begin to talk to she about the lovely scene around and find to he surprise that she see as much of it as he and see a great deal more in it than he she answer be short modest falter but each one of they suggestive and tom soon find that he have meet with a mind which contain all the element of poetry and need only education to develop they what a blue stock pre-raphaelite seventh-heavenarian she would have be if she have have the misfortune to be bear in that station of life but where a clever man be talk to a beautiful woman talk he will and must for the mere sake of show off though she be but a village schoolmistress and tom soon find himself with a secret sneer at he own vanity display before she all the much finer thing that he have see in he travels and as he talk she answer with quiet expression of wonder sympathy regret at she own narrow sphere of experience till as if the truth be not enough he find himself run to the very edge of exaggeration and a little over it in the enjoyment of call out she passion for the marvellous especially when call out in honor of himself and she simple creature drink it all in as sparkling wine and only dreaded lest the stream should cease adventure with noble savage in palm-fringed coral-island with greedy robber amid the fragrant hill of greece with fierce indian beneath the snow-peak of the far west with coward mexican among tunal of cactus and agave beneath the burning tropic sun -- what a man he be where have he not be and what have he not see and how he have be preserve -- for she and he image seem to she utterly beautiful and glorious clothe as it be in the beauty and glory of all that he have see and do and suffer oh love love love the same in peasant and in peer the more honor to you then old love to be the same thing in this world which be common to peasant and to peer they say that you be blind a dreamer a exaggerator -- a liar in short they know just nothing about you then you will not see people as they seem and as they have become no doubt : but why because you see they as they ought to be and be in some deep way eternally in the sight of he who conceive and create they at last she start as if wake from a pleasant dream and speak half to herself -- oh how foolish of I -- to be idle away this opportunity the only one perhaps which i may have oh mr thurnall tell I about this cholera what about it everything ever since i hear of what you have be say to the people ever since mr headley 's sermon it have be like fire in my ear i be truly glad to hear it if all parson have preach about it for the last fifteen year as mr headley do last Sunday if they have tell people plainly that if the cholera be god 's judgment at all it be he judgment of the sin of dirt and that the repentance which he require be to wash and be clean in literal earnest the cholera would be impossible in england by now oh mr thurnall : but be it not god 's do and can we stop he hand i know nothing about that miss harvey i only know that wheresoever cholera break out it be some one 's fault and if death occur some one ought to be try for manslaughter -- i have almost say murder and transport for life someone who that will be settle in the next generation when man have common sense enough to make law for the preservation of they own life against the dirt and covetousness and idleness of a set of human hog grace be silent for awhile but can nothing be do to keep it off now must it come i believe it must still one may do enough to save many life in the meanwhile enough to save many life -- life -- immortal soul too oh what could i do a great deal miss harvey say tom across whom the recollection of grace 's influence flash for the first time what a help she might be to he and he talk on and on to she and find that she enter into he plan with all she wild enthusiasm but also with sound practical common sense and tom begin to respect she intellect as well as she heart at last however she falter -- oh if i could but believe all this be it not fight against god i do not know what sort of god yours be miss harvey i believe in some one who make all that and he point round he to the glorious wood and glorious sky i should have fancy from you speech to that poor girl that you believe in he also you may however only believe in the same be in whom the methodist parson believe one who intend to hurl into endless agony every human being who have not have a chance of hear the say preacher 's nostrum for deliver man out of the hand of he who make they what do you mean asked grace startle alike by tom 's word and the intense scorn and bitterness of he tone that matter little what do you mean in turn what do you mean by say that save life be save immortal soul oh be it not give they time to repent what will become of they if they be cut off in the midst of they sin if you have a son whom it be not convenient to you to keep at home would he be a bad fellow -- the greatest scoundrel on the earth -- be a reason for you turn he into the street to live by thieve and end by go to the dog for ever and a day no but what do you mean that i do not think that god when he send a human be out of this world be more cruel than you or i would be if we transport a man because he be too bad to be in england and he show any sign of mend we give he a fresh chance in the colony and let he start again to try if he can not do better next time and do you fancy that god when he transport a man out of this world never give he a fresh chance in another -- especially when nine out of ten poor rascal have never have a fair chance yet grace look up in he face astonished oh if i could but believe that oh it would give I some gleam of hope for my two -- but no -- it be not in scripture where the tree fall there it lie and as the fool die so die the wise man and there be one account to the righteous and to the wicked and a man have no pre-eminence over a beast for both turn alike to dust and solomon do not know he say or any one else anything about the whole matter or even whether there be any life after death at all and so he say the only wise thing be to leave such deep question alone for he who make we to settle in he own way and just to fear god and keep he commandment and do the work which lie nearest we with all we might grace be silent you be surprise to hear I quote scripture and well you may be : but that same book of ecclesiaste be a very old favorite with I for i be no christian but a worlding if ever there be one but it do puzzle I why you who be a christian should talk one half-hour as you have be talk to that poor girl and the next go for information about the next life to poor old disappointed broken-hearted solomon with he three hundred and odd idolatrous wife who confess fairly that this life be a failure and that he do not know whether there be any next life at all whether tom be altogether right or not be not the question here the novelist 's business be to represent the real thought of mankind when they be not absolutely unfit to be tell and certainly tom speak the doubt of thousand when he speak he own grace be silent still well he say beyond that i can not go be no theologian but when a preacher tell people in one breath of a god who so love man that he give he own son to save they and in the next that the same god so hate man that he will cast nine-tenth of they into hopeless torture for ever -- -lrb- and if that be not hate i do not know what be -rrb- -- unless he the preacher get a chance of talk to they for a few minute -- why i should like miss harvey to put that gentleman upon a real fire for ten minute instead of he comfortable Sunday 's dinner which stand ready fry for he and which he be go home to eat as jolly as if all the world be not go to destruction and there let he feel what fire be like and reconsider he statement grace look up at he no more but walk on in silence ponder many thing howsoever that may be sir tell I what to do in this cholera and i will do it if i kill myself with work or infection you sha not do that we can not spare you from aberalva grace say tom you must save a few more poor creature ere you die out of the hand of that good being who make little child and love and happiness and the flower and the sunshine and the fruitful earth and who you say redeem they all again when they be lose by a act of love which pass all human dream do not talk so cried grace it frighten I it puzzle I and make I miserable oh if you would but become a christian and listen to the gospel yes -- oh yes a gospel mean good news i think when you have any to tell I i will listen meanwhile the news that three out of four of those poor fellow down town be go to a certain place seem to I such terribly bad news that i can not help fancy that it be not the gospel at all and so get on the best way i can listen to the good news about god which this grand old world and my microscope and my book tell I no grace i have more good news than that and i 'll confess it to you he pause and he voice soften say what the preacher may he must be a good god who make such creature as you and send they into the world to comfort poor wretch follow you own sweet heart grace and torment yourself no more with these dark dream my heart cry she look down it be deceitful and desperately wicked i wish mine be too then say tom : but it can not be as long as it be so unlike yours now stop grace i want to speak to you there be a gate in front of they lead into the road as they come to it tom linger with he hand upon the top bar that grace might stop she do stop half-frightened why do he call she grace i wish to speak to you on one matter on which i believe i ought to have speak long ago she look up at he surprise in she large eye : and turn pale as he go on i ought long ago to have beg you pardon for something rude which i say to you at you own door this day have make I quite ashamed of -- but she interrupt he quite wildly gasp for breath the belt the belt oh my god my god have you hear anything more -- anything more not a word but -- to he astonishment she heave a deep sigh as if relieve from a sudden fear he face cloud and he eyebrow rise be she guilty then after all with the quick eye of love she see the change and break out passionately -- yes suspect I suspect I if you will only give I time send I to prison innocent as i be -- innocent as that child there above -- would god i be die like she -- only give I time o misery i have hope you have forget -- that it be lose in the sea -- that -- what be i say -- only give I time -- and she drop on she knee before he wring she hand miss harvey this be not worthy of you if you be innocent as i do not doubt what more do you need -- or i he take she hand and lift she up : but she still keep look down round upward like a hunt deer and plead in word which seem sob out -- as by some poor soul on the rack -- between choke spasm of agony oh i do not know -- god help I o lord help I i will try and find it -- i know i shall find it only have patience have patience with I a little and i know i shall bring it you and then -- and then you will forgive -- forgive and she lay she hand upon he arm and look up in he face with a piteous smile of entreaty she have never look so beautiful as at that moment the devil see it and enter into the heart of thoma thurnall he catch she in he arm kiss away she tear stop she mouth with kiss yes i 'll wait -- wait for ever if you will i 'll lose another belt for such another look as that she be bewilder for a moment poor fond wretch at find herself where she would gladly have stay for ever : but quickly she recover she reason let I go she cry struggle this be not right let I go sir and she try to cover she burning cheek with she hand i will not grace i love you i love you i tell you you do not sir and she struggle still more fiercely do not deceive yourself I you can not deceive let I go i say you could not demean yourself to love a poor girl like I utterly lose he head tom run on with passionate word no sir you know that i be not fit to be you wife : and do you fancy that i -- madden now tom go on ere he be aware from a foolish deed to a base speech i know nothing but that i shall keep you in pawn for my belt till that be at least restore you be in my power grace remember that she thrust he away with so sudden and desperate a spasm that he be force to let she go she stand gaze at he a tremble deer no longer but rather a lioness at bay she face flash beautiful indignation in you power yes sir my character my life for aught i know : but not my soul send I to bodmin gaol if you will but offer no more insult to a modest maiden oh -- and she expression change to one of lofty sorrow and pity -- oh to find all man alike at heart after have fancy you -- fancy you -lrb- what she have fancy he she woman 's modesty dare not repeat -rrb- -- to find you even such another as mr trebooze tom be check as for mere indignation in such case he have see enough of that to trust it no more than ice that be one night old : but pity for he be a weapon of defense to which he be unaccustomed and there be no contempt in she pity and no affectation either she voice be solemn but tender gently upbraid like she countenance never have he feel grace 's mysterious attraction so strong upon he and for the first and last time perhaps for many a year he answer with downcast eye of shame i beg you pardon miss harvey i have be rude -- mad if you will look in you glass when you go home and have a woman 's heart in you you may at least see a excuse for I : but like mr trebooze i be not forgive and forget and let we walk home rationally and he offer to take she hand no : not now not till i can trust you sir say she the word be lofty enough : but there be a profound melancholy in they tone which humble tom still more be it possible -- she seem to have hint it -- that she have think he a very grand personage till now and that he have disgrace himself in she eye if a man have suspect tom of such a feeling i fear he would have care little save how to restore the balance by make a fool of the man who fancy he a fool : but no male self-sufficiency or pride be proof against the contempt of woman and tom slunk along by the schoolmistress 's side as if he have be one of she naughtiest school-child he try of course to brazen it out to he own conscience he have do no harm after all indeed never seriously mean any she be make a ridiculous fuss about nothing it be all part and parcel of she methodistical cant he dare say that she be not as prudish with the methodist parson and at that base think he pause for a flush of rage and a strong desire on such hypothesis to slay the say methodist parson or any one else who dare even to look sweet on grace show he plainly enough what he have long be afraid of that he be really in love with she and that as he put it if she do not make a fool of herself about he he be but too likely to end in make a fool of himself about she however he must speak to support he own character as a man of the world -- it would never do to knock under to a country girl in this way -- she might go and boast of it all over the town -- beside foiled or not he would not give in without try she mettle somewhat further miss harvey will you forgive I i have forgive you will you forget if i can she say with a marked expression which signify -lrb- though of course she do not mean tom to understand it -rrb- some of what be past be too precious and some too painful to forget i do not ask you to forget all which have pass i be afraid that there be nothing which would be any credit to you sir to have remember credit or none say tom unabashed do not forget one word that i say she look hastily and sidelong round -- that i be in you power no curse it i wish i have bite out my tongue before i have say that no that i be in you power miss harvey sir i never hear you say that and if you have the sooner anything so untrue be forget the better i say that i love you grace and if that do not mean that -- sir mr thurnall i can not i will not hear you only insult I sir by speak thus when you know that -- that you consider I -- a thief and the poor girl burst into tear again i do not i do not cry tom grow really earnest at the sight of she sorrow do i not begin this unhappy talk by beg you pardon for ever have let such a think cross my mind but you do you do you tell I as much at my own door and i have see it ever since till i have almost go mad under it i will swear to you by all that be sacred that i do not oh grace the first moment i see you my heart tell I that it be impossible and now this afternoon as i listen to you with that sick girl i feel a wretch for ever have -- grace i tell you you make I feel for the moment a better man than i ever feel in my life before a poor return i have make for that truly grace look up in he face gasp oh say that say that again oh good lord merciful lord at last oh if you know what it be to have even one weight lift off among all my heavy burden and that weight the hardest to bear god forgive I that it should have be so oh i can breathe freely now again that i know i be not suspect by you by you tom could not but see what after all no human being can conceal that grace care for he and the devil come and tempt he once more : but this time it be in vain tom 's better angel have return grace 's tender guilelessness which would with too many man only have mark she out as the easier prey be to he as a sacred shield before she innocence so noble so enthusiastic so pure he could not play the villain with that woman but there be plainly a mystery what be the burden heavier even than unjust suspicion of which she have speak there be no harm in ask but grace -- miss harvey -- you will not be angry with I if i ask -- why speak so often as if find this money depend on you alone you wish I to recover it i know and if you can counsel I why not do so why not tell I whom you suspect she old wild terror return in a instant she stop short -- suspect i suspect oh i have suspect too many already suspect till i begin to hate my fellow-creature -- hate life itself when i fancy that i see ` thief ' write on every forehead oh do not ask I to suspect any more tom be silent oh she cry after a moment 's pause oh that we be back in those old time i have read of when they use to put people to the torture to make they confess why in heaven 's name because then i should have be tortured and have confess it true or false in the agony and have be hang they use to hang they then and put they out of they misery and i should have be put out of mine and no one have be blame but I for ever more you forget say tom lose in wonder that then i should have blame you as well as every one else true yes it be a foolish faithless word i do not take it and it would have be no good to my soul to say i do lie can not prosper can not prosper mr thurnall and she stop short again what my dear grace say he kindly enough for he begin to fear that she be lose she wit i save you life you do grace then i never think to ask for payment but oh i must now will you promise I one thing in return what you will as i be a man and a gentleman i can trust you to ask nothing which be not worthy of you tom speak truth he feel -- perhaps love make he feel it all the more easily -- that whatever be behind he be safe in that woman 's hand then promise I that you will wait one month only one month : ask no question mention nothing to any living soul and if before that time i do not bring you that belt back send I to bodmin gaol and let I bear my punishment i promise say tom and the two walk on again in silence till they near the head of the village then grace go forward like nausicaa when she leave ulyss lest the townsfolk should talk and tom sit down upon a bank and watch she figure vanish in the dusk much he puzzle hunting up and down in he cunning head for a explanation of the mystery at last he find one which seem to fit the fact so well that he rise with a whistle of satisfaction and walk homewards evidently she mother have steal the belt and grace be if not a repentant accomplice -- for that he could not believe -- at least aware of the fact well it be a hard knot for she to untie poor child and on the strength of have save my life she shall untie it she own way i can wait i hope the money will not be spend meanwhile though and the empty leather return to I when want no longer however that be do already if do at all i be a fool for not act at once -- a double fool for suspect she ass that i be to take up with a false scent and throw myself off the true one my everlasting unbelief in people have punish itself this time i might have get a search-warrant three month ago and have that old witch safe in the bilbo but no -- i might not have find it after all and there would have be only a esclandre and if i know that girl 's heart she would have be ten time more miserable for she mother than for herself so it be as well as it be besides it be really good fun to watch how such a pretty plot will work itself out -- as good as a pack of harrier with a cold scent and a squat hare so live and let live only thoma thurnall if you go for to come for to go for to make such a abominable ass of yourself with that young lady any more like a miserable school-boy you will be please to make track and vanish out of these part for ever for my purse can not afford to have you marry a schoolmistress in you impoverished old age and my character which also be my purse can not afford worse one word of grace 's have fix itself in tom 's memory what do she mean by she two he contrived to ask willi that very evening oh do not you know sir she have a young brother drown a long while ago when she be sixteen or so he go out fishing on the sabbath with another like he and both be swamp wild young lad both as lad will be but she sweet maid take it so to heart that she never hold up she head since nor will i think at time to she die day humph be she fond of the other lad then sir say willi i do not think it be fair like -- not decent if you 'll excuse a old sailor -- to talk about young maid ' affair that they would not talk of themselves perhaps not even to themselves so i never ask any question myself and think it rude in I to ask any well i believe you be right good old gentleman that you be what a nobleman you would have make if you have have the luck to have be bear in that station of life i have find too much trouble in do my duty in my humble place to wish to be in any higher one so think tom to himself a girl 's fancy : but it explain so much in the character especially when the temperament be melancholic however to quote solomon once more ' a live dog be better than a dead lion ' and i have not much to fear from a rival who have be wash out of this world ten year since heyday rival quotha tom thurnall you be go to make a fool of yourself you must go sir i warn you you must flee till you have recover you sens there appear next morning in tom 's shop a new phenomenon a smart youth dress in what he consider to be the newest london fashion but which be really that translation of last year 's fashion which happen to be current in the window of the bodmin tailor tom know he by sight and name -- one mr creed a squireen like trebooze and a especial friend of trebooze 's under whose tutelage he have learn to smoke cavendish assiduously from the age of fifteen thereby improve neither he stature nor he digestion he nerve nor the intelligence of he countenance he enter with a lofty air and pause awhile as he speak be it possible say tom to himself that trebooze have send I a challenge it would be too good fun i 'll wait and see so he go on roll pill i say sir quoth the youth who have determine as a owner of land to treat the doctor duly _ de haut en bas _ and have a vague notion that a liberal use of the word sir would both help thereto and be consonant with professional style of duel diplomacy whereof he have read in novel tom turn slowly and then take a long look at he over the counter through halfshut eye-lid with chin upraise as if he have be suddenly afflict with short sight and work on meanwhile steadily at he pill that be i wish -- to speak to you sir -- ahem -- go on mr creed be gradually but surely discomfited by tom 's steady gaze do not trouble yourself sir : i see you case in you face a slight nervous affection -- will pass as the digestion improve i will make you up a set of pill for the night but i should advise a little ammonia and valerian at once may i mix it sir you mistake I sir not in the least you have bring I a challenge from mr trebooze i have sir say the youth with a grand air at once relieve by have the awful word say for he and exalt by the dignity of he first and perhaps last employment in that line well sir say tom deliberately mr trebooze do I a kindness for which i can not sufficiently thank he and you also as he second it be full six month since i fight and i be get hardly to know myself again you will have to fight now sir say the youth try to brazen off by he discourtesy increase suspicion that he have catch a tartar of course of course and of course too i fight you afterwards i -- i sir i be mr trebooze 's friend he second sir you do not seem to understand sir pardon I young gentleman say tom in a very quiet determine voice it be i who have a right to tell you that you do not understand in such matter as these i have fight my man and more than one of they while you be eat blackberry in a short jacket what do you mean sir quoth the youth in fury and begin swearing a little simple fact be you not about twenty-three year old what be that to you sir no business of mine of course you may be grow into you second childhood for aught i care : but if as i guess you be about twenty-three i as i know be thirty-six : then i fight my first duel when you be five year old and my tenth i should say when you be fifteen at which time i suppose you be not ashamed either of the jacket or the blackberry you will find I a man now sir at all event say creed justly wroth at what be after all a sophism for if a man be not a man at twenty he never will be one _ tant mieux _ you know i suppose that as the challenge i have the choice of weapon of course sir say creed in a off-hand generous tone because he do not very clearly know then sir i always fight across a handkerchief you will tell mr trebooze so he be i really believe a brave man and will accept the term you will tell yourself the same whether you be a brave man or not the youth lose the last word in those which go before they he be no coward : would have stand up to be shoot at at fifteen pace like any one else but the deliberate butchery of fight across a handkerchief -- do i understand you sir that depend on whether you be clever enough or not to comprehend you native tongue across a handkerchief i say do you hear that and tom roll on at he pill i do and when i have fight he i fight you and the pill roll steadily at the same pace but -- sir -- why -- sir because say tom look he full in the face because you call yourself a gentleman and be more shame for you one by birth dare to come here for a foolish vulgar superstition call honor to ask I a quiet medical man to go and be shoot at by a man whom you know to be a drunken profligate blackguard : simply because as you know as well as i i interfere to prevent he insulting a poor helpless girl : and in so do be force to give he what you if you be -lrb- as i believe -rrb- a gentleman would have give he also in my place i do not understand you sir say the lad blush all the while as one honestly conscience-stricken for tom have speak the exact truth and he know it do not lie sir and tell I that you do not understand you understand every word which i have speak and you know that it be true lie yes lie look you sir i have no wish to fight -- you will fight though whether you wish it or not say the youth with a hysterical laugh mean to be defiant but -- i can snuff a candle i can split a bullet on a penknife at fifteen pace do you mean to frighten we by boast we shall see what you can do when you come on the ground across a handkerchief : but on no other condition and unless you will accept that condition i will assuredly the next time i see you be we where we may treat you as i treat you friend mr trebooze i 'll do it now get out of my shop sir what do you want here interfere with my honest business and to the astonishment of mr trebooze 's second tom vault clean over the counter and rush at he open-mouthed sacred be the honor of the gallant west country : but both be friend as aristotle have it it be a sacred duty to speak the truth mr creed vanish through the open door i rid myself of the fellow jollily say tom to frank that day after tell he the whole story and no credit to I i see from the minute he come in there be no fight in he but suppose he have accept -- or suppose trebooze accept still there be my game -- to frighten he he 'll take care trebooze sha not fight for he know that he must fight next he 'll go home and patch the matter up trust he meanwhile the oaf have not even _ savoir faire _ enough to ask for my second lucky for I for i do not know where to have find one save the lieutenant and though he would have go out safe enough it would have be a bear for the good old fellow and say prank utterly take aback by tom 's business-like levity you would actually have stand to shoot and be shoot at across a handkerchief tom stick out he great chin and look at he with one of he quaint sidelong moue you be my very good friend sir : but not my father-confessor i know that : but really -- as a mere question of human curiosity -- oh if you ask I on the human ground and not on the sacerdotal i 'll tell you i have try it twice and i should be sorry to try it again though it be a very easy dodge keep you right elbow up -- up to you ear -- and the moment you hear the word fire a high elbow and a cool heart -- that be all and that win win good heaven as you be here alive you must have kill you man no i only shoot my man each through the body and each of they deserve it : but it be a ugly chance i should have be sorry to try it on that yokel the boy may make a man yet and what be more say tom burst into a great laugh he will make a man and go down to he father in peace _ quant à moi _ and so will that wretch trebooze for i 'll bet you my head to a china orange i hear no more of this matter and do not even lose trebooze 's custom upon my word i envy you sanguine temperament mr headley i shall quietly make my call at trebooze to-morrow as if nothing have happen what will you bet I that i be not receive as usual i never bet say frank then you do well it be a foolish and a dirty trick play with edge tool and cut one 's own finger nevertheless i speak truth as you will see you be a most extraordinary man all this be so contrary to you usual caution when you be drive against the rope ` hit out ' be the old rule of fistiana and common sense it be a extreme bear : all the more reason for show such a ugly front as to give people no chance of its happen again nothing so dangerous as half-measure headley ` resist the devil and he will flee from you ' you creed say mine only translate it into practice i have no liking for half-measure myself do you ever say tom hear the story of the two sandhurst broom-squire broomsquire so we call in berkshire squatter on the moor who live by tie heath into broom two of they meet in read market once and fall out : -- ` how ever do you manage to sell you broom for three halfpenny i steal the heth and i steal the bind and i steal the handle : and yet i can not afoord to sell 'em under twopence ' ah but you see ' say the other ' i steal mine ready make ' moral -- if you be go to do a thing do it outright that very evening tom come in again well i have be to trebooze and fare how just as i warn you inquire into he symptom prescribe for he digestion -- if he go on as he be do he will soon have none leave to prescribe for and finally plaster with a sublime generosity the nose which my own knuckle have contuse impossible you be the most miraculously impudent of man pish simple common sense i know that mr trebooze would suspect that the world have hear of he mishap and take care to let she know that i know by come up to inquire for he _ cui bono _ power to have they or any one a little more in my power next i know that he dare not fly out at I for fear i should tell mr trebooze what he have be after -- you see ah it be delicious to have the great oaf sit sulk under my finger longing to knock my head off and i plaster away with word of deepest astonishment and condolence i verily believe that before we part i have persuade he that he black eye proceed entirely from he have run up against a tree in the dark well say frank half sadly though enjoy the joke in spite of himself i can not help think it would have be a fit moment for give the poor wretch a more solemn lesson my dear sir -- a good lick -- and he have one and something over -- be the best lesson for that manner of biped that be the way to school he : but as we be on lesson i 'll give you a hint go on model of self-sufficiency say frank scoff at I if you will i be proof but hearken -- you must not turn out that schoolmistress she be a angel and i know it and if i say so of any human be you may be sure i have pretty good reason i be begin to be of you mind myself say frank end of vol 1 end of project
