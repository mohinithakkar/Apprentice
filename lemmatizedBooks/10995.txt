waterwitch the middle of August be come at last and with it the solemn day on which frederick viscount scoutbush may be expect to revisit the home of he ancestor elsley have gradually make up he mind to the inevitable with a stately sulkiness : and comfort himself as the time draw near with the thought that after all he brother-in-law be not a very formidable personage but to the population of aberalva in general the come event be one of awful jubilation the shipping be all deck with flag all the Sunday clothes have be look out and many a yard of new ribbon and pound of bad powder buy there have be arrangement for a procession which could not be get up for a speech which nobody would undertake to pronounce and lastly for a dinner about which last there be no hang back yea also they have hire from carcarrow church-town sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kind of music for frank have put down the old choir band at aberalva -- another of he mistake -- and there be but one fiddle and a clarionet now leave in all the town so the say town wait all the day on tiptoe ready to worship till out of the soft brown haze the stately waterwitch come slide in like a white ghost to fold she wing in aberalva bay and at that sight the town be all astir fisherman shake themselves up out of they mid-day snooze to admire the beauty as she slip on and on through water smooth as glass she hull hide by the vast curve of the balloon-jib and she broad wing boom out alow and aloft till it seem marvellous how that vast screen do not topple headlong instead of float -lrb- as it seem -rrb- self-supporting above its image in the mirror woman hurry to put on they best bonnet the sexton toddle up with the church key in he hand and the ringer at he heel the coastguard lieutenant bustle down to the manby 's mortar which he have haul out in readiness on the pebble old willi hoist a flag before he house and half-a-dozen merchant skipper do the same bang go the harmless mortar burn the british nation 's powder without leave or licence and all the rock and wood catch up the echo and kick it from cliff to cliff playing at football with it till its breath be beat out a roll fire of old musket and bird-piece crackle along the shore and in five minute a poor lad have blow a ramrod through he hand never mind lord do not visit penalva every day out burst the bell above with merry peal lord scoutbush and the waterwitch be duly ring in to the home of he lordship 's ancestor and he be receive as he scramble up the pier step from he boat by the curate the churchwarden the lieutenant and old tardrew back by half-a-dozen ancient son of anak lineal descendant of the free fisherman to whom six hundred year before st just of penalva do grant privilege hard to spell and harder to understand on the condition of receive whensoever he should land at the quay head three brass farthing from the free fisherman of aberalva scoutbush shake hand with curate lieutenant tardrew churchwarden and then come forward the three farthing in a ancient leather purse hope you lordship will do we the honor to shake hand with we too we be you lordship 's free fisherman as we have be you forefather ' say a magnificent old man gracefully acknowledge the feudal tie while he claim the exemption little scoutbush who be the kindest-hearted of man clasp the great brown fist in he little white one and shake hand heartily with every one of they say -- if you forefather be as much taller than mine as you be than I gentleman i should not wonder if they take they own freedom without ask he leave for it a lord who begin he progress with a jest that be the sort of aristocrat to rule in aberalva and all agree that evening at the mariner ' rest that he lordship be as nice a young gentleman as ever tread deal board and deserve such a yacht as he be get and long may he sail she how easy it be to buy the love of man gold will not do it : but there be a little angel may be in the corner of every man 's eye who be worth more than gold and can do it free of all charge : unless a man drive he out and hate he brother and so walk in darkness not know whither he goeth but run full butt against man 's prejudice and tread on they corn till they knock he down in despair -- and all just because he will not open he eye and use the light which come by common human good-nature presently tom hurry up have be originally one of the deputation but keep by the necessity of bind up the three finger which the ramrod have spare to poor jem burman 's hand he bow and the lieutenant -- who -lrb- frank be a little shy -rrb- act as she majesty 's representative -- introduce he as deputy medical man to we district of the union sir : mr thurnall dr heale be to have be hero by the by where be dr heale say some one very sorry my lord i can answer for he -- professional call i do not doubt -- nobody more devoted to you lordship one need not inquire where dr heale be : but if elderly man will drink much brandy-and-water in hot summer day after a heavy early dinner then will those man be too late for deputation and for more important employment never mind the doctor daresay he be asleep after dinner : do he good say the viscount hit the mark with a random shot and thereby raise he repute for sagacity immensely with he audience who laugh outright ah be it so then but -- mr thurnall i think you say -- i be glad to make you acquaintance sir i have hear you name often : you be my friend mellot 's old friend be you not i be a very old friend of claude mellot 's well and there he be on board and will be delighted to do the honor of my yacht to you whenever you like to visit she you and i must know each other better sir tom bow low -- he lordship do he too much honor : the cunning fellow know that he fortune be make in aberalva if he choose to work it out : but he humbly slip into the rear for frank have to be support not be over popular and the lieutenant may turn crusty unless he have he lordship to himself before the gaze of assemble aberalva scoutbush progress up the street bow right and leave and stop half-a-dozen time by red-cloaked old woman who curtsey under he nose and will need inform he how they know he grandfather or nurse he uncle or how he dear mother god rest she soul give I this very cloak as i have on and so forth till scoutbush come to the conclusion that they be a very loving and lovable set of people -- as indeed they be -- and he heart smite he somewhat for not have see more of they in past year no sooner be thurnall release than he be off to the yacht as fast as oar can take he and in claude 's arm now -lrb- after all salutation and inquiry have be go through -rrb- let I introduce you to major campbell and tom be present to a tall and thin personage who sit at the cabin table bend over a microscope excuse my rise say he hold out a left hand for the right be busy a single jar will give I ten minute ' work to do again i be delighted to meet you : mellot have often speak to I of you as a man who have see more and face death more carelessly than most man mellot flatter sir whatsoever i have do i have give up be careless about death for i have some one beside myself to live for marry at last have diogene find he aspasium cry claude tom do not laugh since my brother die claude the old gentleman have only I to look to you seem to be a naturalist sir a dabbler say the major with eye and hand still busy i ought not to begin we acquaintance by doubt you word : but these thing be no dabbler 's work and tom point to some exquisite photograph of minute coralline evidently take under the microscope they be mellot 's mellot turn man of science impossible no only photographer i be tire of painting nature clumsily and then see a sun-picture out-do all my effort -- so i be turn photographer and have make a vow against painting for three year and a day why the photograph only give you light and shade they will give you color too before seven year be over -- and that be more than i can do or any one else no i yield to the new dynasty the artist 's occupation be go henceforth and the painter 's studio like ` all charm must fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy ' so major campbell prepare the charming little cockyoly bird and i call in the sun to immortalise they and perfectly you be succeed they be quite new to I recollect when i leave melbourne the art have hardly rise there above guinea portrait of bearded desperado a nugget in one hand and a # 50 note in the other : but this be a new and what a forward step for science you be a naturalist then say campbell look up with interest all my profession be more or less say tom carelessly and i have be lucky enough here to fall on untrodden ground and have hunt up a few sea-monster this summer really you can tell one where to search then and where to dredge i hope i have set my heart on a fortnight 's work here and have be dream at night like a child before a twelfth-night party of all sort of impossible hydra gorgon and chimaera dire fish up from you western deep i have none of they but i can give you turbinolia milletiana and zoanthus couchii i have a party of the last gentleman alive on shore the major 's face work with almost childish delight but i shall be rob you they cost I nothing my dear sir i do very well moreover without they for five-and-thirty year and i may do equally well for five-and-thirty more i ought to be able to say the same surely answer the major compose he face again and rise carefully i have to thank you exceedingly my dear sir for you prompt generosity : but it be better discipline for a man in many way to find thing for himself than to have they put into he hand so with a thousand thanks you shall let I see if i can dredge a turbinolium for myself this be speak with so sweet and polish a modulation and yet so sadly and severely withal that tom look at the speaker with interest he be a very tall and powerful man and would have be a very handsome man both in face and figure but for the high cheekbone long neck and narrow shoulder so often see north of tweed he brow be very high and full he eye -- grave but very gentle with large droop eyelid -- be bury under shaggy gray eyebrow he mouth be gentle as he eye but compress perhaps by the habit of command perhaps by secret sorrow for of that too as well as of intellect and magnanimity thurnall think he could discern the trace he face be bronze by long exposure to the sun he close-cut curl which have once be auburn be fast turn white though he feature look those of a man under five-and-forty he cheek be as smooth shaven as he chin a right self-possessed valiant soldier he look one who could be very loving to little innocent and very terrible to full-grown knave you be practise at self-denial as usual say claude because i may at any moment have to exercise it in earnest mr thurnall can you tell I the name of this little glass arrow which i just find shooting about in the sweeping net tom do know the wonderful little link between the fish and the insect and the two chat over its strange form till the boat return to take they ashore do you make any stay here i purpose to spend a fortnight here in my favorite pursuit i must draw on you kindness and knowledge of the place to point I out lodgings lodgings as it befall be to be find and good one close to the beach and away from the noise of the harbor on mr harvey 's first floor for the local preacher who generally occupy they be away but major campbell might dislike the noise of the school the school what better music for a lonely old bachelor than child 's voice so by sunset the major be fairly establish over mr harvey 's shop it be not the place which tom would have choose he be afraid of run over poor grace if he come in and out as often as he could have wish nevertheless he accept the major 's invitation to visit he that very evening i can not ask you to dinner yet sir for my ménage will be hardly settle : but a cup of coffee and a exceedingly good cigar i think my establishment may furnish you by seven o'clock to-night -- if you think they worth walk down for tom of course say something civil and make he appearance in due time he find the coffee ready and the cigar also but the major be busy in he shirt sleeve unpack and arrange jar net microscope and what not of scientific lumber and tom proffer he help i be ashamed to make use of you the first moment that you become my guest i shall enjoy the mere handling of you tackle say tom and begin break the tenth commandment over almost every article he touch for everything be first-rate of its kind you seem to have devote money as well as think plentifully to the pursuit i have little else to which to devote either and more of both than be perhaps safe for I i should hardly complain of a superfluity of think if superfluity of money be the condition of it pray understand I i be no dive but i have learn to want so little that i hardly know how to spend the little which i have i should hardly have call that a unsafe state the penniless faquir who live on chance handful of rice have he danger as well as the rich parsee who have he venture out from madagascar to canton yes i have often envy the schemer the man of business almost the man of pleasure they many want at least absorb they in outward object instead of leave they too easily satisfied to sink in upon themselves and waste away in useless dream you find out the best cure for that malady when you take up the microscope and the collecting-box so i fancied once i take up natural history in indium year ago to drive away think as other man might take to opium or to brandy-pawnee : but like they it have become a passion now and a tyranny and i go on hunting discover wonder craving for more knowledge and -- _ cui bono _ i sometimes ask -- why this at least sir that without such man as you who work for mere love science would be now fifty year behind she present standing-point and we doctor should not know a thousand important fact which you have be kind enough to tell we while we have not time to find they out for ourselves _ sic vo non vobis _ -- yes you have the work and we have the pay which be a very fair division of labor consider the world we live in and have you be skilful enough to make science pay you here in such a out-of-the-way little world as that of aberalva must be she be a good stalking-horse anywhere and tom detail with plenty of humor the effect of he microscope and he lecture on the drop of water but he wit seem so much lose on campbell that he at last stop almost short not quite sure that he have not take a liberty no go on i beg you and do not fancy that i be not interested and amuse too because my laugh muscle be a little stiff from want of use perhaps too i be apt to take thing too much _ au grand sérieux _ but i could not help think while you be speak how sad it be that people be utterly ignorant of matter so vitally necessary to health and i perhaps ought not to jest over the subject : but indeed with cholera stare we in the face here i must indulge in some emotion and as it be unprofessional to weep i must laugh as long as i dare the major drop he coffee-cup upon the floor and look at thurnall with so horrify a gaze that tom could hardly believe he to be the same man then recollect himself he dart down upon the remains of he cup : and look up again -- a thousand pardon but -- do i hear you aright cholera stare we in the face how can it be otherwise it be draw steadily on from the eastward week by week and in the present state of the town nothing but some miraculous caprice of dame fortune 's can deliver we do not talk of fortune sir at such a moment talk of god say the major rise from he chair and pacing the room it be too horrible intolerable when do you expect it here within the month perhaps -- hardly before i should have warn you of the danger i assure you have i not understand from you that you be only go to stay a fortnight the major make a impatient gesture do you fancy that i be afraid for myself no but the thought of its come to -- to the poor people in the town you know it be too dreadful i have see it in indium -- among my own man -- among the native good heaven i never shall forget -- and to meet the fiend again here of all place in the world i fancy it so clean and healthy sweep by fresh sea-breeze and by nothing else a half-hour 's walk round would convince you sir i only wish that you could persuade he lordship to accompany you scoutbush of course he will -- he shall -- he must good heaven whose concern be it more than he you think then that there be a chance of stave it off -- by cleanse i mean if we have heavy rain during the next week or two yes if this drought last better leave ill alone we shall only provoke the devil by stir he up you speak confidently say the major gradually regain he own self-possession as he see tom so self-possessed have you -- allow I to ask so important a question -- have you see much of cholera i have work through three at pari at st petersburgh and in the west indy : and i have be think up my old experience for the last six week foresee what would come i be satisfied sir perhaps i ought to ask you pardon for the question not at all how can you trust a man unless you know he and you expect it within the month you shall go with I to lord scoutbush to-morrow and -- and now we will talk of something more pleasant and he begin again upon the zoophite tom as they chat on could not help wonder at the major 's unexpected passion and could not help remark also that in spite of he desire to be agreeable and to interest he guest in he scientific discovery he be yet distraught and full of other thought what could be the meaning of it be it mere excess of human sympathy the countenance hardly betoken that : but still who can trust altogether the expression of a weather-hardened visage of forty-five so the doctor set it down to tenderness of heart till a fresh vista open on he major campbell he soon find be as fond of insect as of sea-monster : and he begin inquire about the wood the heath the climate which seem to the doctor for a long time to mean nothing more than the question which he put plainly where have i a chance of rare insect but he seem after a while to be try to learn the geography of the parish in detail and especially of the ground round vavasor 's house however it be no business of mine thought thurnall and tell he all he want till -- then the house lie quite in the bottom of the glen be there a good fall to the stream -- for a stream i suppose there be thurnall shake he head cold boggy stewpond in the garden such as we ancestor love dam up the stream they must need have fish in lend we know and pay the penalty of it by ague and fever stewpond dam up the stream scoutbush ought to drain they instantly say the major half to himself but still the house lie high -- with regard to the town i mean no chance of malaria come up upon my word sir as a professional man that be a thing that i dare not say the chance be not great -- the house be two hundred yard from the nearest cottage : but if there be a east wind -- i can not bear this any longer it be perfect madness i trust sir that you do not think that i have neglect the matter i have point it all out i assure you to mr vavasor and it be not altered i believe it be to be alter -- that be -- the truth be sir that mr vavasor shrink so much from the very notion of cholera that -- that he do not like to do anything which may look like believe in its possibility he say quoth tom parry the question but in a somewhat dry tone that he be afraid of alarming mr vavasor and the servant the major say something under he breath which tom do not catch and then in a appease tone of voice -- well that be at least a fault on the right side mr vavasor 's brother as owner of the place be of course the proper person to make the house fit for habitation and he relapse into silence while thurnall who suspect more than meet the ear rise to depart be you go it be not late not ten o'clock yet a medical man who may be call up at any moment must make sure of he ` beauty sleep ' i will walk with you and smoke my last cigar so they go out and up to heale 's tom go in : but he observe that he companion after stand awhile in the street irresolutely go on up the hill and as far as he could see turn up the lane to vavasor 's a mystery here think he as he put matter to rights in the surgery ere go upstairs a mystery which i may as well fathom it may be of use to poor tom as most other mystery be that be though if i can do it honourably for the man be a gallant gentleman i like he and i be incline to trust he whatsoever he secret be i do not think that it be one which he need be ashamed of still ` there be a deal of human natur ' in man ' and there may be in he : -- and what matter if there be half a hour afterwards the major return take the candle from grace who be sit up for he and go upstairs with a gentle good night but without look at she he sit down at the open window and look out lean on the sill well i be too late : i daresay there be some purpose in it when shall i learn to believe that god take better care of he own than i can do i be faithless and impatient to-night i be afraid i betray myself before that man he look like one certainly who could be trust with a secret : yet i have rather that he have not mine it be my own fault like everything else foolish old fellow that you be fret and fuss to the end be not that scene a message from above say ` be still and know that i be god ' and the major look out upon the summer sea light by a million globe of live fire and then upon the wave which break in flame upon the beach and then up to the spangled star above what do i know of these with all my know not even a twentieth part of those medusa or one in each thousand of those spark among the foam perhaps i need not know and yet why be the thirst awaken in I save to be satisfy at last perhaps to become more intense with every fresh delicious draught of knowledge death beautiful wise kind death when will you come and tell I what i want to know i court you once and many a time brave old death only to give rest to the weary that be a coward 's wish and so you would not come i run you close in afghanistan old death and at sobraon too i be not far behind you and i think i have you safe among that jungle grass at aliwal but you slip through my hand -- i be not worthy of you and now i will not hunt you any more old death : do you bide you time and i mine though who know if i may not meet you here only when you come give I not rest but work give work to the idle freedom to the chained sight to the blind -- tell I a little about finer thing than zoophyte -- perhaps about the zoophyte as well -- and you shall still be brave old death my good camp-comrade now for many a year be major campbell mad that depend upon the way in which the reader may choose to define the adjective meanwhile scoutbush have walk into penalva court -- where a affect scene of reconciliation take place not in the least scoutbush kiss lucium shake hand with elsley hug the child and then settle himself in a arm-chair and talk about the weather exactly as if he have be run in and out of the house every week for the last three year and so the matter be do and for the first time a _ partie carrée _ be assemble in the dining-room the evening pass off at first as uncomfortably as it could where three out of the four be well-bred people elsley be of course shy before lord scoutbush and scoutbush be equally shy before elsley though as civil as possible to he for the little fellow stand in extreme awe of elsley 's talent and be afraid of open he lip before a poet lucium be nervous for both they sake as well she might be and valencium have to make all the talking and succeed capitally in draw out both she brother and she brother-in-law till both of they find the other on the whole more like other people than he have expect the next morning 's breakfast therefore be easy and gracious enough : and when it be over and lucium flee to household matter -- you smoke vavasor ask scoutbush vavasor do not smoke really i think poet always smoke you will not forbid my have a cigar in you garden nevertheless i suppose do walk round with I too and show I the place unless you be go to be busy oh no elsley be at lord scoutbush 's service of course and have really nothing to do so out they go charming old pigeon-hole it be say its owner i have not see it since i go into the guard campbell say it be a shame of I and so it be one i suppose but how beautiful you have make the garden look lucium be very fond of gardening say elsley who be very fond of it also and have great taste therein but he be afraid to confess any such taste before a man who he think would not understand he and that fine old wood -- full of cock it use to be -- i hope you work it well last year elsley do not shoot but he have hear there be plenty of game there plenty of cock say he guest correct he but for game the less we say about that the better i really wonder you do not shoot it fill up time so in the winter there be really no winter to fill up here thanks to this delicious climate and i have my book ah i wish i have i wish heartily say he in a confidential tone you or campbell or some of you clever man would sell I a little of they book-learning as valencium say to I ` brain be so common in the world i wonder how none fall to you share ' i do not think that they be a article which be for sale if solomon be to be believe and if they be i could not afford to buy with this irish encumber estate ' bill but now this be one thing i want to say be everything here just as you would wish of course no one could wish a better tenant but any repair you know or improvement which i ought to do of course only tell I what you think should be do for of course you know more about these thing than i do -- can not know less nothing i assure you lord scoutbush i have always leave those matter to mr tardrew ah my dear fellow you should not do that he be such a screw as all honest steward be screw I i know and i dare say have screw you too never i assure you i never give he the opportunity and he have be most civil well in future just order he to do what you like and just as if you be landlord in fact and if the old man haggle write to I and i 'll blow he up delighted to have a man of taste like you here who can improve the place for I i assure you lord scoutbush i need nothing nor do the place i be a man of very few want i wish i be sigh scoutbush pull out another of hudson 's highest-priced cigar and i be bind to say -- -lrb- and here elsley choke a little but the viscount 's frankness and humility have soften he and he determine to be very magnanimous -rrb- -- i be bind in honor after owe to you kindness such a exquisite retreat -- all that either i or lucia could have fancy for ourselves and more -- not to trouble you by ask for little matter which we really do not need and so elsley instead of simply ask to have the house-drain set right which lord scoutbush would have do upon the spot choose to be lofty-minded at the risk of kill he wife and child my dear follow you really must not ` lord ' I any more i hate it i must be plain scoutbush here among my own people just as i be in the guard ' mess-room and as for owe I any -- really it be we that be in you debt -- to see my sister so happy and such beautiful child and so well too -- and altogether -- and valencium so delighted with you poem -- and and altogether -- and there lord scoutbush stop have hoist as he consider the flag of peace once and for all and very glad that the thing be over elsley be go to say something in return but he guest turn the conversation as fast as he could and now i know you want to be busy though you be too civil to confess it and i must be with that old fool tardrew at ten to settle account : he 'll scold I if i do not -- the precise old pedant -- just as if i be he own child good-bye where be you go frederick call lucium from the window she have be watch the interview anxiously enough and could see that it have end well to old stot-and-kye at the farm : do you want anything no only i think you might be go to the yacht and valencium would have walk down with you she want to find major campbell i want to scold major campbell say valencium trip out on the lawn in she walking dress why have he not be here a hour ago i will undertake to say that he be up at four this morning he wait to be invite i suppose say scoutbush i suppose i must do it say elsley to himself sigh just like he primness say valencium i shall go down and bring he up myself this minute and mr vavasor shall come with I of course you will you do not know what a delightful person he be when once you can break the ice elsley like most vain man be of a jealous temper and valencium 's eagerness to see major campbell jar on he he want to keep the exquisite creature to himself and headley be quite enough of a intruder already beside the account of the new comer he learn he military prowess the reverence with which all even scoutbush evidently regard he make he prepare to dislike the major and all the more now he hear that there be a ice-crust to crack impulsive man like elsley especially when they self-respect and certainty of they own position be not very strong have instinctively a defiant fear of the strong calm self-contained man especially if he have see the world and elsley set down major campbell as a proud sarcastic fellow before whom he must be at the pain of be continually on he guard he wish he a hundred mile away however there be no refusing valencium anything so he get he hat but with so bad a grace that valencium see he chagrin and from mere naughtiness of heart amuse herself with it by talk all the way of nothing but major campbell and lucium she say at last will be so glad to see he again we know he so well you know in eaton square year ago really say elsley wincing i never meet he there he recollect that lucium have express more pleasure at major campbell 's come than even at that of she brother and a dark undefined phantom enter he heart which though he would have be too proud to confess it to himself be none other than jealousy oh -- do you not no it be the year before we first know you and we use to laugh at he together behind he back and christen he the wild indian because he be so gauche and shy he be a major in the indian army then : but a few month afterwards he sell out go into the line -- no one could tell why for he throw away very brilliant prospects they say and might have be a general by now instead of a mere major still but he be so improve since then he be like a elder brother to scoutbush guide he in everything i call he the blind man and the major he dog so much the worse thought elsley who dislike the notion of campbell 's have power over a man to whom he be indebted for he house-room : but by this time they be at mr harvey 's door mr harvey open it curtsey to the very ground : and valencium run upstairs and knock at the sitting-room door herself come in shout a pre-occupied voice inside be that a proper way in which to address a lady sir answer she put in she beautiful head major campbell be sit elsley could see in he shirt sleeve cigar in mouth bent over he microscope : but instead of the unexpected prim voice he hear a very gay and arch one answer be that a proper way in which to come peeping into a old bachelor 's sanctuary ma'am go away this moment till i make myself fit to be see valencia shut the door again laugh you seem very intimate with major campbell say elsley intimate i look on he as my father almost now may we come in say she knock again in pretty petulance i want to introduce mr vavasor i shall be only too happy say the major open he door -lrb- this time with he coat on -rrb- there be few person in the world whom i have more wish to know than mr vavasor and he hold out he hand and quite lead elsley in he speak in a tone of grave interest look intently at elsley as he speak valencium remark the interest -- elsley only the compliment it be a great kindness of you to call on I so soon say he i meet mr vavasor several time in year past and though i see very little of she i see enough to long much for the acquaintance of the man who have be worthy to become she husband elsley blush for he conscience smite he a little at that word worthy and mutter some commonplace civility in return valencium see it and attribute it to he usual awkwardness draw off the conversation to herself really major campbell you bring in mr vavasor and let I walk behind as i can and then let I sit three whole minute in you house without deign to speak to I ah my dear queen whim answer he return suddenly to he gay tone and how have you be misbehave yourself since we meet last i have not be misbehave myself at all mon cher saint père as mr vavasor will answer for I during the most delightful fortnight i ever spend delightful indeed say elsley as he be bind to say : but he say it with a earnestness which make the major fix he eye on he why should he not find any and every fortnight as delightful as he last say he to himself but now valencium begin banter he about he book and he animal want to look through he microscope pull off she hat for the purpose laughing when she curl blind she let they blind she in order to toss they back in the prettiest way jest at he about he old fogy at the linnaean society clap she hand in ecstasy when he answer that they be not old fogy at all but the most charming set of man in england and that -lrb- with no offence to the name of scoutbush -rrb- he be prouder of be a fl than if he be a peer of the realm -- and so forth all which harmless pleasantry make elsley cross and more cross -- first because he do not mix in it next because he could not mix in it if he try he like to be always in the seventh heaven and if other people be anywhere else he think they bore at last -- now if you will be good for five minute say the major i will show you something really beautiful i can see that answer she with the most charming impudence in another glass besides you magnify one be it so : but look here and see what a exquisite world there be of which you never dream and which behave a great deal better in its station than the world of which you do dream when campbell speak in that way valencium be good at once and as she go obediently to the microscope she whisper do not be angry with I mon saint père do not be naughty then _ ma chère enfant _ whisper he for he see something about elsley 's face which give he a painful suspicion she look long and then lift up she head suddenly -- do come and look mr vavasor at this exquisite little glass fairy like -- i can not tell what like but a pure spirit hover in some nun 's dream come elsley come and look and when he look he start for it be the very same zoophyte which thurnall have show he on a certain memorable day where do you find the fairy mon saint père i have no such good fortune mr thurnall the doctor give it I thurnall say she while elsley keep still look to hide cheek which be grow very red he be such a clever man they say where do you meet he i have often think of ask mr vavasor to invite he up for a evening with he microscope he seem so superior to the people round he it would be a charity really mr vavasor vavasor keep he eye fix on the zoophyte and say -- i shall be only too delighted if you wish it you will wish it yourself a second time chime in campbell if you try it once perhaps you know nothing of he but professionally unfortunately for professional man that too often happen know anything of he -- i i assure you not save that he attend mr vavasor and the child say vavasor look up at last : but with a expression of anger which astonish both valencium and campbell campbell think that he be too proud to allow rank as a gentleman to a country doctor and despise he from that moment though as it happen unjustly but he answer quietly -- i assure you that whatever some country practitioner may be the average of they as far as i have see be cleverer man and even of higher tone than they neighbor and thurnall be beyond the average : he be a man of the world -- even too much of one -- and a man of science and i fairly confess that what with he wit he _ savoir vivre _ and he genial good temper i have quite fall in love with he in a single evening we begin last night on the microscope and end on all heaven and earth how i should like to make a third my dear queen whim would hear a good deal of sober sense then at least on one side : but i shall not ask she : for mr thurnall and i have we deep secret together so speak the major in the simple wish to exalt tom in a quarter where he hope to get he practice and he secret be a mere jest unnecessary perhaps as he think afterwards to pass off tom 's want of orthodoxy i be a babbler then say he to himself the next moment how much better to have simply hold my tongue ah yes i know man have they secret as well as woman say valencium for the mere love of say something : but as she look at vavasor she see a expression in he face which she have never see before what be it -- all that one can picture for oneself brand into the countenance of a man unable to repress the least emotion who have work himself into the belief that thurnall have betray he secret my dear mr vavasor cry campbell of course unable to guess the truth and suppose vaguely that he be ` ill ' i be sure that -- that the sun have overpower you -lrb- the only possible thing he could think of -rrb- lie down on the sofa a minute -lrb- vavasor be actually reel with rage and terror -rrb- and i will run up to thurnall 's for salvolatile elsley who think he the most consummate of hypocrite cast on he a look which he intend to have be wither and rush out of the room leave the two stare at each other valencium be half inclined to laugh know elsley 's petulance and vanity : but the impossibility of guess a cause keep she quiet major campbell stand for full five minute not as one astounded but as one in deep and anxious thought what can be the matter mon saint père ask she at last to break the silence that there be more whim in the world than yours dear queen whim and i fear darker one let we walk up together after this man i have offend he nonsense i dare say he want to get home to write poetry as you do not praise what he have write i know he vanity and flightiness you do ask he quickly in a painful tone however i have offend he i can see and deeply i must go up and make thing right for the sake of -- for everybody 's sake then do not ask I anything lucia love he intensely and let that be enough for we the major see the truth of the last sentence no more than valencium herself do for valencium would have be glad enough to pour out to he with every exaggeration she sister 's woe and wrong real and fancy have not the sense of she own folly with vavasor keep she silent and conscience-stricken valencium remark the major 's pained look as they walk up the street you dear conscientious saint père why will you fret yourself about this foolish matter he will have forget it all in a hour i know he well enough major campbell be not the sort of person to admire elsley the more for throw away capriciously such deep passion as he have see he show any more than for show the same he must be of a very volatile temperament oh all genius be i have no respect for genius miss st just i do not even acknowledge its existence when there be no strength and steadiness of character if any one pretend to be more than a man he must begin by prove himself a man at all genius give I common sense and common decency do he give mr vavasor pray the benefit of any of these pretty flight of genius valencium be frightened she have never hear she saint père speak so severely and sarcastically and she fear that if he know the truth he would be terribly angry she have never see he angry but she know well enough that that passion when it rise in he in a righteous cause would be very awful to see and she be one of those woman who always grow angry when they be frighten so she be angry at he call she miss st just she be angry because she choose to think he be talk at she though she reasonably might have guess it see that he have scold she a hundred time for want of steadiness of character she be more angry than all because she know that she own vanity have cause -- at least disagreement -- between lucium and elsley all which -lrb- combine with she natural wish not to confess a unpleasant truth about she sister -rrb- justified she of course in answering -- miss st just do not intrude into the secret of she sister 's married life and if she do she would not repeat they major campbell sigh and walk on a few moment in silence then -- pardon miss st just i ask a rude question and i be sorry for it pardon you my dear saint père cry she almost catch at he hand never i must either believe you infallible or hate you eternally it be i that be naughty i always be but you will forgive queen whim who could help it say the major in a sad sweet tone but here be the postman may i open my letter you may do as you like now you have forgive I why what be it mon saint père a sudden shock of horror have pass over the major 's face as he read he letter : but it have soon subside into stately calm a gallant officer whom we and all the world know well be dead of cholera at he post where a man should die and my dear miss st just we be go to the crimea we -- you yes the expedition will really sail i find but not you i shall offer my service my leave of absence will in any case end on the first of September and even if it do not my health be quite enough restore to enable I to walk up to a cannon 's mouth ah mon saint père what word be these the word of a old soldier queen whim who have be so long at he trade that he have get to take a strange pleasure in it in kill no only in the chance of -- but i will not cast a unnecessary shadow over you bright soul there will be shadow enough over it soon without my help what do you mean that you and thousand more as delicate if not as fair as you will see ere long what the reality of human life be and in a way of which you have never dream and he murmur half to himself the word of the prophet -- ` thou saidst i shall sit as a lady for ever : but these two thing shall come upon thee in one day widowhood and the loss of child they shall even come upon thee ' -- no not in they fulness there be noble element beneath the crust which will come out all the purer from the fire and we shall have hero and heroine rise up among we as of old sincere and earnest ready to face they work and to do it and to call all thing by they right name once more and queen whim herself will become what queen whim might be valencium be awed as well she might have be for there be a very deep sadness about campbell 's voice you think there will be def -- disaster say she at last how can i tell that we be what we always be i doubt not scoutbush will fight as merrily as i but we owe the penalty of many sin and we shall pay it it would be as unfair perhaps as easy to make major campbell a prophet after the fact by attribute to he any distinct expectation of those mistake which have be but too notorious since much of the sadness in he tone may have be due to he habitual melancholy he strong belief that the world be deeply diseased and that some terrible purgation would surely come when it be need but it be difficult again to conceive that those error be altogether unforeseen by many a officer of campbell 's experience and thoughtfulness we will talk no more of it just now and they walk up to penalva court seriously enough well scoutbush any letter from town say the major yes you have hear what have happen at d -- barracks yes you have better take care then that the like of it do not happen here here yes i 'll tell you all presently have you hear from head-quarter yes all right say scoutbush who do not like to let out the truth before valencium campbell see it and sign to he to speak out a11 right ask valencium then you be not go ay but i be order to join my regiment by the first of October and to be shoot as soon afterwards as be fitting for the honor of my country so miss val you must be quick in make good friend with the heir-at-law or else you will not get you bill pay any more oh dear dear and valencium begin to cry bitterly it be she first real sorrow strangely enough major campbell instead of try to comfort she take scoutbush out with he and leave she alone with she tear he could not rest till he have open the whole cholera question scoutbush be honestly shock who would have dream it no one have ever tell he that the cholera have really be there before what could he do send for thurnall tom be send for and scoutbush find to he horror that what little he could have ever do ought to have be do three month ago with lord minchampstead 's improvement at pentremochyn the little man walk up and down and wring he hand he curse tardrew for not tell he the truth he curse himself for let the cottage go out of he power he curse a b and c for take the say cottage off he hand he curse up he curse down he curse all around thing which ought to have be curse and thing which really ought not -- for half of the worst sanatory sinner in this bless age of ignorance yclept of progress and science -lrb- how we grandchild will laugh at the epithet -rrb- be utterly unconscious and guiltless one but cursing leave he as it leave other man very much where he have start to do he justice he be in one thing a true nobleman for he be above all pride as be most man of rank who know what they own rank mean it be only the upstart unaccustomed to he new eminence who stand on he dignity and assert he power so scoutbush begged humbly of thurnall only to tell he what he could do you might use you moral influence my lord moral influence in a tone which imply naively enough i would better get a little moral myself before i talk of use the same you position in the parish -- my good sir quoth scoutbush in he shrewd way do you not know yourself what these fine fellow who be ready yesterday to kiss the dust off my foot would say if i ask leave to touch a single hair of they rights -- ` tell you what my lord we pay you you rent and you take it you mind you business and we 'll mind we 'n' you forget that time be change since my seventeenth progenitor be lord of life and limb over man and maid in aberalva and since you seventeenth progenitor take the trouble to live at penalva court say campbell instead of throw away what little moral influence he have by go into the guard and spend he time between rotten row and cowe hardly fair major campbell quoth tom you forget that in the old time if the lord of aberalva be responsible for he people he have also by law the power of make they obey he the long and the short of it be then say scoutbush a little tartly that i can do nothing you can put to rights the cottage which be still in you hand my lord for the rest my only remain hope lie in the last person whom one would usually depute on such a errand who be that the schoolmistress the who ask scoutbush the schoolmistress at whose house major campbell lodge and tom tell they succinctly enough to justify he strange assertion if you doubt I my lord i advise you to ask mr headley he be no friend of hers be a high churchman while she be a little inclined to be schismatic but a enemy 's opinion will be all the more honest she must be a wonderful woman say scoutbush i should like to see she and i too say campbell i pass a lovely girl on the stair last night and think no more of it lovely girl be common enough in west country port we 'll go and see she quoth he lordship meanwhile aberalva pier be astonish by a strange phenomenon a

round he and one after another come forward blush and grin to be take off soon the child gather round and when valencium and major campbell come on the pier they find claude in the midst of a ring of little dark-haired angel while a dozen honest fellow grin when they own visage appear and chaff each other about the sweetheart who be to keep they while they be out at sea and in the midst little claude laugh and joke and tell good story and give himself up the simple the sunny-hearted fellow to the pleasure of please till he earn from one and all the character of the pleasantest-spokenest gentleman that be ever into the town here be she ladyship make room for she ladyship but claude hold up a warn hand he have just arrange a masterpiece -- half-a-dozen of the prettiest child sit beneath a broken boat on spar sail block lobster-pot and what not arrange in picturesque confusion while the black-bearded sea-king round be promise they rock and bulls-eye if they would only sit still like gude maid but at valencium 's come the child all look round and jump up and curtsy and then be afraid to sit down again you have spoil my group miss st just and you must mend it valencium catch the humor regroup they all forthwith and then place herself in front of they by claude 's side now be good child look straight at I and listen and lift up she finger she begin to sing the first song of which she could think the landing of the pilgrim father she have no need to bid the child look at she and listen for not only they but every face upon the pier be fix upon she breathless spell-bound at once by she magnificent beauty and she magnificent voice as up rise leap into the clear summer air and roll away over the still blue sea that glorious melody which have now become the national anthem to the nobler half of the new world honor to woman and honor to old england that from felicium heman come the song which will last perhaps when modern europe shall have share the fate of ancient rome and greece valencium 's singing be the reflex of she own character and therefore perhaps all the more fitted to the song the place and the audience it be no modest cooing voice tender suggestive tremble with suppress emotion such as even though narrow in compass and dull in quality will touch the deepest fiber of the heart and as delicate scent will sometimes do wake up long-forgotten dream which seem memory of some antenatal life it be clear rich massive of extraordinary compass and yet full of all the graceful ease the audacious frolic of perfect physical health and strength and beauty have there be a trace of effort in it it might have be accuse of bravura : but there be no need of effort where nature have bestow already a all but perfect organ and all that be leave for science be to teach not power but control above all it be a voice which you trust after the first three note you feel that that perfect ear that perfect throat could never even by the thousandth part of a note fall short of melody and you give you soul up to it and cast yourself upon it to bear you up and away like a fairy steed whither it would down into the abyss of sadness and up to the highest heaven of joy as do those wild and rough and yet tenderhearted and imaginative man that day while every face speak new delight and hang upon those glorious note -- as one who drink from a charm cup of sparkling and foam and murmur wine -- and not one of they have he have the gift of word but might have say with the poet : -- i have no life constantium now but thee while like the world-surrounding air thy song flow on and fill all thing with melody now be thy voice tempest swift and strong on which like one in a trance upborne secure o'er rock and wave i sweep rejoice like a cloud of morn now ` tis the breath of summer night which when the starry water sleep round western isle with incense-blossom bright linger suspend my soul in its voluptuous flight at last it cease : and all man draw they breath once more while a low murmur of admiration run through the crowd too well-bred to applaud openly as they long to do do you ever hear the like of that gentleman jan or see i use to say no one could hold a candle to we grace but she -- she look like a bear queen all the time well she belong to we too so we have a right to be proud of she why here be we grace all the while true enough grace have be stand among the crowd all the while rapt like they she eye fix on valencium and full too of tear they have be call up first by the melody itself and then by a chain of thought peculiar to grace by the face round she ah if grace have be here cry one we would have have she dra'e off in the midst of the child ah that would ha ' be as nat ` ral as life silence you say gentleman jan who generally feel a mission to teach the rest of the quay good manners ` tis the gentleman 's pleasure to settle who he 'll dra ' off and not wer 'n to which abnormal possessive pronoun claude rejoin -- not a bit whatever you like i could not have a better figure for the center i 'll begin again oh do come and sit among the child grace say valencium no thank you ladyship valencium begin urge she and many a voice round old as well as young back the entreaty excuse I my lady and she slip into the crowd but as she go she speak low but clear enough to be hear by all : no : it will be time enough to flatter I and ask for my picture when you do what i tell you -- what god tell you what be that then grace dear you know i have ask you to save you own life from cholera and you have not the common sense to do it let I go home and pray for you there be a awkward silence among the man till some fellow say -- she be go mad after that doctor i think with he muck-hunting notion and grace go home to await the hour of afternoon school what a face say mellot be it not come and see she in she school when the child go in at two o'clock ah there be scoutbush and st père we be go to the school my lord do not you think that as patron of thing in general here it would look well if you walk in and signify you full approbation of what you know nothing about so much so that i be just on my way there with campbell but i must just speak to that lime-burning fellow he want a new lease of the kiln and i suppose he must have it at least here he come run at I open-mouthed and as dry as he own waistband it make one thirsty to look at he i 'll catch you up in five minute so the three go off to the school \* \* \* \* \* grace be tell in she own sweet way that charming story of the three trout which by the by have be lately pirate -lrb- as many thing be -rrb- by a religious author whose book differ sufficiently from the liberal and wholesome morality of the true author of the tale what a beautiful story grace say valencium you will surpass han anderssen some day grace blush and be silent a moment it be not my own my lady not you own i should have think that no one but you and anderssen could have make such a end to it grace give she one of those beseech half-reproachful look with which she always answer praise and then -- would you like to hear the child repeat a hymn my lady no i want to know where that story come from grace blush and stammer i know where say campbell you need not be ashamed of have read the book miss harvey i doubt not that you take all the good from it and none of the harm if harm there be grace look at he at once surprised and relieved it be a foolish romance-book sir as you seem to know it be the only one which i ever read except han anderssen 's -- which be not romance after all but the beginning be so full of god 's truth sir -- romance though it be -- and give I such precious new light about educate child that i be lead on unawares i hope i be not wrong this schoolroom prove that you be not say campbell ` to the pure all thing be pure ' what be this mysterious book i must know say valencium a very noble romance which i make mellot read once contain the ideal education of a english nobleman in the middle of the last century the fool of quality say mellot of course i think i have hear the story before what a well-written book it be too in spite of all extravagance and prolixity and how wonderfully ahead of he generation the man who write it in politics as well as in religion i must read it say valencium you must lend it I saint père not yet i think why whisper she pouting i suppose i be not as pure as grace harvey she have the child to educate who be in daily contact with coarse sin of which you know nothing -- of which she can not help know it be write in a age when the moral of we class -lrb- more shame to we -rrb- be on the same level with the moral of she class now let it alone i often have fancy i should edit a correct edition of it when i do you shall read that now miss harvey say mellot who have never take he eye off she face i want to turn schoolmaster and give you child a drawing lesson get you slate all of you and take possession of the black board and a piece of chalk claude begin sketch they imp and angel dog and horse till the school ring with shriek of delight now say he wipe the board i 'll draw something and you shall copy it and without take off he hand he draw a single line and a profile head spring up as if by magic under he firm unerring touch somebody a lady no ` taint ` tis schoolmistress you can not copy that i 'll draw you another face and he sketch a full face on the board that be my lady no it be schoolmistress again no it be not not quite sure my dear say claude half to himself then here and wipe the board once more he draw a three-quarter face which elicit a shout of approbation that be schoolmistress she very self then you can not do anything better than try and draw it i 'll show you how and go over the line again one by one the crafty claude pretend to be give a draw lesson while he be really study every feature of he model if you please my lady whisper grace to valencium i wish the gentleman would not why not oh madam i do not judge any one else : but why should this poor perish flesh be put into a picture we wear it but for a little while and be bless when we be rid of its burden why wish to keep a copy of what we long to be deliver from it will please the child grace say valencium puzzle see how they be all try to copy it from love of you who be i i want they to do thing from love of god no madam i be pained -lrb- and no offence to you -rrb- when i be ask to have my likeness take on the quay there be no sin in it of course : but let those who be go away to sea and have friend at home have they picture take : not one who wish to leave behind she no likeness of she own only christ 's likeness in these child and to paint he to other people not to be paint herself do ask he to rub it out my lady why grace we be all just wish to have a likeness of you every one have they picture take for a remembrance the saint and martyr never have theirs as far as i ever hear and yet they be not forget yet i know it be the way of great people like you i see you picture once in a book miss heale have and do not wonder when i see it that people wish to remember such a face as yours : and since i have see you i wonder still less my picture where in a book -- ` the book of beauty ' i believe they call it my dear grace say valencium laughing and blush if you ever look in you glass you must know that you be quite as worthy of a place in ` the book of beauty ' as i be grace shake she head with a serious smile every one in they place madam i can not help know that god have give I a gift : but why i can not tell certainly not for the same purpose as he give it to you for -- a simple country girl like I if he have any use for it he will use it as he do all he creature without my help at all event it will not last long a few year more perhaps a few month and it will be food for worm and then people will care as little about my look as i care now i wish my lady you would stop the gentleman mr mellot draw the child something simpler please -- a dog or a cat and she give claude a look which he obey valencium feel in a more solemn mood than usual as she walk home that day well say claude i have here every line and shade and she can not escape I i 'll go on board and paint she right off from memory while it be fresh why here come scoutbush and the major miss harvey say scoutbush try as he say to campbell to look as grand as a sheep-dog among a pack of fox-hound and very thankful all the while he have no tail to be bite off -- miss harvey i -- we -- have hear a great deal in praise of you school and so i think i should like to come and see it would you lordship like to examine the child say grace curtsey to the ground no -- thanks -- that be -- i have no doubt you teach they all that be right and we be exceedingly gratify with the way in which you conduct the school -- i say val cry scoutbush who could support the part of patron no longer what pretty little duck they be i wish i have a dozen of they come you here and down he sit on a bench and gather a group round he now be you all good child i be sure you look so say he look round into the bright pure face fresh from leaven and feeling himself the nearer heaven as he do so ah i see mr mellot 's be draw you picture he be a clever man a wonderful man be not he i can not draw you picture nor tell you story like you schoolmistress what shall i do sing to they fred say valencium and he begin warble a funny song with a child on each knee and he arm round three or four more while the little face look up into he half awe-struck at the presence of a live lord half longing to laugh but not sure whether it would be right valencium and campbell stand close together exchange look dear fellow whisper she so simple and good when he be himself and he must go to that dreadful war never mind perhaps by this very act he be earn permission to come back again a wiser and a more useful man how then be he not make friend with angel who always behold we father 's face at least he be show capability of good which god give and which therefore god will never waste now shall i sing you another song oh yes please rise from a dozen little mouth you must not be troublesome to he lordship say grace oh no i like it i 'll sing they one more song and then -- i want to speak to you miss harvey grace curtsy blush and shake all over what could lord scoutbush want to say to she that indeed be not very easy to discover at first for scoutbush feel so strongly the oddity of take a pretty young woman into he counsel on a question of sanitary reform that he feel mightily incline to laugh and begin beat about the bush in a sufficiently confused fashion well miss harvey i be exceedingly please with -- with what i have see of the school -- that be what my sister tell and the clergyman -- the clergyman think grace surprised as she well might be at what be entirely a impromptu invention of he lordship 's and -- and -- there be ten pound toward the school and -- and i will give a annual subscription the same amount mr headley receive the subscription my lord say grace draw back from the proffer note of course quoth scoutbush trust again to a impromptu : but this be for yourself -- a small mark of we sense of you -- you usefulness if any one have expect that grace be about to conduct herself during this interview in any wise like a prophetess tragedy queen or other exalted personage to stand upon she native independence and scorn the bounty of a aristocrat to read the say aristocrat a lecture on he duty and responsibility as landlord of aberalva town then will that person be altogether disappointed it would have look very well doubtless : but it would have be equally untrue to grace 's womanhood and to she notion of christianity whether all man be or be not equal in the sight of heaven be a notion which have never cross she mind she know that they would all be equal in heaven and that be enough for she meanwhile she find lord and lady on earth and see no open sin in the fact of they be richer and more powerful than she be she suppose that god have put they where they be and she accept they simply as fact of he kingdom of course they have they duty as every one have : but what they be she do not know or care to know to they own master they stand or fall she business be with she own duty and with she own class whose good and evil she understand by practical experience so when a live lord make he appearance in she school she look at he with vague wonder and admiration as a be out of some other planet for whom she have no gauge or measure : she only believe that he have vast power of do good unknown to she and be delighted by see he condescend to play with she child the truth may be degrading but it must be tell people of course who know the hollowness of the world and the vanity of human wealth and honor and be accustom to live with lord and lady see through all that just as clearly as any american republican do and care no more about walk down pall-mall with the marquis of caraba who can get they a place or a living than with mr two-shoe who can only borrow ten pound of they but grace be a poor simple west-country girl and as such we must excuse she if curtsey to the very ground with tear of gratitude in she eye she take the ten-pound note say to herself thank the good lord this will just pay mother 's account at the mill likewise we must excuse she if she tremble a little be a young woman -- though be also a lady she lose no jot of self-possession -- when he lordship go on in as important a tone as he could -- and -- and i hear miss harvey that you have a great influence over these child 's parent i be afraid some one have misinform you lordship say grace in a low voice ah quoth scoutbush in a tone mean to be reassure it be quite proper in you to say so what eye she have and what hair and what hand too -lrb- this be of course speak mentally -rrb- but we know better and we want you to speak to they whenever you can about keep they house clean and all that in case the cholera should come and scoutbush stop it be a quaint errand enough and besides as he tell mellot frankly i could think of nothing but those wonderful eye of hers and how like they be to la signora 's grace have be look at the ground all the while now she throw upon he one of she sudden startled look and answer slowly as she eye drop again : i have my lord but they will not listen to I will not listen to you then to whom will they listen to god when he speak himself say she still look on the ground scoutbush wince uneasily he be not accustom to solemn word speak so solemnly do you hear this campbell miss harvey have be talk to these people already and they will not hear she miss harvey i dare say be not astonish at that it be the usual fate of those who try to put a little common sense into they fellow-men well and i shall at all event go off and give they my mind on the matter though i suppose -lrb- with a glance at grace -rrb- i can not expect to be hear where miss harvey have not be oh my lord cry grace if you would but speak -- and there she stop for be it she place to tell he he duty no doubt he have wiser people than she to counsel he but the moment the party leave the school grace drop into she chair she head fall on the table and she burst into a agony of weep which bring the whole school round she oh my darling my darling cry she at last look up and clasp they to she by two and three be there no way of save you no way then we must make the more haste to be good and be all ready when jesus come to take we and shake off she passion with one strong effort she begin teach those child as she have never teach they before with a voice a look as of stephen himself when he see the heaven open for that burst of weep be the one single overflow of long pent passion disappointment and shame she have try indeed ever since tom 's conversation and frank 's sermon have pour in a flood of new light on the meaning of epidemic and bodily misery and death itself she have be work as only she could work exhort explain coax warn entreat with tear offer to perform with she own hand the most sickening office to become if no one else would the common scavenger of the town there be no depth to which in she noble enthusiasm she would not have go down and behold it have be utterly in vain ah the bitter disappointment of find she influence fail she utterly the first time that it be require for a great practical work they would let she talk to they about they soul then -- they would even amend a few sin here and there of which they have be all along as well aware as she but to be convince of a new sin to have they laziness pride covetousness touch that she find be what they would not bear and where she have expect if not thanks at least a fair hearing she have be meet with peevishness ridicule even anger and insult she mother have turn against she why would she go get a bad name from every one and drive away customer the preacher who be -lrb- as be too common in west-country village -rrb- narrow ignorant and somewhat unscrupulous man turn against she they have consider the cholera if it be to come as so much spiritual capital for themselves a occasion which they could improve into a sensation perhaps a revival and to explain it upon mere physical cause be to rob they of they harvest coarse virago go even farther still and dare to ask she whether it be the curate or the doctor she be set she cap at : for she never have anything in she mouth now but what they have say and those word go through she heart like a sword be she disinterested be not love for thurnall the wish to please he mingle with all she earnestness and again be not self-love mingle with it and mingle too with the disappointment even indignation which she feel at have fail ah -- what hitherto hide spot of self-conceit vanity pharisaic pride that bitter trial lay bare or seem to lay till she learn to thank she unseen guide even for it perhaps she have more reason to be thankful for she humiliation than she could suspect with she narrow knowledge of the world perhaps that sudden downfall of she fancied queenship be need to shut she out once and for all from that downward path of spiritual intoxication follow by spiritual knavery which as have be hint be but too easy for she but meanwhile the whole thing be but a fresh misery to bear the burden of cassandra day and night see in fancy -- which yet be truth -- the black shadow of death hanging over that doomed place to dream of whom it might sweep off -- perhaps worst of all she mother unconfessed and impenitent too dreadful and dreadful too the private trouble which be thicken fast and which seem instead of draw she mother to she side to estrange she more and more for some mysterious reason she mother be heavily in debt this ten pound of lord scoutbush 's would certainly clear off the miller 's bill she scanty quarter 's salary which be just due would clear off a little more but there be a long-standing account of the wholesale grocer 's for five-and-twenty pound for which mr harvey have give a two month ' bill that bill would become due early in September : and how to meet it neither mother nor daughter know it lay like a black plague-spot on the future only surpass in horror by the cholera itself it might have be three or four day after that claude lounge after breakfast on deck be hail from a dingy which contain captain willi and gentleman jan might we take the liberty of come aboard to speak with you honor by all means and up the side they come they face evidently big with some great purpose and each desirous that the other should begin you speak captain say jan you be oldest and then he begin himself if you please sir we be come on a sort of deputation -- why do not

delighted to see two good seaman here so come along and down they go bowie bring these gentleman some sherry cry claude turn over he portfolio now then my worthy friend be that the sort of thing you

not have believe it you have get the very smile of she and the sadness of she too as if you would know she a hundred year ` tis beautiful sigh jan half to himself poor fellow he have cherish perhaps hope of win grace after all well will that suit you why sir make so bold : -- but what we think on be to have she draw from head to foot and a child standing by she like hold to she hand for a token as she be schoolmistress and the pier behind maybe to signify as she be we maid and belong to aberalva a capital think upon my word you be man of taste here in the west but what do you think i should

claude now i 'll show you some more sketch i should like to know sir ask willis how you get at that likeness she would not hear of the thing and that be why i have no liking to come troubling you about nothing claude tell they and jan laugh heartily while willi say -- do you know sir that be a relief to my mind there be no sin in be draw of course but i do not like to think my maid have change she mind when once she would make it up so the deputation retire in high glee after willi have entreat claude and beer to keep the thing a secret from grace it befall that claude know no reason why he should not tell frank headley tell he the whole story as a proof of the chivalry of he parishioner in which he would take delight frank smile but say little he opinion of grace be alter fast a circumstance which occur a few day after altered it still more scoutbush have go forth as he threaten and explode in every direction with such effect as be to be suppose everybody promise he lordship to do everything but when he lordship 's back be turn everybody do just nothing they know very well that he could not make they do anything and what be more in some of the very worst case the evil be past remedy now and better leave alone for the drought go on pitiless a copper sun a sea of glass a brown easterly blight day after day while thurnall look grimly aloft and mystify the sailor with -- fine weather for the fly dutchman this coffin sail fastest in a calm you would best all out to the quay-head and whistle for a wind : it would be a ill one that would blow nobody good just now but the wind come not nor the rain and the cholera creep nearer and nearer : while the heart of all in aberalva be harden and out of very spite against the agitator they do less than they would have do otherwise even the inhabitant of the half-a-dozen cottage which scoutbush find that they be in he own hand whitewash by main force fill the town with lamentation over he lordship 's tyranny true -- they pig-stye be either under they front window or within two foot of the wall : but to pull down a poor man 's pig-stye -- they might ever so well be rooshian slave -- and all the town be on they side for pig be the normal inhabitant of aberalva back-yard tardrew 's wrath of course know no bound and meeting thurnall standing at willi 's door with frank and mellot he fall upon he open-mouthed well sir i have a crow to pick with you pick away quoth tom what business have you meddle between he lordship and I that be my concern quoth tom who evidently be not disincline to quarrel i be not here to give a account to you of what i choose to do i 'll tell you what sir ever since you have be in this parish you have be meddle you and mr headley too -- i 'll say it to you face -- i 'll speak the truth to any man gentle or simple and that be not enough for you but you must come over that poor half-crazed girl to set she plaguing honest people with tell 'em they 'll all be dead in a month till nobody can eat they supper in peace : and that again be not enough for you but you must go to my lord with you -- hold hard quoth tom do not start two hare at once let 's hear that about miss harvey again miss harvey why you should know better than i let 's hear what you know why ever since that night trebooze catch you and she together -- stop say tom that be a lie everybody say so then everybody lie that be all and you may say i say so and take care you do not say it again yourself but what ever since that night why i suppose you come over the poor thing somehow as you seem mind to do over every one as you can but she be be run up and down the town ever since preach to 'em about windilation and drain and smell and cholera and its be a judgment of the lord against dirt till she be frightened all the woman so that many 's the man as have have to forbid she he house -- but you know that as well as i i never hear a word of it before : but now i have i 'll give you my opinion on it that she be a noble sensible girl and that you be all a set of fool who be not worthy of she and that the greatest fool of the whole be you mr tardrew and when the cholera come it will serve you exactly right if you be the first man carry off by it now sir you have give I you mind and i have give you mine and i do not wish to hear anything more of you good morning you hold you head mighty high to be sure since you have have the run of he lordship 's yacht if you be impertinent sir you will repent it i shall take care to inform he lordship of this conversation my dear thurnall say headley as tardrew withdraw mutter curse the old fellow be certainly right on one point what then that you have wonderfully change you tone who be to eat any amount of dirt if he could but save he influence thereby i have alter my plan i sha not stay here long : i shall just see this cholera over and then vanish no yes i can not sit here quietly listen to the war-news it make I mad to be up and do i must eastward-ho and see if trump will not turn up for I at last why i know the whole country half-a-dozen of the language -- oh if i could get some secret-service work go i must at worst i can turn my hand to doctoring bashi-bazouk my dear tom when will you settle down like other man cry claude i would now if there be a opening at whitbury and low as life would be i would face it for my father 's sake but here i can not stay both claude and headley see that tom have reason which he do not choose to reveal however claude be take into he confidence that very afternoon i shall make a fool of myself with that schoolmistress i have be near enough to it a dozen time already and this magnificent conduct of hers about the cholera have give the finish stroke to my brain if i stay on here i shall marry she : i know i shall and i will not -- i would go to-morrow if it be not that i be bind for my own credit to see the cholera safe into the town and out again tom do not hint a word of the lose money or of the month 's delay which grace have ask of he the month be draw fast to a close now however : but no sign of the belt still tom have honor enough in he to be silent on the point even to claude by the by have you hear from the wanderer this week i hear from sabina this morning marie be very poorly i fear they have be at kissingen bathing and be go to bertrich : somebody have recommend the bath there bertrich where 's bertrich the most delicious little nest of a place half way up the moselle among the volcano crater do not know it have they find that yankee no why i think sabina have a whole detective force of pet and protégés from boulogne to rome well she have at least hear of he at baden and then again at stuttgard : but he have escape they as yet and poor marie be break she heart all the while i 'll tell you what claude it will be well for he if he escape I as well as they what do you mean i certainly sha not go to the east without shake hand once more with marie and sabina and if in so do i pass that fellow it be a pity if i do not have a snap shot at he tom tom i have hope you duelling day be over they will be over when one can get the law to punish such puppy but not till then hang the fellow what business have he with she at all if he do not intend to marry she i tell you as i tell you before it be she who will not marry he and yet she be break she heart for he i can see it all plain enough claude she have find he out only too late i know he -- luxurious selfish blazé would give a thousand dollar to-morrow i believe like the old roman for a new pleasure : and then amuse himself with she till he break she heart of course she will not many he : because she know that if he find out she quadroon blood -- ah that be it i 'll lay my life he have find it out already and that be why he have bolt claude have no answer to give that talk at the exhibition make it only too probable you think so yourself i see very well you know that whatever i have be to other that girl have nothing against I nothing against you why she owe you honor life everything never mind that only when i take a fancy to begin i 'll carry it through i take to that girl for poor wyse 's sake and i 'll behave by she to the last as he would wish and he who insult she insult I i will not go out of my way to find stangrave : but if i do i 'll have it out then you will certainly fight my dearest tom do look into you own heart and see whether you have not a grain or two of spite against he leave i assure you you judge he too harshly hum -- that must take its chance at least if we fight we fight fairly and equally he be a brave man -- i will do he that justice -- and a cool one and use to be a sweet shot so he have just as good a chance of shooting I if i be in the wrong as i have of shoot he if he be but you father i know that be very disagreeable and all the more so because i be go to insure my life -- a pretty premium they will make I pay -- and if i be kill in a duel it will be forfeit however the only answer to that be that either i sha not fight or if i do i sha not be kill you know i do not believe in be kill claude tom tom the same as ever say claude sadly well old man and what else would you have I nobody could ever alter I you know and why should i alter myself here i be after all alive and jolly and there be old daddy as comfortable as he ever can be on earth : and so it will be to the end of the chapter there let 's talk of something else chapter xvi come at last now as if in all thing tom thurnall and john brigg be fate to take opposite side campbell lose ground with elsley as fast as he gain it with thurnall elsley have never forgive himself for he passion that first morning he have show campbell he weak side and fear and dislike he accordingly beside what might not thurnall have tell campbell about he and what use might not the major make of he secret besides elsley 's dread and suspicion increase rapidly when he discover that campbell be one of those man who live on term of peculiar intimacy with many woman whether for he own good or not still for the good of the woman concern for only by honest purity and moral courage superior to that of the many be that dangerous post earn and woman will listen to the man who will tell they the truth however sternly and will bow as before a guardian angel to the strong insight of he whom they have once learn to trust but it be a dangerous office after all for layman as well as for priest that of father-confessor the experience of century have show that they must need exist wherever father neglect they daughter husband they wife wherever the average of the woman can not respect the average of the man but the experience of century should likewise have teach man that the say father-confessor be no object of envy that they temptation to become spiritual coxcomb -lrb- the worst species of all coxcomb -rrb- if not intriguer bully and worse be so extreme that the soul which be proof against they must be either very great or very small indeed whether campbell be altogether proof will be see hereafter but one day elsley find out that such be campbell 's influence and do not love he the more for the discovery they be walk round the garden after dinner scoutbush be lick he foolish lip over some commonplace tale of scandal i tell you my dear fellow she be book and mellot know it as well as i he see she that night at lady a 's we see the third act of the comi-tragedy the fourth be play out now we shall see the fifth before the winter non sine sanguine say the major serve the wretched stick right at least say scoutbush what right have he to marry such a pretty woman what right have they to marry she up to he say claude i do not blame poor January i suppose none of we gentleman would have refuse such a pretty toy if we could have afford it as he could whom do you blame then ask elsley father and mother who prate hypocritically about keep they daughter ' mind pure and then abuse a girl 's ignorance in order to sell she to ruin let they keep she mind pure in heaven 's name but let they consider themselves all the more bind in honor to use on she behalf the experience in which she must not share well drawl scoutbush i do not complain of she bolting she be a very sweet creature and always be : but as longreach say -- and a very witty fellow he be though you laugh at he -- ` if she would keep to we i should not have mind : but as guardsman we must throw she over it be a insult to the whole guard my dear fellow after refuse two of we to marry a attorney and after all to bolt with a plunger ' what bolt with a plunger might signify elsley know not : but ere he could ask the major rejoin in a abstracted voice -- god help we all and this be the girl i recollect two year ago singing there in cavendish square as innocent as a nestle thrush poor child say mellot sell at first -- perhaps sell again now the plunger have bill out and she have ready money i know she settlement she sha not do it say the major quietly : i 'll write to she to-night elsley look at he keenly you think then sir that you can by simply write stop this intrigue the major do not answer he be deep in thought i should not wonder if he do say scoutbush two to one on he baulk the plunger she be at lord -- 's now at those silly private theatricals be he there no say mellot he try hard for a invitation -- stoop to work I and sabina i believe she tell he that she would sooner see he in the morgue than help he and he be go to the moor now i believe there be time then : i will write to she to-night and campbell take up he hat and go home to do it ah say scoutbush take he cigar meditatively from he mouth i wonder how he do it it be a gift i always say a wonderful gift before he have be a week in a house he 'll have the confidence of every woman in it -- and ` gad he do it by say the rudest thing -- and the confidence of all the youngster the week after a somewhat dangerous gift say elsley drily ah yes he might play trick if he choose : but there be the wonder that he do not i would answer for he with my own sister i do every day of my life -- for i believe he know how many pin she put into she dress -- and yet there he be as i say once in the mess-room -- there be a youngster there who take on himself to be witty and talk about the still sow sup the milk -- the snob you recollect he mellot the attorney 's son from brompton who sell out -- we shave he mustachio put a bear in he bed and send he home to he ma -- and he say that major campbell might be very pious and all that : but he would warrant -- they be the fellow 's own word -- that he take he lark on the sly like other man -- the snob so i tell he i be no better than the rest and no more i be but if any man dare to say that the major be not as honest as he own sister i be he man at fifteen pace and so i be claude all which do not increase elsley 's love to the major conscious as he be that lucium 's confidence be a thing which he have not wholly and which it would be very dangerous to he for any other man to have at all into the drawing-room they go frank headley have be ask up to tea and he stand at the piano listen to valencium 's singing as they come in the maid come in also mr thurnall wish to speak to major campbell campbell go out and return in two minute somewhat hurriedly mr thurnall wish lord scoutbush to be inform at once and i think it be better that you should all know it -- that -- it be a painful surprise : -- but there be a man ill in the street whose symptom he do not like he say cholera say elsley call he in say scoutbush he have rather not come in he say what be it infectious certainly not if it be cholera but -- he do not wish to frighten people quite right : -lrb- with a half glance at elsley -rrb- but be it cholera honestly i fear so oh my child say poor mr vavasor will five pound help the poor fellow say scoutbush how far off be it ask elsley unpleasantly near i be go to advise you to move at once you hear what they be say ask valencium of frank yes i hear it say frank in a quiet meaning tone valencium think that he be half pleased with the news then she think he afraid for he do not stir you will go instantly of course of course i shall good-bye do not be afraid it be not infectious afraid and a soldier 's sister say valencium with a toss of she beautiful head by way of give force to she somewhat weak logic frank leave the room instantly and meet thurnall in the passage well headley it be here before we send for it as bad luck usually be i know let I go where be it whose house ask frank in a excited tone humph say thurnall look intently at he that be just what i shall not tell you not tell I no you be too pale headley go back and get two or three glass of wine and then we will talk of it what do you mean i must go instantly it be my duty -- my parishioner look here headley be you and i to work together in this business or be we not why not in heaven 's name then i want you not for cure but for prevention you can do they no good when they have once get it you may prevent dozen from have it in the next four-and-twenty hour if you will be guide by I but my business be with they soul thurnall exactly -- to give they the consolation of religion as they call it you will give they to the people who have not take it you may bring they safe through it by simply keep up they spirit while if you waste you time on poor die wretch -- thurnall you must not talk so i will do all you ask : but my place be at the death-bed as well as elsewhere these perish soul be in my care and how do you know pray that they be perish answer tom with something very like a sneer and if they be do you honestly believe that any talk of yours can change in five minute a character which have be form for year or prevent a man 's go where he ought to go -- which i suppose be the place to which he deserve to go i do say frank firmly well it be a charitable and hopeful creed my great dread be lest you should kill the poor wretch before they time by add to the fear of cholera the fear of hell i catch the methodist parson at that work a hour ago take he by the shoulder and shoot he out into the street but my dear headley -lrb- and tom lower he voice to a whisper -rrb- wherever poor tom beer deserve to go to he be go to it already he have be dead this twenty minute tom beer dead one of the finest fellow in the town and i never send for do not speak so loud or they will hear you i have no time to send for you and if i have i should not have send for he be past attend to you from the first he bring it with he i suppose from c -- have have warning for a week and neglect they now listen to I : that man be but two hour ill as sharp a case as i ever see even in the west indy you must summon up all you good sense and play the man for a fortnight for it be come on the poor soul like hell say tom between he tooth and stamp he foot upon the ground frank have never see he show so much feeling he fancy he could see tear glisten in he eye i will so help I god say frank tom hold out he hand and grasp frank 's i know you will you be all right at heart only mind three thing : do not frighten they do not tire yourself do not go about on a empty stomach and then we can face the worst like man and now go in and say nothing to these people if they take a panic we shall have some of they down to-night as sure as fate go in keep quiet persuade they to bolt anywhere on earth by daylight to-morrow then go home eat a good supper and come across to I and if i be out i 'll leave word where frank go back again he find campbell who have have he cue from tom urge immediate removal as strongly as he could without declare the extent of the danger valencium be for send instantly for a fly to the nearest town and go to stay at a watering-place some forty mile off elsley be willing enough at heart but hesitate he know not at the moment poor fellow where to find the money he wife know that she could borrow of valencium but she too be against the place the cholera would be in the air for mile round the journey in the hot sun would make the child sick and ill and watering-place lodgings be such horrid hole never ventilate and full of smell -- people catch fever at they so often valencium be incline to treat this as mother 's nonsense but major campbell say gravely that mr vavasor be perfectly right as to fact and she argument full of sound reason whereon valencium say that of course if lucium think it major campbell would prove it and there be no argue with such solon as he -- which elsley hear and ground he tooth whereon little scoutbush cry joyfully -- i have it why not go by sea take the yacht and go where of course i have it again ` pon my word i be grow clever valencium in spite of all you prophecy go up the welsh coast nothing so healthy and airy as a sea-voyage : sea as smooth as a mill-pond too and likely to be and then land if you like at port madoc as i mean to do and there be my room at beddgelert lie empty engage they a week ago think i should be there by now so you may as well keep they air for I come valencium pack up you millinery lucium get the cradle ready and we 'll have they all on board by twelve capital plan vavasor be not if and by jove what stunning poetry you will write there under snowdon but will you not want you room yourself lord scoutbush say elsley my dear fellow never mind I i shall go across the country i think see a old friend and get some otter-hunting do not think of I till you be there and then send the yacht back for I she must be do something you know and the man be only get drunk every day here come -- no argue about it or i shall turn you all out of door into the lane eh and the little fellow laugh so good-naturedly that elsley could not help like he : and feel that he would be both a fool and cruel to he family if he refuse so good a offer he give in to the scheme and go out to arrange matter : while scoutbush go out into the hall with campbell and scramble into he pea-jacket to go off to the yacht that moment you 'll see to they there be a good fellow as they light they cigar at the door that vavasor be greener than grass you know _ tant pi _ for my poor sister i be not go not go certainly not so my room will be at they service and you have much better escort they yourself it will be much less disagreeable for vavasor who know nothing of command sailor or himself think the major than find himself master of you yacht in you absence and you will get you fishing as you intend but why be you go to stay oh i have not half do with the sea-beast here i find too new one yesterday quaint old beetle-hunter you be for a man who have fight in half-a-dozen battle and scoutbush walk on silently for five minute suddenly he break out -- i can not by george i can not and what be more i will not what run away it will look so -- so cowardly and there be the truth of it before those fine fellow down there : and just as i be come among they too the commander-in-chief to turn tail at the first shot though i can not be of any use i know and i should have like a fortnight 's fishing so say he in a dolorous voice before go to be eat up with fly at varna -- for this crimean expedition be all moonshine do not be too sure of that say campbell we shall go and some of we who go will never come back freddy i know those russian better than many and i have be talk they over lately with thurnall who have be in they service have he be at sevastopol no almost the only place on earth where he have not be : but from all he say and from all i know we be undervalue we foe as usual and shall smart for it we 'll lick they never fear yes but not at the first round scoutbush you life have be child 's play as yet you be go now to see life in earnest -- the sort of life which average people have be live in every age and country since adam 's fall a life of sorrow and danger tear and blood mistake confusion and perplexity and you will find it a very new sensation and at first a very ugly one all the more reason for do what good deed you can before you go for you may have no time leave to do any on the other side of the sea scoutbush be silent awhile well i be afraid of nothing i hope : only i wish one could meet this cholera face to face as one will those russian with a good sword in one 's hand and a good horse between one 's knee and have a chance of give he what he bring instead of be kick off by the cowardly rockite no one know how and not even from behind a turf dyke but out of the very cloud so we all say in every battle scoutbush who ever see the man who send the bullet through he and yet we fight on do you not think the greatest terror the only real terror in any battle be the chance shot which come from no one know where and hit no man can guess whom if you go to the crimea as you will you will feel what i feel at the cape and cabul and the punjab twenty time -- the fear of die like a dog one know not how and yet i 'll fight campbell of course you will and take you chance do so now by jove campbell -- i always say it -- you be the most sensible man i ever meet and by jove the doctor come the next my sister shall have the yacht and i 'll go up to penalva you will do two good deed at once then say the major you will do what be right and you will give heart to many a poor wretch here believe I scoutbush you will never repent of this by jove it always do one good to hear you talk in that way campbell one feel -- i do not know -- so much of a man when one be with you not that i sha not take uncommonly good care of myself old fellow that be but fair : but as for run away as i say why -- why -- why i can not and so i will not by the by say the major there be one thing which i have forget and which they will never recollect be the yacht victual -- with fresh meat and green stuff i mean whew -- w -- i will go back borrow a lantern and forage in the garden like a old campaigner i have cut a salad with my sword before now and make it in you helmet with macassar sauce and the two go they way meanwhile before they have leave the room a notable conversation have be go on between valencium and headley headley have re-enter the room so much paler than he go out that everybody notice he altered look valencium choose to attribute they to fear so be you return from the sick man already mr headley ask she in a marked tone i have be forbid by the doctor to go near he at present miss st just say he quietly but in a sort of under-voice which hint that he wish she to ask no more question a shade pass over she forehead and she begin chat rather noisily to the rest of the party till elsley she brother and campbell go out valencium look up at he expect he to go too mrs vavasor begin bustling about the room collect little valuable and look over she shoulder at the now unwelcome guest but frank lean back in a cosy arm-chair and do not stir he hand be clasp on he knee he seem lose in think very pale : but there be a firm set look about he lip which attract valencium 's attention once he look up in valencium 's face and see that she be look at he a flush come over he cheek for a moment and then he seem as impassive as ever what could he want there how very gauche and rude of he so unlike he too and she say civilly enough to he i fear mr headley we must begin pack up now i fear you must indeed answer he as if start from a dream he speak in a tone and with a look which make both the woman start for what they mean it be impossible to doubt i fear you must i have foresee it a long time and so i fear -lrb- and he rise from he seat -rrb- must i unless i mean to be very rude you will at least take away with you the knowledge that you have give to one person 's existence at least for a few week pleasure more intense than he think earth could hold i trust that pretty compliment be mean for I say lucium half playful half reproving i be sure that it ought not to have be mean for I say valencium more downright than she sister both could see for whom it be mean by the look of passionate worship which frank fix on a face which after all seem make to be worship i trust that neither of you answer he quietly think I impertinent enough to pretend to make love as it be call to miss st just i know who she be and who i be gentleman as i be and the descendant of gentleman -lrb- and frank look a little proud as he speak and very handsome -rrb- i see clearly enough the great gulf fix between we and i like it for it enable I to say truth which i otherwise dare not have speak as a brother might say to a sister or a subject to a queen either analogy will do equally well and equally ill frank without the least intend it have take up the very strongest military position let a man once make a woman understand or fancy that he know that he be nothing to she and confess boldly that there be a great gulf fix between they which he have no mind to bridge over : and then there be little that he may not see or do for good or for evil and therefore it be that lucium answer gently i be sure you be not well mr headley the excitement of the night have be too much for you do i look excited my dear madam he answer quietly i assure you that i be as calm as a man must be who believe that he have but a few day to live and trust too that when he die he will be infinitely happier than he ever have be on earth and lay down a office which he have never discharge otherwise than ill which have be to he a constant source of shame and sorrow do not speak so say valencium with she irish impetuous generosity you be unjust to yourself we have watch you feel for you honor you even when we differ from you -- what more she would have say i know not but at that moment elsley 's peevish voice be hear call over the stair lucia lucium oh dear he will wake the child cry lucium look at she sister as much as to say how can i leave you run run my dear creature say valencium with a self-confident smile : and the two be leave alone the moment that mr vavasor leave the room there vanish from frank 's face that intense look of admiration which have make even valencia uneasy he drop he eye and he voice falter as he speak again he acknowledge the change in they position and valencium see that he do so and like he the better for it i shall not repeat miss st just now that we be alone what i say just now of the pleasure which i have have during the last month i be not poetical or give to string metaphor together and i could only go over the same dull word once more but i could ask if i be not ask too much leave to prolong at least a shadow of that pleasure to the last moment that i shall die shortly and of this cholera be with I a fix idea which nothing can remove no madam -- it be useless to combat it but have i anything by which to the last moment i could bring back to my fancy what have be its sunlight for so long even if it be a scrap of the hem of you garment aye a grain of dust off you foot -- god forgive I he and he mercy ought to be enough to keep I up : but one 's weakness may be excuse for cling to such slight float straw of comfort valencium pause startle and yet affect how she have play with this deep pure heart and yet be it pure do he wish by exciting she pity to trick she into give he what he might choose to consider a token of affection and she answer coldly enough -- i should be sorry after what you have just say to chance hurt you by refuse i put it to you own good feeling -- have you not ask somewhat too much certainly too much madam in any common case say he quite unmoved certainly too much if i ask you for it as i do not as the token of a affection which i know well you do not can not feel but -- take my word as they stand -- be you to -- it would be return if i die in a few week and return still sooner if i live and madam say he lower he voice i vow to you before he who see we both that as far as i be concerned no human be shall ever know of the fact frank have at last touch the wrong chord what mr headley can you think that i be to have secret in common with you or with any other man no sir if i grant you request i should avow it as openly as i shall refuse it and she turn sharply toward the door frank headley be naturally a shy man : but extreme need sometimes bestow on shyness a miraculous readiness -- -lrb- else why in the long run do the shy man win the best wife which be a fact and may be prove by statistics at least as well as anything else can -rrb- so he quietly step to valencium 's side and say in a low voice -- you can not avow the refusal half as proudly as i shall avow the request if you will but wait till you sister 's return both be unnecessary i think : but it will only be a honor to I to confess that poor curate as i be -- hush and valencium walk quietly up to the table and begin turn over the leaf of a book to gain time for she softened heart and puzzle brain in five minute frank be beside she again the book be tennyson 's princess she have wander -- who can tell why -- to that last exquisite scene which all know and as valencium read frank quietly lay a finger on the book and arrest she eye at last -- if you be what i think you some sweet dream stoop down and seem to kiss I ere i die valencia shut the book up hurriedly and angrily a moment after she have make up she mind what to do and with the slightest gesture in the world motion frank proudly and coldly to follow she back into the window have she be a country girl she would have avoid the ugly matter but she be a woman of the world enough to see that she must for she own sake and he talk it out reasonably what do you mean mr headley i must ask you tell I just now that you have no intention of make love to I i tell you the truth say he in he quiet impassive voice i fix on these line as a _ pi aller _ and they have do all and more than i wish by bring you back here for at least a moment and do you suppose -- you speak like a rational man therefore i must treat you as one -- that i can grant you request why not it be a uncommon one if i have guess you character aright you be able to do uncommon thing have i think you enslave by etiquette and by the fear of a world which you can make bow at you foot if you will i should not have ask you but -- and here he voice take a tone of deepest earnestness -- grant it -- only grant it and you shall never repent it never never never will i cast one shadow over a light which have be so glorious so life-giving which i watch with delight and yet lose without regret go you way and god be with you i go mine grant I but a fortnight 's happiness and then let what will come he have conquer the quiet earnestness of the voice the child-like simplicity of the manner of which every word convey the most delicate flattery -- yet she could see without intend to flatter without a after-thought -- all these have win the impulsive irish nature for all the duke and marquis in belgravium she would not have do it for they would have mean more than they say even when they speak more clumsily : but for the plain country curate she hesitate and ask herself what shall i give he the rose from she bosom no that be too significant at once and too commonplace besides it might wither and he find a excuse for not restore it it must be something valuable stately formal which he must need return and she draw off a diamond hoop and put it quietly into he hand you promise to return if i promise long ago he take it and lift it -- she think that he be go to press it to he lip instead he put it to he forehead bow forward and move it slightly she see that he make with it the sign of the cross i thank you he say with a look of quiet gratitude i expect as much when you come to understand my request again thank you and he draw back humbly and leave she there alone while she heart smite she bitterly for all the foolish encouragement which she have give to one so tender and humble and delicate and true and so do frank headley get what he want by that plain earnest simplicity which have more power -lrb- let worldling pride themselves as they will on they knowledge of woman -rrb- than all the cunning wiles of the most experienced rake and only by ape which after all can the rake conquer it be a strange thing for valencium to do no doubt : but the strange thing which be do in the world -lrb- which be some million daily -rrb- be just what keep the world alive chapter xvii baalzebub 's banquet the next day there be three cholera case : the day after there be thirteen he have come at last baalzebub god of fly and of what fly be breed from to visit he self-blinded worshipper and bestow on they he own cross of the legion of dishonor he have come suddenly capriciously sportively as he sometimes come as he have come to newcastle the summer before while yet the rest of england be untouched he have wander all but harmless about the west country that summer as if he maw have be full glutted five year before when he sit for many a week upon the dartmoor hill amid the dull brown haze and sun-burnt bent and dried-up watercourse of white dusty granite look far and wide over the plague-struck land and listen to the dead-bell boom all day long in tavistock churchyard but he be come at last with appetite more fierce than ever and have dart aside to seize on aberalva and not to let it go till he have suck he fill and all man move about the street slowly fearfully conscious of some awful unseen presence which might spring on they from round every corner some dreadful inevitable spell which lay upon they like a nightmare weight and walk to and fro warily look anxiously into each other 's face not to ask how be you but how be i do i look as if -- and glance up ever and anon restlessly as if they expect to see like the greek in they tainted camp by troy the pitiless sun-god shooting he keen arrow down on beast and man all night long the curdled cloud lay low upon the hill wrap in its hot blanket the swelter breathless town and roll off sullenly when the sun rise high to let he pour down he glare and quicken into evil life all evil thing for baalzebub be a sunny fiend and love not storm and tempest thunder and lash rain but the broad bright sun and broad blue sky under which he can take he pastime merrily and laugh at all the shame and agony below and as he do at he great banquet in new orlean once madden all heart the more by the contrast between the pure heaven above and the foul hell below and up and down the town the foul fiend sport now here now there snap daintily at unexpected victim as if to make confusion worse confound : to belie thurnall 's theory and prognostic and harden the heart of fool by fresh excuse for believe that he have nothing to do with drain and water that he be only -- such a only -- the visitation of god he have take old beer 's second son and now he clutch at the old man himself then across the street to gentleman jan he eldest : but he be drive out from both house by chloride of lime and peat dust and the colony of the beer have peace awhile alas there be victim enough and to spare beside they too ready for the sacrifice and up the main street he go unabashed spring in at one door and at another on either side of the street but fondest of the western side where the hill slope steeply down to the house-back he flesh he tooth on every kind of prey the drunken cobbler die of course : but spotless cleanliness and sobriety do not save the mother of seven child who have be soak she brick floor daily with water from a poison well defile where she mean to clean youth do not save the buxom lass who have be fill herself as girl will do with unripe fruit : nor innocence the two fair child who be sail they feather-boat yesterday in the quay-pool as they have sail they for three year past and find no hurt piety do not save the bed-ridden old dame bed-ridden in the lean-to garret who moan it be the lord and die it be the lord to she though baalzebub himself be the angel of release and yet all the while sot and fool escape where wise man fall weakly woman live amid all wretchedness nurse unharmed strong man who have breathe fresh air all day of one word of scripture at least baalzebub be mindful for one be take and another leave still there be a method in he seeming madness he eye fall on a blind alley run back from the main street back at the upper end by a high wall of rock there be a god-send for he -- a devil 's - send rather to speak plain truth : and in he dash and never leave that court let brave tom wrestle with he as he may till he have take one from every house that court belong to treluddra the old fish-jowder he must do something thurnall attack he major campbell headley the neighbor join in the cry for there be no mistaking cause and effect there and no one bear a great love to he besides terrify and conscience-stricken man be glad of a scapegoat and some of those who be he stoutest backer in the vestry be now in they terror the loudest against he ready to impute the whole cholera to he indeed old beer be ready to declare that it be treluddra 's fish-heap which poison he and he : so all but mob the old sinner go up -- to set the house to rights no to curse the whole lot for a set of pig and order they to clean the place out themselves or he will turn they into the street he be one of those base nature whom fact only lash into greater fury -- a pharaoh whose heart the lord himself can only harden such man there be and woman too grown gray in lie to reap at last the fruit of lie but he carry back with he to he fish-heap a little invisible somewhat which he do not bring and ere nightfall he be dead hideously he he wife he son : -- and now the beer be down again and the whole neighborhood of treluddra 's house be wild with disgusting agony now the fiend be hover round the fish-curing house : but turn back disgust with the pure scent of the tan-yard where not hide but net be bark skip on board of a brig in the quay-pool and a poor collier 's ` prentice die and go to he own place what harm have he do be it he sin that ill-fed and well-beaten daily he have be leave to sleep on board just opposite the sewer 's mouth in a berth some four foot long by two foot high and broad or be it that poor girl 's sin who be just now in heale 's shop talk to miss heale safe and sound that she be carry back into it in half-an-hour 's time faint shriek one must draw a veil over the too hideous detail no not she fault : but there at least the curse have not come without a cause for she be tardrew 's daughter but whither have we get how long have the cholera be in aberalva five day five minute or five year how many sun have rise and set since frank headley put into he bosom valencium 's pledge it would be hard for he to tell and hard for many more : for all the day have pass as in a fever dream to coward the time have seem endless and every moment ere they term shall come a age of terror of self-reproach of superstitious prayer and cry which be not repentance and to some coward too the day have seem but as a moment for they have be drunk day and night strange and hideous yet true it have now become a mere commonplace the strange power which great crisis pestilence famine revolution invasion have to call out in they highest power for evil and for good alike the passion and virtue of man how during they stay the most desperate recklessness the most ferocious crime side by side with the most heroic and unexpected virtue be follow generally by a collapse and a moral death alike of virtue and of vice we should explain this now-a-days and not ill by say that these crisis put the human mind into a state of exaltation : but the truest explanation after all lie in the old bible belief that in these time there go abroad the unquenchable fire of god literally kindle up all man 's heart to the highest activity and show by the light of they own strange deed the inmost recess of they spirit till those spirit burn down again self-consumed while the chaff and stubble be leave as ash not valueless after all as manure for some future crop and the pure gold if gold there be alone remain behind even so it be in aberalva during that fearful week the drunkard drink more the swearer swear more than ever the unjust shopkeeper clutch more greedily than ever at the last few scrap of mean gain which remain for he this side the grave the selfish wrap themselves up more brutally than ever in selfishness the shameless woman mingle desperate debauchery with fit of frantic superstition and all base soul cry out together let we eat and drink for to-morrow we die but many a brave man and many a weary woman possess they soul in patience and work on and find that as they day they strength should be and to they the day seem short indeed for there be too much to be do in they for any note of time headley and campbell grace and old willi and last but not least tom thurnall -- these and three or four brave woman organise themselves into a right-gallant and well-disciplined band and commence at once a visitation from house to house save thereby doubtless many a life : but ere eight-and-forty hour be pass the house visitation languish it be as much as they could do to attend to the acute case and little scoutbush he could not nurse nor doctor : but what he could he do he buy and fetch all that money could procure he gallop over to the justice and obtain such summary power as he could and then like a true irishman exceed they recklessly break into premise right and left in a utterly burglarious fashion he organise he fatigue-party as he call they of scavenger and pay the cowardly clod five shilling a day each to work at remove all removable nuisance he walk up and down the street for hour give the sailor cigar from he own case just to show they that he be not afraid and therefore they need not be : and if it be somewhat he fault that the horse be steal he at least do he best after the event to shut the stable-door the five real worker toil on meanwhile in perfect harmony and implicit obedience to the all-knowing tom but with the most different inward feeling four of they seem to forget death and danger but each remember they in he own fashion major campbell long to die and court death frank believe that he should die and be ready for death grace long to die but know that she should not die till she have find tom 's belt and be content to wait willi be of opinion that a old man must die some day and somehow -- as good one way as another and all he concern be to run about after he maid see that she do not tire herself and obey all she order with sailor-like precision and cleverness and tom he just think nothing about death and danger at-all always smile always cheerful always busy yet never in a hurry he go up and down seemingly ubiquitous sleep he get when he could and food as often as he could into the sea he leap morning and night and come out fresher every time the only person in the town who seem to grow healthier and actually happier as the work go on you really must be careful of yourself say campbell at last you carry no charmed life my dear sir i be the most cautious and selfish man in the town i be live by rule i have get -- and what greater pleasure -- a good stand-up fight with a old enemy and be sure i shall keep myself in condition for it i have write off for help to the board of health and i shall not be shove against the rope till the government man come down and then i shall go to bed and sleep for a month never mind I but mind yourself : and mind that curate he be a noble brick -- if all parson in england be like he i would -- what be here now miss heale come shriek down the street oh mr thurnall miss tardrew miss tardrew scream will only make you ill too miss where be miss tardrew in the surgery -- and my mother i expect this say tom the old man will go next he go into the surgery the poor girl be in collapse already mr heale be lie on the sofa stricken the old man hang over she brandy bottle in hand put away that trash cry tom you have have too much already oh mr thurnall she be die and i shall die too you you be all right this morning but i shall die i know i shall and go to hell you 'll go where you ought and if you give way to this miserable cowardice you 'll go soon enough walk out sir make yourself of some use and forget you fear leave mr heale to I the wretched old man obey he utterly cow and go out : but not to be of use : he have be hopelessly boozy from the first -- half to fortify he body against infection half to fortify he heart against conscience tom have never reproach he for he share in the public folly indeed tom have never reproach a single soul poor wretch who have insult he have send for he with abject shriek oh doctor doctor save I oh forgive I oh if i would mind what you say oh do not think of what i say and tom have answer cheerfully tut-tut never mind what might have be let 's feel you pulse but though tom do not reproach heale heale reproach himself he have just conscience enough leave to feel the whole weight of he abused responsibility exaggerate and defile by superstitious horror and maudlin tipsy he wander about the street moan that he have murder he wife and all the town and ask pardon of every one he meet till see one of the meeting-house open he stagger in in the vain hope of comfort which he know he do not deserve in half-an-hour tom be down the street again to headley 's where be miss harvey at the beer ' she must go up to heale 's instantly the mother will die those case of panic seldom recover and miss heale may very likely follow she she have shriek and sob herself into it poor fool and grace must go to she at once she may bring she to common sense and courage and that be the only chance grace go and literally talk and pray miss heale into life again you be a angel say tom to she that very evening when he find the girl past danger mr thurnall say grace in a tone of sad and most mean reproof but you be and these owl be not worthy of you this be no time for such language sir after all what be i do more than you and grace go upstairs again with a cold hard countenance which belie utterly the heart within that be the critical night of all the disease seem to have do its worst in the likeliest spot : but case of panic increase all the afternoon and the gross number be greater than ever tom do not delay inquire into the cause : and he discover it headley come out the next morning after two hour ' fitful sleep meet he at the gate : he usual business-like trot be exchange for a fierce and hurry stamp when he see frank he stop short and burst out into a story which be hardly intelligible so interlarded be it with oath for heaven 's sake thurnall calm yourself and do not swear so frightfully it be so unlike you what can have upset you thus why should i not curse and swear in the street gasp he while every fellow who call himself a preacher be allow to do it in the pulpit with impunity fine he five shilling for every curse as you might if people have courage and common sense and then complain of I i be a fool i know though but i can not stand it to have all my work undo by a brutal ignorant fanatic -- it be too much here if you will believe it be those preach fellow get up a revival or some such invention just to make money out of the cholera they have get down a great gun from the county town twice a-day they be preach at they tell they that it be all god 's wrath against they sin that it be impious to interfere and that i be fight against god and the end of the world be come and they and the devil only know what if i meet one of they i 'll wring he neck and be hang for it oh you parson you parson and tom ground he tooth with rage be it possible how do you find this out mr heale have be in listen to they howling just before she be take heale go in when i turn he out of door come home rave mad and be all but blue now three case of woman have i have this morning all frighten into cholera by they own confession by last night 's tomfoolery -- come home howl faint and be take before morning one be dead the other two will die you must stop it or i shall have half-a-dozen more to-night go into the meeting and curse the cur to he face i can not cry frank with a gesture of despair i can not ah you cloth forbid you i suppose to enter the non-conformist opposition shop you be unjust thurnall what be such rule at a moment like this i would break they and the bishop would hold I guiltless but i can not speak to these people i have no eloquence -- no readiness -- they do not trust I -- would not believe I -- god help I and frank cover he face with he hand and burst into tear not that for heaven 's sake say tom or we shall have you blue next my good fellow i would go myself but they would not hear I for certain i be no christian i suppose : at least i can not talk they slang : -- but i know who can we 'll send campbell frank hail the suggestion with rapture and away they go : but they have a hour 's good search from sufferer to sufferer before they find the major he hear they quietly a severe gloom settle over he face i will go say he at six o'clock that evening the meeting-house be fill with terrify woman and half-curious half-sneering man and among they the tall figure of major campbell in he undress uniform -lrb- which he have put on wisely to give a certain dignity to he mission -rrb- stalk in and take he seat in the back bench the sermon be what he expect there be no need to transcribe it such discourse may be hear often enough in church as well as chapel the preacher 's object seem to be -- for some purpose or other which we have no right to judge -- to excite in he hearer the utmost intensity of selfish fear by language which certainly as tom have say come under the law against profane cursing and swearing he describe the next world in language which seem a strange jumble of virgil 's aeneid the koran the dream of those rabbi who crucify we lord and of those mediaeval inquisitor who try to convert sinner -lrb- and on they own ground neither illogically nor over-harshly -rrb- by make this world for a few hour as like as possible to what so they hold god be go to make the world to come for ever at last he stop suddenly when he see that the animal excitement be at the very highest and call on all who feel convinced to come forward and confess they sin in another minute there would have be -lrb- as there have be ere now -rrb- four or five young girl rave and toss upon the floor in mad terror and excitement or possibly half the congregation might have rush out -lrb- as a congregation have rush out ere now -rrb- head by the preacher himself and run headlong down to the quay-pool with shriek and shout declare that they have cast the devil out of betsey pennington and be hunting he into the sea : but campbell see that the madness must be stop at once and rise he thunder in a voice which bring all to they sens in a moment -- stop i too have a sermon to preach to you i trust i be a christian man and that not of last year 's making or the year before follow I outside if you be rational being and let I tell you the truth -- god 's truth man he say with a emphasis on the word you at least will give I a fair hearing and you too modest married woman leave that fellow with the shameless hussy who like to go into fit at he foot the appeal be not in vain the soberer majority follow he out the insane minority soon follow in the mere hope of fresh excitement while the preacher be fain to come also to guard he flock from the wolf campbell spring upon a large block of stone and take off he cap open he mouth and spake unto they \* \* \* \* \* reader will doubtless desire to hear what major campbell say : but they will be disappointed and perhaps it be better for they that they should be let each of they if they think it worth while write for themselves a discourse fitting for a christian man who love and honor he bible too much to find in a few scattered text all misinterpret and some mistranslate excuse for deny fact reason common justice the voice of god in he own moral sense and the whole remainder of the bible from begin to end whatsoever word he speak they come home to those wild heart with power and when he pause and look intently into the face of he auditory to see what effect he be produce a murmur of assent and admiration rise from the crowd which have now swell to half the population of the town and no wonder no wonder that as the man be enchain by the matter so be the woman by the manner the grand head like a gray granite peak against the clear blue sky the tall figure with all its martial stateliness and ease the gesture of he long arm so graceful and yet so self-restrained the tone of he voice which pour from beneath that proud moustache now tender as a girl 's now ring like a trumpet over roof and sea there be old man there old beyond the year of man who say they have never see nor hear the like : but it must be like what they father have tell they of when john wesley on the cliff of st ive out-thunder the thunder of the gale to grace he seem one of the old scotch covenanter of whom she have read rise from the dead to preach there from he rock beneath the great temple of god 's air a wider and a juster creed than theirs frank draw thurnall 's arm through he and whisper i shall thank you for this to my die day : but thurnall hold down he head he seem deeply move at last half to himself -- humph i believe that between this man and that girl you will make a christian even of I some day but the lull be only for a moment for major campbell look round discern among the crowd the preacher whisper and scowl amid a knot of woman and a sudden fit of righteous wrath come over he stand out there sir you preacher and look I in the face if you can thunder he we be here on common ground as free man beneath god 's heaven and god 's eye stand out sir and answer I if you can or be for ever silent half in unconscious obedience to the soldier-like word of command half in jealous rage the preacher step forward gasp for breath -- do not listen to he he be a messenger of satan send to damn you -- a lie prophet let the lord judge between I and he stop you ear -- a messenger of satan -- a jesuit in disguise you lie and you know that you lie answer campbell twirl slowly he long moustache as he always do when choke down indignation but you have call on the lord to judge so do i listen to I sir dare you in the presence of god answer for the word which you have speak this day a strange smile come over the preacher 's face i read my title clear sir to mansion in the sky well for you if you could do the same be it only the set sun or be it some inner light from the depths of that great spirit which shine out in all he countenance and fill he eye with awful inspiration as he speak in a voice calm and sweet sad and regretful and yet terrible from the slow distinctness of every vowel and consonant mansion in the sky you need not wait till then sir for the presence of god now here you and i be before god 's judgment-seat now here i call on you to answer to he for the innocent life which you have endanger and destroy for the innocent soul to whom you have slander they heavenly father by you devil 's doctrine this day you have say it let the lord judge between you and I he know best how to make he judgment manifest he bow he head awhile as if overcome by the awful word which he have utter almost in spite of himself and then step slowly down from the stone and pass through the crowd which reverently make way for he while many voice cry thank you sir thank you and old captain willi step forward hold out he hand to he a quiet pride in he gray eye you will not refuse a old fighting man 's thanks sir this have be like elijah 's day with baal 's priest on carmel campbell shake he hand in silence : but turn suddenly for another and a coarser voice catch he ear it be jone the lieutenant 's and now my lad take the methodist parson neck and heel and heave he into the quay pool to think over he summons campbell go back instantly no my dear sir let I entreat you for my sake what have pass have be too terrible to I already if it have do any good do not let we break it by spoil the law i believe you be right sir : but my blood be up and no wonder why where be the preacher he have stand quite still for several minute after campbell 's adjuration he have often perhaps himself hurl forth such word in the excitement of preach but never before have he hear they pronounce in spirit and in truth and as he stand thurnall who have he doctor 's eye on he see he turn paler and more pale suddenly he clench he tooth and stoop slightly forwards for a moment draw he breath thurnall walk quickly and steadily up to he gentleman jan and two other riotous fellow have already lay hold of he more with the intention of frightening than of really duck he do not do not cry he look round with eye wild -- but not with terror hand off my good lad say tom quietly this be my business now not yours i can tell you and pass the preacher 's arm through he own with a serious face tom lead he off into the house at the back of the chapel in two hour more he be

paralyse cold pulseless but quite collect and cheerful tom look inquire shake he head and call for a hot bath of salt and water warmth we must have somehow anything to keep the fire alight why so sir

thank god i always know what you be and say it they have find you out in the last week and there be not a man in the town but what would die for you i believe this announcement stagger frank some man it would have only harden in they pedantry and have embolden they to say : ah then these man see that a high churchman can work like any one else when there be a practical sacrifice to be make now i have a standing ground which no one can dispute from which to go on and enforce my idea of what he ought to be but rightly or wrongly no such thought cross frank 's mind he be just as good a churchman as ever -- why not just as fond of he own ideal of what a parish and a church service ought to be -- why not but the only thought which do rise in he mind be one of utter self-abasement oh how blind i have be how i have waste my time in lay down the law to these people : fancy myself infallible as if god be not as near to they as he be to I -- certainly nearer than to any book on my shelf -- offend they little prejudice little superstition in my own cruel self-conceit and self-will and now the first time that i forget my own rule the first time that i forget almost that i be a priest even a christian at all that moment they acknowledge I as a priest as a christian the moment i meet they upon the commonest human ground help they as one heathen would help another simply because he be he own flesh and blood that moment they soften to I and show I how much i might have do with they twelve month ago have i have but common sense he kneel down and pray by the old man for he and for himself would it be trouble you sir say the old man at last but i would like to take the sacrament before i go of course whom shall i ask in the old man pause awhile i fear it be selfish : but it seem to I i would not ask it but that i know i be go i should like to take it with my maid once more before i die i 'll go for she say frank the moment thurnall come back to watch you what need to go yourself sir old sarah will go and willing thurnall come in at that moment i be go to fetch miss harvey where be she captain at janey headon 's along with she two poor child stay say tom that be a bad quarter just at the fish-house back have some brandy before you start no no dutch courage and frank be go he have a word to say to grace harvey and it must be say at once he turn down the silent street and turn up over stone stair through quaint stone gallery and balcony such as be often huddle together on the cliff side in fishing town into a stifle cottage the door of which have be set wide open in the vain hope of fresh air a woman meet he and clasp both he hand with tear of joy they be mend sir they be mend else i would have send to tell you i never look for you so late there be a gentle voice in the next room it be grace 's ah she be pray by they now she be give they all they medicine all along whatever i should have do without she -- and in and out all day long too till one fancy at while the lord must have change she into five or six at once to be everywhere to the same minute frank go in and listen to she prayer she face be as pale and calm as the pale calm face of the two worn-out babe whose head lay on the pillow close to hers : but she eye be light up with a intense glory which seem to fill the room with love and light frank listen : but would not break the spell at last she rise look round and blush i beg you pardon sir for take the liberty if i have know that you be about i would have send : but hear that you be go home i think you would not be offend if i give thanks for they myself they be my own sir as it be -- oh miss harvey do not talk so while you can pray as you be pray then he who would silence you might be silencing unaware the lord himself she make no answer though the change in frank 's tone move she and when he tell she he errand that thought also pass from she mind at last happy happy man she say calmly and put on she bonnet follow frank out of the house miss harvey say frank as they hurry up the street i must say one word to you before we take that sacrament together sir it be well to confess all sin before the eucharist and i will confess mine i have be unjust to you i know that you hate to be praise so i will not tell you what have alter my opinion but heaven forbid that i should ever do so base a thing as to take the school away from one who be far more fit to rule in it than ever i shall be grace burst into tear thank god and i thank you sir oh there be never a storm but what some gleam break through it and now sir i would not have tell you it before lest you should fancy that i change for the sake of gain -- though perhaps that be pride as too much else have be but you will never hear of I inside either of those chapel again what have alter you opinion of they then it would take long to tell sir : but what happen this morning fill the cup i begin to think sir that they god and mine be not the same though why should i judge they who worship that other god myself till no such long time since and never know poor fool that the lord 's name be love i have find out that too in these last day more shame to I than to you that i do not know it before well for we both that we do know it now sir for if we believe he now sir to be aught but perfect love how could we look round here to-night and not go mad aman say frank and how have the pestilence of all thing on earth reveal to those two noble soul that god be love let the reader if he have supply campbell 's sermon answer the question for himself they go in and upstairs to willis grace bent over the old man tenderly but with no sign of sorrow dry-eyed she kiss the old man 's forehead arrange he bed-clothes woman-like before she kneel down and then the three receive the sacrament together do not turn I out whisper tom it be no concern of mine of course but you be all good creature and somehow i should like to be with you so tom stay and what thought pass through he heart be no concern of ours frank put the cup to the old man 's lip the lip close sip -- then open the jaw have fall go say grace quietly frank pause awe-struck go on sir say she in a low voice he hear it all more clearly than he ever do before and by the dead man 's side frank finish the communion service grace rise when it be over kiss the calm forehead and go out without a word tom say frank in a whisper come into the next room with I tom hardly hear the tone in which the word be speak or he would perhaps have answer otherwise than he do my father take the communion say he half to himself at least it be a beautiful old -- howsoever the sentence would have be finish tom stop short -- hey -- what do that mean at last gasp frank gently enough excuse I he be bow almost double crush thurnall 's arm in the fierce gripe of pain pish -- hang it -- impossible -- there you be all right now for the time i can understand many thing now curious sensation it be though can you conceive a sword put in on one side of the waist just above the hip-bone and draw through handle and all till it pass out at the opposite point i have feel it twice and therefore you will be please to hold you tongue and go to bed have you have any warning yes -- no -- that be -- this morning : but i forget never mind -- what matter a hundred year hence i there it be again -- god help I humph growled thurnall to himself i would sooner have lose a dozen of these herring-hog whom nobody miss and who be well out of they life-scrape : but the parson just as he be make a man there be no use in complaint in half a hour frank be scream like a woman though he have bite he tongue half through to stop he scream chapter xviii the black hound pah let we escape anywhere for a breath of fresh air for even the scent of a clean turf we have be watch saint and martyr -- perhaps not long enough for the good of we soul but surely too long for the comfort of we body let we away up the valley where we shall find it not indeed a fresh healthful breeze -lrb- for the drought last on -rrb- at least a cool refreshing down-draught from carcarrow moor before the sun get up it be just half-past four o'clock on a glorious August morning we shall have three hour at least before the heaven become one great dutch-oven again we shall have good company too in we walk for here come campbell fresh from he morning 's swim swing up the silent street toward frank headley 's lodging he stop and toss a pebble against the window-pane in a minute or two thurnall open the street-door and slip out to he ah major overslept myself at last that sofa be wonderfully comfortable no time to go down and bathe ill get my header somewhere up the stream how be he he sleep like a babe and get well as fast as he soul will allow he body he have something on he mind nothing to be ashamed of though i will warrant for a purer nobler fellow i never meet when can we move he oh to-morrow if he will agree you may all depart and leave I and the government man to make out the return of kill and wound we shall have no more cholera eight day without a new case we shall do now i be glad you be come up with we i will just see the hound throw off and then go back and get headley 's breakfast no no you must not sir : you want a day 's play not half as much as you and i be in no hunting mood just now do you take you fill of the wood and the stream and let I see we patient i suppose you will be back by noon certainly and the two swing up the street and out of the town along the vale toward trebooze for trebooze of trebooze have invite they and lord scoutbush and certain other to come out otter-hunting and otter-hunting they will go trebooze have be sorely exercise during the last fortnight between fear of the cholera and desire of call upon lord scoutbush -- as i ought to do of course as one of the gentry round he be a whig of course and no more to I than anybody else but one do not like to let politics interfere by which trebooze gloss over to himself and friend the deep hunkeydom with which he lusteth after a live lord 's acquaintance and one especially in whom he hope to find even such a one as himself good fellow i hear he be too -- good sportsman smoke like a chimney and so forth so at last when the cholera have all but disappear he come down to penalva and introduce himself half swaggering half servile begin by a string of apology for not have call before -- mrs trebooze so afraid of infection you see my lord -- which be a lie : then blunder out a few fulsome compliment to scoutbush 's courage in stay then take heart at a little joke of scoutbush 's and try the free and easy style finger he lordship 's high-priced hudson and give a broad hint that he would like to smoke one on the spot which hint be not take any more than the bet of a pony which he offer five minute afterwards that he will jump he irish mare in and out of aberalva pound be utterly throw on he haunch -lrb- as he inform he friend mr creed afterwards -rrb- by scoutbush 's praise of tom thurnall as a invaluable man a treasure in such a out-of-the-way place and really better company than ninety-nine man out of a hundred recover himself again when scoutbush ask after he otter-hound of which he have hear much praise from tardrew and launch out once more into sport conversation of that graceful and lofty stamp which may be peruse and perpend in the page of handley cross and mr sponge 's sport tour book painfully true to that uglier and baser side of sport life which they clever author have choose so wilfully to portray so at least say scoutbush to himself when he visitor have depart he be just like a page out of sponge 's tour though he be not half as good a fellow as sponge himself for sponge know he be a snob and live up to he call honestly : but this fellow want all the while to play at be a gentleman and -- ugh how the fellow smell of brandy and worse he hand too shake as if he have the palsy and he chatter and fidgett like a man with st vitus 's dance do he my lord quoth tom thurnall when he hear the same in a very mean tone and trebooze for he part could not make out that lord -- uncommonly agreeable and easy and all that : but shove a fellow off and set he down somehow and in such a -- civil way that you do not know where to have he however trebooze depart in high spirit for lord scoutbush have deign to say that he will be delighted to see the otter-hound work any morning that trebooze like and anyhow -- no time too early for he he will bring he friend major campbell by all means expect two or three sport gentleman from the neighborhood too regular good one my lord -- though they be county buck -- very much honor to make you lordship 's acquaintance scoutbush express himself equally honor by make they acquaintance in a tone of bland simplicity which utterly puzzle trebooze who go a step further you lordship 'll honor we by take pot luck afterwards can not show you french cookery you know and you souffley and glacy and all that honest saddle o ' mutton and the grounds of old port -- my father lay it down and i take it up eh and trebooze give a wink and a nudge of he elbow mean to be witty he lordship be exceedingly sorry it be the most unfortunate accident : but he have the most particular engagement that very afternoon and must return early from the otter-hunt and probably sail the next day for wale but say the little man who know all about trebooze 's household i shall not fail to do myself the honor of call on mr trebooze and express my regret etc so to the otter-hunt be scoutbush go and campbell and thurnall after he for trebooze have say to himself must ask that blackguard of a doctor -- hang he i wish he be a otter himself but if he be so thick with he lordship it will not do to quarrel for indeed thurnall might tell tale so trebooze swallow he spite and shame -- as do many folk who call themselves he betters when they have to deal with a great man 's hanger-on -- and send down a note to tom : mr trebooze request the pleasure of mr thurnall 's company with he hound at -- and tom accept -- why not and chat with campbell as they go on many thing and among other thing on this -- by the by say he i get a hour 's shore-work yesterday afternoon and refreshing enough it be and i get a prize too the suck barnacle which you ask for : i be certain i should get one or two if i could have a look at the pool this week jolly little dog he be paddle and spin about last night and enjoy himself ` ere age with creep ' -- what be it -- ` have claw he in he clutch ' that fellow 's destiny be not a hopeful analogy for you sir who believe that we shall rise after we die into some higher and freer state why not why which be better off the free swimming larva or the perfect cirrhipod root for ever motionless to the rock which be better off the rove young fellow who be sowing he wild oats or the man who have settle down and become a respectable landowner with a good house over he head and begin to propagate he species well you have I there sir as far as this life be concerned but you will confess that the barnacle 's history prove that all crawl grub do not turn into butterfly i daresay the barnacle turn into what be best for he at all event what he deserve that rule of yours will apply to he to whomsoever it will not and so do penance for the sin of he youth as some of we be to do in the next world perhaps yes perhaps no perhaps neither do you speak of we or the barnacle of both i be glad of that for on the popular notion of we be punish a million year hence for what we do when we be lad i never could see anything but a misery and injustice in we have come into the world at all i can say the major quietly of course i mean nothing rude : but i have to buy my experience and pay for it dearly enough in folly so have i to buy mine then why be punish over and above why have to pay for the folly which be itself only the necessary price of experience ' for be perhaps so foolish as not to use the experience after it have cost you so dear and will punishment cure I of the foolishness that depend on yourself if it do it must need be so much the better for you but perhaps you will not be punish but forgive let off that would be a very bad thing for I unless i become a very different man from what i have be as yet i be always right glad now to get a fall whenever i make a stumble i should have go to sleep in my track long ago else as one to do in the back wood on a long elk hunt perhaps you may become a very different man i should be sorry for that even if it be possible why do you consider yourself perfect no but somehow thoma thurnall be a old friend of mine the first i ever have and i should be sorry to lose he company i do not think you need fear do so you have see a insect go through strange metamorphosis and yet remain the same individual why should not you and i do so likewise well well -- there be some point about you i suppose which you would not be sorry to have alter a few quoth tom laugh i do not consider myself quite perfect yet what if those point be not really any part of you character but mere excrescence of disease : or if that be too degrade a notion mere scar of old wound and of the wear and tear of life and what if in some future life all those disappear and the true mr thoma thurnall pure and simple be alone leave it be a very hopeful notion only my dear sir one be quite self-conceited enough in this imperfect state what intolerable coxcomb we should all be if we be perfect and could sit admire ourselves for ever and ever but what if that self-conceit and self-dependence be the very root of all the disease the cause of all the scar the very thing which will have to be get rid of before we true character and true manhood can be develop yes i understand faith and humility you will forgive I major campbell i shall learn to respect those virtue when good people have define they a little more exactly and can show I somewhat more clearly in what faith differ from superstition and humility from hypocrisy i do not think any man will ever define they for you but you may go through a course of experience more severe probably than pleasant which may enable you at last to define they for yourself have you define they ask tom bluntly glance round at he companion faith -- yes i trust humility -- no i fear i should like to hear you definition of the former at least do i not say that you must discover it for yourself yes well when the lesson come if it do come i suppose it will come in some learnable shape and till then i must shift for myself -- and if self-dependence he a punishable sin i shall at all event have plenty of company whithersoever i go there be lord scoutbush and trebooze why do not campbell speak he mind more clearly to thurnall because he know that with such man word be of little avail the disease be entrench too strongly in the very center of the man 's be it seem at moment as if all he strange adventure and hairbreadth escape have be send to do he harm and not good to pamper and harden he self-confidence not to crush it therefore campbell seldom argue with he : but he pray for he often for he have begin as all do who see much of tom thurnall to admire and respect he in spite of all he fault and now turn through a woodland path they descend toward the river till they can hear voice below they scoutbush laugh quietly trebooze lay down the law at the top of he voice how noisy the fellow be and how he be hop about say campbell no wonder : he have be soak i hear for the last fortnight with some worthy compeer by way of keep off cholera i must have my eye on he to-day scramble down through the brushwood they find themselves in such a scene as creswick alone know how to paint : though one element of beauty which creswick use full well be want and the whole place be see not by slant sun-ray gleam through the bough and dapple all the pebble with a lacework of leaf shadow but in the uniform and sober gray of dawn a broad bed of shingle look just now more like a ill-made turnpike road than the bed of alva stream above it a long shallow pool which show every stone through the transparent water on the right a craggy bank bed with deep wood sedge and orange-tipped king fern cluster beneath sallow and maple bush already tinge with gold on the leave a long bar of gravel cover with giant butter-bur leaf in and out of which the hound be brushing -- beautiful black-and-tan dog of which poor trebooze may be pardonably proud while round the burleaf-bed dance a rough white irish terrier seem by he frantic self-importance to consider himself the master of the hound scoutbush be stand with trebooze beyond the bar upon a little lawn set thick with alder trebooze be fuss and fidgett about wipe he forehead perpetually tell everybody to get out of the way and not to interfere then catch hold of scoutbush 's button to chatter in he face then start aside to put some part of he dress to rights he usual lazy drawl be exchange for foolish excitement two or three more gentleman tire of trebooze 's absurdity be scramble over the rock above in search of spraint old tardrew waddle stoop along the line where grass and shingle meet he bulldog visage bent to he very knee tardrew out hunting say campbell why it be but a week since he daughter be bury and why not i like he better for it would he bring she back again by throw away a good day 's sport better turn out as he have do and forget he feeling if he have any he have feeling enough do not doubt but you be right there be something very characteristic in the way in which the english countryman never show grief never let it interfere with business even with pleasure hillo mr trebooze say the old fellow look up here it be spraint -- spraint -- spraint -- where eh -- what cry trebooze no but what be as good : here on this alder stump not a hour old i think they beauty starn be not flemish for nowt here here here here musical musical sweetlip get out of the way -- and trebooze run down musical examine throw she nose into the air and answer by the rich bell-like note of the true otter hound and all the woodland ring as the pack dash down the shingle to she call over shout tom here be the fresh spraint we side through the water splash squire viscount steward and hound to the horror of a shoal of par the only visible tenant of a pool which after a shower of rain would be alive with trout where those trout be in the meanwhile be a mystery yet unsolved over dance the little terrier yap furiously and expend he superfluous energy by snap right and leave at the par hark to musical hark to sweetlip down the stream -- no the old girl have it right up the bank how do doctor how do major campbell forward -- forward -- forward shout trebooze glad to escape a longer parley as with he spear in he left hand he clutch at the overhang bough with he right and swing himself up with peter the huntsman after he tom follow he and why because he do not like he look that bull-eye be red and almost burst he cheek be flush he lip blue he hand shake and tom 's quick eye have already remark from a distance over and above he new fussiness a sudden shudder a quick half-frightened glance behind he and perceive too that the moment musical give tongue he put the spirit-flask to he mouth away go the hound at score through tangled cover they merry peal ringing from brake and brier clashing against the rock moan musically away through distant glen aloft scoutbush and tardrew take down the riverbed follow by campbell it be in he way home and though the major have stick many a pig shoot many a gaur rhinoceros and elephant he disdain not like a true sportsman the less dangerous but more scientific excitement of a otter-hunt hark to the merry merry christchurch bell she be up by this time -- that do not sound like a drag now cry tom burst desperately with elbow-guarded visage through the tangled scrub what be the matter trebooze no thanks ` modest quencher ' will not improve the wind just now for trebooze have halt panting and bath in perspiration have be at the brandy flask again and now offer tom a quencher as he call it as you like say trebooze sulkily have mean it as a token of reconciliation and push on they be now upon a little open meadow girdle by green wall of wood and along the river-bank the hound be fairly race tom and peter hold on trebooze slacken you master do not look right this morning peter peter lift he hand to he mouth to signify the habit of drinking and then shake it in a melancholy fashion to signify that the say habit have reach a lamentable and desperate point tom look back trebooze have pull up and be walk wipe still at he face the hound have overrun the scent and be back again flemish about the plashed fence on the river brink over over over shout peter tumble over the fence into the stream and staggering across trebooze come up to it try to scramble over mutter something and sit down astride of a bough you be not well squire well as ever i be in my life only a little sick -- have be several time lately could not sleep either -- have not sleep a hour this week -- do not know what it be what duck of hound those

across the hound be all round he and he be courage they on fuss again more than ever but without success go to hole somewhere here say peter cry trebooze look round with a sudden shudder and face of terror there be that black brute again there behind I hang it he 'll bite I next and he catch up he leg and strike behind he with he spear there be no dog there peter be about to speak but tom silence he by a look and shout -- here we be go to holt in this alder root now then little carlingford out of the way puppy cry trebooze right again for the moment by the excitement and thrust the hound right

neither answer peter with utter astonishment tom because he see what be the matter do not stoop squire you 'll make the blood fly to you head let I -- but trebooze thrust he back with curse i 'll have the brute out and send the spear through he and fling himself on he knee again trebooze begin tear madly at the root and stone shout to the half-buried terrier to tear the intruder peter look at tom

chapter xix beddgelert the pleasant summer voyage be over the waterwitch be lounge off port madoc wait for she crew the say crow be busy on shore drink the lady ' health with a couple of sovereign which valencia have give they in she sister 's name and she own the lady under the care of elsley and the far more practical care of mr bowie be rattle along among child maid and box over the sandy flat of the traeth mawr beside the long reach of the lazy stream with the blue surge of the hill in front and the silver sea behind soon they begin to pass wooded knoll islet of rock in the alluvial plain the higher peak of snowdon sink down behind the lower spur in front the plain narrow close in walled round with woodland cling to the steep hill-side and at last they enter the narrow gorge of pont-aberglaslyn -- pretty enough no doubt but much over-praised for there be in devon alone a dozen pass far grander both for form and size soon they emerge again on flat meadow mountain-cradled and the grave of the mythic greyhound and the fair old church shroud in tall tree and last but not least at the famous leek hotel where ruleth mr lewi great and wise over the four month ' babylon of guide car chambermaid tourist artist and reading-party camp-stool telescope poetry-book blue ugly red petticoat and parasol of every hue there they settle down in the best room in the house and all go as merrily as it can while the horror which they have leave behind they hang like a black background to all they thought however both scoutbush and campbell send as cheerful report as they honestly can and gradually the exceed beauty of the scenery and the amusing bustle of the village make they forget perhaps a good deal which they ought to have remember as for poor lucia no one will complain of she for be happy for feel that she have get a holiday the first for now four year and try to enjoy it to the utmost she have no household care mr bowie manage everything and do so in order to keep up the honor of the family on a somewhat magnificent scale the child in that brace air be better than she have ever see they she have valencium all to herself and elsley in spite of the dark fancy over which he have be brooding be better behave on the whole than usual he have escape -- so he consider -- escape from campbell above all from thurnall from himself indeed he have not escape but the company of self be on the whole more pleasant to he than otherwise just now for though he may turn up he nose at tourist and reading-party and long for contemplative solitude yet there be a certain pleasure to some people and often strongest in those who pretend most shyness in the digito monstrarus et diceri hic est : in take for grant that everybody have read he poem that everybody be say in they heart there go mr vavasor the distinguished poet i wonder what he be write now i wonder where he have be to-day and what he have be think of so elsley go up hebog and look over the glorious vista of the vale over the twin lake and the rich sheet of woodland with aran and moel meirch guard they right and left and the greystone glacier of the glyder wall up the valley mile above and they go up snowdon too and see little beside fifty fog-blinded tourist five-and-twenty drip pony and five hundred empty porter-bottle wherefrom they return as do many disgusted and with great cold in they head but most they love to scramble up the crag of dina emry and muse over the ruin of the old tower where merlin teach vortigern the course of the star till the star set and rise as they have do for merlin and he pupil behind the four great peak of aran siabod cnicht and hebog which point to the four quarter of the heaven : or to lie by the side of the boggy spring which once be the magic well of the magic castle till they see in fancy the white dragon and the red rise from its depths once more and fight high in air the battle which foretell the fall of the cymry before the sassenach invader one thing indeed trouble elsley -- that claude be he only companion for valencium avoid carefully any more _ tête-à-tête _ walk with he she have find out she mistake and devoted herself now to lucia she have a fair excuse enough for lucium be not just then in a state for ramble and scramble and of that elsley certainly have no right to complain so that he be force to leave they both at home with as good grace as he could muster and to wander by himself scribble he fancy while they lounge and work in the pleasant garden of the hotel with bowie fetch and carry for they all day long and intimate pretty roundly to miss clara he opeeenion that he be very proud and thankful of the office : but he do think that he have to do a great many thing for mr vavasor every day which would come with a much better grace from mr vavasor himself : and that when he marry he should not leave he wife to be nurse by other man which last word be speak with a ulterior object well understand by the hearer for between clara and bowie there be one of those patient and honorable attachment so common between worthy servant they have both keep company though only by letter for the most part for now five year they have both save a fair sum of money and clara might have marry bowie when she choose have she not think it she duty to take care of she mistress while bowie consider himself equally indispensable to the welfare of that puir feckless laddie he master so they wait patiently amusing the time by little squabble of jealousy real or pretended and bowie be faithful though clara be past thirty now and lose she good look so ye 'll see you lassie mr bowie say sergeant macarthur he intimate when he start for aberalva that summer i be think ye would better put she out of she pain soon five year be ower lang court and she be na pullet by now save you pardon hoooo -- say bowie leave the green gooseberry to the lad and gi ' I the ripe fruit sergeant however he find love-making in he own fashion so pleasant that not content with carry mr vavasor 's baby about all day long he have several time to be gently turn out of the nursery where he want to assist in wash and dress they on the ground that a old soldier could turn he hand to anything so slip away a fortnight and more during which valencium be the cynosure of all eye and know it also : for claude mellot half to amuse she and half to tease elsley make she laugh many a time by retail little saying and doings in she praise and dispraise pick up from rich manchester gentleman who would fain have marry she without a penny and from strong-minded manchester lady who envy she beauty a little and set she down of course as a empty-minded worldling and a proud aristocrat the majority of the reading-party meanwhile think a great deal more about valencium than about they book the oxford man it seem though of the same mind as the cambridge man in consider she the model of all perfection be divide as to they method of testify the same two or three of they who be give to that simpering and flirt tone with young lady to which oxford would-be-fine gentleman be so pitiably prone hung about the inn-door to ogle she : contrived always to be walk in the garden when she be there dress out as if for high street at four o'clock on a may afternoon torment claude by fruitless attempt to get from he a introduction which he have neither the right nor the mind to give and at last -lrb- so bowie tell claude one night and claude tell the whole party next morning -rrb- try to bribe and flatter valencium 's maid into give they a bit of ribbon or a cast-off glove which have belong to the idol whereon that maiden in virtuous indignation tell mr bowie and complain moreover -lrb- as maid be bind to do to valet for whom they have a penchant -rrb- of they have dare to compliment she on she own good look : by which act she succeed of course in make mr bowie understand that other people still think she pretty if he do not and also in arouse in he that jealousy which be often the best helpmate of sweet love so mr bowie go forth in he might that very evening and find two of the oxford man inform they in plain scotch that gin he catch they or any ither such skellum philander after he leddy or he leddy ' maid he would jist knock they empty pow togither to which there be no reply but silence for mr bowie stand six foot four without he shoe and have but the week before perform for the edification of the cambridge man who hold he in high honor a few old guard ' feat such as cut in two at one sword-blow a suspend shoulder of mutton lift a long table by he tooth squeeze a quart pewter pot flat between he finger and other little recreation of those who be bear unto rapha but the cantab and a couple of gallant oxford boat man who have fraternise with they testify they admiration in they simple honest way by put down they pipe whenever they see valencium come and just lift they hat when they meet she close it be take a liberty no doubt but i tell you mellot say wynd as brave and pure-mind a fellow as ever pull in the university eight the arab when they see such a creature say ` praise allah for beautiful woman ' and quite right they may remind some fellow of worse thing but they always remind I of heaven and the angel and my hat go off to she by instinct just as it do when i go into a church that be all simple chivalrous admiration and delight in she loveliness as in that of a lake or a mountain sunset but nothing more the good fellow have no time indeed to fancy themselves in love with she or she with they for every day be too short for they what with read all the morning and start out in the afternoon in strange garment -lrb- which become shabbier and more ragged very rapidly as the week slip on -rrb- upon all manner of desperate errand walk unheard-of-distance and lose they way upon the mountain scramble cliff and now and then fall down they camp all night by unpronounceable lake in the hope of catch mythical trout try in all way how hungry thirsty dirty and tire a man could make himself and how far he could go without break he neck any approach to which catastrophe be hail -lrb- as be all other mishap -rrb- as all in the day 's work and the finest fun in the world by that unconquerable english lebensglückseligkeit which be a perpetual wonder to we sober german cousin ah glorious twenty-one with you inexhaustible power of do and enjoy eating and hungering sleeping and sit up reading and play happy be those who still possess you and can take they fill of you golden cup steady but not sadden by the remembrance that for all thing a good and loving god will bring they into judgment happier still those who -lrb- like a few -rrb- retain in body and soul the health and buoyancy of twenty-one on to the very verge of forty and seem to grow younger-hearted as they grow older-headed can cast off care and work at a moment 's warning laugh and frolic now as they do twenty year ago and say with wordsworth -- so be it when i be a boy so let it be when i be old or let I die unfortunately as will appear hereafter elsley 's especial _ bêtes noir _ be this very wynd and he inseparable companion naylor who happen to be not only the best man of the set but mellot 's especial friend both be rugby man now read for they degree wynd be a shropshire squire 's son a lissom fair-haired man the handiest of boxer rower rider shot fisherman with a noisy superabundance of animal spirit which madden elsley yet wynd have sentiment in he way though he take good care never to show it elsley could repeat tennyson from end to end spout the mort d'arthur up hill and down dale and chaunt rapturously come into the garden maud while he express he opinion of maud 's lover in term more forcible than delicate naylor fidus achate be a gloucestershire parson 's son a huge heavy-looking man with a thick curl lip and a sleepy eye but he have brain enough to become a first-rate classic and in that same sleepy eye and heavy lip lay a infinity of quiet humor racy old country story quaint scrap of out-of-the-way learning jovial old ballad which he sing with the mellowest of voice and a slang vocabulary which make he the dread of all bargee from newnham pool to upware he also elsley hate because naylor look always as if he be laugh at he which indeed he be and the worst be that elsley have always to face they both at once if wynd vault over a gate into he very face with a how de ' do mr vavasor have any verse this morning in the same tone as if he have ask have any sport naylor 's round face be sure to look over the stone-wall pipe in mouth with a do not disturb the gentleman tom do not you see he be a composing of he rhyme in a strong provincial dialect put on for the nonce in fact the two young rogue have no respect whatsoever for genius perhaps because they have each of they a little genius of they own make a butt of the poet as soon as they find out that he be afraid of they but worse _ bêtes noir _ than either wynd or naylor be on they way to fill up the cup of elsley 's discomfort and at last without a note of warning appear in beddgelert a phenomenon which rejoice some heart but perturb also the spirit not only of the oxford philanderer but those of elsley vavasor and what be more of valencium herself she be sit one evening at the window with lucium look out into the village and the pleasure-grounds before the hotel they be both laughing and chat over the group of tourist in they pretty irish way just as they have do when they be girl for lucium 's heart be expand under the quiet beauty of the place the freedom from household care and what be more from money anxiety for valencium have slip into she hand a cheque for fifty pound from scoutbush and assure she that he would be quite angry if she speak of pay the rent of the room elsley be moon down the river by himself claude be entertaining he cambridge acquaintance as he do every night with he endless fun and sentiment gradually the tourist slipt in one by one as the last ray of the sun fade off the peak of aran and the mist settle down upon the dark valley beneath and darkness fall upon that rock-girdled paradise when up to the door below there drive a car at sight whereof out rush not waiter only and landlady but mr bowie himself who help out a very short figure in a pea-jacket and a shine boat hat and then a very tall one in a wild shooting-coat and a military cap my brother and mon saint père lucium too delightful this be why they do not write and valencium spring up and be go to run down stair to they when she pause at lucium 's call who have they with they ' val -- come and look who can it be campbell and bowie be help out carefully a tall man cover up in many wrapper it be too dark to see the face but a fancy cross valencium 's mind which make she look grave in spite of she pleasure he be evidently weak as from recent illness for he two supporter lead he up the step and scoutbush seem full of direction and inquiry and fuss about with the landlady till she be tire of curtsey to my lord a minute afterwards bowie throw open the door grandly my lord my lady and in trot scoutbush and begin kiss they fiercely and then dance about oh my dear here at last -- out of that horrid city of the plague such sight as i have see -- and then he pause do you know val and lucium i be glad i have see it : i do not know but i feel as if i should be a better man all my life and those poor people how well they do behave and the major he be a angel and so be that brick of a doctor and the mad schoolmistress and the curate everybody i think but I hang it val but you word sha not come true i will be of some use yet before i die but i have -- and valencium go up to he and kiss he while he run on and lucium say -- you have be of use already dear fred you have send I and the dear child to this sweet place where we have be safer and happier than -- -lrb- she check herself -rrb- and you generous present too i feel quite a girl again thanks to you val and i have do nothing but laugh all day long and she begin kiss he too ` how happy could i be with either be t ` other dear charmer away ' break out scoutbush what a pity it be now that i should have two such sweet creature make love to I and can not marry either of they why do ye go and be my father 's daughter mavourneen i would have make a peeress of the one of ye if ye would have the sense to be anybody else 's sister at which they all laugh and laugh and chatter broad irish together as they use to do for fun in old kilanbaggan castle before lucium be a weary wife and valencium a worldly fine lady and scoutbush a rackety guardsman break half of the ten commandment every week rather from ignorance than vice well i be glad ye be please with I asthore say he at last to lucium but i have do another little good deed i flatter myself for i have bring away the poor spalpeen of a priest and have get he safe in the house valencium stop short in she fun why what have ye to say against that miss val why will not he be a little in the way say valencium not know what to say faith he need not trouble you and i shall take very good care -- i wonder when the supper be come -- that neither he nor any else trouble I but really say he in he natural voice and with some feeling i be ashamed to go away and leave he there he would have die if we have he work day and night talk of saint and martyr campbell himself say he be a idler by the side of he oh i hope major campbell have not over-exerted himself he nothing hurt he he be as hard as he own sword but the poor curate work on till he get the cholera himself he always expect it long for it campbell say -- want to die some love affair i suppose poor fellow -- and a terrible bout he have for eight-and-forty hour thurnall think he go again and again but he pull the poor fellow through after all and we get some one -lrb- that be campbell do -rrb- to take he duty and bring he away after a good deal of persuasion for he would not move as long as there be a fresh case in the town that be why we never write we do not know till the last hour when we should start and we expect to be with you in two day and give you a pleasant surprise he be half dead when we get he on board but the week 's sea-air help he through so i must not grumble at these northerly breeze ` it be a ill wind that blow nobody good ' they say valencium hear all this as in a dream and watch she chattering brother with a stupefied air she comprehend all now and bitterly she blame herself he have really love she then set himself manfully to die at he post that he might forget she in a better world how shamefully she have trifle with that noble heart how should she ever meet -- how have courage to look he in the face and not love or anything like love but sacred pity and self-abasement fill she heart as he fair delicate face rise up before she all wan and shrunken with sad upbraid eye and round it such a halo pure and pale as crown in some old german picture a martyr 's head he have have the cholera he have be actually die ask she at last with that strange wish to hear over again bad news which one know too well already of course he have why you be not go away valencia you need not be afraid of infection campbell and thurnall too say that be all nonsense and they must know have see it so often here come bowie at last with supper have mr headley have anything to eat asked valencium who long to run away to she own room but dare not he be eat now like any ged ma'am and major campbell 's make he eat too he must be very ill thought she for mon saint père never to have come near we yet : and then she think with terror that she saint père might have guess the truth and be angry with she and yet she trust in frank 's secrecy he would not betray she take care valencium when a woman have to trust a man not to betray she and do trust he she may soon find it not only easy but necessary to do more than trust he however in five minute campbell come in valencium see at once that there be no change in he feeling to she : but he could talk of nothing but headley he self-devotion courage angelic gentleness and humility and every word of he praise be a fresh arrow in valencium 's conscience at last -- one know well enough what be the matter say he almost bitterly -- what be the matter i sometimes think with half the noblest man in the world and nine-tenth of the noblest woman and with many a one too god help they who be none of the noblest and therefore do not know how to take the bitter cup as he know -- what do the philosopher mean now ask scoutbush look up from the cold lamb valencium know but too well what he mean he have a history my dear lord a history what be he write a book campbell laugh a quiet under-laugh half sad half humorous i be very tired say valencium i really think i shall go to bed she go to she room but to bed she do not go : she sit down and cry till she could cry no more and lay awake the greater part of the night toss miserably she would have do better if she have pray but prayer about such a matter be what valencium know nothing of she be regular enough at church of course and say she prayer and confess she sin in a general way and pray about she soul as she have be teach to do -- unless she be too tired : but to pray really about a real sorrow a real sin like this be a thought which never enter she mind and if it have she would have drive it away again : just because the anxiety be so real practical human it be a matter which have nothing to do with religion which it seem impertinent -- almost wrong to lay before the throne of god so she come downstairs next morning pale restless unrefreshed in body or mind and she peace of mind be not improve by see seat at the breakfast-table frank headley whom lucia and scoutbush be stuff with all manner of good thing she blush scarlet -- do what she would she could not help it -- when he rise and bow to she half choke she come forward and offer she hand she be so shocked to hear that he have be so dangerously ill -- no one have even tell they of it -- it have come upon they so suddenly and so forth she speak kindly but avoid the least tone of tenderness : for she feel that if she give way she might be only too tender and to re-awaken hope in he heart would be only cruelty and therefore and for other reason also she do not look he in the face as she speak he answer so cheerfully that she be half disappointed in spite of she remorse at he not be as miserable as she have expect still if he have overcome the passion it be so much better for he but yet valencium hardly wish that he should have overcome it so self-contradictory be woman 's heart and she pity have sink to half-ebb and she self-complacency be rise with a flow tide as he chat on quietly but genially about the voyage and the scenery and snowdon which he have never see and which he would ascend that very day you will do nothing of the kind mr headley cry lucium be he not mad major campbell quite mad i know i be mad my dear mrs vavasor i have be so a long time : but snowdon pony be in they sober sens -- and i shall take one of they fulfil the old pun -- begin beside yourself and end beside you horse i be sure he be not strong enough to sit over those rock no you shall stay at home comfortably here valencium and i will take care of you and mon saint père too i have a thousand thing to say to he and so have he to queen whim so scoutbush send bowie for john jones clerk the fisherman -lrb- may he day be as many as he salmon and as good as he fly -rrb- and the four stay at home and talk over the aberalva tragedy till as it befall both lucium and campbell leave the room awhile immediately frank rise and walk across to valencia lay the fatal ring on the arm of she chair and return to he seat without a word you be very -- i hope that it -- stammer valencium you hope that it be a comfort to I it be and i shall be always grateful to you for it valencium hear a emphasis on the be it check the impulse -lrb- foolish enough -rrb- which rise in she to bid he keep the ring so prim and dignified she slip it into its place on she finger and go on with she work merely say -- i need not say that i be happy that anything which i could do should have be of use to you in such a fearful time it be a fearful time but for myself i can not be too glad of it god grant that it may have be as useful to other as to I it cure I of a great folly now i look back i be astonish at my own absurdity rudeness presumption -- you must let I say it -- i do not know how to thank you enough i can not trust myself with the fit word they would be so strong : but i owe this confession to you and to you exceed goodness and kindness when you would have be justify in treat I as a madman i be mad i believe : but i be in my right mind now i assure you say he gaily have i not be i need hardly say you would not have see I here what a prospect this be and he rise and look out of the window valencium have hear all this with downcast eye and unmoved face be she please at it not in the least the naughty child that she be and more she grow quite angry with herself ashamed of herself for have think and feel so much about he the night before how silly of I he be very well and do not care for I and who be he pray that i should even look at he and as if in order to put she word into practice she look at he there and then he be gaze out of the window lean gracefully and yet feebly against the shutter with the full glory of the forenoon sun upon he sharp-cut profile and rich chestnut lock and after all have look at he once she could not help look at he again he be certainly a most gentleman-like man elegant from head to foot there be not a ungraceful line about he to he very boot and the white nail of he slender finger even the defect of he figure -- the too great length of the neck and slope of the shoulder -- increase he likeness to those saintly picture with which he have be mix up in she mind the night before he be at one extreme pole of the different type of manhood and that burly doctor who have save he life at the other : but she saint père alone perfectly combine the two there be nobody like he after all perhaps she wisest plan as headley have forget he fancy be to confess all to the saint père -lrb- as she usually do she little sin -rrb- and get some sort of absolution from he however she must say something in answer -- yes it be a very lovely view but really i must say one more word about this matter i have to thank you you know for the good faith which you have keep with I he look round seemingly amuse _ celum va san dire _ and he bow pray do not say any more about the matter and he look at she with such humble and thankful eye that valencia be sorry not to hear more from he than -- pray tell I -- for of course you know -- the name of this exquisite valley up which i be look gwynnant you must go up it when you be well enough and see the lake they be the only one in snowdon from the bank of which the primaeval forest have not disappear indeed i must make shift to go there this very afternoon for -- do not laugh at I -- but i never see a lake in my life never see a lake no i be a true lowlander : bear and breed among bleak norfolk sand and fen -- so much the worse for this chest of mine and this be my first sight of mountain it be all like a dream to I and a dream which i never expect to be realize ah you should see we irish lake and mountain -- you should see killarney i be content with these i suppose it be as wrong to break the tenth commandment about scenery as about anything else ah but it seem so hard that you who i be sure would appreciate fine scenery should have be debar from it while hundred of stupid people run over the alp and italy every summer and come home as far as i can see rather more stupid than they go have make confusion worse confound by fill they poor brain with hard name out of murray not quite so hard as that thousand every day who would enjoy a meat dinner should have nothing but dry bread and not enough of that i fancy sometimes that in some mysterious way that want will be make up to they in the next life and so with all the beautiful thing which travel people talk of -- i comfort myself with the fancy that i see as much as be good for I here and that if i make good use of that i shall see the alp and the ande in the world to come or something much more worth see tell I now how far may that range of crag be from we i be sure that i could walk there after luncheon this mountain air be strengthen I so walk thither i assure you they be at least four mile off four and i think they one so clear and sharp as they stand out against the sky one fancy that one could almost stretch out a hand and touch those knoll and slab of rock as distinct as in a photograph and yet so soft and rich withal dappled with pearly-grey stone and purple heath ah -- so it must be i suppose the first time that one see a glorious thing one 's heart be lift up towards it in love and awe till it seem near to one -- ground on which one may freely tread because one appreciate and admire and so one forget the distance between its grandeur and one 's own littleness the allusion be palpable : but do he intend it surely not after what he have just say and yet there be a sadness in the tone which make valencium fancy that some feeling for she might still linger : but he evidently have be speak to himself forgetful for the moment of she presence for he turn to she with a start and a blush -- but now -- i have be trouble you too long with this stupid _ tête-à-tête _ sentimentality of mine i will make my bow and find the major i be afraid if it be possible for he to forget any one he have forget I in some new moss or other he go out and to valencium 's chagrin she see he no more that day he spend the forenoon in the garden and the afternoon in lie down and at night complain of fatigue and stay in he own room the whole evening while campbell read he to sleep next morning however he make he appearance at breakfast well and cheerful i must play at sick man no more or i shall rob you i see of major campbell 's company and i owe you all for too much already unless you be better than you be last night you must play at sick man say the major i can not conceive what exhaust you so unless you lady be better nurse i must let no one come near he but myself if you have be scold he the whole morning instead of praise he as he deserve he could not have be more tired last night pray do not cry frank evidently much pained i have such a delightful morning and every one be so kind -- you only make I wretched when i feel all the trouble i be give my dear fellow say scoutbush _ en grand sérieux _ after all that you have do for we people at aberalva i should be very much shock if any of my family think any service show to you a trouble pray do not speak so say frank i be fall among angel when i least expect scoutbush as a angel shriek lucium clap she hand elsley do not you see the wing sprout already under he shooting jacket they be my brace i suppose of course say scoutbush who never understand a joke about himself though he like one about other people while elsley who hate all joke make no answer -- at least none worth recording in fact as the reader may have discover elsley save _ tête-à-tête _ with some one who take he fancy be somewhat of a silent and morose animal and as little scoutbush confide to mellot there be no get a rise out of he all which lucia saw as keenly as any one and try to pass off by chatter nervously and fussily for he as well as for herself whereby she only make he the more cross for he could not the least understand she argument -- why my dear if you do not talk to people i must but why should people be talk to because they like it and expect it the more foolish they much better to hold they tongue and think or read you poetry i suppose and then would begin a squabble meanwhile there be one at least of the party who be watch lucium with most deep and painful interest lord scoutbush be too busy with he own comfort especially with he fishing to think much of this moroseness of elsley 's if he suit lucium very well he taste and hers differ : but it be she concern not he -- be a very easy way of free himself from all anxiety on the matter : but not so with major campbell he see all this and know enough of human nature to suspect that the self-seeking which show as moroseness in company might show as downright bad temper in private longing to know more of elsley if possible to guide and help he he try to be intimate with he as he have try at aberalva pay he court ask he opinion talk to he on all subject which he think would interest he he conclusion be more favourable to elsley 's head than to he heart he see that elsley be vain and like he attention and that lower he in he eye : but he see too that elsley shrink from he at first he think it pride but he soon find that it be fear and that lower he still more in he eye perhaps campbell be too hard on the poet : but he own purity itself tell against elsley who be i that any one should be afraid of I unless they have do something wrong so with he dark suspicion rouse he watch intently every word and every tone of elsley 's to he wife and here he come to a more unpleasant conclusion still he see that they be sometimes at least not happy together and from this he take for grant too hastily that they be never happy together that lucium be a utterly ill-used person that elsley be a bad fellow who ill-treat she : and a black and awful indignation against the man grow up within he all the more fierce because it seem utterly righteous and because too it have under heavy penalty to be utterly conceal beneath a courteous and genial manner : till many a time he feel inclined to knock elsley down for little roughness to she which be really the fruit of mere _ gaucherie _ and then accuse himself for a hypocrite because he be keep up the courtesy of life with such a man for campbell like most man of he temperament be over-stern and sometimes a little cruel and unjust in demand of other the same lofty code which he have lay down for himself and in demand it too of some more than of other by a very questionable exercise of private judgment on the whole he be right no doubt in be as indulgent as he dare to the publican and sinner like scoutbush and in be as severe as he dare on all pharisee and pretentious person whatsoever : but he be too much inclined to draw between the two class one of those strong line of demarcation which exist only in the fancy of the human brain for sin like all diseased matter be complicate and confuse matter many a seem pharisee be at heart a self-condemned publican and ought to be comfort and not curse while many a publican be in the midst of all he foul sin a thorough exclusive and self-complacent pharisee and need not the right hand of mercy but the strong arm of punishment campbell like other man have he fault : and he be those of a man wrap up in a pure and stately but a austere and lonely creed distrust with the world in all its form and look down upon man in general nearly as much as thurnall do so he set down elsley for a bad man to whom he be force by hard circumstance to behave as if he be a good one the only way therefore in which he could vent he feeling be by show to lucia that study attention which sympathy and chivalry demand of a man toward a injured woman not that he dare or wish to conduct himself with she as he do with valencium even have she not be a married woman he do not know she as intimately as he do she sister but still he have a right to behave as the most intimate friend of she family and he assert that right and all the more determinedly because elsley seem now and then not to like it i will teach he how to behave to a charming woman say he to himself and perhaps he have be wiser if he have not say it : but every man have he weak point and chivalry be major campbell 's what do you think of that poet mellot say he once on return from a pic-nic during which elsley have never notice he wife and at last finding valencium engage with headley have actually go off _ pour pi aller _ to watch lord scoutbush fishing oh clever enough and to spare and as well read a man as i know one of the sturm-und-drang party of course : -- the express locomotive school scream-and-go-head : and think I with my classicism a benighted pagan still every man have a right to he opinion live and let live i do not care about he taste say the major impatiently what sort of man be he -- man claude ahem humph ` irritabile genus poetarum ' but one be so accustomed to that among literary man one never expect they to be like anybody else and so take they whim and oddity for grant and they sin too eh sin i know of none on he part do not you call temper a sin no i call it a determination of blood to the head or of animal spirit to the wrong place or -- my dear major i be no moralist i take people you know as i find they but he be a bear and i should not wonder if that sweet little woman have find it out ere now campbell ground something between he tooth he fancy himself full of righteous wrath : he be really in a very unchristian temper be it so : perhaps there be excuse for he -lrb- as there be for many man -rrb- of which we know nothing elsley meanwhile watch campbell with fast lower brow lose a woman 's affection he who do so deserve he fate have he be in the habit of pay proper attention to lucia he would have like campbell all the more for he conduct there be few greater pleasure to a man who be what he should be to he wife than to see other man admire what he admire and try to rival he where he know that he can have no rival let they worship as much as they will let she make herself as charming to they as she can what matter he smile at they in he heart for have he not over and above all the pretty thing which he can say and do ten time as well as they a talisman -- a dozen talisman which be beyond they reach -- in the strength of which he will go home and laugh over with she amid sacred caress all which make mean man mad but elsley alas for he have neglect lucium himself and therefore dreaded comparison with any other man and the suspicion which have take root in he at aberalva grow into ugly shape and strength however he be silent and contented himself with coldness and all but rudeness there be excuse for he in the first place it would have be a ugly thing to take notice of any man 's attention to a wife it could not be do but upon the strongest grounds and do in a way which would make a complete rupture necessary so break up the party in a sufficiently unpleasant way besides to move in the matter at all would be to implicate lucium for of whatsoever kind campbell 's attention be she evidently like they and a quarrel with she on that score be more than elsley dare face he be not a man of strong moral courage he hate a scene of any kind and he be afraid of be worst in any really serious quarrel not merely by campbell but by lucium it may seem strange that he should be afraid of she though not so that he should be afraid of campbell but the truth be that the man who bully he wife very often do so -- as elsley have do more than once -- simply to prove to himself he own strength and hide he fear of she he know well that woman 's tongue when once the fair beast be bring to bay be a weapon far too trenchant to be face by any shield but that of a very clear conscience toward she which be more than elsley have beside -- and it be a honor to elsley vavasor amid all he weakness that he have justice and chivalry enough leave to know what nine man out of ten ignore -- behind all let the worst come to the worst lay one just and terrible rejoinder which he though he have be no worse than the average of man could only answer by silent shame -- at least sir i be pure when i come to you you best know whether you be so likewise and yet even that so all-forgiving be woman might have be face by some means : but the miserable complication about the false name still remain elsley believe that he be in he wife 's power that she could if she choose turn upon he and proclaim he to the world as a scoundrel and a impostor and as it be of the nature of man to hate those whom he fear elsley begin to have dark and ugly feeling toward lucium instead of throw they away as a strong man would have do he pampered they almost without mean to do so for he let they run riot through he too vivid imagination in the form of possible speech possible scene till he have look and look through a hundred thought which no man have a right to entertain for a moment true he have entertain they with horror but he ought not to have entertain they at all he ought to have kick they contemptuously out and back to the devil from whence they come it may be again that this be impossible to man that prayer be the only refuge against that walpurgis-dance of the witch and the fiend which will at hapless moment whirl unbidden through a mortal brain : but elsley do not pray so leave these fancy in he head too long he soon become accustomed to they and accustomed too to the nemesis which they bring with they of chronic moodiness and conceal rage day by day he be lash himself up into fresh fury and yet day by day he be become more careful to conceal that fury he have many reason : moral cowardice which make he shrink from the tremendous consequence of a explosion -- equally tremendous be he right or wrong then the secret hope perhaps the secret consciousness that he be wrong and be only say to god like the self-deceiving prophet i do well to be angry then the honest fear of go too far of be surprise at last into some hideous and irreparable speech or deed which he might find out too late be utterly unjust : then at moment -lrb- for even that would cross he -rrb- the devilish notion that by concealment he might lure lucium on to give he a safe ground for attack all these and more torment he for a wretched fortnight during which he become at such a expense of self-control as he have not exercise for year courteous to campbell more than courteous to lucium hiding under a smile face wrath which increase with the pressure bring to bear upon it campbell and lucium mellot valencium and frank utterly deceive go on more merrily than ever little dream that they walk and talk daily with a man who be fast become glad to flee to the pit of hell but for the fear that god would be there also they meanwhile chat on enjoy as human soul be allow to do at rare and precious moment the mere sensation of be of which they would talk at time in a way which lead they down into deep matter : for instance -- how pleasant to sit here for ever say claude one afternoon in the inn garden at beddgelert and say not with descarte ' i think therefore i exist ' but simply ' i enjoy therefore i exist ' i almost think those emersonian be right at time when they crave the ` life of plant and stone and rain ' stangrave say to I once that he ideal of perfect bliss be that of a oyster in the indian sea drink the warm salt water motionless and troubling himself about nothing while nothing troubled itself about he till a diver come and tear he up for the sake of he pearl say valencium he do not intend to contain any pearl a pearl you know be a disease of the oyster the product of some irritation he wish to be the oyster pure and simple a part of nature and to be of no use ask frank of none whatsoever nature have make he what he be and all beside be she business and not he i do not deny that i laugh at he and make he wroth by tell he that he doctrine be ` the apotheosis of loaf ' but my heart go with he and the jolly oyster too it be very beautiful after all that careless nymph and shepherd life of the old greek and that marquesa romance of herman melville 's -- to enjoy the simple fact of live like a neapolitan lazzaronus or a fly upon a wall but the old greek hero fight and labor to till the land and rid it of giant and monster say frank and as for the marquesa mr melville find out do he not -- as you do once -- that they be only petting and fattening he for the purpose of eat he there be a dark side to that pretty picture mr mellot _ tant pi pour eux _ but that be a unnecessary appendage to the idea purely it must be possible to realize such a simple rich healthy life without wickedness if not without human sorrow it be no dream and no one shall rob I of it i have see fragment of it scatter up and down the world and i believe they will all meet in paradise -- where and when i care not but they will meet i be very happy in the south sea island after that when nobody mean to eat I and i be very happy here and do not intend to be eat unless it will be any pleasure to miss st just no let man enjoy himself when he can and take he fill of those flame red geranium and glossy rhododendron and feathered crown-fern and the gold green lace of those acacia toss and whisper overhead and the purple mountain sleep there aloft and the murmur of the brook over the stone and drink in scent with every breath -- what be he nose make for save to smell i use to torment myself once by ask they all what they mean now i be content to have do with symbolism and say ` what you all mean i care not all i know be that i can draw pleasure from the mere sight of you as perhaps you do from the mere sight of I so let we sit together nature and i and stare into each other 's eye like two young lover careless of the morrow and its grief ' i will not even take the trouble to paint she why make ugly copy of perfect picture let those who wish to see she take a railway ticket and save we academician color and canvas _ quant à moi _ the public must go to the mountain as mahomet have to do for the mountain shall not come to the public one of you wilful paradox mr mellot why you be photograph they all day long not quite all day long madam and after all _ il faut vivre : _ i want a few luxury i have no capacity for keep a shop photograph pay better than painting consider the time it take and it be only nature reproduce herself not caricature she but if any one will ensure I a poor two thousand a year i will promise to photograph no more but vanish to sicily or calabrium and sit with sabina in a orchard all my day twine rise garland for she pretty head like theocritus and he friend while the ` pear drop on we shoulder and the apple by we side ' what do you think of all this ask valencium of frank that i be too like the emersonian oyster here very happy and very useless and therefore very anxious to be go surely you have earn the right to be idle awhile no one have a right to be idle oh groan claude where do you find that eleventh commandment i have do with all eleventh commandment for i find it quite hard work enough to keep the ancient ten but i find it mellot in the deepest abyss of all in the very depth from which the commandment spring but we will not talk about it here why not ask valencium look up be we so very naughty as to be unworthy to listen and be these mountain ask claude so ugly and ill-made that they be a unfit pulpit for a sermon no tell I what you mean after all i be half in jest do not courtesy pity chivalry generosity self-sacrifice -- in short being of use -- do not we heart tell we that they be the most beautiful noble lovely thing in the world i suppose it be so say valencium why do one admire a soldier not for he epaulette and red coat but because one know that coxcomb though he be at home here there be the power in he of that same self-sacrifice that when he be call he will go and die that he may be of use to he country and yet -- it may seem invidious to say so just now -- but there be other sort of self-sacrifice less showy but even more beautiful oh mr headley what can a man do more than die for he countryman live for they it be a longer work and therefore a more difficult and a nobler one frank speak in a somewhat sad and abstracted tone but tell I she say what all this have to do with -- with the deep matter of which you speak simply that it be the law of all earth and heaven and he who make they -- that god be perfectly powerful because he be perfectly and infinitely of use and perfectly good because he delight utterly and always in be of use and that therefore we can become like god -- as the very heathens feel that we can and ought to become -- only in proportion as we become of use i do not see it once i try to be good not know what good mean i try to be good because i think it would pay I in the world to come but at last i see that all life all devotion all piety be only worth anything only divine and god-like and god-beloved as they be mean to that one end -- to be of use it be a noble thought headley say claude : but valencium be silent it be a noble thought mellot and all thought become clear in the light of it even that most difficult thought of all which so often torment good people when they feel ' i ought to love god and yet i do not love he ' easy to love he if one can once think of he as the concentration the ideal perfection of all which be most noble admirable lovely in human character and easy to work too when one once feel that one be work for such a be and with such a be as that the whole world round we and the future of the world too seem full of light even down to its murkiest and foulest depths when we can but remember that great idea -- a infinitely useful god over all who be try to make each of we useful in he place if that be not the beatific vision of which old mystic speak so rapturously one glimpse of which be perfect bliss i at least know none nobler desire none more bless pray forgive I miss st just i ought not to intrude thus go on say valencium i -- i really have no more to say i have say too much i do not know how i have be betray so far stammer frank who have the just dislike of he school of anything like display on such solemn matter can you tell we too much truth mr headley be right mr mellot and you be wrong it will not be the first time miss st just but what i speak in jest he have answer in earnest he be quite right we be none of we half earnest enough there be lucium with the child and she rise and walk across the garden you have move the fair trifler somewhat say claude god grant it but i can not think what make I why think you speak out nobly and i shall not forget you sermon i be not preach at you most affectionate and kindly of man and laziest of man likewise what can i do now at this moment to be of use to any one set I my task but frank be follow with he eye valencia as she go hurriedly across to lucia he see she take two of the child at once off she sister 's hand and carry they away down a walk a few minute afterwards he could hear she romp with they but he could not have guess from the silver din of those merry voice that valencium 's heart be heavy within she for she conscience be really smitten of what use be she in the world major campbell have talk to she often about she duty to this person and to that of this same necessity of be useful but she have escape from the think as we have see she in laugh at poor little scoutbush on the very same score but why have not major campbell 's sermon touch she heart as this one have who can tell who be there among we to whom a oft-heard truth have not become a tiresome and superfluous commonplace till one day it have flash before we utterly new indubitable not to be disobey write in letter of fire across the whole vault of heaven all one can say be that she time be not come besides she look on major campbell as a be utterly superior to herself and that very superiority while it allow she to be as familiar with he as she choose excuse she in she own eye from open to he she real heart she could safely jest with he let he pet she play at be he daughter while she feel that between he and she lay a gulf as wide as between earth and heaven and that very notion comfort she in she naughtiness for in that case of course he code of moral be not mean for she and while she take he warning -lrb- as many of they at least as she choose -rrb- she think herself by no means bind to follow he example she all but worship he as she guardian angel : but she be not mean for a angel herself so she could indulge freely in those little escapade and frivolity for which she be bear and then whenever frightened run for shelter under he wing but to hear the same and even loftier word from the lip of the curate whom she have make she toy almost she butt be to have they bring down unexpectedly and painfully to she own level if this be he ideal why ought it not to be hers be she not he equal perhaps he superior and so she very pride humble she as she say to herself -- then i ought to be useful i can be -- will be lucia ask she that very afternoon will you let I take the child off you hand while clara be busy in the morning oh you dear good creature but it would be such a _ gêne _ they be really stupid i be afraid sometimes or else i be they make I so miserably cross at time i will take they it would be a relief to you would it not my clear say poor lucium with a doleful smile which seem to valencium 's self-accusing heart to say have you only now discover that fact from that day valencium court headley 's company more and more to fall in love with he be of course absurd and he have cure himself of he pass fancy for she there could be no harm then in she make the most of conversation so different from what she hear in the world and which in she heart of heart she like so much better for it be with valencium as with all woman in this common fault of frivolity as in most other the man rather than they be to blame valencium have cultivate in herself those quality which she see admire by the man whom she meet and some one of whom of course she mean to marry and as they female ideal be a butterfly ideal a butterfly she become but beneath all lay deep and strong the woman 's love of nobleness and wisdom the woman 's longing to learn and to be lead which have show itself in every age in so many a fantastic and even ugly shape and which be they real excuse for the flirt with genius cast themselves at the foot of director which have tempt she to coquette with elsley and be now bring she into undesirable intimacy with the poor curate she have hear that day with some sorrow he announcement that he wish to be go but as he do not refer to it again she leave the thought alone and all but forget it the subject however be renew about a week afterwards when you return to aberalva she have say in reference to some commission i shall never return to aberalva not return no i have already resign the curacy i believe you uncle have appoint to it the man whom campbell find for I : and a excellent man i hear he be at least he will do better there than i but what could have induce you how sorry all the people will be i be not sure of that say he with a smile i do what i could at last to win back at least they respect and to leave at least not hatred behind I : but i be unfit for they i do not understand they i mean -- no matter what i mean but i fail god forgive I i shall now go somewhere where i shall have simpler work to do where i shall at least have a chance of practise the lesson which i learn there i learn it all strange to say from the two people in the parish from whom i expect to learn least whom do you mean the doctor and the schoolmistress why from they less than from any in the parish she so good and he so clever that i shall never tell to any one now suffice it that i be mistaken valencium could obtain no further answer and so the day run on every one become more and more intimate till a certain afternoon on which they be all to go and pic-nic under claude 's pilotage above the lake of gwynnant scoutbush be to have be with they but a heavy day 's rain in the meanwhile swell the stream into fishing order so the little man order a car and start at three in the morning for bettw with mr bowie who however loth to give up the arrangement of plate and the extraction of champagne cork consider he presence by the river-side a natural necessity my dear miss clara ye see there 'll be nobody to see that he lordship pit on dry stocking and he be always get over the top of he water-boot be young and daft as we have all be and no offence to you and to tell you truth i can stand all temptation -- in moderation that be save a ' except the chance o ' cleik a fish chapter xx both side of the moon at once the spot which claude have choose for the pic-nic be on one of the lower spur of that great mountain of the maiden 's peak which bound the vale of gwynnant to the south above a wilderness of gnarled volcanic dyke and purple heather ledge below break into glen in which still linger pale green ashwood relic of that great primaeval forest in which in bess 's day great leicester use to rouse the hart with hound and horn among these claude have find a little lawn guard by great rock out of every cranny of which the ash grow as freely as on flat ground they foot be bed deep in sweet fern and wild raspberry and golden-rod and purple scabious and tall blue campanula above they and before they and below they the ash shake they green filigree in the bright sunshine and through they glimpse be see of the purple cliff above and right in front of the great cataract of nant gwynnant a long snow-white line zigzag down coal-black cliff for many a hundred foot and above it depth beyond depth of purple shadow away into the very heart of snowdon up the long valley of cwm-dyli to the great amphitheatre of clogwyn-y-garnedd while over all the cone of snowdon rise in perfect symmetry between he attendant peak of lliwedd and crib coch there they sit and laugh and talk the pleasant summer afternoon in they pleasant summer bower and never regret the silence of the bird so sweetly do valencia 's song go up in many a rich sad irish melody while the lowing of the milch kine and the wild cooing of the herd-boy come softly up from the vale below and all the air be fill with pleasant noise of water then claude must need photograph they all as they sit and group they first accord to he fancy and among he fancy be one that valencium should sit as queen with headley and the major at she foot and headley lounge there and look into the grass and think it well for he could he lie there for ever then claude must photograph the mountain itself and all begin to talk of it see the breadth of light and shadow say claude how the purple depth of the great lap of the mountain be throw back by the sheet of green light on lliwedd and the red glory on the cliff of crib coch till you seem to look away into the bosom of the hill mile after mile and so you do say headley i have learn to distinguish mountain distance since i have be here that peak be four mile from we now and yet the shadowed cliff at its foot seem double that distance and look look say valencium at the long line of glory with which the western sun be gilding the edge of the left hand slope bring it nearer and nearer to we every moment against the deep blue sky but what a form perfect lightness perfect symmetry say claude curve sweep over curve peak towering over peak to the highest point and then sink down again as gracefully as they rise one can hardly help fancy that the mountain move that those dancing line be not instinct with life at least say headley that the mountain be a leap wave frozen just ere it fall perfect say valencium that be the very expression so concise and yet so complete and headley poor fool feel as happy as if he have find a gold mine to I say elsley the fancy rise of some great eastern monarch sit in royal state with ample shoulder slope right and leave he lay he purple-mantled arm upon the head of two of those titan guard who stand on either side he footstool while from beneath he throne say headley as eastern poet would say flow everlasting stream life-giving to fertilise broad land below i do not know that you too be a poet say valencium nor i madam but if such scene as these and in such company can not inspire the fancy of even a poor country curate to something of exaltation he must be dull indeed why not put some of these thought into poetry what use answer he in so low sad and mean a tone mean only for she ear that valencium look down at he : but he be gaze intently upon the glorious scene be he hint at the vanity and vexation of poor elsley 's versify or do he mean that he have now no purpose in life -- no prize for which it be worth while to win honor she do not answer he : but he answer himself -- perhaps to explain away he own speech -- no madam god have write the poetry already and there it be before I my business be not to re-write it clumsily but to read it humbly and give he thanks for it more and more have valencium be attract by headley during the last few week accustom to man who try to make the greatest possible show of what small wit they possess she be surprise to find one who seem to think it a duty to keep he knowledge and taste in the background she give he credit for more talent than appear for more perhaps than he really have she be pique too at he very modesty and self-restraint why do not he like the rest who dangle about she spread out he peacock 's train for she eye and try to show he worship of she by set himself off in he brightest color and yet this modesty awed she into respect of he for she could not forget that whether he have sentiment much or little sentiment be not the staple of he manhood : she could not forget he cholera work and she know that under that delicate and bashful outside lay virtue and heroism enough and to spare but if you put these thought into word you would teach other to read that poetry my business be to teach people to do right and if i can not to pray god to find some one who can right headley say major campbell lay he hand on the curate 's shoulder god dwell no more in book write with pen than in temple make with hand and the sacrifice which please he be not verse but righteousness do you recollect queen whim what i write once in you album ` be good sweet maid and let who will be clever do noble thing not dream they all day long so make life death and that vast for ever one grand sweet song ' but you naughty hypocritical saint père you write poetry yourself and beautifully yes as i smoke my cigar to comfort my poor rheumatic old soul but if i live only to write poetry i should think myself as wise as if i live only to smoke tobacco valencium 's eye could not help glance at elsley who have wander away to the neighbouring brook and be gaze with all he eye upon a ferny rock have leave lucium to help claude with he photograph frank see she look and read its meaning and answer she thought perhaps too hastily and what a really well-read and agreeable man he be all the while what a mine of quaint learning and beautiful old legend -- if he would but bring it into the common stock for every one 's amusement instead of hoard it up for himself why what else do he do but bring it into the common stock when he publish a book which every one can read say valencium half out of the spirit of contradiction and few understand say headley quietly you be very unjust he be a very discerning and agreeable person and i shall go and talk to he and away go valencium to elsley somewhat cross woman-like she allow for the sake of she sister 's honor no one but herself to depreciate vavasor and choose to think it impertinent on headley 's part headley begin quietly talk to major campbell about botany while valencium a little ashamed of herself all the while take she revenge on elsley by scold he for he unsocial way in the very term which headley have be use at last claude have finish he photograph depart downward to get some new view from the road below and lucium return to the rest of the party valencium join they at once bring up elsley who be not in the best of humor after she diatribe and the whole party wander about the woodland and scramble down beside the torrent bed at last they come to a point where they could descend no further for the stream fall over a cliff have worn itself a narrow chasm in the rock and thunder down it into a deep narrow pool lucium who be bask in the sunshine and the flower as simple as a child would need peep over the brink and make elsley hold she while she look down a quiet happiness as of old recollection come into she eye as she watch the sparkling and foam water -- and beauty bear of murmur sound do pass into she face campbell start the lucium of seven year ago seem to bloom out again in that pale face and wrinkled forehead and a smile come over he face too as he look just like the dear old waterfall at kilanbaggan you recollect it major campbell elsley always dislike recollection of kilanbaggan recollection of she life before he know she recollection of pleasure in which he have not share : especially recollection of she old acquaintance with the major i do not i be ashamed to say reply the major why you be there a whole summer ah i suppose you think about nothing but you salmon fishing if elsley have be there he would not have forget a rock or a pool would you elsley really in spite of all salmon i have not forget a rock or a pool about the place which i ever see : but at the waterfall i never be so he have not forget what cause have he to remember so carefully think elsley oh elsley look what be that exquisite flower like a ball of gold hanging just over the water if elsley have not have the evil spirit haunt about he he would have join in lucium 's admiration of the beautiful creature as it drop into the foam from its narrow ledge with its fan of palmate leave bright green against the black moss of the rock and its golden petal glowing like a tiny sun in the darkness of the chasm : as it be he answer -- only a buttercup i be sure it be not a buttercup it be three time as large and a so much paler yellow be it a buttercup now major campbell campbell look down very nearly one after all : but its real name be the globe flower it be common enough here in spring you may see the leaf in every pasture but i suppose this plant hide from the light have keep its flower till the autumn and till i come to see it darling that it be i should like to reward it by wear it home i daresay it would be very proud of the honor especially if mr vavasor would embalm it in verse after it have do service to you it be do good enough service where it be say elsley why pluck out the very eye of that perfect picture strange say lucium that such a beautiful thing should be bear there all alone upon these rock with no one to look at it it enjoy itself sufficiently without we no doubt say elsley yes but i want to enjoy it oh if you could but get it for I elsley look down there be fifteen foot of somewhat slippery rock then a ragged ledge a foot broad in a crack of which the flower grow then the dark boil pool elsley shrug he shoulder and say smile as if it be a fine thing to say -- really my dear all man be not knight errant enough to endanger they neck for a bit of weed and i can not say that such rough _ tour de force _ be at all to my fancy lucium turn away : but she be vex campbell could see that a strange fancy for the plant have seize she as she walk from the spot he could hear she talk about its beauty to valencium campbell 's blood boil to be ask by that woman -- by any woman -- to get she that flower : and to be afraid it be bad enough to be ill-tempered but to be a coward and to be proud thereof he yield to a temptation which he have much better have leave alone see that lucium have not ask he swing himself easily enough down the ledge get the flower and put it quietly bow into mr vavasor 's hand he be frighten when he have do it for he see to he surprise that she be frightened she take the flower smile thanks and express a little commonplace horror and astonishment at he have go down such a dangerous cliff : but she take it to elsley draw he arm through hers and seem determine to make as much of he as possible for the rest of the afternoon the fellow be jealous then in addition to he other sin and campbell who feel that he have put himself unnecessarily forward between husband and wife grow more and more angry and somehow unlike he usual wont refuse to confess himself in the wrong because he be in the wrong certainly it be not pleasant for poor elsley and so lucia feel and bear with he when he refuse to be comfort and render blessing for railing when he say to she more than one angry word but she have be accustom to angry word by this time all might have pass off but for that careless valencium who have not see the detail of what have pass and so advise herself to ask where lucium get that beautiful plant major campbell pick it up for she from the cliff say elsley drily ah at the risk of he neck i do not doubt he be the most matchless _ cavalier servente _ i shall leave mr vavasor to he care then -- that be for the present say elsley draw he arm from lucium 's i assure you answer she rouse in she turn by he determined bad temper i be not the least afraid of be leave in the charge of so old a friend elsley make no answer but spring down through the thicket call loudly to claude mellot it be very naughty of lucium no doubt : but even a worm will turn and there be time when people who have not courage to hold they peace must say something or other and do not always in the hurry get out what they ought but only what they have time to think of and she forget what she have say the next minute in major campbell 's question -- be i then so old a friend mr vavasor of course who older campbell be silent a moment if he be incline to choke at least lucium do not see it i trust i have not offend you -- mr vavasor oh she say with a forced gaiety only one of he poetic fancy he want so much to see mr mellot photograph the waterfall i hope he will be in time to find he i be a plain soldier mr vavasor and i only ask because i do not understand what be poetic fancy lucium look up in he face puzzle and see there a expression so grave pity tender that she heart leap up toward he and then sink back again why do you ask why need you know you be no poet and for that very cause i ask you oh but say she guess at what be in he mind and try woman-like to play purposely at cross purpose and to defend she husband at all risk he have a extraordinary poetic faculty all the world agree to that major campbell what matter say he lucium would have be very angry and perhaps ought to have be so for what business of campbell 's be it whether she husband be kind to she or not but there be a deep sadness almost despair in the tone which disarm she oh major campbell be it not a glorious thing to be a poet and be it not a glorious thing to be a poet 's wife oh for the sake of that -- if i could but see he honor appreciate famous as he will be some day though i think -lrb- and she speak with all a woman 's pride -rrb- he be somewhat famous now be he not famous yes answer campbell with a abstracted voice and then rejoin quickly if you could but see that what then why then say she with a half smile -lrb- for she have nearly entrapped herself into a admission of what she be determine to conceal -rrb- -- why then i should be still more what i be now he devoted little wife who care for nobody and nothing but put he study to rights and bring up he child happy child say he after a pause and half to himself who have such a mother to bring they up do you really think so but flattery use not to be one of you sin ah i wish you could give I some advice about how i be to teach they so it be she who have the work of education not he think campbell to himself and then answer gaily -- my dear madam what can a confirm old bachelor like I know about child oh do not you know -lrb- and she give one of she pretty irish laugh -rrb- that it be the old maid who always write the child 's book for the benefit of we poor ignorant married woman but -lrb- and she speak earnestly again -rrb- we all know how wise and good you be i do not know it in old time i be afraid i use to torment you when i be young and foolish where on earth can mellot and mr vavasor be ask campbell oh never mind mr mellot have go wander down the glen with he apparatus and my elsley have go wander after he and will find he in due time with he head in a black bag and a great bull just go to charge he from behind like that hapless man in ` punch ' i always tell mr mellot that will be he end campbell be deeply shock to hear the light tone in which she talk of the passionate temper of a man whom she so surely love how many outburst of it there must have be how many paroxysm of astonishment shame and grief -- perhaps alas counterburst of anger -- ere that heart could have become thus proof against the ever-lowering thunder-storm well he say all we can do be to walk down to the car and let they follow and meanwhile i will give you my wise opinion about this education question whereof i know nothing it will be all oracular to I for i know nothing either and she put she arm through he and walk on do you hurt yourself then i be sure you be in pain i never less free from it with many thanks to you what make you think so i hear you breathe so hard and quite stamp you foot i think i suppose it be fancy it be not fancy nevertheless major campbell be stamp down something and succeed too in crush it they walk on toward the car valencium and headley follow they : ere they arrive at the place where they be to meet it it be quite dark : but what be more important the car be not there the stupid man must have mistake he order and go home or let he horse go home of itself while he be asleep inside he be more than half tipsy when we start so speak the major divine the exact truth there be nothing to be do but to walk the four mile home and let the two truant follow as they could we shall have plenty of time for we educational lecture say lucium plenty of time to waste then my clear lady oh i never talk with you five minute -- i do not know why -- without feel wiser and happier i envy valencium for have see so much of you of late little thought poor lucium as she speak those innocent word that within four yard of she crouch behind the wall he face and every limb writhe with mingled curiosity and rage be none other but she husband he have give place to the devil : and the devil -lrb- for the superstitious and old-world notion which attribute such frenzy to the devil have not yet be supersede by a better one -rrb- have enter into he and concentrate all the evil habit and passion which he have indulge for year into one flame hell within he miserable man he torment be sevenfold : and if he have sin he be at least punish not merely by all which a husband have a right to feel in such a case or fancy that he have a right not merely by tortured vanity and self-conceit by the agony of see any man prefer to he which to a man of elsley 's character be of itself unbearable -- not merely by the loss of trust in one whom he hail once trust utterly : -- but over and above all and worst of all by the feeling of shame self-reproach self-hatred which haunt a jealous man and which ought to haunt he for few man lose the love of woman who have once love they save by they own folly or baseness : -- by the recollection that he have trade on she trust that he have drug he own conscience with the fancy that she must love he always let he do what he would and have neglect and insult she affection because he fancy in he conceit that it be inalienable and with the loss of self-respect come recklessness of it and drive he on as it have jealous man in all age to meanness unspeakable which have make they for century poor wretch the butt of worthless playwright and the scorn of they fellow-men elsley have wander he hardly know how or whither for he call to mellot be the merest blind -- stumble over rock bruise himself against tree-trunk to this wall he know they must pass it he wait for they and have he reward blind with rage he hardly wait for the sound of they footstep to die away before he have spring into the road and hurry up in the opposite direction -- anywhere everywhere -- to escape from they and from self whipt by the fury he flee along the road and up the vale he care not whither and what be headley and valencium who of necessity have pair off together do all the while they walk on silently side by side for ten minute then frank say -- i have be impertinent miss st just and i beg you pardon no you have not say she quite hastily you be right too

dark dreary bog the moonlight shine on they runnel while the mountain on he right sloped downward more rapidly in dark dreary down strew with rock which stand out black against the sky he be near the head of the watershed soon he see slate roof glitter in the moonlight and find himself at the little inn of pen-y-gwryd at the meeting of the three great valley the central heart of the mountain and a genial jovial little heart it be and a honest kindly little heart too with warm life-blood within so it look that night with every window red with comfortable light and a long stream of glare pour across the road from the open door gilding the fir-tree top in front : but its geniality only make he shudder he have be there more than once and know the place and the people and know too that of all people in the world they be the least like he he hurry past the doorway and catch one glimpse of the bright kitchen a sudden thought strike he he would go in and write he letter there but not yet -- he could not go in yet for through the open door come some sweet welsh air so sweet that even he pause to listen man be singing in three part in that rich metallic temper of voice and that perfect time and tune which be the one gift still leave to that strange cymry race wear out with the long burden of so many thousand year he know the air it be the rising of the lark heaven what a bitter contrast to he own thought but he stand root as if spell-bound to hear it to the end the lark 's upward flight be over and elsley hear he come quiver down from heaven 's gate flutter sink trill self-complacently spring aloft in one bar only to sink lower in the next and call more softly to he brooding mate below till wear out with he ecstasy he murmur one last sigh of joy and sink into the nest the picture flash through elsley 's brain as swiftly as the note do through he ear he breathe more freely when it vanish with the sound he stride hastily in and down the little passage to the kitchen it be a low room ceil with dark beam from which hang bacon and fishing-rod harness and dry stocking and all the miscellanea of a fishing inn keep by a farmer and beneath it the usual happy hearty honest group there be harry owen bland and stalwart he baby in he arm smile upon the world in general old mr pritchard bend over the fire put the last touch to one of those miraculous soufflet

to escape handsome lady-like mr owen bustling out of the kitchen with a supper-tray run full against he and utter a welsh scream show I a room and bring I a pen and paper say he and then start in he turn as all have start at he for the two englishman look round and behold to he disgust the singer be none other than naylor the actor of punch be wynd to have find he _ bêtes noire _ even here and at

out he heavy under-lip and glance sidelong at he friend with something worse ned that man 's eye and voice have something uncanny in they mellot say he would go craze some day and be hang if i do not

patient beast of burden ready for any amount of walk at any hour in the twenty-four he have be up snowdon once to-day already he be go up again at twelve to-night with a german who want to see the sun rise he depute that office to john robert and stride out which way do the gentleman go mr owen ask naylor capel curig road naylor whisper to wynd who set the two little girl on the table and hurry out with he they look up the road and see no one run a couple of hundred yard where they catch a sight of the next turn clear in the moonlight there be no one on the road run to the bridge wynd whisper naylor he may have throw himself over tally ho whisper wynd in return lay he hand on naylor 's arm and point to the left of the road a hundred yard from they over the boggy upland among scatter boulder a dark figure be move now he stop short gesticulate turn right and leave irresolutely at last he hurry on and upward he be run spring from stone to stone there be but one thing wynd after he or he 'll drown himself in llyn cwn fynnon no he be striking to the right can he be go up the glyder we 'll see that in five minute all in the day 's work my boy i could go up mont blanc with such a dinner in I the two gallant man run in struggle into they wet boot again and provision with meat and bread whiskey tobacco and plaid be away upon elsley 's track have leave mr owen disconsolate by they announcement that a sudden fancy to sleep on the glyder have seize they nothing more will they tell she or any one be gentleman however much slang they may talk in private elsley leave the door of pen-y-gwryd careless whither he go if he go only far enough in front of he rise the glyder vawr its head shroud in soft mist through which the moonlight gleam upon the chequered quarry of that enormous desolation the dead bone of the eldest-born of time a wild longing seize he he would escape up thither up into those cloud up anywhere to be alone -- alone with he miserable self that be dreadful enough : but less dreadful than have a companion -- ay even a stone by he -- which could remind he of the scene which he have leave even remind he that there be another human be on earth beside himself yes -- to put that cliff between he and all the world away he plunge from the high road splashing over boggy upland scramble among scatter boulder across a stony torrent bed and then across another and another : -- when would he reach that dark marbled wall which rise into the infinite blank -- look within a stone-throw of he and yet no nearer after he have walk a mile he reach it at last and rush up the talus of boulder spring from stone to stone till he breath fail he and he be force to settle into a less frantic pace but upward he would go and upward he go with a strength which he never have feel before strong how should he not be strong while every vein feel fill with molten lead while some unseen power seem not so much to attract he upwards as to drive he by magical repulsion from all that he have leave below so upward and upward ever drive on by the terrible gad-fly like io of old he go stumble upward along torrent bed of slippery slate writhe himself upward through cranny where the waterfall splash cold upon he chest and face yet could not cool the inward fire climb hand and knee up cliff of sharp-edged rock stride over downs where huge rock lay crouch in the grass like fossil monster of some ancient world and seem to stare at he with still and angry brow upward still to black terrace of lava stand out hard and black against the gray cloud gleam like iron in the moonlight stair above stair like those over which vathek and the princess climb up to the hall of ebli over they crumble step up through they crack and cranny out upon a dreary slope of broken stone and then -- before he dive upward into the cloud ten yard above he head -- one breathless look back upon the world the horizontal curtain of mist gauzy below fringed with white tuft and streamer deepen above into the blackness of utter night below it a long gulf of soft yellow haze in which as in a bath of gold lie delicate bar of far-off western cloud and the faint glimmer of the western sea above long knotted spur of hill in deepest shades like a bunch of purple grape fleck here and there from behind with gleam of golden light and beneath they again the dark wood sleep over gwynnant and they dark double sleeping in the bright lake below on the right hand snowdon rise vast sheet of utter blackness -- vast sheet of shine light he can see every crag which jut from the green wall of galt-y-wennalt and far past it into the great valley of cwn dylus and then the red peak now as black as night shut out the world with its huge mist-topped cone but on the left hand all be deepest shade from the highest saw-edge where moel meirch cut the golden sky down to the very depth of the abyss all be lustrous darkness sooty and yet golden still let the darkness lie upon it for ever hide be those wood where she stand a hour ago hide that road down which even now they may be pacing home together -- curse the thought he cover he face in he hand and shudder in every limb he lift he hand from he eye at last : -- what have befall before the golden haze a white veil be fall fast sea mountain lake be vanish fading as in a dream soon he can see nothing but the twinkle of a light in pen-y-gwryd a thousand foot below happy child be nestle there in innocent sleep jovial voice be chat round the fire what have he to do with youth and health and joy lower lower ye cloud -- shut out that insolent and intrude spark till nothing be see but the silver sheet of cwm fynnon and the silver zig-zag line which wander into it among black morass while down the mountain side go softly slide troops of white mist-angel softly they slide swift and yet motionless as if by some inner will which need no force of limb glide gently round the crag diving gently off into the abyss they long white robe trail about they foot in upward-floating fold let we go hence they seem to whisper to the god-forsaken as legend say they whisper when they leave they doom shrine in old jerusalem let the white fringe fall between he and the last of that fair troop let the gray curtain follow the black pall above descend till he be alone in darkness that may be feel and in the shadow of death now he be safe at last hide from all live thing -- hidden it may be from god for at least god be hide from he he have desire to be alone : and he be alone the center of the universe if universe there be all create thing sun and planet seem to revolve round he and he a point of darkness not of light he seem to float self-poised in the center of the boundless nothing upon a ell-broad slab of stone -- and yet not even on that : for the very ground on which he stand he do not feel he do not feel the mist which wet he cheek the blood which throb within he vein he only be and there be none beside horrible thought permit but to few and to they -- thank god -- but rarely for two minute of that absolute self-isolation would bring madness if indeed it be not the very essence of madness itself there he stand he know not how long without motion without think without even rage or hate now -- in one blank paralysis of he whole nature conscious only of self and of a dull inward fire as if he soul be a dark vault light with lurid smoke \* \* \* \* \* what be that he start : shudder -- as well he might have he see heaven open or another place so momentary be the vision that he scarce know what he see there it be again lasting but for a moment : but long enough to let he see the whole western heaven transfigure into one sheet of pale blue gauze and before it snowdon towering black as ink with every saw and crest cut out hard and terrible against the lightning-glare : -- and then the blank of darkness again the awful black giant tower high in air before the gate of that blue abyss of flame : but a black crown of cloud have settle upon he head and out of it the lightning spark leap to and fro ring he brow with a coronet of fire another moment and the roar of that great battle between earth and heaven crash full on elsley 's ear he hear it leap from snowdon sharp and rattle across the gulf toward he till it crash full upon the glyder overhead and roll and flap from crag to crag and die away along the dreary downs no there it boom out again thunder full against siabod on the left and siabod toss it on to moel meirch who answer from all she cleft and peak with a long confused battle-growl and then toss it across to aran and aran with one dull bluff report from she flat cliff to nearer lliwedd till wear out with the long buffering of that giant ring it sink and die on gwynnant far below -- but ere it die another and another thunder-crash burst sharper and nearer every time to hurry round the hill after the one which roar before it another minute and the blue glare fill the sky once more : but no black titan tower before it now the storm have leap llanberri pass and all around elsley be one howl chaos of cloud and rain and blind flame he turn and flee again by the sensation of he foot he know that he be go up hill and if he but go upward he care not whither he go the rain gush through where the lightning pierce the cloud in drop like musket ball he be drench to the skin in a moment dazzle and giddy from the flash stun by the everlasting roar peal over-rushing peal echo out-shooting echo till rock and air quiver alike beneath the continuous battle-cannonade -- what matter what fitter guide for such a path as mine than the blue lightning flash poor wretch he have go out of he way for many a year to give himself up a willing captive to the melodramatic view of nature and have let sight and sound not principle and duty mould he feeling for he : and now in he utter need and utter weakness he have meet she in a mood which be too awful for such as he be to resist the nemesis have come and sweep away helplessly without faith and hope by those outward impression of thing on which he have feast he soul so long he be the puppet of he own eye and ear the slave of glare and noise breathless but still untired he toil up a steep incline where he could feel beneath he neither moss nor herb now and then he foot brush through a soft tuft of parsley fern : but soon even that sign of vegetation cease he foot only rasp over rough bare rock and he be alone in a desert of stone what be that sudden apparition above he see for a moment dim and gigantic through the mist hide the next in darkness the next flash show he a line of obelisk like giant crouch side by side stare down on he from the cloud another five minute he be at they foot and past they to see above they again another line of awful watcher through the storm and rain of many a thousand year wait grim and silent like those doom senator in the capitol of rome till they own turn should come and the last lightning stroke hurl they too down to lie for ever by they fall brother whose mighty bone bestrew the scree below he grope he way between they see some fifty yard beyond a higher peak gain it by fierce struggle and many fall saw another beyond that and rush down and up two slope of moss reach a region where the upright lava-ledge have be split asunder into chasm crush together again into cave topple over each other hurl up into spire in such chaotic confusion that progress seem impossible a flash of lightning reveal a lofty cairn above he head there be yet then a higher point he would reach it if he break every limb in the attempt and madly he hurry on feel he way from ledge to ledge squeeze himself through cranny crawl on hand and knee along the sharp chine of the rock till he reach the foot of the cairn climb it and throw himself at full length on the summit of the glyder vawr a awful place it always be and elsley see it at a awful time as the glare unveil below he a sea of rock-wave all sharp on edge point toward he on every side : or rather one wave-crest of a sea for twenty yard beyond all slope away into the abysmal dark terrible be those rock below and ten time more terrible as see through the lurid glow of he distempered brain all the weird peak and slab seem point up at he : sharp-toothed jaw gape upward -- tongue hiss upward -- arm point upward -- hound leap upward -- monstrous snake-head peer upward out of crack and cave do he not see they move writhe or be it the ever-shifting light of the flash do he not hear they howl yell at he or be it but the wind tortured in they labyrinthine cavern the next moment and all be dark again but the image which have be call up remain and fasten on he brain and grow there and when in the light of the next flash the scene return he could see the red lip of the phantom hound the bright eye of the phantom snake the tongue wag in mockery the hand brandish great stone to hurl at he the mountain-top be instinct with fiendish life -- a very blocksberg of all hideous shape and sin and yet he do not shrink horrible it be he be go mad before it and yet he take a strange and fierce delight in make it more horrible in maddening himself yet more and more in clothing those fantastic stone with every fancy which could inspire another man with dread but he have no dread perfect rage like perfect love cast out fear he rejoice in he own misery in he own danger he life hang on a thread any instant might hurl he from that cairn a blacken corpse what better end let it come he be prometheus on the peak of caucasus hurl defiance at the unjust jove he hope he love he very honor -- curse it -- ruin let the lightning stroke come he be a coward to shrink from it let he face the worst unprotected bare-headed naked and do battle himself and nothing but himself against the universe and as man at such moment will do in the mad desire to free the self-tortured spirit from some unseen and choke bond he begin wildly tear off he clothes but merciful nature bring relief and stop he in he mad effort or he have be a frozen corpse long ere the dawn he hand stiff with cold refuse to obey he as he delay he be save after the paroxysm come the collapse he sink upon the top of the cairn half senseless he feel himself fall over its edge and the animal instinct of self-preservation unconsciously to he make he slide down gently till he sink into a crack between two rock sheltered somewhat as it befall happily from the lash of the rain another minute and he sleep a dreamless sleep but there be two man upon that mountain whom neither rock nor rain storm nor thunder have conquer because they be simply brave honest man and who be perhaps far more poetic character at this moment than elsley vavasor or any dozen of mere verse-writer because they be hazard they life on a errand of mercy and all the while have so little notion that they be hazard they life or do anything dangerous or heroic that instead of be touch for a moment by nature 's melodrama they be jest at each other 's trouble greet each interval of darkness with mock shout of misery and despair liken the crag to various fogy of they acquaintance male and female and only pull the cutty pipe out of they mouth to chant snatch of jovial song they be wynd and naylor the two cambridge boating-man in bedrabbled flannel trousers and shooting-jacket pocketful of water who be both fully agree that hunting a mad poet over the mountain in a thunder-storm be on the whole the jolliest lark they ever have in they life he must have go up here somewhere i see the poor beggar against the sky as plain as i see you -- which i do not -- for darkness cut the speech short where be you william say the keeper here i be sir say the beater with my ` eel above my ` ed wery well william when you get you ` ed above you ` eel gae on but i be stuck fast between two stone hang the stone and naylor burst into a old seventeenth century ditty of the day of three-man glee they stoan they stoan they stoan they stoan -- they stoan that build george riddler 's oven o they be fetch from blakeney quarr ' and george he be a jolly old man and he head do grow above he har ' one thing in george riddler i must commend and i hold it for a valiant thing with any three brother in gloucestershire he swear that he three son should sing there be dick the tribble and tom the mane let every man sing in he own place and william he be the eldest brother and therefore he should sing the base -- i be down again this be my thirteenth fall so be i i shall just lie and light a pipe come on now and look round the lee side of this crag we shall find he bundle up under the lee of one of they he do not know lee from windward i dare say he 'll soon find out the difference by he skin -- if it be half as wet at least as mine be i 'll tell you what naylor if the poor fellow have cross the ridge and try to go down on the twll du he be a dead man by this time he 'll have funk it when he come to the edge and see nothing but mist below but if he have wander on to the cliff above trifaen he be a dead man then at all event get out of the way of that flash a close shave that i believe my whisker be singe ` pon my honor wynd we ought to be say we prayer rather than joke in this way we may do both and be none the worse as for come to grief old boy we be on a good errand i suppose and the devil himself can not harm we still shame to he who be ashamed of say he prayer as arnold use to say and all the while these two brave lad have be thrust they lanthorn into every crack and cranny and beat round every crag carefully and cunningly till long past two in the morning here be the ordnance cairn at last and -- here be i astride of a carving-knife i think come and help I off or i shall be split to the chin i be come what be this soft under my foot who-o-o-oop run he to earth at last and diving down into a crack wynd drag out by the collar the unconscious elsley what a swab like a piece of wet blotting-paper lucky he be not make of salt he be dead say naylor not a bit i can feel he heart there be life in the old dog yet and they begin under the lee of a rock chafe he wrap he in they plaid and pour whiskey down he throat it be some time before vavasor recover he consciousness the first use which he make of it be to bid he preserver leave he querulously at first and then fiercely when he find out who they be leave I i say can not i be alone if i choose what right have you to dog I in this way my dear sir we have as much right here as any one else and if we find a man die here of cold and fatigue -- what business of yours if i choose to die there be no harm in you die sir say naylor the harm be in we let you die i assure you it be entirely to satisfy we own conscience we be trouble you thus and he begin press he to take food no sir nothing from you you have show I impertinence enough in the last few week without press on I benefit for which i do not wish let I go if you will not leave I i shall leave you and he try to rise : but stiffen with cold sink back again upon the rock in vain they try to reason with he beg he pardon for all past jest : he make effort after effort to get up and at last he limb regain strength by the fierceness of he passion support he and he struggle onward toward the northern slope of the mountain you must not go down till it be light it be as much as you life be worth i be go to bangor sir and go i will i tell you there be fifteen hundred foot of slippery scree below you as steep as a house-roof and with every tile on it loose you will roll from top to bottom before you have go a hundred yard what care i let I go i say curse you sir do you mean to use force i do say wynd quietly as he take he round arm and body and set he down on the rock like a child you have assault I sir the law shall avenge this insult if there be law in england i know nothing about law : but i suppose it will justify I in save any man 's life who be rush to certain death look here sir say naylor go down if you will when it grow light : but from this place you do not stir yet whatever you may think of we conduct to-night you will thank we for it to-morrow morning when you see where you be the unhappy man stamp with rage the red glare of the lanthorn show he he two powerful warder stand right and leave he feel that there be no escape from they but in darkness and suddenly he dash at the lanthorn and try to tear it out of wynd 's hand steady sir say wynd spring back and parry he outstretched hand if you wish we to consider you in you sens you will be quiet and if you do not choose to appear sane say naylor you must not be surprise if we treat you as man be treat who -- you understand I elsley be silent awhile he rage find itself impotent subside into dark cunning really gentleman he say at length i believe you be right i have be very foolish and you very kind but you would excuse my absurdity if you know they provocation my dear sir say naylor we be bind to believe that you have good cause enough for what you be do we have no wish to interfere impertinently only wait till daylight and wrap yourself in one of we plaid as the only possible method of carry out you own intention for dead man can not go to bangor whithersoever else they may go you really be too kind but i believe i must accept you offer under penalty of be call mad and elsley laugh a hollow laugh for he be by no means sure that he be not mad he take the proffer wrapper lay down and seem to sleep wynd and naylor congratulating themselves on he better mind lay down also beneath the other plaid intend to watch he but wear out with fatigue they be both fast asleep ere ten minute have pass elsley have determine to keep himself awake at all risk and he pay a bitter penalty for so do for now that the fury have pass away he brain begin to work freely again and inflict torture so exquisite that he look back with regret on the unreasoning madness of last night as a less fearful hell than that of thought of deliberate acute recollection suspicion train of argument which he try to thrust from he and yet could not who have not know in the still sleepless hour of night how dark thought will possess the mind with terror which seem logical irrefragable inevitable so it be then with the wretched elsley within he mind a whole train of devil 's advocate seem argue with triumphant subtlety the certainty of lucium 's treason and justify to he he rage he hatred he flight he desertion of he own child -- if indeed -lrb- so far have the devil lead he astray -rrb- they be he own at last he could bear it no longer he would escape to bangor and then to london cross to france to italy and there bury himself amid the forest of the apennine or the sunny glen of calabrium and for a moment the vision of a poet 's life in that glorious land brighten he dark imagination yes he would escape thither and be at peace and if the world hear of he again it should be in such a thunder-voice as those with which shelley and byron from they southern seclusion have shake the ungrateful motherland which cast they out he would escape and now be the time to do it for the rain have long since cease the dawn be approach fast the cloud be thin from black to pearly gray now be he time -- be it not for those two man to be keep guard stop by they or by any man shameful intolerable he have flee hither to be free and even here he find himself a prisoner true they have promise to let he go if he wait till daylight but perhaps they be deceive he as he be deceive they -- why not they think he mad it be a ruse a stratagem to keep he quiet awhile and then bring he back -- restore he to he afflict friend he friend truly he would be too cunning for they yet and even if they mean to let he go would he accept liberty from they or any man no he be free he have a right to go and go he would that moment he raise himself cautiously the lanthorn have burn to the socket : and he could not see the man though they be not four yard off but by they regular and heavy breathing he could tell that they both sleep soundly he slip from under the plaid draw off he shoe for fear of noise among the rock and rise what if he do make a noise what if they wake chase he bring he back by force curse the thought -- and glide close to they he listen again to they heavy breathing how could he prevent they follow he a horrible nameless temptation come over he every vein in he body throb fire he brain seem to swell to burst and ere he be aware he find himself feel about in the darkness for a loose stone he could not find one thank god that he could not find one but after that dreadful thought have once cross he mind he must flee from that place ere the brand of cain be on he brow with a cunning and activity utterly new to he he glide away like a snake downward over crag and boulder he know not how long or how far all he know be that he be go down down down into a dim abyss there be just light enough to discern the upper surface of a rock within arm 's length beyond that all be blank he seem to be hour descend to be go down mile after mile : and still he reach no level spot the mountain-side be too steep for he to stand upright except at moment it seem one uniform quarry of smooth broken slate slip down for ever beneath he foot -- whither he grow giddy and more giddy and a horrible fantastic notion seize he that he have lose he way that somehow the precipice have no bottom no end at all that he be go down some infinite abyss into the very depths of the earth and the molten root of the mountain never to reascend he stop tremble only to slide down again terrify he try to struggle upward : but the shale give way beneath he foot and go he must what be that noise above he head a fall stone be he enemy in pursuit down to the depth of hell rather than that they should take he he drive he heel into the slippery shale and rush forward blindly spring slip fall roll till he stop breathless on a jut slab and lo below he through the thin pearly veil of cloud a dim world of dark cliff blue lake gray mountain with they dark head wrap in cloud and the straight vale of nant francon magnify in mist till it seem to stretch for hundred of league towards the rosy north-east dawn and the shine sea with a wild shout he hurry onward in five minute he be clear of the cloud he reach the foot of that enormous slope and hurry over rocky way till he stop at the top of a precipice full six hundred foot above the lonely tarn of idwal never mind he know where he be now he know that there be a passage somewhere for he have once see one from below he find it and almost run along the boggy shore of idwal look back every now and then at the black wall of the twll du in dread lest he should see two move speck in hot pursuit and now he have gain the shore of ogwen and the broad coach-road and down it he stride run at time past the roar cataract past the enormous cliff of the carnedd past tin-y-mae where nothing be stir but a bark dog on through the sleep street of bethesda past the black stair of the penrhyn quarry the huge click ant-heap be silent now save for the roar of ogwen as he swirl and bubble down rich coffee-brown from last night 's rain on past rich wood past trim cottage garden gay with flower past rhododendron shrubbery broad field of golden stubble sweet clover and gray swede with ogwen make music far below the sun be up at last and colonel pennant 's grim slate castle towering above black wood glitter metallic in its ray like chaucer 's house of fame he stop to look back once far up the vale eight mile away beneath a roof of cloud the pass of nant francon gape high in air between the great jaw of the carnedd and the glyder its cliff mark with the upright white line of the waterfall he be clear of the mountain clear of that cursed place and all its cursed thought on past llandegaus and all its rose-clad cottage past yellow quarryman walk out to they work who stare as they pass at he haggard face drench clothes and streaming hair he do not see they one fix thought be in he mind and that be the railway station at bangor he be stride through bangor street now beside the summer sea from which fresh scent of shore-weed greet he he have rather smell the smoke and gas of the strand the station be shut he look at the bill outside there be no train for full two hour and he throw himself wear out with fatigue upon the doorstep now a new terror seize he have he money enough to reach london have he he purse at all too dreadful to find himself stop short on the very brink of deliverance a cold perspiration break from he forehead as he feel in every pocket yes he purse be there : but he turn sick as he open it and dare hardly look hurrah five pound six -- eight that will take he as far as pari he can walk beg the rest of the way if need be what will he do now wander over the town and gaze vacantly at one little object and another about the house front one thing he will not look at and that be the bright summer sea all golden in the sun ray fleck with gay white sail from all which be bright and calm and cheerful he soul shrink as from a impertinence he long for the lurid gas-light of london and the roar of the strand and the everlasting stream of face among whom he may wander free sure that no one will recognize he the disgrace the desperate the weary hour roll on too tired to stand longer he sit down on the shaft of a cart and try not to think it be not difficult body and mind be alike wear out and he brain seem fill with uniform dull mist a shop-door open in front of he a boy come out he see bottle inside and shelf the look of which he know too well the bottle-boy whistle begin to take the shutter down how often in whitbury of old have elsley do the same half amuse he watch the lad and wonder how he spend he evening and what work he read and whether he ever think of write poetry and as he watch all he past life rise up before he ever since he serve out medicine fifteen year ago -- he wild aspiration heavy labor struggle plan brief triumph long disappointment : and here be what it have all come to -- a failure -- a miserable shameful failure not that he think of it with repentance with a single wish that he have do otherwise : but only with disappointed rage yes he say bitterly to himself -- ` we poet in we youth begin in gladness but after come despondency and madness ' this be the way of the world with all who have nobler feeling in they than will fit into its cold rule curse the world what on earth have i to do with mix myself up in it and marry a fine lady fool that i be i might have know from the first that she could not understand I that she would go back to she own let she go i will forget she and the world and everything -- and i know how and spring up he walk across to the druggist 's shop year before elsley have try opium and find unhappily for he that it feed he fancy without inflict those torture of indigestion which keep many happily for they from its magic snare he have try it more than once of late : but lucia have have a hint of the fact from thurnall and in just terror have exact from he a solemn promise never to touch opium again elsley be a man of honor and the promise have be keep but now -- i promise she and therefore i will break my promise she have break hers and i be free and he go in and buy he opium he take a little on the spot to allay the craving of hunger he reserve a full dose for the railway-carriage it would bridge over the weary gulf of time which lay between he and town he take he second-class place at last not without stare and whisper from those round at the wild figure which be start for london without bag or baggage but as the clerk agree if he be run away from he creditor it be a shame to stop he if he be run from the police they would have the more sport the longer the run at least it be no business of theirs there be one thing more to do and he do it he write to campbell a short note if as i suppose you expect from I ` the satisfaction of a gentleman ' you will find I at adelphus i be not escape from you but from the whole world if by shoot I you can quicken my escape you will do I the first and last favor which i be likely to ask from you he post he letter settle himself in a corner of the carriage and take he second dose of opium from that moment he recollect little more a confused whirl of hedge and wood rattle station scream and flash train great red town white chalk cutting while the everlasting roar and rattle of the carriage shape themselves in he brain into a hundred snatch of old tune all full of a strange merriment as if mock at he misery strive to keep he awake and conscious of who and what he be he close he eye and shut out the hateful garish world : but that sound he could not shut out too tired to sleep too tired even to think he could do nothing but submit to the ridiculous torment watch in spite of himself every note as one jig-tune after another be fiddle by all the imp close to he ear mile after mile and county after county for all that weary day which seem full seven year long at euston square the porter call he several time ere he could rouse he he could hear nothing for awhile but that same imp ' melody even though it have stop at last he get out stare round he shake himself awake by one strong effort and hurry away not know whither he go wrapt up in self he wander on till dark sleep on a doorstep and awake not know at first where he be gradually all the horror come back to he and with the horror the craving for opium wherewith to forget it he look round to see he whereabouts surely this must be golden square a sudden thought strike he he go to a chemist 's shop buy a fresh supply of he poison and take only enough to allay the craving of he

uppermost in she mind be -- oh that i could find frank headley happy be it for frank 's love paradoxical as it may seem that it have conquer just at that moment of terrible distress valencium 's acceptance of he have be hasty found rather on sentiment and admiration than on deep affection and she feeling might have falter wane die away in self-distrust of its own reality if giddy amusement if mere easy happiness have follow it but now the fire of affliction be brand in the thought of he upon she softened heart living at the utmost strain of she character campbell go she brother useless and lucium and the child depend utterly on she there be but one to whom she could look for comfort while she need it most utterly and happy for she and for she lover that she could go to he poor lucium thank god that i have some one who will never treat I so who will lift I up and shield I instead of crush I -- dear creature -- oh that i may find he and she heart go out after frank with a gush of tenderness which she have never feel before be this then love she ask herself and she find time to slip into she own room for a moment and arrange she dishevelled hair ere she enter the breakfast-room frank be there luckily alone pacing nervously up and down he hurry up to she catch both she hand in he and gaze into she wan and haggard face with the intensest tenderness and anxiety valencium 's eye look into the depths of he passive and confide till they fail before the keenness of he gaze and swim in glitter mist ah think she sorrow be a light price to pay for the feeling of be so love by such a man you be tire -- ill what a night you must have have mellot have tell I all oh my poor sister and wildly she pour out to frank she wrath against elsley she inability to comfort lucium and all the misery and confusion of the past night this be a sad dawn for the day of my triumph think frank who long to pour out he heart to she on a thousand very different matter : but he be content it be enough for he that she could tell he all and confide in he a truer sign of affection than any selfish love-making and he ask and answer with such tenderness and thoughtfulness for poor lucium with such a deep comprehension of elsley 's character pity while he blame that he win he reward at last oh it would he intolerable if i have not through it all the thought and blush crimson she head droop on she bosom she seem ready to drop with exhaustion sit down sit down or you will fall say frank lead she to a chair and as he lead she he whisper with flutter heart new to its own happiness and longing to make assurance sure -- what think she be silent still but he feel she hand tremble in he the thought of I she look up in he face how beautiful and in another moment neither know how she be clasp to he bosom he cover she face she hair with kiss : she do not move from that moment she feel that he be she husband oh guide I counsel I pray for I sob she i be all alone and my poor sister she be go mad i think and i have no one to trust but you and you -- you will leave I to go to those dreadful war and then what will become of I oh stay only a few day and hold he convulsively she answer he kiss with she own frank stand as in a dream while the room reel round and vanish and he be alone for a moment upon earth with she and he great love tell I say he at last try to awaken himself to action tell I be she really go to seek he yes selfish and forgetful that i be you must help I she will go to london nothing can stop she -- and it will kill she it may drive she mad to keep she here it will and that drive I mad also what can i choose follow where god lead it be she after all who must reclaim he leave she in god 's hand and go with she to london but my brother mellot or i will see he let it be I mellot shall go with you to london oh that you be go oh that i be i will follow though do you think that i can be long away from you but i must tell you brother i have a very different matter on which to speak to he this morning say he with a sad smile : but better as it be he shall find I i hope reasonable and trustworthy in this matter perhaps enough so to have my valencium commit to I precious jewel i must learn to be a man now at least now that i have you to care for and yet you go and leave I valencia because god have give we to each other shall we thank-offering be to shrink cowardly from he work he speak more sternly than he intend to awe into obedience rather himself than she for he feel poor fellow he courage fail fast while he hold that treasure in he arm she shudder in silence forgive I he cry i be too harsh valencium no she cry look up at he with a glorious smile scold I be harsh to I it be so delicious now to be reprove by you and as she speak she feel as if she would rather endure torture from that man 's hand than bliss from any other how many strange word of lucium 's that new feeling explain to she word at which she have once grow angry as doting weakness unjust and degrading to self-respect poor lucium she might be able to comfort she now for she have learn to sympathise with she by experience the very opposite to hers yet there must have be a time when lucium cling to elsley as she to frank how horrible to have she eye open thus -- to be tear and fling away from the bosom where she long to rest it could never happen to she of course she frank be true though all the world be false : but poor lucium she must go to she this be mere selfishness at such a moment you will find scoutbush then this moment i will order the car now if you will only eat you must and he ring the bell and then make she sit down and eat almost feed she with he own hand that too be a new experience and one so strangely pleasant that when bowie enter and stare solemnly at the pair she only look up smile though blush a little get a car instantly say she for mr vavasor my lady she have order hers already no for mr headley he be go to find my lord frank pour I out a cup of tea for lucium bowie vanish mystified it be no concern of mine but better tak ' up wus ' a godly meenister than a godless pawet say the worthy warrior to himself as he march down stair you see that i be assert we rights already before all the world say she look up i see you be not ashamed of I ashamed of you and now i must go to lucium and to london valencium begin to cry like any baby but rise and carry away the tea in she hand must i go and before you come back too be she determine to start instantly i can not stop she you see she have order the car then go my darling my own my valencium oh a thousand thing to ask you and no time to ask they in i can write say frank with a inquire smile write yes every day -- twice a day i shall live upon those letter

frank rise and walk downstairs abstractedly bowie keep close to he side ye 'll pardon I sir say he in a low voice but i see how it be -- the more blessing for you ye 'll be pleased i trust to take more care of this jewel than other have of that one : or -- or you 'll shoot I yourself bowie say frank half amuse half awed too by the stern tone of the guardsman i 'll give you leave to do it if i deserve it it be no my duty either as a soldier or as a valet and indeed i have that opeenion of you sir that i do not think it 'll need to be any one 's else 's duty either and so do mr bowie signify he approbation of the new family romance and go off to assist mr clara in get the trunk down stair clara be in high dudgeon she have not yet complete she flirtation with mr bowie and feel it hard to have she one amusement in life snatch out of she hard-worked hand i be sure i do not know why we be move i do not believe it be business some of he tantrum i daresay i hear she walk up and down the

minute the lady be pack into the carriage and away under mellot 's care frank watch valencium look back and smile through she tear as they roll through the village and then get into he car and rattle down the southern road to pont aberglaslyn he hand still tingle with the last pressure of valencium 's chapter xxiii the broad stone of honor but where have stangrave be all this while where any give bachelor have be for any give month be difficult to say and no man 's business but he own but where he happen to be on a certain afternoon in the first week of October on which he have just hear the news of alma be -- upon the hill between em and coblentz walking over a high table-land of stubble which would be grass in england and yet with all its tillage be perhaps not worth more than english grass would be thanks to that small-farm system much be-praised by some who know not wheat from turnip then along a road which might be a devon one cut in the hill-side through authentic devonian slate where the deep chocolate soil be lodge on the top of the upright stratum and a thick coat of moss and wood sedge cluster about the oak-scrub root round which the delicate and rare oak-fern mingle its frond with great blue campanula while the white admiral and silver-washed fritillary flit round every bramble bed and the great purple emperor come down to drink in the road puddle and sit fearless flash off they velvet wing a blue as of that empyrean which be dark by excess of light down again through cultivate land corn and clover flax and beet and all the various crop with which the industrious german yeoman eke out he little patch of soil past the thrifty husbandman himself as he guide the two milch-kine in he tiny plough and stop at the furrow 's end to greet you with the hearty german smile and bow while the little fair-haired maiden walk beneath the shade of standard cherry walnut and pear all gray with fruit fill the cow ' mouth with chicory and wild carnation and pink saintfoin and many a fragrant weed which richer england waste down once more into a glen but such a glen as neither england nor america have ever see or please god ever will see glorious as it be stangrave who know all europe well have walk the path before but he stop then as he have do the first time in awe on the right slope up the bare slate downs up to the foot of cliff but only half of those cliff god have make above the gray slate ledge rise cliff of man 's handiwork pierce with a hundred square black embrasure and above they the long barrack-range of a soldier 's town which a foeman storm once when it be young : but what foeman will ever storm it again -lrb- transcriber 's note : punctuation miss from the end of this sentence in original possibly question mark -rrb- what conqueror 's foot will ever tread again upon the broad stone of honor and call ehrenbreitstein he on the leave the clover and the corn range on beneath the orchard bough up to yon knoll of chestnut and acacia tall poplar feathered larch : -- but what be that stonework which gleam gray beneath they stem ' a summer-house for some great duke look out over the glorious rhine vale and up the long vineyard of the bright moselle from whence he may bid he people eat drink and take they ease for they have much goods lay up for many year -- bank over bank of earth and stone cleft by deep embrasure from which the great gun grin across the rich garden stud with standard fruit-tree which close the glaci to its topmost edge and there below he lie the vineyard : every rock-ledge and narrow path of soil toss its golden tendril to the sun gray with ripen cluster rich with noble wine but what be that wall which wind among they up and down creep and sneak over every ledge and knoll of vantage ground pierce with eyelet-hole back by strange stair and gallery of stone till it rise close before he to meet the low round tower full in he path from whose deep casemate as from dark scowl eye-hole the ugly cannon-eye stare up the glen stangrave know they all -- as far as any man can know the ward of the key which lock apart the nation the yet maiden troy of europe the greatest fortress of the world he walk down turn into the vineyard and lie down beneath the mellow shade of vine he have no sketch-book -- article forbid he passport be in he pocket and he speak all tongue of german man so fearless of gendarme and soldier he lie down in the blaze german afternoon upon the shaly soil and watch the bright-eyed lizard hunt fly along the roasting-wall and the great locust buzz and pitch and leap green locust with red wing and gray locust with blue wing he note the species for he be tired and lazy and have so many thought within he head that he be glad to toss they all away and give up he soul if possible to locust and lizard vine and shade and far below he fleet the mighty rhine rich with the memory of two thousand stormy year and on its further bank the grey-walled coblentz town and the long arch of the moselle-bridge and the rich flat of kaiser franz and the long poplar-crested upland which look so gay and be so stern for everywhere between the poplar-stem the saw-toothed outline of the western fort cut the blue sky and far beyond it all sleep high in air the eifel with its hundred crater peak blue mound behind blue mound melting into white haze -- stangrave have walk upon those hill and stand upon the crater-lip of the great moselkopf and dream beside the laacher see beneath the ancient abbey wall and he thought flit across the moselle flat towards he ancient haunt as he ask himself -- how long have that old eifel lain in such soft sleep how long ere it awake again it may awake geologist confess -- why not and blacken all the sky with smoke of tophet pour its stream of boil mud once more to dam the rhine whelm the work of man in flood and ash and fire why not the old earth seem so solid at first sight : but look a little nearer and this be the stuff of which she be make -- the wreck of past earthquake the leavings of old flood the washing of cold cinder heap -- which be smoulder still below stangrave know that well enough he have climb vesuvius etna popocatepetl he have feel many a earthquake shock and know how far to trust the everlasting hill and be old david right he think that day when he hold the earthquake and the volcano as the truest symbol of the history of human kind and of the dealings of they maker with they all the magnificent plutonic imagery of the hebrew poet have it no meaning for man now do the lord still uncover the foundation of the world spiritual as well as physical with the breath of he displeasure be the solfa-tara of tophet still ordain for tyrant and do the lord still arise out of he place to shake terribly the earth or have the moral world grow as sleepy as the physical one have seem to have do would anything awful unexpected tragical ever burst forth again from the heart of earth or from the heart of man surprising question what can ever happen henceforth save infinite railroad and crystal palace peace and plenty cockaigne and dilettantism to the end of time be it not full sixty whole year since the first french revolution and six whole year since the revolution of all europe bah -- change be a thing of the past and tragedy a myth of we forefather war a bad habit of old barbarian eradicate by the spread of a enlighten philanthropy man know now how to govern the world far too well to need any divine visitation much less divine punishment and stangrave be a utopian dreamer only to be excuse by the fact that he have in he pocket the news that three great nation be go forth to tear each other as of yore nevertheless look round upon those grim earth-mound and embrasure he could not but give the man who put they there credit for suppose that they might be want ah but that might be only one of the direful necessity of the decaying civilisation of the old world what a contrast to the unarmed and peaceful prosperity of he own country thank heaven new england need no fortress military road or stand army true but why that flush of contemptuous pity for the poor old world which could only hold its own by such expensive and ugly method he ask himself that very question a moment after angrily for he be out of humor with himself with he country and indeed with the universe in general and across he mind flash a memorable conversation at constantinople long since during which he have make some such unwise remark to thurnall and receive from he a sharp answer which part they for year it be natural enough that that conversation should come back to he just then for in he jealousy he be think of tom thurnall often enough every day and in spite of he enmity he could not help suspect more and more that thurnall have have some right on he side of the quarrel he have be twit thurnall with the miserable condition of the labourer in the south of england and extol he own country at the expense of ours tom unable to deny the fact have wax all the more wroth at have it press on he and at last have burst forth -- well and what right have you to crow over we on that score i suppose if you could hire a man in america for eighteen-penny a day instead of a dollar and a half you would do it you american be not accustom to give more for a thing than it be worth in the market be you but stangrave have answer the glory of america be that you can not get the man for less than the dollar and a half that he be too well feed too prosperous too well educate to be make a slave of and therefore make slave of the nigger instead i 'll tell you what i be sick of that shallow fallacy -- the glory of america do you mean by america the country or the people you boast all of you of you country as if you have make it yourselve and quite forget that god make america and america have make you make we sir quoth stangrave fiercely enough make you reply thurnall exaggerate he half truth from anger to what be you comfort you high feed you very education owe but to you have a thin population a virgin soil and unlimited means of emigration what credit to you if you need no poor law when you pack off you child as fast as they grow up to clear more ground westward what credit to you yeoman that they have read more book than we clod have while they can earn more in four hour than we poor fellow in twelve it all depend on the mere physical fact of you be in a new country and we in a old one : and as for moral superiority i sha not believe in that while i see the whole of the northern state so utterly give up to the ` almighty dollar ' that they leave the honor of they country to be make duck and drake of by a few southern slaveholder moral superiority we hold in england that a honest man be a match for three rogue if the same law hold good in the united state i leave you to settle whether northerner or southerner be the honester man whereupon -lrb- and no shame to stangrave -rrb- there be a heavy quarrel and the two man have not meet since but now those word of thurnall 's back by far bitterer one of marie 's be fret stangrave 's heart -- what if they be true they be not the whole truth there be beside and above they all a nobleness in the american heart which could if it choose and when it choose give the lie to that bitter taunt : but have it do so already at least he himself have not if thurnall and marie be unjust to he nation they have not be unjust to he he at least have be make all he life mere outward blessing cause of self-congratulation and not of humility he have be pride himself on wealth ease luxury cultivation without a thought that these be god 's gift and that god would require a account of they if thurnall be right be he himself too truly the typical american and bitterly enough he accuse at once himself and he people noble marie be right we boast of we nobleness : better to take the only opportunity of show it which we have have since we have become a nation heap with every blessing which god could give beyond the reach of sorrow a check even a interference shut out from all the world in god 's new eden that we might freely eat of all the tree of the garden and grow and spread and enjoy ourselves like the bird of heaven -- god only lay on we one duty one command to right one simple confess conscious wrong and what have we do -- what have even i do we have steadily deliberately cringe at the foot of the wrong-doer even while we boast we superiority to he at every point and at last for the sake of we own selfish ease help he to forge new chain for he victim and receive as we only reward fresh insult white slave we perhaps and not the english peasant be the white slave at least if the irishman emigrate to england or the englishman to canada he be not hunt out with blood-hound and deliver back to he landlord to be scourge and chained he be not practically out of the pale of law unrepresented forbid even the use of book and even if he be there be a excuse for the old country for she be found on no political principle but discover what she know step by step a sort of political topsy as claude mellot call she who have ` kinder grow ' do from hand to mouth what seem best but that we who profess to start as a ideal nation on fix idea of justice freedom and equality -- that we should have be stultifying ever since every great principle of which we so loudly boast -- \* \* \* \* \* the old jew use to say of he nation ` it be god that have make we and not we ourselves ' we say ` it be we that have make ourselves while god -- ' -- ah yes i recollect god 's work be to save a soul here and a soul there and to leave america to be save by the american who make it we must have a broader and deeper creed than that if we be to work out we destiny the battle against middle age slavery be fight by the old catholic church which hold the jewish notion and look on the deity as the actual king of christendom and every man in it as god 's own child i see now -- no wonder that the battle in america have as yet be fight by the quaker who believe that there be a divine light and voice in every man while the calvinist preacher with they isolate and individualise creed have look on with fold hand content to save a negro 's soul here and there whatsoever might become of the body and the national future of the whole negro race no wonder while such man have the teaching of the people that it be necessary still in the nineteenth century in a protestant country amid sane human being for such a man as mr sumner to rebut in sober earnest the argument that the negro be the descendant of canaan doom to eternal slavery by noah 's curse \* \* \* \* \* he would rouse himself he would act speak write as many a noble fellow-countryman be do he have avoid they of old as bore and fanatic who would need wake he from he luxurious dream he have even hate they simply because they be more righteous than he he would be a new man henceforth he stride down the hill through the cannon-guarded vineyard among the busy group of peasant yes marie be right life be mean for work and not for ease to labor in danger and in dread to do a little good ere the night come when no man can work : instead of try to realize for oneself a paradise not even bunyan 's shepherd-paradise much less fourier 's casino-paradise and perhaps least of all because most selfish and isolate of all my own heart-paradise -- the apotheosis of loaf as claude call it ah tennyson 's palace of art be a true word -- too true too true art what if the most necessary human art next to the art of agriculture be after all the art of war it have be so in all age what if i have be befool -- what if all the anglo-saxon world have be befool by forty year of peace we have forget that the history of the world have be as yet write in blood that the story of the human race be the story of its hero and its martyr -- the slayer and the slay be it not become such once more in europe now and what divine exemption can we claim from the law what right have we to suppose that it will be aught else as long as there be wrong unredressed on earth as long as anger and ambition cupidity and wound pride canker the heart of man what if the wise man 's attitude and the wise nation 's attitude be that of the jew

prepare for the next thunder-burst it be a ugly fact : but i have thrust it away too long and i must accept it now and henceforth this and not luxurious broadway this and not the comfortable new england village be the normal type of human life and this be the model city -- armed industry which till the corn and vine among the cannon ' mouth which never forget they need though it may mask and beautify they terror : but know that as long as cruelty and wrong exist on earth man 's destiny be to dare and suffer and if it must be so to die yes i will face my work my danger if need be i will find marie i will tell she that i accept she quest not for she sake but for its own only i will demand the right to work at it as i think best patiently moderately wisely if i can for a fanatic i can not be even for she sake she may hate these slaveholder -- she may have she reason -- but i can not i can not deal with they as _ fera naturae _ i can not deny that they be no worse man than i that i should have do what they be do have say what they be say have i be breed up as they have be with irresponsible power over the soul and body of human being god i shudder at the fancy the brute that i might have be -- that i should have be yes one thing at least i have learn in all my experiment on poor humanity -- never to see a man do a wrong thing without feeling that i could do the same in he place i use to pride myself on that once fool that i be and call it comprehensiveness i use to make it a excuse for sit by and see the devil have it all he own way and call that toleration i will see now whether i can not turn the say knowledge to a better account as common sense patience and charity and yet do work of which neither i nor my country need be ashamed he walk down and on to the

before the detective come at two how to pass the weary weary time for i be past thinking -- almost past pray -- though not quite thank god he pace up still noisy piccadilly and then up silent bond street pause to look at some strange fish on grove 's counter -- anything to while away the time then he plod on toward the top of the street and turn into mr pillischer 's shop and upstairs to the microscopic club-room there at least he can forget himself for a hour he look round the neat pleasant little place with its case of curiosity and its exquisite photograph and bright brass instrument its glass vase stock with delicate water-plant and animalcule with the sunlight gleam through the green and purple seaweed frond while the air be fresh and fragrant with the seaweed scent a quiet cool little hermitage of science amid that great noisy luxurious west-end world at least it bring back to he the thought of the summer sea and aberalva and he shore-study : but he can not think of that any more it be past and may god forgive he at one of the microscope on the slab opposite he stand a sturdy bearded man he back toward the major while the wise little german hopeless of customer be lean over he in he shirt sleeve but i never have see its like it have just like a painter 's easel in its stomach yesterday why it be a echinus larva : a suck sea-urchin hang it if i have know you have not

undignified abel drugger to dose bashi-bazouk impossible and with such a opening as you have there you must excuse I but my opinion of you prudence must not be so rudely shake why do you not ask the question which balzac 's old tourangeoi judge ask whenever a culprit be bring before he -- ` who be she ' take for grant that there be a woman at the bottom of every mishap i understand you say the major with a sad smile now let you and I walk a little together and look at the echinoid another day -- or when i return from sevastopol -- tom go out with he a new ray of hope have cross the major 's mind he meeting with thurnall might he providential for he recollect now for the first time mellot 's parting hint you know elsley vavasor well no man better do you think that there be any tendency to madness in he no more than in any other selfish vain irritable man with a strong imagination leave to run riot humph you seem to have divine he character may i ask you if you know he before you meet he at aberalva tom look up sharply in the major 's face you would ask what cause i have for inquire i will tell you presently meanwhile i may say that mellot tell I frankly that you have some power over he and mention mysteriously a name -- john brigg i think -- which it appear that he once assume if mellot think fit to tell you anything i may frankly tell you all john brigg be he real name i have know he from childhood and then tom pour into the ear of the surprised and somewhat disgusted major all he have to tell you have keep you secret mercifully and use it wisely sir and i and other shall be always you debtor for it now i dare tell you in turn in strictest confidence of course -- i be far too poor to afford the luxury of babble and the major tell he what we all know i expect as

literary friend of he and yet no trace have he go to the continent heaven know i have inquire at every passport office for news of any one answer he description indeed i have two detective i may tell you at this moment watch every possible place there be but one hope if he be alive can he have go home to he native town never anywhere but there be there any old friend of the lower class with whom

out-patient at st mumpsimus 's some month every year i know that he be there this summer for i write to ask at brigg 's request and brigg send he a sovereign through I but what make you fancy that he can have take shelter with such a man and one who know he secret it be but a chance : but he may have do it from the mere feeling of loneliness -- just to hold by some one whom he know in this great wilderness especially a man in whose eye he will be a great man and to whom he have do a kindness still it be the merest chance we will take it nevertheless forlorn hope though it be they take a cab to the hospital and with some trouble get the man 's name and address and drive in search of he they have some difficulty in find he abode for it be up a alley at the back of drury lane in the top of one of those foul old house which hold a family in every room but by dint of knock at one door and the other and bear meekly much revile consequent thereon they arrive _ per modum tollendus _ at a

drunken dog as he be thus it be with they all the world over so much the worse for they say tom cynically and for the man too they make fool of we first with we over-fondness of they and then they let we make fool of ourselves with they over-fondness of we i fancy sometimes that they be all mean to be the mate of angel and stoop to man as a _ pis aller _ reverse the old story of the son of heaven and the daughter of man and accounting for the present degeneracy when the son of heaven marry the daughter of man they offspring be giant and man of renown now the son of man marry the daughter of heaven and the offspring be wiggle waggle windbag and redtape they visit one public-house after another till the girl find for they the man they want a shabby sodden-visaged fellow with a would-be jaunty air of conscious shrewdness and vanity who stand before the bar he thumb in he armhole and lay down the law to a group of coster-boy for want of a better audience the girl after sundry pluck at he coat-tail stop he in the midst of he oration and explain she errand somewhat fearfully mr barker bent down he head on one side to signify that he be absorb in attention to she news and then draw himself up once more lift he greasy hat high in air bow to the very floor and break forth : -- most potent grave and reverend signior : a man of war and eke a man of peace -- that be if you come peaceful and if not have we not hiren here and the fellow put himself into a fresh attitude we come in peace my good sir say tom first to listen to you talented effusion and next for a little private conversation on a subject on which -- but mr barker interrupt -- to listen and to drink the muse be dry and pegasus doth thirst for hippocrene and fain would paint -- imbibe the vulgar call -- or hot or cold or long or short -- attendant the bar girl who know he humor come forward glass all round -- these noble knight will pay -- of hottest hot and stiffest stiff thou mark ` st I now to you quest and he face round with a third attitude do you know mr brigg ask the straightforward major he roll he eye to every quarter of the seventh sphere clap he hand upon he heart and assume a expression of angelic gratitude : -- my benefactor be the world a waste a thistle-waste ass-nibbled goldfinch-pecked and all the man and woman merely ass i still could lay this hand upon this heart and cry ` not yet alone i know a man -- a man jove-fronted and hyperion-curled -- a gush flushing blush human heart ' as sure as you live sir say tom if you will not talk honest prose i will not pay for the brandy and water base be the slave who pay and baser prose -- hang uninspired patter ` tis in verse that angel praise and fiend in limbo curse and ass bray i think say tom in despair do you know where mr brigg be now and why the devil do you want to know for that be a verse sir although somewhat slow the two man laugh in spite of themselves better tell the fellow the plain truth say campbell to thurnall come out with we and i will tell you and campbell throw down the money and lead he off after he have gulp down he own brandy and half tom 's beside what leave the nepenthe untasted they take he out and he tuck he arm through theirs and strut down drury lane the fact be sir -- i speak to you of course in confidence as one gentleman to another -- mr barker reply by a lofty and gracious bow that he family be exceedingly distressed at he absence and he wife who as you may know be a lady of high family dangerously ill and he can not be aware of the fact this gentleman be the medical man of she family and i -- i be a intimate friend we should esteem it therefore the very greatest service if you would give we any information which -- weep no more gentle shepherd weep no more for lycida you sorrow be not dead sink though he be upon a garret floor with fume of morpheus ' crown about he head fume of morpheus ' crown ask thurnall that crimson flower which crown the sleepy god and sweep the soul aloft though flesh may nod he have take to opium say thurnall to the bewildered major what i should have expect god help he we must save he out of that last lowest deep cry campbell where be he sir a vow a vow i have a vow in heaven why guide the hound toward the tremble hare we adonai have drunk poison oh what deaf and viperous murderer could crown life 's early cup with such a draught of woe as i live sir cry campbell lose he self-possession in disgust at the fool you may rhyme you own nonsense as long as you will but you sha not quote the adonai about that fellow in my presence mr barker shake himself fiercely free of campbell 's arm and face round at he in a fight attitude campbell stand eye he sternly but at he wit 's end mr barker say tom blandly will you have another glass of brandy and water or shall i call a policeman sir sputter he speak prose at last this gentleman have insult I he have call my poetry nonsense and my friend a fellow and blood shall not wipe out -- what liquor may the hint be sufficient but ere he have drain another glass mr barker be decidedly incapable of manage he affair much less theirs and become withal exceedingly quarrelsome return angrily to the grievance of brigg have be call a fellow in spite of all they entreaty he talk himself into a passion and at last to campbell 's extreme disgust rush out of the bar into the street this be too vexation to have keep half-an-hour 's company with such a animal and then to have he escape I after all a just punishment on I for pander to he drunkenness tom make no answer but go quietly to the door and peep out pay for he liquor major and follow keep a few yard behind I there will be less chance of he recognize we than if he see we both together why where do you think he be go not home i can see ten to one that he will go rage off straight to brigg to put he on he guard against we just like a drunkard 's cunning it would be there he have turn up that side street now follow I quick oh that he may only keep he leg they gain the bottom of that street before he have turn out of it and so through another and another till they run he to earth in one of the court out of st martin 's lane into a doorway he go and up a stair tom stand listen at the bottom till he hear the fellow knock at a door far above and call out in a drunken tone then he beckon to campbell and both careless of what might follow run upstairs and push he aside enter the room without ceremony they chance of be on the right scent be small enough consider that though every one be out of town there be a million and a half of people in london at that moment and unfortunately at least fifty thousand who would have consider mr john barker a desirable visitor but somehow in the excitement of the chase both have forget the chance against they and the probability that they would have to retire downstairs again apologise humbly to some wrathful joseph buggin whose conviviality they might have interrupted but no tom 's cunning have as usual play he true and as they enter the door they behold none other than the lose elsley vavasor alia john brigg major campbell advance bow hat in hand with a courteous apology on he lip it be a low lean-to garret there be a deal table and a old chair in it but no bed the window be break the paper hang down in strip elsley be stand before the empty fireplace he hand in he bosom as if he have be startle by the scuffle outside he have not shave for some day so much tom could note but no more he see the glance of recognition pass over elsley 's face and that a ugly one he see he draw something from he bosom and spring like a cat almost upon the table a flash -- a crack he have fire a pistol full in campbell 's face tom be startle not at the thing but that such a man should have do it he have see soul and too many flit out of the world by that same tiny crack in californian tavern arabian desert australian gully he know all about that : but he like campbell and he breathe more freely the next moment when he see he stand still erect a quiet smile on he face and feel the plaster drop from the wall upon he own head the bullet have go over the major all be right he be not man enough for a second shot think tom quietly while the major 's eye be on he i beg you pardon mr vavasor he hear the major say in a gentle unmoved voice for this intrusion i assure you that there be no cause for any anger on you part and i be come to entreat you to forget and forgive any conduct of mine which may have cause you to mistake either I or the lady whom i be unworthy to mention i be glad the beggar fire at he think tom one spice of danger and he be himself again and will overawe the poor cur by mere civility i be afraid of some abject methodist parson humility which would give the other party a handle elsley hear he with a stupefied look like that of a trap wild beast in which rage shame suspicion and fear be mingle with the vacant glare of the opium-eater 's eye then he eye droop beneath campbell 's steady gentle gaze and he look uneasily round the room still like a trap wild beast as if for a hole to escape by then up again but sidelong at major campbell i assure you sir on the word of a christian and a soldier that you be labor under a entire misapprehension for god 's sake and mr vavasor 's sake come back sir to those who will receive you with nothing

he foot to and fro he arm straight down by he side he finger clutch after something then he look up hurriedly again at campbell and thurnall look at he also and he face be as the face of a angel miserable ass think tom if he do not see innocence in that man 's countenance he would not see it in he own child 's elsley suddenly turn he back to they and thrust he hand into he bosom now be tom 's

elsley for neither dear lad let bygones be bygones and do you be a new man and go home to mr vavasor never never never never never never shriek elsley like a baby every word increase in intensity till the whole house ring and then throw himself into the crazy chair and dash he head between he hand upon the table this be a case for I major campbell i think you have better go now you will not leave

not fit to be see come to my room then in the adelphus and have a wash and a shave it will make you as fresh as a lark again and then we 'll send out for the eatables and have a quiet chat elsley do not say no thurnall take the thing as a matter of course and he be too weak and tired to argue with he beside there be a sort of relief in the company of a man who though he know all chat on to he cheerily and quietly as if nothing have happen who at least treat he as a sane man from any one else he would have shrink lest they should find he out : but a companion who know the worst at least save he suspicion and dread he weakness now that the collapse after passion have come on clung to any human friend the very sound of tom 's clear sturdy voice seem pleasant to he after long solitude and silence at least it keep off the fiend of memory tom anxious to keep elsley 's mind employ on some subject which should not be painful begin chat about the war and its prospects elsley soon catch the cue and talk with wild energy and pathos opium-fed of the come struggle between despotism and liberty the arise of poland and hungary and all the grand dream which then haunt mind like he by jove say tom you be yourself again now why do not you put all that into a book i may perhaps say elsley proudly and if it come to that why not come to the war and see it for yourself a new country -- one of the finest in the world new scenery new actor -- why constantinople itself be a poem yes there be another ` revolt of islam ' to be write yet why do not you become we war poet come and see the fight for there 'll be plenty of it let they say what they will the old bear be not go to drop he dead donkey without a snap and a hug come along and tell people what it be all really like there will be a dozen cockney write battle song i 'll warrant who never see a man shoot in they life not even a hare come and give we the real genuine grit of it -- for if you can not who can it be a grand think the true war poet after all have be warrior themselves körner and alcaeus fight as well as sing and sing because they fight old homer too -- who can believe that he have not hew he way through the very battle which he describe and see every wound every shape of agony a noble thought to go out with that army against the northern anarch singing in the van of battle as taillefer sing the song of roland before william 's knight and to die like he the proto-martyr of the crusade with the melody yet upon one 's lip and he face blaze up with excitement what a handsome fellow he be after all if there be but more of he say tom to himself i wonder if he would fight though when the singing-fever be off he he take elsley upstairs into he bed-room get he wash and shave : and send out the woman of the house for mutton chop and stout and begin himself set out the luncheon table while elsley in the room within chant to himself snatch of poetry the notion have take : he be compose a war song already i believe it actually be so : but elsley 's brain be weak and wander and he be soon silent and motionless so long that tom open the door and look in anxiously he be sit on a chair he hand fall on he lap the tear run down he face well ask tom smilingly not notice the tear how go on the opera i hear through the door the orchestra tuning for the prelude elsley look up in he face with a puzzle piteous expression do you know thurnall i fancy at moment that my mind be not what it be fancy flit from I as quickly as they come i have twenty verse five minute ago and now i can not recollect one no wonder think tom to himself my clear fellow recollect all that you have suffer with this neuralgia believe I all you want be animal strength chop and porter will bring all the verse back or better one instead of they he try to make elsley eat and elsley try himself : but fail the moment the meat touch he lip he loathe it and only courtesy prevent he leave the room to escape the smell the laudanum have do its work upon he digestion he try the porter and drink a little : then suddenly stop he pull out a phial drop a heavy dose of he poison into the porter and toss it off sell be i say tom to himself he must have hide the bottle as he come out of the room with I oh the cunning of those opium-eater however it will keep he quiet just now and to eaton square i must go you have better be quiet now my dear fellow after you dose talk will only excite you settle yourself on my bed and i 'll be back in a hour so he put elsley on he bed carefully remove razor and pistol -lrb- for he have still he fear of a outburst of passion -rrb- then lock he in run down into the strand throw himself into a cab for eaton square and ask for valencium campbell have be there already so tom take care to tell nothing which he have not tell expect and rightly that he would not mention elsley 's have fire at he lucia be still all but senseless too weak even to ask for elsley to attempt any meeting between she and she husband would be madness what will you do with the unhappy man mr thurnall keep he under my eye day and night till he be either rational again or -- do you think that he may -- oh my poor sister i think that he may yet end very sadly madam there be no use conceal the truth from you all i can promise be that i will treat he as my own brother valencium hold out she fair hand to the young doctor he stoop and lift the tip of she finger to he lip i be not worthy of such a honor madam i shall study to deserve it and he bow himself out the same sturdy self-confident tom do right he hardly know why save that it be all in the way of business and now arise the puzzle what to do with elsley he have set he heart on go down to whitbury the next day he have be in england nearly six month and have not yet see he father he heart yearn too after the old place and mark armsworth and many a old friend whom he might never see again however that fellow i must see to come what will : business first and pleasure afterwards if i make he all right -- if i even get he out of the world decently i get the scoutbush interest on my side -- though i believe i have it already still it be as well to lay people under as heavy a obligation as possible i wish miss valencium have ask I whether elsley want any money : it be expensive keep he myself however poor thing she have other matter to think of : and i dare say never know the pleasure of a empty purse here we be three-and-sixpence -- eh cabman i suppose you think i be bear Saturday night there be three shilling now do not chaff I my excellent friend or you will find you have meet you match and a leetle more and tom hurry into he room and find elsley still sleep he set to work packing and arrange for with he every moment find its business : and presently hear he patient call faintly from the next room thurnall say he i have be a long journey i have be to whitbury once more and follow my father about he garden and sit upon my mother 's knee and she teach I one text and no more over and over again she say it as she look down at I with still sad eye the same text which she speak the day i leave she for london i never see she again ` by this my son be admonish of making of book there be no end and much study be a weariness of the flesh let we hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep he commandment for this be the whole duty of man ' yes i will go down to whitbury and he a little child once more i will take poor lodgings and crawl out day by day down the old lane along the old river-bank where i feed my soul with fair and mad dream and reconsider it all from the beginning -- and then die no one need know I and if they do they need not be ashamed of I i trust -- ashamed that a poet have rise up among they to speak word which have be hear across the globe at least they need never know my shame -- never know that i have break the heart of a angel who give herself to I body and soul -- attempt the life of a man whose shoe i be not worthy to unloose -- never know that i have kill my own child -- that a blacker brand than cain 's be on my brow -- never know -- oh my god what care i let they know all as long as i can have do with sham and affectation dream and vain ambition and he just my own self once more for one day and then die and he burst into convulsive weep no tom do not comfort I i ought to die and i shall die i can not face she again let she forget I and find a husband who will -- and be a father to the child whom i neglect oh my darling my darling if i could but see you once again : but no you too would ask I where i have be so long you too would ask I -- you innocent face at least would -- why i have kill you little brother -- let I weep it out thurnall let I face it all this very misery be a comfort for it will kill I all the sooner if you really mean to go to whitbury my poor dear fellow say tom at last i will start with you to-morrow morning for i too must go i must see my father you will really ask elsley who begin to cling to he like a child i will indeed believe I you be right you will find friend there and admirer too i know one you do ask he look up mary armsworth the banker 's daughter what that purse-proud vulgar man do not be afraid of he a truer and more delicate heart do not beat no one have more cause to say so than i he will receive you with open arm and need be tell no more than be necessary while as he friend you may defy gossip and do just what you like tom slip out that afternoon pay elsley 's pittance of rent at he old lodgings buy he a few necessary article and lend he without say anything a few more elsley sit all day as one in a dream moan to himself at interval and follow tom vacantly with he eye as he move about the room excitement misery and opium be fast wear out body and mind and tom put he to bed that evening as he would have put a child tom walk out into the strand to smoke in the fresh air and think in spite of himself of that fair saint from whom he be so perversely fly gay girl slither past he look round at he but in vain those two great sad eye hang in he fancy and he could see nothing else ah -- if she have but give he back he money -- why what a fool he would have make of himself better as it be he be mean to be a vagabond and a adventurer to the last and perhaps to find at last the luck which have flit away before he he pass one of the theater door there be a group outside more noisy and more earnest than such group be wont to be and ere he could pass through they a shout from within rattle the door with its mighty pulse and seem to shake the very wall another and another -- what be it fire no it be the news of alma and the group surge to and fro outside and talk and question and rejoice and smart gent forget they vulgar pleasure and look for a moment as if they too could have fight -- have fight -- at alma and sinful girl forget they shame and look more beautiful than they have do for many a day as beneath the flare gas-light they face glow for a while with noble enthusiasm and woman 's sacred pity while they question tom take he for a officer as to whether he think there be many kill i be no officer : but i have be in many a battle and i know the russian well and have see how they fight and there be many a brave man kill and many a one more will be oh do it hurt they much ask one poor thing not often quoth tom thank god thank god and she turn suddenly away and with the impulsive nature of she class burst into violent sobbing and weep poor thing perhaps among the man who fight and fall that day be he to whom she owe the curse of she young life and after he she lonely heart go forth once more faithful even in the lowest pit you be strange creature woman woman think tom : but i know that many a year ago now then -- the game be grow fast and furious it seem oh that i may find myself soon in the thickest of it so say tom thurnall and so say major campbell too that night as he prepare everything to start next morning to southampton the better the day the better the deed quoth he when a man be travel to a better world he need not be afraid of start on a Sunday chapter xxv the banker and he daughter tom and elsley be safe at whitbury at last and tom ere he have see he father have pack elsley safe away in lodgings with a old dame whom he can trust then he ask he way to he father 's new abode a small old-fashioned house with low bay window jut out upon the narrow pavement tom stop and look in the window he father be sit close to it in he arm-chair he hand upon he knee he face lift to the sunlight with chin slightly outstretch and he pale eye feel for the light the expression would have be painful but for its perfect sweetness and resignation he countenance be not perhaps a strong one but its delicacy and calm and the high forehead and the long white lock be most venerable with a blind man 's exquisite sense he feel tom 's shadow fall on he and start and call he by name for he have be expect he and thinking of nothing else all the morning and take for grant that it must be he in another moment tom be at he father 's side what need to describe the sacred joy of those first few minute even if it be possible but unrestrained tenderness between man and man rare as it be and as it be unaccustomed to itself have no passionate fluency no metaphor or poetry such as man pour out to woman and woman again to man all its language lie in the tone the look the little half-concealed gesture hint which pass themselves off modestly in jest and such be tom 's first interview with he father till the old isaac have feel tom 's head and hand again and again to be sure whether it be he very son or no make he sit down by he hold he still fast and begin -- now tell I tell I while jane get you something to eat no jane you must not talk to master tom yet to bother about how much he be grow -- nonsense i must have he all to myself jane go and get he some dinner now tom as if he be afraid of lose a moment you have be a dear boy to write to I every week but there be so many question which

real holothurian or not and tom begin and tell for a full half-hour interrupted then by some little comment of the old man 's which prove how prodigious be the memory within imprison and force to feed

be read to I a book of mr lee 's adventure in australium which read like a novel delicious book -- to I at least why there be she step outside i do believe and she father 's with she the lighter woman 's step be inaudible to tom but the heavy deliberate waddle of the banker be not he open the house-door and then the parlour-door without knock but when he see the visitor he stop on the threshold with outstretched arm hillo ho who have we here we prodigal son return with he pocket full of nugget from the digging oh mum 's the word be it as tom lay he finger on he lip come here then and let 's

but no man will touch that fifty thousand for no one would marry I for myself say mary and no one shall marry I for my money so she greet tom shyly and humbly without look in he face yet very cordially and then slip away to deposit on the table a noble pine-apple a little bit of fruit from she greenhouse say the old man in a disparage tone : and oh jane bring I a saucer here be a sprat i just caper out of hemmelford mill-pit perhaps the doctor would like it fry for supper if it be big enough not to fall through the gridiron jane who know mark armsworth 's humor bring in the largest

old man lay back in he chair and cover he face with he handkerchief and be quite still awhile and tom watch he and think that he would give all he cunning and power to be like that old man then jane come in and lay the cloth -- a coarse one enough -- and tom pick a cold mutton bone with a steel fork and drink he pint of beer from the public-house and light he father 's pipe and then he own and vow that he have never dine so well in he life and begin he traveller 's story again and in the evening mark come in with a bottle of the '21 in he coat-tail pocket and the three sit and chat while

while she have go up to the room after tell she father with a kiss not to forget to say he prayer and then she feed she canary bird and make up the persian cat 's bed and then sit long at the open window gaze out over the shadow-dappled lawn away to the poplar sleep in the moonlight and the shine silent stream and the shine silent star till she seem to become as one of they and a quiet heaven within she eye take counsel with the quiet heaven above and then she draw in suddenly as if sting by some random thought and shut the window a picture hang over she mantelpiece -- a portrait of she mother who have be a country beauty in she time she glance at it and then at the looking-glass would she have give she fifty thousand pound to have exchange she face for such a face as that she catch up she little thomas à kempis mark through and through with line and reference and sit and read steadfastly for a hour and more that be she school as it have be the school of many a noble soul and for

i 'll stop he mouth with a good dinner i suppose he be gentleman enough to invite as much a gentleman as you and i not of the very first water of course still he eat like other people and do not break many glass during a sit think he could not have be a very great cad to marry a nobleman 's daughter why no speak well for he that consider he breeding he must be a very clever fellow to have catch the trick of the thing so soon and so he be a very clever fellow too clever by half and a very fine-hearted fellow too in spite of he conceit and he temper but that do not prevent he be a awful fool you speak like a book tom say old mark clap he on the back look at I no one can say i be ever trouble with genius : but i can show my money pay my way eat my dinner kill my trout hunt my hound help a lame dog over a stile -lrb- which be mark 's phrase for do a generous thing -rrb- and thank god for all and who want more i should like to know but here we be -- you go up first they find elsley crouch up over the empty grate he head in he hand and a few scrap of paper by he on which he have be try to scribble he do not look up as they come in but give a sort of impatient half-turn as if angry at be disturbed tom be about to announce the banker but he announce himself come to do myself the honor of call on you mr vavasor i be sorry to see you so poorly i hope we whitbury air will set all right you mistake I sir my name be brigg say elsley without turn he head but a moment after he look up angrily mr armsworth i beg you pardon sir but what bring you here be you come sir to use the rich

hope that you would come up and take a family dinner i could do no less run on the banker see that elsley be prepare a peevish answer consider the honor that i hear you have be to you native town a very distinguish person we friend tom tell I and we ought to be proud of you and behave to you as you deserve for i be sure we do not send too many clever fellow out of whitbury would that you have never send I say elsley in he bitter way ah sir that be matter of opinion you would never have be hear of down here never have have justice do you i mean for hear of you have be there be my daughter have read you poem again and again -- always quote they and very pretty they sound too poetry be not in my line of course still it be a credit to a man to do anything well if he have the gift and she tell I that you have it and plenty of it and though she be no fine lady thank heaven i 'll back she for good sense against any woman come up sir and judge for yourself if i do not speak the truth she will be delighted to meet you and bid I say so by this time good mark have talk himself out of breath and elsley flushing up as of old at a little praise begin to stammer a excuse he nerve be so weak and he spirit so break with late trouble my dear sir that be the very reason i want you to come a bottle of port will cure the nerve and a pleasant chat the spirit nothing like forget all for a little time and then to it again with a fresh lease of strength and beat it at last like a man too late my dear sir i must pay the penalty of my own folly say elsley really win by the man 's cordiality never too late sir while there be life leave in we and he go on in a gentler tone if we all be to pay for we own folly or lie down and die when we see they come full cry at we heel where would any one of we be by now i have be a fool in my time young gentleman more than once or twice and that too when i be old enough to be you father : and down i go and deserve what i get : but my rule always be -- fight fair fall soft know when you have get enough and do not cry out when you have get it : but just go home train again and say -- better luck next fight and so old mark 's sermon end -lrb- as most of they do -rrb- in somewhat socratic allegory savor rather of the market than of the study but elsley understand he and look up with a smile you too be somewhat of a poet in you way i see sir i never think to live to hear that sir i can not doubt now that you be cleverer than you neighbor for you have find out something which they never do but you will come -- for that be my business elsley look inquiringly at tom he have learn now to consult he eye and lean on he like a child tom look a stout yes and elsley say languidly -- you have give I so much new and good advice in a few minute sir that i must really do myself the pleasure of come and hear more well do we side cry old mark dinner at half-past five no london late hour here sir miss armsworth will be out of she mind when she hear you be come and off he go do you think he 'll come up to the scratch tom i be very much afraid he courage will fail he i will see he again and bring he up with I : but now my dear mr armsworth do remember one thing that if you go on with he at you usual rate of hospitality the man will as surely be drunk as he nerve and brain be all but ruin and if he be so he will most probably destroy himself to-morrow morning destroy himself he will the shame of make a fool of himself just now before you will be more than he could bear so be stingy for once he will not wish for it unless you press he but if he talk -lrb- and he will talk after the first half-hour -rrb- he will forget himself and half a bottle will make he mad and then i will not answer for the consequence good gracious why these poet want as tender handling as a bag of gunpowder over the fire you speak like a book there in you turn and tom go home to he father he return in due time a new difficulty have arise elsley under the excitement of expectation have go out and deign to buy laudanum -- so will a unhealthy craving degrade a man -- of old bolus himself who luckily do not recognize he he have take he fullest dose and be now unable to go anywhere or do anything tom do not disturb he : but go away sorely perplexed and very much mind to tell a white lie to armsworth in whose eye this would be a offence -- not unpardonable for nothing with he be unpardonable save lie or cruelty -- but very grievous if a man have drunk too much wine in he house he would have simply keep he eye on he afterwards as a fool who do not know when he have he quotum but laudanum drinking -- involve too the breaking of a engagement which well manage might have be of immense use to elsley -- be a very different matter so tom know

life and death now i 'll try the house where he be bear somewhere in water lane it be i know and toward water lane he hurry it be a low-lying offshoot of the town lead along the water meadow with a straggle row of house on each side the perennial haunt of fever and ague before they on each side the road and fringed with pollard willow and tall poplar run a tiny branch of the whit to feed some mill below and spread out meanwhile into pond and mire full of offal and duckweed and rank float grass a thick mist hang knee-deep over they and over the garden right and left and as tom come down on the lane from the main street above he could see the mist spreading across the water-meadow and reflect the moon-beam like a lake and as he walk into it he feel as if he be walk down a well and he hurry down the lane look out anxiously ahead for the long cloak at last he come to a better sort of house that might be it he would take the chance there be a man of the middle class and two or three woman stand at the gate he go up -- pray sir do a medical man name brigg ever live here what do you want to know for why -- tom think matter be too serious for delicacy -- i be look for a gentleman and think he might have come here and so he do if you mean one in a queer hat and a cloak how long since why he come up we garden a hour or more ago walk right into the parlor without with you leave or by you leave and stare at we all round like one out of he mind and so away as soon as ever i ask he what he be at -- which way to the river i expect : i run out and see he go down the lane but i be not go far by night alone with any such strange customer lend I a lanthorn then for heaven 's sake the lanthorn be lend and tom start again down the lane now to search at the end of the lane be a cross road parallel to the river a broad still ditch lie beyond it with a little bridge across where one get minnow for bait : then a broad water-meadow then silver whit the bridge-gate be open tom hurry across the road to it the lanthorn show he fresh footmark go into the meadow forward up and down in that meadow for a hour or more do tom and the tremble youth beat like a brace of pointer dog stumble into gripe and over sleep cow and more than once stop short just in time as they be walk into some broad and deep feeder almost in despair and after have search down the river bank for full two hundred yard tom be on the point of return when he eye rest on a part of the stream where the mist lay higher than usual and let the reflection of the moonlight off the water reach he eye and in the moonlight ripple close to the farther bank of the river -- what be that black lump tom know the spot well the river there be very broad and very shallow flow round low island of gravel and turf it be very low just now too as it generally be in October : there could not be four inch of water where the black lump lay but on the side nearest he the water be full knee deep the thing whatever it be be forty yard from he and it be a cold night for wade it might be a hassock of rush a tuft of the great water-dock a dead dog one of the hang with which the club-water be stud tear up and strand : but yet to tom it have not a canny look as usual here be i get wet dirty and miserable about matter which be not the slightest concern of mine i believe i shall end by get hang or shoot in somebody else 's place with this confound spirit of meddle yah how cold the water be for in he go the grumble honest dog step across to the black lump and lift it up hastily enough -- for it be elsley vavasor drown no but wet through and senseless from mingled cold and laudanum whether he have mean to drown himself and lighting on the shallow have stumble on till he fall exhaust : or whether he have merely blunder into the stream careless whither he go tom know not and never know for elsley himself could not recollect tom take he in he arm carry he ashore and up through the water meadow borrow a blanket and a wheelbarrow at the nearest cottage wrap he up and make the offend surgeon 's assistant wheel he to he lodgings he sit with he there a hour and then enter mark 's house again with he usual compose face to find mark and mary sit up in great anxiety mr armsworth do the telegraph work at this time of night i 'll make it if it be wanted but what be the matter you will indeed ` gad i 'll go myself and kick up the station-master what be the matter that if poor mr vavasor wish to see she husband alive she must be here in four-and-twenty hour i 'll tell you all presently -- mary my coat and comforter cry mark jump up and mary a pen and ink to write the message say tom oh can not i be of any use say mary no you angel you must not call I a angel mr thurnall after all what can i do which you have not do already tom start grace have once use to he the very same word by the by what be it in the two woman which make they so like certainly neither face nor fortune something in the tone of they voice ah if grace have mary 's fortune or mary grace 's face think tom as he hurry back to elsley and mark rush down to the station elsley be conscious when he return and only too conscious all night he scream in agony of rheumatic fever by the next afternoon he be fail fast he heart be affect and tom know that he might die any hour the evening train bring two lady valencium and lucium at the risk of she life the poor faithful wife have come a gentleman 's carriage be wait for they though they have order none and as they go through the station-room a plain little well-dressed body come humbly up to they -- be either of these lady mr vavasor yes i -- i -- be he alive gasp lucia alive and better and expect you -- better -- expect I almost shriek she as valencium and mary -lrb- for it be she -rrb- help she to the carriage mary put they in and turn away be you not come too ask valencium who be puzzle no thank you madam i be go to take a walk john you know where to drive these lady little mary do not think it necessary to say that she with she father 's carriage have be down to two other afternoon train upon the chance of find they but why be not frank headley with they when he be need most and why be valencium 's eye more red with weep than even she sister 's sorrow need have make they because frank headley be roll away in a french railway on he road to marseille and to what heaven shall find for he to do yes he be go eastward ho among the many will he come westward ho again among the few they be at the door of elsley 's lodgings now tom thurnall meet they there and bow they upstairs silently lucium be so weak that she have to cling to the banister a moment and then with a strong shudder the spirit conquer the flesh and she hurry up before they both it be a small low room -- valencium have expect that : but she have expect too confusion and wretchedness : for a note from major campbell ere he start have tell she of the condition in which elsley have be find instead she find neatness -- even gaiety fresh damask linen comfortable furniture a vase of hothouse flower while the air be full of cool perfume no one be likely to tell she that mary have furnish all at tom 's hint -- we must smarten up the place for the poor wife 's sake it will take something off the shock and i want to avoid shock for she so tom have work with he own hand that morning arrange the room as carefully as any woman with that true doctor 's forethought and consideration which often issue in the loftiest because the most unconscious benevolence he pause at the door -- will you go in whisper he to valencium in a tone which mean -- you have better not not yet -- i daresay he be too weak lucium dart in and tom shut the door behind she and wait at the stair-head better think he to let the two poor creature settle they own concern it must end soon in any case lucium rush to the bed-side draw back the curtain -- tom moan elsley not tom -- lucium lucium -- lucia st just answer he in a low abstracted voice as if try to recollect lucium vavasor -- you lucium elsley slowly raise himself upon he elbow and look into she face with a sad inquire gaze elsley -- darling elsley -- do not you know I yes very well indeed better than you know I i be not vavasor at all my name be brigg -- john brigg the apothecary 's son come home to whitbury to die she do not hear or do not care for those last word elsley i be you wife -- you own wife -- who never love any one but you -- never never never yes my wife at least -- curse they that they can not deny say he in the same abstracted voice oh god be he mad thought she elsley speak to I -- i be you lucium -- you love -- and she tear off she bonnet and throw herself beside he on the bed and clasp he in she arm murmur -- you wife who never love any one but you slowly he frozen heart and frozen brain melt beneath the warmth of she great love : but he do not speak : only he pass he weak arm round she neck and she feel that he cheek be wet with tear while she murmur on like a coo dive the same sweet word again -- call I you love once more and i shall know that all be past then call I no more elsley love whisper he call I john brigg and let we have do with sham for ever no you be my elsley -- my vavasor and i be you wife once more and the poor thing fondle he head as it lay upon the pillow my own elsley to whom i give myself body and soul for whom i would die now -- oh such a death -- any death how could i doubt you -- fool that i be no it be all my fault it be all my odious temper but we will be happy now will we not elsley smile sadly and begin babble -- yes they would take a farm and he would plough and sow and be of some use before he die but promise I one thing cry he with sudden strength what that you will go home and burn all the poetry -- all the manuscript and never let the child write a verse -- a verse -- when i be dead and he head sink back and he jaw drop he be dead cry the poor impulsive creature with a shriek which bring in tom and valencium he be not dead madam : but you must be very gentle with he if we be to -- tom see that there be little hope i will do anything -- only save he -- save he mr thurnall till i have atone for all you have little enough to atone for madam say tom as he busy himself about the sufferer he see that all would soon be over and would have have mr vavasor withdraw : but she be so really good a nurse as long as she could control herself that he could hardly spare she so they sit together by the sick-bed side as the short hour pass into the long and the long hour into the short again and the October dawn begin to shine through the shutterless window a weary eventless night it be a night as of many year as worse and worse grow the weak frame and tom look alternately at the heave chest and shorten breath and rattle throat and then at the pale still face of the lady better she should sit by -lrb- think he -rrb- and watch he till she be tire out it will come on she the more gently after all he will die at sunrise as so many die at last be begin gently feel for elsley 's pulse she eye catch he movement and she half spring up but at a gesture from he she sink quietly on she knee hold she husband 's hand in she own elsley turn toward she once ere the film of death have fall and look she full in the face with he beautiful eye full of love then the eye pale and fade but still they seek for she painfully long after she have bury she head in the coverlet unable to bear the sight and so vanish away elsley vavasor poet and genius into he own place let we pray say a deep voice from behind the curtain : it be mark armsworth 's he have come over with the first dawn to bring the lady food have slip upstairs to ask what news find the door open and enter in time to see the last gasp lucium keep she head still bury : and tom for the first time for many a year kneel as the old banker commend to god the soul of we dear brother just depart this life then mark glide quietly downstairs and valencium rise try to lead mr vavasor away but then break out in all its wild passion the irish temperament let we pass it over why try to earn a little credit by depict the agony and the weakness of a sister at last thurnall get she downstairs mark be there still have send off for he carriage he quietly put she arm through he lead she off wear out and unresisting drive she home deliver she and valencium into mary 's keep and then ask tom to stay and sit with he i hope i have no very bad conscience boy but mary 's busy with the poor young thing mere child she be too to go through such a night and somehow i do not like to be leave alone after such a sight as that \* \* \* \* \* tom say mark as they sit smoking in silence after breakfast in the study tom yes sir that be a awful death-bed tom tom be silent i do not mean that he die hard as we say but so young tom and i suppose poet ' soul be worth something like other people 's -- perhaps more i can not understand 'em but my mary seem to and people like she who think a poet the finest thing in the world i laugh at it all when i be jolly and call it sentiment and cant : but i believe that they be nearer heaven than i be : though i think they do not quite know where heaven be nor where -lrb- with a wicked wink in spite of the sadness of he tone -rrb- -- where they themselves be either i 'll tell you sir i have see man enough die -- we doctor be harden to it : but i have see unprofessional death -- man we do not kill ourselves i have see man drown shot hang run over and worse death than that sir too -- and somehow i never feel any death like that man 's grant he begin by try to set the world right when he have not yet set himself right but be not it some credit to see that the world be wrong i do not know that the world 's a very good world to you and I but there be man who have higher notion than i of what this world ought to be and for aught i know they be right that aberalva curate headley have and so have brigg in he own way i think he once only a poor discontented devil who quarrel with he bread and butter because he have not tooth to eat it with : but there be more in the fellow coxcomb as he be ` tis not often that i let that croak old bogy madam might have be trouble I but i can not help think that if fifteen year ago i have listen to he vapouring more and bully he about they less he might have be here still you would not have be then well for you that you do not catch he fever and write verse too do not make I laugh sir on such a day as this i always comfort myself with -- ` it be no business of mine : ' but somehow i can not do so just now and tom sit silent more softened than he have be for year let 's talk of something else say mark at last you have the cholera very bad down there i hear oh sharp but short say tom who dislike any subject which bring grace to he mind any on my lord 's estate with the queer name not a case we stop the devil out there thanks to he lordship so do we here we be very near in for it though i fancy -- at least i choose to fancy so -- think it a good opportunity to clean whitbury once for all it be just like you well well i offer the town-council to drain the whole town at my own expense if they would let I have the sewage and that only make thing worse for as soon as the beggar find out the sewage be worth anything they be down on I as if i want to do they -- i mark armsworth -- and would sooner let half the town rot with a epidemic than have reason to fancy i would make any money out of they so a pretty fight i have for half-a-dozen meeting till i call in my lord and sir he come down by the next express like a trump all the way from town and give they such a piece of he mind -- be go to have the board of health down and turn on the government tap commissioner and all and cost 'em hundred : till the fellow shake in they shoe -- and so i conquer and here we be as clean as a nut -- and a fig for the cholera -- except down in water-lane which i do not know what to do with for if tradesman will run up house on spec in a water-meadow who can stop they there ought to be a law for it say i but i say a good many thing in the twelve month that nobody mind but my dear boy if one man in a town have pluck and money he may do it it 'll cost he a few : i have have to pay the main part myself after all : but i suppose god will make it up to a man somehow that be old mark 's faith at least now i want to talk to you about yourself my lord come into town to-day and you must see he why then he can not help I with the bashi-bazouk can he bashi-fiddle i say tom the more i think over it the more it will not do it be throw yourself away they say that turkish contingent be get on terribly ill more need of I to make they well hang it -- i mean -- have not justice do it and so on the papers be full of it well quoth tom and why should it why man alive if england spend all this money on the man she ought to do she duty by they i do not see that as pecksniff say ` if england expect every man to do he duty she be very sanguine and will be much disappointed ' they do not intend to do they duty by she any more than i do so why should she do she duty by they do not intend to do you duty i be go out because england 's money be necessary to I and england hire I because my skill be necessary to she i do not think of duty when i settle to go and why should she i 'll get all out of she i can in the way of pay and practice and she may get all she can out of I in the way of work as for be ill-used i never expect to be anything else in this life i be sure i do not care and i be sure she do not so live and let live talk plain truth and leave bunkum for right honourable who keep they place thereby give I another weed queer old philosopher you be but go you sha not go i will sir do not stop I i have my reason and they be good one enough the conversation be interrupt by the servant -- lord minchampstead be wait at mr armsworth 's office early bird he lordship and get the worm accordingly say mark as he hurry off to attend on he ideal hero you come over to the shop in half-an-hour mind but why confound you sir you talk of have you reason : i have mine mark look quite cross so tom give way and go in due time to the bank standing with he back to the fire in mark 's inner room he see the old cotton prince and a prince he look like quoth tom to himself as he wait in the bank outside and look through the glass screen how well the old man wear i wonder how many fresh thousand he have make since i see he last seven year ago and a very noble person lord minchampstead do look one to whom hat go off almost without they owner ' will tall and portly with a soldier-like air of dignity and command which be relieve by the good-nature of the countenance yet it be a good-nature which would stand no trifle the jaw be deep and broad though finely shape the mouth firm set the nose slightly aquiline the brow of great depth and height though narrow -- altogether a julius caesar 's type of head that of a man bear to rule self and therefore to rule all he meet tom look over he dress not forget like a true englishman to mark what sort of boot he wear they be boot not quite fashionable but carefully clean on tree trousers strap tightly over they which have adopt the military stripe but retain the slit at the ankle which be in vogue forty year ago frock coat with a velvet collar button up but not too far high and tight blue cravat below a immense shirt collar a certain care and richness of dress throughout but soberly behind the fashion : while the hat be a very shabby and broken one and the whip still more shabby and broken all which indicate to tom that he lordship let he tailor and he valet dress he and though not unaware that it behove he to set out he person as it deserve be far too fine a gentleman to trouble himself about look fine mark look round see tom and call he in mr thurnall i be glad to meet you sir you do I good service at pentremochyn and do it cheaply i be agreeably surprised i confess at receive a bill for four pound seven shilling and sixpence where i expect one of twenty or thirty i charge accord to what my time be really worth there my lord i heartily wish it have be worth more no doubt say my lord in the blandest but the driest tone some man would have under a sense of tom 's merit send he a cheque off-hand for five-and-twenty pound : but that be not lord minchampstead 's way of do business he have pay simply the sum ask : but he have set tom down in he memory as a man whom he could trust to do good work and to do it cheaply and now -- you be go to join the turkish contingent i be you know that part of the world well i believe intimately and the language speak there by no means all russian and tartar well turkish tolerably with a smattering of two or three circassian dialect humph a fair list any persian only a few word humph if you can learn one language i presume you can learn another now mr thurnall i have no doubt that you will do you duty in the turkish contingent tom bow but i must ask you if you resolution to join it be fix i only join it because i can get no other employment at the seat of war humph you wish to go then in any case to the seat of war certainly no doubt you have sufficient reason armsworth this put the question in a new light tom look round at mark and behold he face bear a ludicrous mixture of anger and disappointment and perplexity he seem to be try to make signal to tom and to be afraid of do so openly before the great man he be as wilful and as foolish as a girl my lord and i have tell he so everybody know he own business best armsworth mr thurnall have you any fancy for the post of queen 's messenger i should esteem myself only too happy as one they be not to be obtain now as easily as they be fifty year ago and be give as you may know to a far higher class of man than they be formerly but i shall do my best to obtain you one when a opportunity offer tom be begin he profusest thanks : for be not he fortune make but lord minchampstead stop he with a uplifted finger and meanwhile there be foreign employment of which neither those who bestow they nor those who accept they be expect to talk much : but for which you if i be rightly inform would be especially fit tom bow and he face speak a hundred assent very well if you will come over to minchampstead to-morrow i will give you letter to friend of mine in town i trust that they may give you a better opportunity than the bashi-bazouk will of display that courage address and self-command which i understand you possess in so uncommon a degree good morning and forth the great man go most opposite be the action of the two whom he have leave behind he tom dance about the room hurrahing in a whisper -- my fortune 's make the secret service oh what bliss the thing i have always long for mark dash himself desperately back in he chair and shoot he angry leg straight out almost trip up tom you abominable ass you have do it with a vengeance why he have be pump I about you this month one word from you to say you would have stay and he be go to make you agent for all he cornish property do not he wish he may get it catch a fish climb tree catch I stay at home when i can serve my queen and my country and find a sphere for the full development of my talent oh will not i be as wise as a serpent will not i be compliment by -- himself as he best lurcher worth any ten needy pole greedy armenian traitor renegade rag-tag and bob-tail i 'll shave my head to-morrow and buy I a assortment of wig of every hue take care tom thurnall after pride come a fall and he who dig a pit may fall into it himself have this morning 's death-bed give you no lesson that it be as well not to cast ourselves down from where god have put we for whatsoever seemingly fine end of ours lest do so we tempt god once too often you father quote that text to john brigg here many year ago might he not quote it now to you true not one word of murmur not even of regret or fear have pass he good old lip about you self-willed plan he have such utter confidence in you such utter carelessness about himself such utter faith in god that he can let you go without a sigh but will you make he courage a excuse for you own rashness again beware after pride may come a fall \* \* \* \* \* on the fourth day elsley be bury mark and tom be the only mourner lucy and valencium stay at mark 's house to return next day under tom 's care to eaton square the two mourner walk back sadly from the churchyard i shall put a stone over he tom he ought to rest quietly now for he have little rest enough in this life now i want to talk to you about something when i have take off my hatband that be for it would be hardly lucky to mention such matter with a hatband on tom look up wonder tell I about he wife meanwhile what make he marry she be she a pretty woman pretty enough i believe before she marry : but i hardly think he marry she for she face of course not say the old man with emphasis of course not whatever fault he have he would be too sensible for that do not you marry for a face tom i do not tom open he eye at this last assertion but humbly express he intention of not fall into that snare ah you do not believe I : well she be a beautiful woman -- i would like to see she fellow now in the county -- and i will not deny i be proud of she but she have ten thousand pound tom and as for she look why if you 'll believe I after we would be marry three month i do not know whether she have any look or not what be you smile at you young rogue report do say that one look of mr armsworth 's to the last would do more to manage mr armsworth than the opinion of the whole bench of bishop report 's a liar and you be a puppy you do not know yet whether it be a pleasant look or a cross one lad but still -- well she be a angel and keep old mark straighter than he be ever be since : not that he be so very bad now though i sometimes think mary 's better even than she mother that girl 's a good girl tom report agree with you in that at least fool if it do not and as for look -- i can speak to you as to my own son -- why handsome be that handsome do and that handsome have for you must honestly put that into the account you think so so do i well then tom -- and here mark be seize with a tendency to st vitus 's dance and begin overhaul every button on he coat twitch up he black glove till -lrb- as undertaker ' glove be generally mean to do -rrb- they burst in half-a-dozen place take off he hat wipe he head fiercely and put the hat on again behind before till at last he snatch he arm from tom 's and grip he by the shoulder recommence -- you think so eh well i must say it so i would better have it out now hatband or none what do you think of the man who marry my daughter face and all i should think quoth tom wonder who the happy man could be that he would be so lucky in possess such a heart that he would be a fool to care about the face then be as good as you word and take she yourself i have watch you this last week and you 'll make she a good husband there i have speak let I hear no more about it and mark half push tom from he and puff on by he side highly excite if mark have knock the young doctor down he would have be far less astonished and far less puzzle too well think he i fancy nothing could throw my steady old engine off the rail but i be off they now with a vengeance what to say he know not at last -- it be just like you generosity sir you have be a brother to my father and now -- and now i 'll be a father to you old mark do nothing by half but sir however lucky i should be in possess miss armsworth 's heart what reason have i to suppose that i do so i never speak a word to she i need not say that she never do to I -- which -- of course she do not and of course you do not should like to have see you make love to my daughter indeed no sir it be my will and pleasure i have settle it and do it shall be i shall go home and tell mary and she 'll obey I -- i should like to see she do anything else hoity toity father must be master sir even in these fly-away new time when young one choose they own husband and they own politics and they own hound and they own religion too and be hang to they what do this unaccustomed bit of bluster mean for unaccustomed it be and tom know well that mary armsworth have she own way and manage she father as completely as he manage whitbury humph it be impossible and yet it must be this explain he be so anxious that lord minchampstead should approve of I i have find favor in the poor dear thing 's eye i suppose : and the good old fellow know it and will not betray she and so shams tyrant just like he but -- that mary armsworth should care for he vain fellow that he be to fancy it and yet when he begin to put thing together little silence little look little nothing which all together might make something he would not slander she to himself by suppose that she attention to he father be pay for he sake : but he could not forget that it be she always who read he letter aloud to the old man : or that she have take home and copy out the story of he shipwreck beside it be the only method of explain mark 's conduct save on the supposition that he have suddenly be change by the fairy in he old age instead of in the cradle as usual it be a terrible temptation and to no man more than to thoma thurnall he be no boy to hanker after mere animal beauty he have no delicate vision or lofty aspiration and he know -lrb- no man better -rrb- the plain english of fifty thousand pound and mark armsworth 's daughter -- a good house a good consulting practice -lrb- for he would take he md of course -rrb- a good station in the county a good clarence with a good pair of horse good plate a good dinner with good company thereat and over and above all he father to live with he and with mary whom he love as a daughter in luxury and peace to he life 's end -- why it be all that he have ever dream of three time more than he ever hope to gain -- not to mention -lrb- for how oddly little dream of selfish pleasure slip in at such moment -rrb- -- that he would buy such a ross 's microscope and keep such a horse for a sly by-day with the whitford prior oh to see once again a fox break from coldharbor gorse and then rise up before he imagination those droop steadfast eye and grace harvey the suspect the despise seem to look through and through he inmost soul as through a home which belong of right to she and where no other woman must dwell or could dwell for she be there and he know it and know that even if he never marry till he die day he should sell he soul by marry any one but she and why should i not sell my soul ask he almost fiercely i sell my talent my time my strength i would sell my life to-morrow and go to be shoot for a shill a day if it would make the old man comfortable for life and why not my soul too do not that belong to I as much as any other part of I why be i to be condemn to sacrifice my prospects in life to a girl of whose honesty i be not even sure what be this intolerable fascination witch i almost believe in mesmerism now -- again i say why should i not sell my soul as i would sell my coat if the bargain 's but a good one and if he do who would ever know -- not even grace herself the secret be he and no one else 's or if they do know what matter dozen of man sell they soul every year and thrive thereon tradesman lawyer squire popular preacher great noblemen king and prince he would be in good company at all event : and while so many live in glass house who dare throw stone but then curiously enough there come over he a vague dread of possible evil such as he have never feel before he have be try for year to raise himself above the power of fortune and he have succeed ill enough : but he have never lose heart rob shipwreck lose in desert cheat at card shoot in revolution beg he bread he have always be the same unconquerable light-hearted tom whose motto be fall light and do not whimper : better luck next round but now what if he play he last court-card and fortune out of she close-hidden hand lay down a trump thereon with quiet sneering smile and she would he know somehow that he should not thrive he child would die of the measles he horse break they knee he plate be steal he house catch fire and mark armsworth die insolvent what a fool he be to fancy such nonsense here he have be slave all he life to keep he father : and now he could keep he why he would be justified right a good son in do the thing how hard how unjust of those upper power in which he believe so vaguely to forbid he do it and how do he know that they forbid he that be too deep a question to be analyze here : but this thing be noteworthy that there come next over tom 's mind a stranger feeling still -- a fancy that if he do this thing and sell he soul he could not answer for himself thenceforth on the score of merest respectability could not answer for himself not to drink gamble squander he money neglect he father prove unfaithful to he wife that the innate capacity for blackguardism which be as strong in he as in any man might and probably would run utterly riot thenceforth he feel as if he should cast away he last anchor and drift helplessly down into utter shame and ruin it may have be very fanciful : but so he feel and feel it so strongly too that in less time than i have take to write this he have turn to mark armsworth : -- sir you be what i have always find you do you wish I to be what you have always find I i would be sorry to see you anything else boy then sir i can not do this in honor i can not be you married already thunder mark not quite as bad as that and in spite of he agitation

you may be angry with I but you 'll understand I anything but be a rogue to you and to mary and to my own self too fool i 'll be but rogue i will not mark stride on in silence frightfully red in the face for full five minute then he turn sharply on tom and catch he by the shoulder thrust he from he there -- go and do not let I see or hear of you that be till i tell you go along i say hum-hum -lrb- in a tone half of wrath and half of triumph -rrb- he father 's child if you will ruin yourself i can not help it nor i sir say tom in a really piteous tone bemoan the day he ever see aberalva as he watch mark stride into he own gate if i have but have common luck if i have but bring my # 1500 safe home here and never see grace and marry this girl out of hand common luck be all i ask and i never get it and tom go home sulkier than a bear : but he do not let he father find out he trouble it be he last evening with the old man to-morrow he must go to london and then -- to scramble and twist about the world again till he die well why not a man must die somehow : but it be hard on the poor old father say tom as tom be pack he scanty carpet-bag next morning there be a knock at the door he look out and see armsworth 's clerk what could that mean have the old man determine to avenge the slight and to do so on he father by claim some old debt there might be many between he and the doctor and tom 's heart beat fast as jane put a letter into he hand no answer sir the clerk say tom open it and turn over the contents more than once ere he could believe he own eye it be neither more nor less than a cheque on mark 's london banker for just five hundred pound a half-sheet be wrap round it on which be write these word : -- to thoma thurnall esq for behave like a gentleman the cheque will be duly honor at messr smith brown and jone lombard street no acknowledgment be to be send do not tell you father mark armsworth queer old world it be say tom when the first burst of childish delight be over and jolly old flirt dame fortune after all if i have write this in a book now who would have believe it father say he as he kiss the old man farewell i have a little money come in i 'll send you fifty from london in a day or two and lodge a hundred and fifty more with smith and co so you 'll be quite in clover while i be poisoning the turkey or at some better work the old man thank god for he good son and only hope that he be not straiten himself to buy luxury for a useless old fellow another sacred kiss on that white head and tom be away for london with a fuller purse and a more self-contented heart too than he have know for many a year and elsley be leave behind under the gray church spire sleep with he father and vex he soul with poetry no more mark have cover he now with a fair portland slab he take claude mellot to it this winter before church time and stand over it long with a puzzle look as if dimly discover that there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of in he philosophy wonderful fellow he be after all mary shall read we out some of he verse to-night but i say why should people be bear clever only to make they all the more miserable perhaps they learn the more papa by they sorrow say quiet little mary and so they be the gainer after all and none of they have any better answer to give they all three go into the church to see if one could be find there and so tom thurnall too go eastward-ho to take like all the rest what god might send chapter xxvi too late and how be poor grace harvey prosper the while while comfortable folk be praise she at they leisure as a heroine grace harvey be learn so she opine by fearful lesson how much of the unheroic element be still leave in she the first lesson have come just a week after the yacht sail for port madoc when the cholera have all but subside and it come in this wise before breakfast one morning she have to go up to heale 's shop for some cordial she mother have pass so she say a sleepless night and come downstairs nervous and without appetite oppress with melancholy both in the spiritual and the physical sense of the word it be not often so with she now she have escape the cholera the remoteness of she house she care never to enter the town the purity of the water which trickle always fresh from the cliff close by and last but not least the scrupulous cleanliness which -lrb- to do she justice -rrb- she have always observe and in which she have train up grace -- all these have keep she safe but grace could see that she dread of the cholera be intense she even try at first to prevent grace from enter a infected house but that proposal be answer by a look of horror which shame she into silence and she contented herself with all but taboo grace make she change she clothes whenever she come in refuse to sit with she almost to eat with she but over and above all this she have grow moody peevish subject to violent burst of cry fit of superstitious depression spend sometimes whole day in read experimental book argue with the preacher gad to and fro to every sermon arminian or calvinist and at last even to church -- walk in dry place poor soul seek rest and finding none all this betoken some malady of the mind rather than of the body but what that malady be grace dare not even try to guess perhaps it be one of the fit of religious melancholy so common in the west country -- like she own in fact : perhaps it be all nerve she mother be grow old and have a great deal of business to worry she and so grace thrust away the horrible suspicion by little self-deception she go into the shop tom be busy upon he knee behind the counter she make she request ah miss harvey and he spring up it will be a pleasure to serve you once more in one 's life i be just go go where to turkey i find this place too pleasant and too poor not work enough and certainly not pay enough so i have get a appointment as surgeon in the turkish contingent and shall be off in a hour to turkey to the war yes it be a long time since i have see any fight i be quite out of practice in gunshot wound there be the medicine good-bye you will shake hand once for the sake of we late cholera work together grace hold out she hand mechanically across the counter and he take it but she do not look into he face only she say half to herself -- well better so i have no doubt you will be very useful among they confound the icicle thought tom i really believe that she want to get rid of I and he would have withdraw he hand in a pet : but she hold it still quaint it be those two strong nature each love the other better than anything else on earth and yet part by the thinnest pane of ice which a single look would have melt she longing to follow that man over the wide world slave for he die for he he longing for the least excuse for make a fool of himself and cry take I as i take you without a penny for better for worse if they eye have but meet but they do not meet and the pane of ice keep they asunder as surely as a wall of iron be it that tom be pique at she seeming coldness : or do he expect before he make any advance that she should show that she wish at least for he respect by say something to clear up the ugly question which lay between they or be he as i suspect so ready to melt and make a fool of himself that he must need harden he own heart by help of the devil himself and yet there be excuse for he it would have be a sore trial to any man 's temper to quit aberalva in the belief that he leave fifteen hundred pound behind he be that as it may he say carelessly after a moment 's pause -- well farewell and by the bye about that little money matter the month of which you speak once be up yesterday i suppose i be not worthy yet so i shall be humble and wait patiently do not hurry yourself i beg of you on my account she snatch she hand from he without a word and rush out of the shop he return to he packing whistle away as shrill as any blackbird little do he think that grace 's heart be burst as she hurry down the street cover she face in she veil as if every one would espy she dark secret in she countenance but she do not go home to hysteric and vain tear a awful purpose have arise in she mind under the pressure of that great agony heaven how she love that man to be suspect by he be torture but she could bear that it be she cross she could carry it lie down on it and endure : but wrong he she could not -- would not it be sinful enough while he be there but doubly unbearably sinful when he be go to a foreign country when he would need every farthing he have so not for she own sake but for he she speak to she mother when she go home and find she sit over she bible in the little parlor vainly try to find a text which suit she distemper mother you have the bible before you there yes child why what ask she look up uneasily grace fix she eye on the ground she could not look she mother in the face do you ever read the thirty-second psalm mother which why not child let we read it together then now and grace take up she own bible sit quietly down and read as none in that parish save she could read : bless be he whose transgression be forgive and whose sin be cover bless be the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there be no guile when i keep silence my bone wax old through my groan all the day long for day and night thy hand be heavy upon I my moisture be turn to the drought of summer i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hide i say i will confess my transgression unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin grace stop choke with tear which the pathos of she own voice have call up she look at she mother there be no tear in she eye : only a dull thwart look of terror and suspicion the shaft however bravely and cunningly speed have miss its mark poor grace she usual eloquence utterly fail she as most thing do in which one be wont to trust before the pressure of a real and horrible evil she have no heart to make fine sentence to preach a brilliant sermon of commonplace what could she say that she mother have not know long before she be bear and throw herself on she knee at she mother 's foot she grasp both she hand and look into she face imploringly -- mother mother mother be all that she could say : but they tone mean more than all word -- reproof counsel comfort utter tenderness and under-current of clear deep trust bubble up from beneath all pass suspicion however dark and foul be in it : but they be vain baser terror the parent of baser suspicion have harden that woman 's heart for the while and all she answer be -- get up what be this foolery i will not i will not rise till you have tell I what whether -- and she force the word slowly out in a low whisper whether you know -- anything of -- of -- mr thurnall 's money -- he belt be the girl mad belt money do you take I for a thief wench no no no only say you -- you know nothing of it psha girl go to you school : and the old woman try to rise only say that only let I know that it be a dream -- a hideous dream which the devil put into my wicked wicked heart -- and let I know that i be the basest meanest of daughter for harbour such a think a moment it will be comfort bliss to what i endure only say that and i will crawl to you foot and beg for you forgiveness -- ask you to beat I like a child as i shall deserve drive I out if you will and let I die as i shall deserve only say the word and take this fire from before my eye which burn day and night -- till my brain be dry up with misery and shame mother mother speak but then burst out the horrible suspicion which falsehood suspect all other of be false as itself have engender in that mother 's heart yes viper i see you plan do you think i do not know that you be in love with that fellow grace start as if she have be shoot and cover she face with she hand yes and want I to betray myself -- to tell a lie about myself that you may curry favor with he -- a penniless unbelieving -- mother almost shriek grace i can bear no more say that it be a lie and then kill I if you will it be a lie from begin to end what else should it be and the woman in the hurry of she passion confirm the equivocation with a oath and then run on as if to turn she own thought as well as grace 's into commonplace about a poor old mother who care for nothing but you who have work she finger to the bone for year to leave you a little money when she be go i wish i be go i wish i be out of this wretched ungrateful world i do to have my own child turn against I in my old age grace lift she hand from she face and look steadfastly at she mother and behold she know not how or why she feel that she mother have forswear herself a strong shudder pass through she she rise and be leave the room in silence where be you go hussy stop scream she mother between she tooth she rage and cruelty rise as it will with weak nature in the very act of triumph -- to you young man to pray say grace quietly and lock herself into the empty schoolroom give vent to all she feeling but not in tear how she upbraid herself -- she have not use she strength she have not tell she mother all she heart and yet how could she tell she heart how face she mother with such vague suspicion hardly support by a single fact how argue it out against she like a lawyer and convict she to she face what daughter could do that who have human love and reverence leave in she no to touch she inward witness as the quaker well and truly term it be the only method : and it have fail god help I be she only cry : but the help do not come yet there come over she instead a feeling of utter loneliness willi dead thurnall go she mother estrange and like a child lose upon a great moor she look round all heaven and earth and there be none to counsel none to guide -- perhaps not even god for would he help she as long as she live in sin and be she not live in sin deadly sin as long as she know what she be sure she know and leave the wrong unrighted it be sometimes true the popular say that sunshine come after storm sometimes true or who could live but not always : not even often equally true be the popular antithet that misfortune never come single that in most human life there be period of trouble blow follow blow wave follow wave from opposite and unexpected quarter with no natural or logical sequence till all god 's billow have go over the soul how paltry and helpless in such dark time be all theory of mere self-education all proud attempt like that of göthe 's wilhelm meister to hang self-poised in the center of the abyss and there organise for oneself a character by means of circumstance easy enough and graceful enough do that dream look while all the circumstance themselves -- all which stand around -- be easy and graceful obliging and commonplace like the sphere of petty experience with which göthe surround he insipid hero easy enough it seem for a man to educate himself without god as long as he lie comfortably on a sofa with a cup of coffee and a review : but what if that daemonic element of the universe which göthe confess and yet in he luxuriousness try to ignore because he could not explain -- what if that break forth over the graceful and prosperous student as it may any moment what if some thing or some person or many thing or many person one after the other -lrb- question which he must get answer then or die -rrb- take he up and dash he down again and again and again till he be ready to cry i reckon till morning that like a lion he will break all my bone from morning till evening he will make a end of I what if he thus find himself hurl perforce amid the real universal experience of humanity and make free in spite of himself by doubt and fear and horror of great darkness of the brotherhood of woe common alike to the simplest peasant-woman and to every great soul perhaps who have leave he impress and sign manual upon the heart of after generation jew heathen or christian man of the most opposite creed and aim whether it be mose or socrate isaiah or epictetus augustine or mohammed dante or bernard shakspeare or bacon or göthe 's self no doubt though in he tremendous pride he would not confess it even to himself -- each and all of they have this one fact in common -- that once in they life at least they have go down into the bottomless pit and stato all ' inferno -- as the child use truly to say of dante and there out of the utter darkness have ask the question of all question -- be there a god and if there be what be he do with I what refuge then in self-education when a man feel himself powerless in the gripe of some unseen and inevitable power and know not whether it be chance or necessity or a devour fiend to wrap himself sternly in himself and cry i will endure though all the universe be against I -- how fine it sound -- but who have do it could a man do it perfectly but for one moment -- could he absolutely and utterly for one moment isolate himself and accept he own isolation as a fact he be then and there a madman or a suicide as it be he nature happily too weak for that desperate self-assertion fall back recklessly on some form more or less graceful accord to the temperament of the ancient panacea let we eat and drink for to-morrow we die why should a man educate self when he know not whither he go what will befall he to-night no there be but one escape one chink through which we may see light one rock on which we foot may find standing-place even in the abyss : and that be the belief intuitive inspire due neither to reasoning nor to study that the billow be god 's billow and that though we go down to hell he be there also -- the belief that not we but he be educate we that these seemingly fantastic and incoherent misery storm follow earthquake and earthquake fire as if the caprice of all the demon be let loose against we have in he mind a spiritual coherence a organic unity and purpose -lrb- though we see it not -rrb- that sorrow do not come singly only because he be make short work with we spirit and because the more effect he see produce by one blow the more swiftly he follow it up by another till in one great and vary crisis seemingly long to we but short enough compare with immortality we spirit may be -- heated hot with burn fear and bath in bath of hiss tear and batter with the stroke of doom to shape and use and thus perhaps it be with poor grace harvey at least happily for she she begin after a while to think that it be so only after a while though there be at first a phase of repining of doubt almost of indignation against high heaven who shall judge she what blame if the crucify one writhe when the first nail be drive what blame if the stoutest turn sick and giddy at the first home-thrust of that sword which pierce the joint and marrow and lay bare to self the secret of the heart god give poor soul time to recover they breath ere he strike again and if he be not angry why should we condemn poor grace she sorrow have be thicken fast during the last few month she be schoolmistress again true but where be she child those of they whom she love best be sweep away by the cholera and could she face the remnant each in mourning for a parent or a brother that alone be grief enough for she and yet that be the lightest of all she grief she love tom thurnall -- how much she dare not tell herself she long to save he she have think and not untruly during the past cholera week that he be soften open to new impression : but he have avoid she more than ever -- perhaps suspect she again more than ever -- and now he be go go for ever that too be grief enough alone but darkest and deepest of all darker and deeper than the past shame of be suspect by he she love be the shame of suspect she own mother -- of believe herself as she do privy to that shameful theft and yet unable to make restitution there be the horror of all horror the close prison which seem to stifle she whole soul the only chink through which a breath of air seem to come and keep she heart alive be the hope that somehow somewhere she might find that belt and restore it without she mother 's knowledge but more -- the first of September be come and go the bill for five-and-twenty pound be due and be not meet grace choke down she honest pride go off to the grocer and with tear which he could not resist persuade he to renew the bill for one month more and now that month be all but past and yet there be no money eight or ten people who owe mr harvey money have die of the cholera some of course have leave no effect and all hope of they work out they debt be go some have leave money behind they : but it be still in the lawyer 's hand some of it at sea some on mortgage some in house which must be sell till they affair be wind up -- -lrb- a sadly slow affair when a country attorney have a poor man 's unprofitable business to transact -rrb- -- nothing could come in to mr harvey to and fro she go with knit brow and heavy heart and bring home again only promise as she have do a hundred time before one day she go up to mr heale old heale owe she thirteen pound and more : but that be not the least reason for pay he cholera patient have not pay he and whether heale have the money by he or not he be not go to pay he debt till other people pay theirs mr harvey storm mr heale give she as good as she bring and mr harvey threaten to county court she husband whereon mr heale _ en revanche _ drag out the book and display to the poor widow 's horror-struck eye a account for medicine and attendance on she and grace which nearly swallow up the debt poor grace be overwhelm when she mother come home and upbraid she in she despair with be a burden be she not a burden must she not be one henceforth no she would take in needlework labor in the field heave ballast among the coarse pauper-girl on the quay-pool anything rather : but how to meet the present difficulty we must sell we furniture mother for a quarter of what it be worth never girl no the lord will provide say she between she clenched tooth with a sort of hysteric chuckle the lord will provide i believe it i believe it say poor grace but faith be weak and the day be very dark mother dark ay and may be darker yet but the lord will provide he prepare a table in the wilderness for he saint that the world do not think of oh mother and do you think there be any door of hope go to bed girl go to bed and leave I to see to that find my spectacles wherever have you lay they to now i 'll look over the book awhile do let I go over they for you no you sha 'n' t i suppose you 'll be want to make out you poor old mother 's be cheat somebody why not if i be a thief miss eh oh mother mother do not say that again and grace glide out meekly to she own chamber which be on the ground-floor adjoining the parlor and there spend more than one hour in prayer from which no present comfort seem to come yet who shall say that it be all unanswered at last she mother come upstairs and put she head in angrily : -- why be not you in bed girl sit up this way i be pray mother say grace look up as she kneel pray what be the use of pray and who 'll hear you if you pray what you want 's a husband to keep you out of the workhouse and you will not get that by kneel here get to bed i say or i 'll pull you up grace obey uncomplaining but utterly shocked though she be not unacquainted with those frightful fit of morose unbelief even of fierce blasphemy to which the excitable west-country mind be liable after have be over-strain by superstitious self-inspection and by the desperate attempt to prove itself right and safe from frame and feeling while fact and conscience proclaim it wrong the west-country people be apt to attribute these paroxysm to the possession of a devil and so do grace that night tremble with terror and loving pity she lay down and begin to pray afresh for that poor wild mother at last the fear cross she that she mother might make away with herself but a few year before another class-leader in aberalva have attempt to do so and have all but succeed the thought be intolerable she must go to she face reproach blow anything she rise from she bed and go to the door it be fasten on the outside a cold perspiration stand on she forehead she open she lip to shriek to she mother : but check herself when she hear she stir gently in the outer room she pulse throb too loudly at first for she to hear distinctly : but she feel that it be no moment for give way to emotion by a strong effort of will she conquer herself and then with that preternatural acuteness of sense which some woman possess she could hear everything she mother be do she hear she put on she shawl she bonnet she hear she open the front door gently it be now long past midnight whither could she be go at that hour she hear she go gently to the leave past the window and yet she footfall be all but inaudible no rain have fall and she shoe ought to have sound on the hard earth she must have take they off there she be stop just by the school-door now she move again she must have stop to put on she shoe for now grace could hear she step distinctly down the earth bank and over the rattle shingle of the beach where be she go grace must follow the door be fast : but in a moment she have remove the table open the shutter and the window thank god that i stay here on the ground floor instead of go back to my own room when major campbell leave it be a providence the lord have not forsake I yet say the sweet saint as catch up she shawl she wrap it round she and slip through the window crouch under the shadow of the house and look for she mother she be hurry over the rock a hundred yard off whither to drown herself in the sea no she hold on along the mid-beach right across the cove toward arthur 's nose but why grace must know she feel she know not why that this strange journey that wild the lord will provide have to do with the subject of she suspicion perhaps this be the crisis perhaps all will he clear up to-night for joy or for utter shame the tide be low the beach be bright in the western moonlight : only along the cliff foot lay a strip of shadow a quarter of a mile long till the nose like a great black wall bury the corner of the cove in darkness along that strip of shadow she run crouch now stumble over a boulder now crush she bare foot between the sharp pebble as heedless where she step she keep she eye fix on she mother as if fascinate she could see nothing else in heaven or earth but that dark figure hurry along with a dogged determination and then stop a moment to look round as if in fear of a pursuer and then grace lay down on the cold stone and press herself into the very earth and the moment she mother turn to go forward spring up and follow and then a true woman 's thought flash across she and shape itself into a prayer for herself she never think : but if the coast guardsman above should see she mother stop she question she god grant that he might be on the other side of the point and she hurry on again near the nose the rock run high and jag she mother hold on to they pass through a narrow chasm and disappear grace now not fifty yard from she dart out of the shadow into the moonlight and run breathlessly toward the spot where she have see she mother last like anderssen 's little sea-maiden she go every step on sharp knife across the rough bed of barnacle but she feel no pain in the greatness of she terror and she love she crouch between the rock a moment hear she mother slip and splash among the pool and glide after she like a ghost -- a guardian angel rather -- till she see she emerge again for a moment into the moonlight upon a strip of beach beneath the nose it be a weird and lonely spot and a dangerous spot withal for only at low spring-tide could it be reach from the land and then the flood rise far up the cliff cover all the shingle and fill the mouth of a dark cavern have she mother go to that cavern it be impossible to see so utterly be the cliff shroud in shadow shiver with cold and excitement grace crouch down and gaze into the gloom till she eye swim and a hundred fantastic figure and spark of fire seem to dance between she and the rock spark of fire -- yes but that last one be no fancy a actual flash the crackle and sputter of a match what could it mean another match be light and a moment after the glare of a lanthorn show she mother enter beneath the polished arch of rock which glare lurid overhead like the gateway of the pit of fire the light vanish into the winding of the cave and then grace hardly know what she do rush up the beach and crouch down once more at the cave 's mouth there she sit she know not how long listen listen like a hunt hare she whole faculty concentrate in the one sense of hear she eye wander vacantly over the black saw of rock and glisten oar-weed bed and bright phosphoric sea thank heaven there be not a ripple to break the silence ah what be that sound within she press she ear against the rock to hear more surely a rumble as of stone roll down and then -- be it a fancy or be she power of hearing intensify by excitement actually equal to discern the chink of coin who know but in another moment she have glide in silently swiftly hold she very breath and see she mother kneel on the ground the lanthorn by she side and in she hand the long-lost belt she do not speak she do not move she always know in she heart of heart that so it be : but when the sin take bodily shape and be there before she very eye it be too dreadful to speak of to act upon yet and amid the most torturing horror and disgust of that great sin rise up in she the divinest love for the sinner she feel -- strange paradox -- that she have never love she mother as she do at that moment oh that it have be i who have do it and not she and she mother 's sin be to she she own sin she mother 's shame she shame till all sense of she mother 's guilt vanish in the light of she divine love oh that i could take she up tenderly tell she that all be forgive and forget by man and god -- serve she as i have never serve she yet -- nurse she to sleep on my bosom and then go forth and bear she punishment even if need be on the gallows-tree and there she stand in a silent agony of tender pity drink she portion of the cup of he who bear the sin of all the world silently she stand and silently she turn to go to go home and pray for guidance in that dark labyrinth of confused duty she mother hear the rustle look up and spring to she foot with a scream drop gold piece on the ground she first impulse be wild terror she be discover by whom she know not she clasp she evil treasure to she bosom and thrust grace against the rock flee wildly out mother mother shriek grace rush after she the shawl fall from she shoulder she mother look back and see the white figure god 's angel god 's angel come to destroy I as he come to balaam and in the madness of she guilty fancy she see in grace 's hand the fiery sword which be to smite she another step look backward still and she have trip over a stone she fall and strike the back of she head against the rock lay senseless tenderly grace lift she up : go for water to a pool near by bath she face call on she by every term of endearment slowly the old woman recover she consciousness but show it only in moan she head be cut and bleed grace bind it up and then take that fatal belt bind it next to she own heart never to be move from thence till she should put it into the hand of he to whom it belong and then she lift up she mother come home darling mother and she try to make she stand and walk the old woman only moan and wave she away impatiently grace put she on she foot but she fall again the lower limb seem all but paralyse slowly that sweet saint lift she and lay she on she own back and slowly she bear she homeward with ache knee and bleeding foot while before she eye hang the picture of he who bear he cross up calvary till a solemn joy and pride in that sacred burden seem to intertwine itself with she deep misery and faint every moment with pain and weakness she still go on as if by supernatural strength : and murmur -- thou didst bear more for I and shall not i bear even this for thee surely if blest spirit can weep and smile over the woe and heroism of we mortal man face brighter than the star look down on that fair girl that night and in loving sympathy call she too blest at last it be over undiscovered she reach home lay she mother on the bed and tend she till morning but long ere morning dawn stupor have change into delirium and grace 's ear be all on fire with word -- which those who have ever hear will have no heart to write and now by one of those strange vagary in which epidemic so often indulge appear other symptom and by day-dawn cholera itself heale though recover be still too weak to be of use : but happily the medical man send down by the board of health be still in the town grace send for he but he shake he head after the first look the wretched woman 's ravings at once explain the case and make it in he eye all but hopeless the sudden shock to body and mind the sudden prostration of strength have bring out the disease which she have dread so intensely and against which she have take so many precaution and which yet lay all the while lurk unfelt in she system a hideous eight-and-forty hour follow the preacher and class-leader come to pray over the die woman : but she scream to grace to send they away she have just sense enough leave to dread that she might betray she own shame would she have the new clergyman then no she would have no one -- no one could help she let she only die in peace and

and not know all not have forgive all and go she must but it be a thousand to one against you see he we even do not know exactly where he be go grace shudder a moment and then recover she calmness i do not expect this : but be it so i shall meet he if god will and if not i can still work -- work i think mary you would better take the young woman upstairs and make she sleep here to-night say mark glad of a excuse to get rid of they which when he have do he pull he chair round in front of the fire put a foot on each hob and begin rub he eye vigorously dear I dear I what a lot of good people there be in this old world to be sure ten time better than I at least -- make one ashamed of oneself : -- and if one be not even good enough for this world how 's one to be good enough for heaven and mary carry grace upstairs and into she own bed-room a bed should be make up there for she it would do she good just to have anything so pretty sleep in the same room and then she get grace supper and try to make she talk : but she be distrait reserve for a new and sudden dread have seize she at the sight of that fine house fine plate fine friend these be he acquaintance then : no wonder that he would not look on such as she and as she cast she eye round the really luxurious chamber and -lrb- after falteringly ask mary whether she have any brother and sister -rrb- guess that she must be the heiress of all that wealth she settle in she heart that tom be to marry mary and the intimate tone in which mary speak of he to she and she innumerable inquiry about he make she more certain that it be a settled thing handsome she be not certainly but so sweet and good and that she own beauty -lrb- if she be aware that she possess any -rrb- could have any weight with tom she would have consider as a insult to he sense so she make up she mind slowly but steadily that thus it be to be and every fresh proof of mary 's sweetness and goodness be a fresh pang to she for it show the more how probable it be that tom love she therefore she answer all mary 's question carefully and honestly as to a person who have a right to ask and at last go to she bed and wear out in body and mind be asleep in a moment she have not remark the sigh which escape mary as she glance at that beautiful head and the long black tress which stream down for a moment over the white shoulder ere they be knot back for the night and then at she own poor countenance in the glass opposite \* \* \* \* \* it be long past midnight when grace wake she know not how and look up see a light in the room and mary sit still over a book she head rest on she hand she lay quiet and think she hear a sob she be sure she hear tear drop on the paper she stir and mary be at she side in a moment do you want anything only to -- to remind you ma'am it be not wise to sit up so late only that say mary laughing i do that every night alone with god and i do not think he will be the farther off for you be here one thing i have to ask say grace it would lesson my labor so if you could give I any hint of where he might be we know as we tell you as little as you he letter be to be send to constantinople some from aberalva be go thither already and mine among they think grace it be god 's will madam if it would not seem forward on my part -- if you could tell he the truth and what i have for he and where i be in case he might wish -- wish to see I -- when you be write of course i will or my father will say mary who do not like to confess either to herself or to grace that it be very improbable that she would ever write again to tom thurnall and so the two sweet maiden so near that moment to a explanation which might have clear up all go on each in she ignorance for so it be to be the next morning grace come down to breakfast modest cheerful charming mark make she breakfast with they give she endless letter of recommendation want to take she to see old doctor thurnall which she decline and then send she to the station in he own carriage pay she fare first-class to town and somehow or other contrived with mary 's help that she should find in she bag two ten-pound note which she have never see before after which he go out to he counting-house only remark to mary -- very extraordinary young woman and very handsome too will make some man a jewel of a wife if she do not go mad or die of the hospital fever to which mary fully assent little she guess and little do she father that it be for grace 's sake that tom have refuse she hand a few day more and grace harvey also have go eastward ho chapter xxvii a recent explosion in a ancient crater it be perhaps a pity for the human race in general that some enterprising company can not buy up the moselle -lrb- not the wine but the river -rrb- cut it into five-mile length and distribute they over europe wherever there be a demand for lovely scenery for lovely be its proper epithet it be not grand not exciting -- so much the better it be scenery to live and die in scenery to settle in and study a single landscape till you know every rock and walnut-tree and vine-leaf by heart : not merely to run through in one hasty steam-trip as you now do in a long burning day which make you not drunk -- but weary -- with excess of beauty besides there be two or three point so superior to the rest that have see they one care to see nothing more that paradise of emerald purple and azure which open behind trei and that strange heap of old-world house at berncastle which have scramble up to the top of a rock to stare at the steamer and have never be able to get down again -- between they and after they one feel like a child who after a great mouthful of pine-apple jam be condemn to have pour down its throat a everlasting stream of treacle so think stangrave on board the steamer as he smoke he way up the shallows and wonder which turn of the river would bring he to he destination when would it all be over and he never leap on shore more joyfully than he do at alf that afternoon to jump into a carriage and trundle up the gorge of the issbach some six lonely weary mile till he turn at last into the wooded caldron of the romer-kessel and see the little chapel crowning the central knoll with the white high-roofed house of bertrich nestle at its foot he drive up to the handsome old kurhaus nestle close beneath heather-clad rock upon its lawn shaded with huge horse-chestnut and set round with dahlia and geranium and delicate tinted german stock which fill the air with fragrance a place make only for young lover : -- certainly not for those black petticoated worthy each with that sham of a sham the modern tonsure pare down to a poor florin 's breadth among they bushy well-oiled curl who sit at little table pass the lazy day à muguetter les bourgeoises of sarrebruck and treve and sip the fragrant josephshofer -- perhaps at the good bourgeois ' expense past they stangrave slip angrily for that development of humanity can find no favor in he eye be not human at all but professedly superhuman and therefore practically sometimes inhuman he hurry into the public room seize on the visitor 's book the name be there in they own handwriting : but where be they waiter be seize and question the english lady come back last night and be go this afternoon where be they go nobody recollect : not even the man from whom they hire the carriage but they be not go far they servant and they luggage be still here perhaps the herr ober-badmeister lieutenant d -- will know oh it will not trouble he a english gentleman der herr lieutenant will be only too happy and in ten minute der herr lieutenant appear really only too happy and stangrave find himself at once in the company of a soldier and a gentleman have they acquaintance be a longer one he would have recognize likewise the man of taste and of piety i can well appreciate sir say he in return to stangrave 's anxious inquiry you impatience to rejoin you lovely countrywoman who have be for the last three week the wonder and admiration of we little paradise and whose four day ' absence be regard believe I as a public calamity i can well believe it but they be not countrywoman of mine the one lady be a englishwoman the other -- i believe -- a italian and der herr a american ah a still greater pleasure sir i trust that you will carry back across the atlantic a good report of a spot all but unknown i fear to you compatriot you will meet one i think on the return of the lady a compatriot yes a gentleman who arrive here this morning and who seem from he conversation with they to belong to you noble fatherland he go out drive with they this afternoon whither i unfortunately know not ah good saint nichola -- for though i be a lutheran i must invoke he now -- look out yonder stangrave look and join in the general laugh of lieutenant waiter priest and bourgeoise for under the chestnut strut like he in struwelpeter as though he be a very king of ashantee sabina 's black boy who have take to himself a scarlet umbrella and a great cigar while after he come also like they in struwelpeter caspar bretzel in hand and ludwig with he hoop and all the naughty boy of bertrich town hooting and singing in chorus after the fashion of german child the resemblance to the well-known scene in the german child 's book be perfect and as the child shout -- ein kohlpechrabenschwarzer mohr die sonne schien ihm in gehirn da nahm er seinen sonnenschirm -- more than one grow person join therein stangrave long to catch hold of the boy and extract from he all news but the blackamoor be not quite in respectable company enough at that moment and stangrave have to wait till he strut proudly up to the door and enter the hall with a bland smile evidently have take the hooting as a homage to he personal appearance ah mas ' stangrave glad see you sir quite a party of we now ` mong dese ` barian heathen foreigner ma ' thurnall he come di mornin ' go up picken ' bush wid de lady he he not see he dis tree year afore thurnall stangrave 's heart sink within he he first impulse be to order a carriage and return whence he come but it would look so odd and moreover be so foolish that he make up he mind to stay and face the worst so he swallow a hasty dinner and then wander up the narrow valley with all he suspicion of thurnall and marie seethe more fiercely than ever in he heart some half-mile up a path lead out of the main road to a wooden bridge across the stream he follow it careless whither he go and in five minute find himself in the quaintest little woodland cavern he ever have see it be simply a great block of black lava crown with brushwood and support on wall and pillar of dutch cheese or what should have be dutch cheese by all law of shape and color have not he finger prove to they that they be stone how they get there and what they be puzzle he for he be no geologist and find a bench inside he sit down and speculate thereon there be more than one doorway to the cheese cellar it stand beneath a jut knoll and the path run right through so that as he sit he could see up a narrow gorge to he left roof in with tree and down into the main valley on he right where the issbach glitter clear and smooth beneath red-berried mountain-ash and yellow leaf there he sit and try to forget marie in the tinkling of the stream and the sighing of the autumn leave and the cooing of the sleepy dove while the ice-bird as the german call the water-ouzel sit on a rock in the river below and warble he low sweet song and then flit up the grassy reach to perch and sing again on the next rock above and whether it be that he do forget marie awhile or whether he be tire as he well might have be or whether he have too rapidly consume he bottle of red walporzheimer forgetful that it alone of german wine combine the delicacy of the rhine sun with the potency of its burgundian vinestock transplant to the ahr by charlemagne -- whether it be any of these cause or whether it be not stangrave fall fast asleep in the kaise-kellar and sleep till it be dark at the risk of catch a great cold how long he sleep he know not : but what waken he he know full well voice of people approach and voice which he recognize in a moment sabina yes and marie too laughing merrily and among they shriller tone the voice of thurnall he have not hear it for year but consider the circumstance under which he have last hear it there be no fear of he forget it again they come down the side-glen and before he could rise they have turn the sharp corner of the rock and be in the kaise-kellar close to he almost touch he he feel the awkwardness of he position to keep still be perhaps to overhear and that too much to discover himself be to produce a scene and he could not trust he temper that the scene would not be a ugly one and such as woman must not witness he be relieve to find that they do not stop they be laugh about the gloom about be out so late how jealous some one whom i know would be say sabina if he find you and tom together in this darksome den i do not care say tom i have make up my mind to shoot he out of hand and marry marie myself sha 'n' t i now my -- and they pass on and down to they carriage which have be wait for they in the road below what marie 's answer be or by what name thurnall be about to address she stangrave do not hear : but he have hear quite enough he rise quietly after a while and follow they he be a dupe a ass the dupe of those bad woman and of he ancient enemy it be maddening yet how could sabina be in fault she have not know marie till he himself have introduce she and he could not believe she capable of such baseness the crime must lie between the other two yet -- however that might be matter little to he now he would return order he carriage once more and depart shake off the dust of he foot against they pah there be other woman in the world and woman too who would not demand of he to become a hero he reach the kurhaus and go in but not into the public room for fear of meeting people whom he have no heart to face he be in the passage in the act of settle he account with the waiter when thurnall come hastily out and run against he stangrave stand by the passage lamp so that he see tom 's face at once tom draw back beg a thousand pardon and see stangrave 's face in turn the two man look at each other for a few seconds stangrave long to say you intend to shoot I then try at once but he be ashamed of course to make use of word which he have so accidentally overhear tom look carefully at stangrave to divine he temper from he countenance it be quite angry enough to give tom excuse for say to himself -- the fellow be mad at be catch at last very well i think sir say he quietly enough that you and i have better walk outside for a few minute allow I to retract the apology i just make till we have have some very explicit conversation on other matter curse he impudence think stangrave do he actually mean to bully I into marry she and he reply haughtily enough -- i be aware of no matter on which i be incline to be explicit with mr thurnall or on which mr thurnall have a right to be explicit with I i be then quoth tom he suspicion increase in turn do you wish sir to have a scene before this waiter and the whole house or will you be so kind as to walk outside with I i must decline sir not be in the habit of hold intercourse with a actress 's bully tom do not knock he down : but reply smilingly enough -- i be far too much in earnest in this matter sir to be stop by any coarse expression waiter you may go now will you fight I to-morrow morning or will you not i may fight a gentleman : but not you well i shall not call you a coward because i know that you be none and i shall not make a row here for a gentleman 's reason which you call yourself a gentleman seem to have forget but this i will do i will follow you till you do fight I if i have to throw up my own prospects in life for it i will proclaim you wherever we meet for what you be -- a mean and base intriguer i will insult you in kursaal and cane you on public place i will be frankenstein 's man to you day and night till i have avenge the wrong of this poor girl the dust of whose foot you be not worthy to kiss off stangrave be surprise at he tone it be certainly not that of a conscious villain : but he only reply sneeringly -- and pray what may give mr thurnall the right to consider himself the destine avenger of this frail beauty 's wrong i will tell you that after we have fight and somewhat more meanwhile that expression ` frail beauty ' be a fresh offence for which i should certainly cane you if she be not in the house well drawl stangrave feign a ostentatious yawn i believe the wise method of rid oneself of impertinent be to grant they request have you pistol i have none i have both dueller and revolver at you service ah i think we 'll try the revolver then say stangrave savage from despair and disbelief in all human goodness after what have pass five or six shot apiece will be hardly _ outré _ hardly i think say tom will you name you second ' i know no one i have not be here two hour but i suppose they do not matter much humph it be as well to have witness in case of accident there be a couple of royster burschen in the public room who i think would enjoy the office both have scar on they face so they will be _ au fait _ at the thing shall i have the honor of send one of they to you as you will sir my number be 34 and the two fool turn on they respective heel and walk off at sunrise next morning tom and he second be stand on the falkenhohe at the edge of the vast circular pit blast out by some explosion which have tear the slate into mere dust and shiver now cover with a thin coat of turf schöne aussicht say the bursch wave he hand round in a tone which be benevolently mean to withdraw tom 's mind from painful consideration very pretty prospect indeed you be sure you understand that revolver thoroughly the bursch mutter to himself something about english nonchalance and assure thurnall that he be competently acquaint with the weapon as indeed he ought to be for have never see one before he have be talk and think of nothing else since they leave bertrich and why do not tom care to look at the prospect certainly not because he be afraid he sleep as soundly as ever last night and know not what fear means but somehow the glorious view remind he of another glorious view which he see last summer walking by grace harvey 's side from tolchard 's farm and that subject he will sternly put away he be not sure but what it might unman even he the likeness certainly exist for the rock be the same in both place have take the same general form and the wanderer in rhine-prussium and nassau might often fancy himself in devon or cornwall true here there be no sea : and there no moselkopf raise its huge crater-cone far above the upland all golden in the level sun but that brown tannus far away or that brown hundsruck opposite with its deep-wooded gorge bar with level gleam of light across black gulf of shade might well be dartmoor or carcarrow moor itself high over aberalva town which he will see no more true in cornwall there would be no slag-cliff of the falkenley beneath he foot as black and blast at this day as when yon orchard meadow be the mouth of hell and the south-west wind dash the great flame against the cinder cliff behind and forge it into wall of time-defying glass but that might well be alva stream that issbach in its green gulf far below wind along toward the green gulf of the moselle -- he will look at it no more lest he see grace herself come to he across the down to chide he with sacred horror for the dark deed which he have come to do and yet he do not wish to kill stangrave he would like to wing he he must punish he for he conduct to marie punish he for last night 's insult it be a necessity but a disagreeable one he would be sorry to go to the war with that man 's blood upon he hand he be sorry that he be out of practice a year ago i could have count on hit he where i like i trust i shall not blunder against he vitals now however if i do he have himself to blame the thought that stangrave may kill he never cross he mind of course out of six shot fire at all distance from forty pace to fifteen one may hit he : but as for be kill tom 's heart be harden melt again and again this summer for a moment only to freeze again he all but believe that he bear a charmed life all the miraculous escape of he past year instead of make he believe in a living guide protect father have become to that proud hard heart the excuse for a deliberate though unconscious atheism he fall be surely near at last stangrave and he second appear stangrave be haggard not from fear but from misery and rage and self-condemnation this be the end of all he fine resolve pah what use in they what use in be a martyr in this world all man be liar and all woman too tom and stangrave stand a little apart from each other while one of the seconds pace the distance he step out away from they across the crater floor carry tom 's revolver in he hand till he reach the required point and turn he turn : but not to come back without a gesture or a exclamation which could explain he proceedings he face about once more and rush up the slope as hard as leg and wind permit tom be confound with astonishment : either the bursch be seize with terror at the whole business or he covet the much-admired revolver in either case he be make off with it before the owner 's eye stop hillo stop thief he be get my pistol and away go thurnall in chase after the bursch who never look behind never see that he be follow : while stangrave and the second bursch look on with wide eye now the bursch be a gymnast and a capital runner and so be tom likewise and brilliant be the race upon the falkenhohe but the victory after a while become altogether a question of wind for it be all up-hill the crater be one of explosion and not of elevation as the geologist would say do not slope downward again save on one side from its outer lip : and tom and the bursch be breast a fair hill after they have emerge from the kessel below now the bursch have have too much thronerhofberger the night before and possibly as burschen will in they vacation the night before that also whereby he diaphragm surrender at discretion while he heel be yet unconquered and he suddenly feel a strong gripe and a stronger kick which roll he over on the turf the hapless youth who fancy himself alone upon the mountain top roar mere incoherence and tom too angry to listen and too hurry to punish tear the revolver out of he grasp whereon one barrel explode -- i have do it now no : the ball have luckily bury itself in the ground tom turn to rush down hill again and meet the impatient stangrave crack -- whing -- g -- g a bullet yes and prodigy on prodigy up the hill towards he charge as he would upon a whole army a prussian gendarme with bayonet fix tom sit down upon the mountain-side and burst into inextinguishable laughter while the gendarme come charge up right toward he very nose but up to he nose he charge not for he wind be short and the noise of he roaring go before he moreover he know that tom have a revolver and be a mad englishman now he be not afraid of tom or of a whole army : but he be a man of drill and of order of rule and of precedent as a prussian gendarme ought to be and for the mode of attack infantry cavalry and artillery man woman and child thief and poacher stray pig or even stray wolf he have drill and order sufficient : but for attack a colt 's revolver none moreover for arrest all manner of riotous burschen drunken boor french red republican mazzini-hatted italian refugee suspect polish incendiary or other fera naturse he have precedent and regulation : but for arrest a mad englishman none he hold fully the opinion of he superior that there be no say what a englishman might not could not and would not do he be a sphinx a chimera a lunatic break loose who take unintelligible delight in get wet and dirty and tired and starve and all but loll and call the same take exercise : who would see everything that nobody ever care to see and who know mysteriously everything about everywhere whose deed be like he opinion utterly subversive of all constitute order in heaven and earth be probably the inhabitant of another planet possibly the man in the moon himself who have be turn out have make he native satellite too hot to hold he all that be to be do with he be to inquire whether he passport be correct and then -lrb- with a due regard to self-preservation -rrb- to endure he vagary in pity wonder so the gendarme pause panting and not daring to approach walk slowly and solemnly round tom keep the point of he bayonet carefully towards he and roar at interval -- you have murder the young man but i have not say tom look and see but i see he fall but he have get up again and run away so then where be you passport that one other fact cognisable by the mind of a prussian gendarme remain as a anchor for he brain under the new and try circumstance and he use it here quoth tom pull it out the gendarme step cautiously forward do not be frightened i 'll stick it on you bayonet-point and suit the action to the word tom catch the bayonet-point put the passport on it and pull out he cigar-case mad englishman murmur the gendarme so the passport be correct but der herr must consider himself under arrest der herr will give up he death-instrument by all means say tom : and give up the revolver the gendarme take it very cautiously meditate awhile how to carry it stick the point of he bayonet into its muzzle and lift it aloft schon da kriegt have der herr any more death-instrument dozen say tom and begin fumble in he pocket from whence he pull a case of surgical instrument another of mathematical one another of lancet and a knife with innumerable blade saw and picker every one of which he open carefully and then spread the whole fearful array upon the grass before he the gendarme scratch he head over those too plain proof of some tremendous conspiracy so man must have a dozen hand he be surely palmerston himself or at least hecker or mazzinus murmur he as he meditate how to stow they all he think now that the revolver may be safe elsewhere and that the knife will do best on the bayonet-point so he unship the revolver bang go barrel number two and the ball go into the turf between he foot you will shoot yourself soon at that rate say tom so der herr speak german like a native say the gendarme grow complimentary in he perplexity perhaps der herr would be so good as to carry he death-instrument himself and attend on the herr polizeirath who be wait to see he by all means and tom pick up he tackle while the prudent gendarme reload and tom march down the hill the gendarme follow with he bayonet disagreeably near the small of tom 's back do not stumble look out for the stone or you 'll have that skewer through I so der herr speak german like a native say the gendarme civilly it be certainly der palmerston think he he manners be so polite once at the crater edge and able to see into the pit the mystery be in part at least explain : for there stand not only stangrave and bursch number two but a second gendarme two elderly gentleman two lady and a black boy one be lieutenant d -- by he white moustache he be lecture the bursch who look sufficiently foolish the other be a portly and awful-looking personage in uniform evidently the polizeirath of those part arm with the just terror of the law : but justice have if not she eye bandage at least she hand tie for on he arm hang sabina smile chat entreat the polizeirath smile bow ogle evidently a willing captive venus have disarm rhadamanthus as she have mar so often and the sword of justice must rust in its scabbard some distance behind they be stangrave talk in a low voice earnestly passionately -- to whom but to marie and lastly opposite each other and like two dog who be uncertain whether to make friend or fight be a gendarme and sabina 's black boy : the gendarme with shouldered musket be try to look as stiff and cross as possible be scandalise by he superior officer 's defection from the path of duty and still more by the irreverence of the black boy who be dance grin snap he finger in delight at have discover and prevent the come tragedy tom descend bow courteously apologise for have be absent when the highly distinguish gentleman arrive and turn to the bursch beg he to transmit to he friend who have run away he apology for the absurd mistake which lead he to etc etc the polizeirath look at he with much the same blank astonishment as the gendarme have do and at last end by lift up he hand and burst into a enormous german laugh and no one on earth can laugh as a german can so genially and lovingly and with such intense self-enjoyment oh you english you english you be all mad i think nothing can shame you and nothing can frighten you potz i believe when you guard at alma walk into that battery the other day every one of they be whistle you jim crow even after he be shoot dead and

the old man never seem to regret he never mention he name after a while mark he say once remember david why weep for the child i shall go to he but he will not come to I none know meanwhile why the old man need not to talk of tom to he friend and neighbor it be because he and grace never talk of anything else \* \* \* \* \* so they have live and so they have wait till that week before last christmas-day when mellot and stangrave make they appearance in whitbury and become mark armsworth 's guest the week slip on stangrave hunt on alternate day and on the other go with claude who photograph -lrb- when there be sun to do it with -rrb- stangrave end and whitford priory interior and exterior not forget the stangrave monument in whitbury church and sit too for many a pleasant hour with the good doctor who take to he at once as all man do it seem to give fresh life to the old man to listen to tom 's dearest friend to he as to grace he could talk openly about the lost son and live upon the memory of he prowess and he virtue and ere the week be out the doctor and grace too have hear a hundred gallant feat to tell all which would add another volume to this book and grace stand silently by the old man 's chair and drink all in without a smile without a sigh but not without full many a prayer it be the bless christmas eve the light be fail fast when down the high street come the mighty roman-nosed rat-tail which carry mark 's portly bulk and by he stangrave on a right good horse they shog on side by side -- not home but to the doctor 's house for every hunting evening mark 's groom meet he at the doctor 's door to lead the horse home while he before he will take he bath and dress bring to he blind friend the gossip of the field and detail to he every joke fence find kill hap and mishap of the last six hour the old man meanwhile be sit quietly with claude by he talk -- as claude can talk they be not speak of tom just now : but the eloquent artist 's conversation suit well enough the temper of the good old man yearning after fresh knowledge even on the brink of the grave but too feeble now in body and in mind to do more than listen claude be tell he about the late photographic exhibition and the old man listen with a triumphant smile to wonder which he will never behold with mortal eye at last -- this be very pleasant -- to feel surer and surer day by day that one be not need that science move forward swift and sure under a higher guidance than one 's own that the sacred torch-race never can stand still that he have take the lamp out of old and fail hand only to put it into young and brave one who will not falter till they reach the goal then he lie back again with closed eye wait for more fact from claude how beautiful say claude -- i must compliment you sir -- to see the child-like heart thus still beat fresh beneath the honor of the gray head without envy without vanity without ambition welcome every new discovery rejoice to see the young outstrip they and what credit sir to we we knowledge do not belong to we but to he who make we and the universe and we son ' belong to he likewise if they be wiser than they teacher it be only because they like they teacher have make he testimony they study when we rejoice in the progress of science we rejoice not in ourselves not in we child but in god we instructor and all the while hide in the gloom behind stand grace she arm fold over she bosom watch every movement of the old man and listen too to every word she can understand but little of it : but she love to hear it for it remind she of tom thurnall above all she love to hear about the microscope a mystery inseparable in she thought from he who first show she its wonder at last the old man speak again : -- ah how delighted my boy will be when he return to find that so much have be do during he absence claude be silent awhile startle you be surprise to hear I speak so confidently well i can only speak as i feel

possible however miraculous they may seem be they so very much more so than the daily fact of memory i can as little guess why we can remember the past as why we may not at time be able to foresee the future true you speak if not like a physician yet like a metaphysician so you will not laugh at I and compel the weak old man and he fancy to take refuge with a girl -- who be not weak -- grace darling you think still that he be come she come forward and lean over he yes she half whisper he be come soon to we : or else we be soon go to he it may mean that sir perhaps it be better that it

that voice yes there he be in bodily flesh and blood thin sallow beard to the eye dress in ragged sailor 's clothes : but tom himself grace utter a long low soft half-laughing cry full of the delicious agony of sudden relief a cry as of a mother when she child be bear and then slip from the room past the unheeding tom who have no eye but for he father straight up to the old man he go take both he hand and speak in the old cheerful voice -- well my dear old daddy so you seem to have expect I and gather i suppose all my friend to bid I welcome i be afraid i have make you very anxious :

the word of scripture for feeling beyond he fail power tom kneel down : and the old man pass he hand in silence over and over the forehead and face and beard while all stand silent mark armsworth
