upon thing afar off take up the spoon and help himself from the unwonted silence of miss nugent in the presence of anything unusual it be clear to he that the whole thing have be carefully arrange he eat in silence and a resolution to kick mr wilk off the premise vanish before the comfort to say nothing of the dignity afford by he presence mr wilk somewhat reassure favored miss nugent with a wink

quay be grievously misinterpret by a nervous man in a sailing boat master hardy have also see the ship out and perch on the extreme end of the breakwater he remain watch until she be hull down on the horizon then he make he way back to the town and the nearest confectioner and start for home just as miss nugent who be about to pay a call with she aunt wait beautifully dress in the front garden while that lady complete she preparation feel very spic and span and still a trifle uncomfortable from the vigorous attention of ann who cleanse she as though she have be a doorstep she pace slowly up and down the path upon these occasion of high dress a spirit of sabbath calm be wont to descend upon she and save she from escapade to which in a less severe garb she be somewhat prone she stop at the gate and look up the road then she face flush and she cast she eye behind she to make sure that the hall-door stand open the hate scion of the house of hardy be come down the road and in view of that fact she forget all else -- even she manners the boy still fresh from the loss of he natural protector keep a wary eye on the house as he approach then all expression die out of he face and he pass

cut off he retreat she be willing for he to be release but not to escape and so it fall out that the boy dodge beneath mr wilk 's outspread arm charge blindly up the side-entrance and bowl the young lady over there be a shrill squeal a flutter of white and a neat pair of button boot wave in the air then miss nugent sob piteously rise from the puddle into which she have fall and survey she garment

groan faintly and raise himself upon he elbow open he eye and sit up with a sharp exclamation he bed be higher from the floor than usual and moreover the floor be different in the dim light he distinctly see a ship 's forecastle untidy bunk with frouzy bedclothes and shiny oil-skin hang from the bulkhead for a few moment he stare about in mystification he be certainly ill and no doubt the forecastle be a hallucination it be a strange symptom and the odd part of it be that everything be so distinct even the smell he stare harder in the hope that he surroundings would give place to the usual one and lean a little bit more on he elbow nearly roll out of the bunk resolve to probe this mystery to the bottom he lower himself to the floor and feel distinctly the motion of a ship at sea there be no doubt about it he stagger to the door and holding by the side look on to the deck the steamer be roll in a fresh sea and a sweet strong wind blow refreshingly into he face funnel bridge and mast swing with a rhythmical motion loose gear rattle and every now and then a distant tinkle sound faintly from the steward 's pantry he stand bewildered try to piece together the event of the precede night and to try and understand by what miracle he be back on board he old ship the conqueror there be no doubt as to she identity he know every inch of she and any further confirmation that might be require be fully supply by the appearance of the long lean figure of captain hardy on the bridge captain nugent take he breath sharply and begin to realize the situation he step to the side and look over the harbor be only a little way astern and sunwich itself look cold and cheerless beyond the dirty tumble sea little more than a mile distant at the sight he spirit revive and with a hoarse cry he run shout towards the bridge captain hardy turn sharply at the noise and recognize the intruder stand peer down at he in undisguised amazement put back cry nugent wave up at he put back what on earth be you do on my ship inquire the astonished hardy put I ashore cry nugent imperiously do not waste time talk d'ye hear put I ashore the amazement die out of hardy 's face and give way to a expression of anger for a time he regard the red and threatening visage of captain nugent in silence then he turn to the second officer this man be not one of the crew mr prowle he say in a puzzle voice no sir say mr prowle how do he get aboard here captain nugent answer the question himself i be crimped by you and you drunken bully he say sternly how do this man get aboard here repeat captain

get there be probably best know to yourself i hold you responsible for the affair look here my lad say captain hardy in patronize tone i do not know how you get aboard my ship and i do not care i be willing to believe that it be not intentional on you part but either the outcome of a drunken freak or else a means of escape from some scrape you have get into ashore that be so i shall take a

year i sail with the cap'n and serve ` im faithful and this be my reward hardy plead he case next day miss nugent be alone when he call and move by the vivid picture he draw of the old man 's
