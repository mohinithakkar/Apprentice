they be steward or minister of whatever talent be entrust to they only be it not a strange thing that while we more or less accept the meaning of that say so long as it be consider metaphorical we never accept its meaning in its own term you know the lesson be give we under the form of a story about money money be give to the servant to make use of : the unprofitable servant dig in the earth and hide he lord 's money well we in we poetical and spiritual application of this say that of course money do not mean money -- it mean wit it mean intellect it mean influence in high quarter it mean everything in the world except itself 2 and do you not see what a pretty and pleasant come-off there be for most of we in this spiritual application of course if we have wit we would use it for the good of we fellow-creature but we have not wit of course if we have influence with the bishop we would use it for the good of the church but we have not any influence with the bishop of course if we have political power we would use it for the good of the nation but we have no political power we have no talent entrust to we of any sort or kind it be true we have a little money but the parable can not possibly mean anything so vulgar as money we money 's we own 3 i believe if you think seriously of this matter you will feel that the first and most literal application be just as necessary a one as any other -- that the story do very specially mean what it say -- plain money and that the reason we do not at once believe it do so be a sort of tacit idea that while think wit and intellect and all power of birth and position be indeed give to we and therefore to be lay out for the giver -- we wealth have not be give to we but we have work for it and have a right to spend it as we choose i think you will find that be the real substance of we understanding in this matter beauty we say be give by god -- it be a talent strength be give by god -- it be a talent but money be proper wages for we day 's work -- it be not a talent it be a due we may justly spend it on ourselves if we have work for it 4 and there would be some shadow of excuse for this be it not that the very power of make the money be itself only one of the application of that intellect or strength which we confess to be talent why be one man richer than another because he be more industrious more persevere and more sagacious well who make he more persevere and more sagacious than other that power of endurance that quickness of apprehension that calmness of judgment which enable he to seize opportunity that other lose and persist in the line of conduct in which other fail -- be these not talent -- be they not in the present state of the world among the most distinguished and influential of mental gift 5 and be it not wonderful that while we should be utterly ashamed to use a superiority of body in order to thrust we weaker companion aside from some place of advantage we unhesitatingly use we superiority of mind to thrust they back from whatever good that strength of mind can attain you would be indignant if you see a strong man walk into a theater or lecture-room and calmly choose the best place take he feeble neighbor by the shoulder and turn he out of it into the back seat or the street you would be equally indignant if you see a stout fellow thrust himself up to a table where some hungry child be be feed and reach he arm over they head and take they bread from they 6 but you be not the least indignant if when a man have stoutness of thought and swiftness of capacity and instead of be long-armed only have the much greater gift of be long-headed -- you think it perfectly just that he should use he intellect to take the bread out of the mouth of all the other man in the town who be in the same trade with he or use he breadth and sweep of sight to gather some branch of the commerce of the country into one great cobweb of which he be himself the central spider make every thread vibrate with the point of he claw and command every avenue with the facet of he eye you see no injustice in this 7 but there be injustice and let we trust one of which honorable man will at no very distant period disdain to be guilty in some degree however it be indeed not unjust in some degree it be necessary and intend it be assuredly just that idleness should be surpass by energy that the widest influence should be possess by those who be best able to wield it and that a wise man at the end of he career should be better off than a fool but for that reason be the fool to be wretched utterly crash down and left in all the suffering which he conduct and capacity naturally inflict not so 8 what do you suppose fool be make for that you might tread upon they and starve they and get the better of they in every possible way by no means they be make that wise people might take care of they that be the true and plain fact concern the relation of every strong and wise man to the world about he he have he strength give he not that he may crush the weak but that he may support and guide they in he own household he be to be the guide and the support of he child out of he household he be still to be the father that be the guide and support of the weak and the poor not merely of the meritoriously weak and the innocently poor but of the guilty and punishably poor of the man who ought to have know better -- of the poor who ought to be ashamed of themselves 9 it be nothing to give pension and cottage to the widow who have lose she son it be nothing to give food and medicine to the workman who have break he arm or the decrepit woman waste in sickness but it be something to use you time and strength in war with the waywardness and thoughtlessness of mankind to keep the err workman in you service till you have make he a unerring one and to direct you fellow-merchant to the opportunity which he dullness would have lose 10 this be much but it be yet more when
