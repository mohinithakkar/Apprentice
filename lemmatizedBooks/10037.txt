letter to evadne he brother have write give full and minute explanation as to she best course in the matter these she will follow implicitly under you supervision and i feel confident the result will be a well-developed character along the line on which woman through no fault of they own be so lamentably deficient namely the proper conduct of business and management of money judge hildreth look again at the envelope with its clear bold address that be not the handwriting of a fool he mutter i wish i could make up my mind what to do through the solemn hush of midnight he good and evil angel contend for he soul in a strange silence he listen to they voice the one insidious tempting the other urge he to take the upright course have he eye not be holden he would have see they the one

the white-robed angel turn sadly away judge hildreth have thrust evadne 's letter with he own far under the pile of papers and double-locked the drawer \* \* \* \* \* above the coach-house be a large room where pompey keep a store of hay and grain and there evadne often find herself ensconce with isabelle 's bible during the long morning when she be leave to amuse herself as best she might the atmosphere of the house stifle she and pompey have love she father it be scrupulously clean under pompey 's régime spider and moth find no tolerance and a magnificent black cat effectually frighten away the audacious rodent which be tempt to depredation by the toothsome cereal in the great bin in one corner pompey have improvise for she a luxurious couch of hay and rug and in this fragrant retreat evadne study she strange new book she bring to it a mind absolutely untrammeled by creed or circumstance and in this virgin soil god 's truth take root slowly the light dawned hers be no shallow nature to leap to a hasty conclusion and then forsake it for a later thought gradually through the darkness as god 's flower grow this human flower lift itself towards the light sometimes she would sit for hour with the stately cat upon she knee think think think while pompey sing he favorite hymn about he work and the mellow strain float up the stairway and soothe she lonely heart he childlike faith become to she a tower of refuge and often when bewilder by life 's inconsistency she feel as if the eternal reality be vanish into mist she be calm and comfort by he happy trust i can not imagine evadne say isabelle one evening at dinner what pleasure you can find in sit in a stable in company with a negro it certainly show a most depraved taste christ be bear in a stable isabelle what in the world have that to do with you i be begin to think he have everything to do with I answer she cousin quietly well say isabelle with a toss of she head we be know by the company we keep i should imagine pompey 's curriculum of manners be not on a very elevated plane pompey isabelle say judge hildreth suddenly why my dear pompey be a modern socrate bind in ebony there be no danger to be apprehend from he well it be a peculiar companionship for judge hildreth 's niece that be all i have to say say isabelle coldly but _ chacun à son goût _ i read this morning in you bible that god have choose the base thing of the world and thing which be despise and thing which be not to bring to nought thing that be what do that mean isabelle really evadne we shall have to send you to live with doctor jerome say she aunt with a careless laugh you be get to be a regular interrogation point we be not bible commentator child you can not expect we to explain all the difficult passage the embroidery club meet here tomorrow evadne exclaim marion and i do not believe you have touch you table scarf since they be here before what will celeste follingsby think she work so rapidly and she draw work be a perfect poem no i have not confess evadne it seem such silly work to draw thread apart and then sew they together again isabelle elevated she eyebrow with a look of horror loui laugh she be a hopeless case isabelle you 'll never convert she into a elegant trifler you might as well throw up the contract it seem to I evadne say he sister icily that you might have a little regard for the decorum of society do not i beg of you give utterance to such heresy before the girl and i wish you would not call it _ my _ bible i do not make it that be quite true evadne say loui gravely if she have there would have be a good deal leave out isabellum shoot a angry glance at he but make no remark she brother 's sarcasm be always receive in silence eva she say after a pause i intend to call you by that name in future -- you full one be too troublesome evadne shiver she father be the only one who have ever abbreviate she name i shall not answer to it she say quietly why pray because i suppose in common with the rest of the lower animal i have a natural repugnance to be cut in two how tiresome you be exclaim isabelle with a pout i do not object to my first syllable all the girl at school call I isa mamma do you remember to order the tulle for we wing claude river have finish hers and they be perfectly sweet she show they to I this afternoon wing isabelle what in the world be you up to now a butterfly social papa we must raise money in some way the church be frightfully in debt that be a deplorable fact but i do not know butterfly be famed as financier oh of course it be just for the novelty of the thing the last social we have be a mother goose and we have have brownie supper and pink tea and everything else we could think of we must have something to attract you know i wonder if it really pay ventured marion it never seem to I there be much leave after you deduct the cost of the preparation people might as well give the money outright it would save they a world of trouble why you silly child it be to promote sociability in the church as to the trouble of course we do not count that we must expect to make sacrifice but they do not make the church any more sociable say marion boldly who have strike for freedom of thought be follow up she advantage the same people take part every time and the other be leave outside nonsense say isabelle hotly it be only those who can not afford to take part and think what a treat it be for they to look on a sort of half-price theater say loui with a sneer i do not believe they find the look on such fun as you think say marion who be astonish at herself suppose you try if they would not like to take part and offer you place in the cantata to jemima dobb well do si and loui applaud softly isabelle 's lip curl upon my word marion you bid fair to become as hot a anarchist as louise michel it be a mystery to I where you find out the christian name of all the ungainly people in the congregation the other soprano would feel complimented to have a prima-donna with a face like a full moon and hand like a blacksmith 's foist upon they one must have a little regard for appearance and isabelle draw she graceful figure up to its full height jemima dobb be not dynamite and i have no anarchical tendency persist marion stoutly -- but beauty be only skin deep isabelle she support a sick mother and five child and that be more than any of the rest of we could do and marion frightened at she momentary temerity shrink back into she shell it be a most unaccountable thing lawrence say mr hildreth why the church should be so heavily encumber i be sure you contribute handsomely and the pew rent be high there be always a large congregation i can not understand it be largely compose of transient though my dear and they never carry more than a nickel in they pocket so the weight of the burden fall upon a few the expense be very heavy jerome want to make it the most popular church in the city and the new quartette prove a extravagant luxury oh well say mr hildreth of course one can not grudge the money for that professional singing be such a attraction the way madame rialto take that high c last Sunday be superb well say isabelle i do not think there be any doubt that doctor jerome be the most popular preacher in the city he be go to preach next Sunday on the moral progress of social science and next month he commence he series of sermon on the social problem of the day he do take such a interest in sociology but why do not he preach jesus christ ask evadne wonderingly you will get to be a regular fanatic evadne if you ring the change on that subject so often doctor jerome say he want he people to have a intelligent idea of the progress of event of course everyone understand the bible i do think he be the loveliest man she continue rapturously he be so sympathetic and celeste follingsby say he be ` perfectly heavenly in affliction ' she little sister die last week you know it be so awkward that it should have happen just now she will not be able to take any part in the cantata and she have the sweetest dress very ill-timed of providence say loui gravely what a pity it be isabelle that you could not have the regulation of affair he yawn and stroll lazily towards the fireplace when he look round again evadne be the only other occupant of the room well coz what do you think of the situation i belong to the worldling of course but i confess the idea of jesus christ at a butterfly social be tremendously incongruous we have the best of it evadne for we live up to we theory give it up coz you 'll find it a hopeless task to make the bible and modern christianity agree he look at he watch i say evadne jefferson be play at the metropolitan in richard iii to-night let we go and hear he and evadne go and enjoy it immensely chapter vii i be go for a long ride into the country evadne say she uncle one morning would you like to come with I evadne give a glad assent after she beautiful tropical life it seem to she as if she should choke shut away from the wide expanse of sky which she love among monotonous row of house and dingy street as they leave the city behind they and the road sweep out into the open she give a long sigh of delight she uncle laugh well evadne do it please you it be the first time i have feel as if i could breathe she say so you do not take kindly to marlborough well i suppose it be a rude awakening from you sunny land but you will get use to it we grow accustomed to all life 's disagreeable surprise as time roll on evadne

about it uncle lawrence no turn for dollar and cent eh do you father never consult you about he affair evadne 's lip quiver oh yes she say and she word be a cry of pain he consult I about everything

bewildering vista of summer beauty there be flower beside each plate as well as in the quaintly carve bowl in the center of the table evadne catch herself smile that have always be a conceit of hers in barbado everything be simple but delicious the tender juicy chicken the delicate pink ham the muffin brown to a turn the jersey butter mould into a sheaf of wheat and moist brown bread of aunt marthe 's own make the block of golden sponge cake the crisp lettuce the fragrant strawberry the cool jelly frost with snow evadne drink she tea out of a chocolate tinted cup flute like the bell of a

tea my dear evadne he say as he pass she cup to be refill be a infusion of poison which be slowly but surely destroy the coating of the gastronomical organ of the female portion of society i tremble to think of the amount of tannin which analysis would show deposit in the system of the votary of the deadly five o'clock and the unhealthy nervous tension of the age be largely traceable to the excessive consumption of the pernicious liquid chocolate on the contrary take as i always drink it be simple and nutritive with no unpleasant after effect to be apprehend but this decoction of bitter

the mystery of the boiling process water after it have pass the initiatory stage become flat absolutely flat and tasteless what i have to drink last night be so repugnant to my palate that i find it impossible to sink into repose with that calm attitude of mind which be so essential to perfect slumber see to it also my dear that i be not disturb at such a unearthly hour again as i be this morning teslum the great electrician have put himself on record as intimate that the want of sleep be a potent factor in the deplorably heavy death rate of the present day he think sleep and longevity be synonymous therefore it become we to bend every effort to attain that desirable consummation involuntarily evadne look at mr everidge she face be slightly turn towards the open window and there be a half smile upon she lip as if like joan of arc she be listen to voice of sweeter tone than those of earth she come back to the present again on the instant and meet she niece 's eye with a smile but

knock and mr everidge open the door evadne stretch out she hand impulsively oh this beautiful stillness she exclaim in marlborough there be the clang of the car gong and the rumble of cab and the tramp of foot upon the pavement until it seem as if the weary world be never to be at rest but this house be so quiet i could almost hear a pin drop mr everidge smile you have quick ear little one but

know full well that the relief of the tried heart be help she more than any physical rest could do and now oh aunt marthe life be so desperately lonely she say at last with a sob sigh mr everidge lean over and kiss the tremble lip i think sometimes the earthly fatherhood be take from we dear child that we may learn to know the beautiful fatherliness of god we can never find true happiness until we restless heart be fold close in the hush of he love human love -- however lovely -- do not satisfy we nothing can -- but god the fatherliness of god repeat evadne that sound lovely but people do not think of he so god be someone very terrible and far away ` and god shall wipe away all tear from they eye ' do that sound as if he be far away little one ` as one whom he mother comforteth so will i comfort you ' why god be father and mother both to we dear child can you think of anyone nearer than that evadne catch she breath in a great gladness i believe you be he angel of consolation she say in a hushed voice ` even unto they will i give a place and a name better than of son and daughter ' quote aunt marthe softly that mean a location and a identity here sometimes it seem as if we have neither the one nor the other christ follow out the same idea in he picture of the abide place which be be prepare for you and I everything on earth be so transitory and the human heart have such a hunger for something that will last have you feel this too cried evadne i think i be the only one mr everidge laugh the only one in all the world to puzzle over its problem oh yes the older we grow the more we find that the great majority have the same feeling and perplexity as ourselves although some may not understand they think clearly enough to put it into word what be you favorite verse in all the bible ask evadne after a pause mr everidge laugh again and evadne think she have never hear a laugh at once so merry and so sweet you send I into a rose garden dear child and tell I to select the choicest bloom out of its wilderness of beauty how can i when every one have a different coloring and a fragrance all its own two of my special favorite be in the revelation -- ` to he that overcometh to he will i give of the hidden manna and i will give he a white stone and upon the stone a new name write which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it ' ` and they shall see he face and he name shall be on they forehead ' that mean a possession and a belong it be the spiritual symbol which bind we to we heavenly lover for eternity just as the wedding ring be a pledge of fidelity for we earth time it be only as we see it so that we get the full beauty of the religion of jesus he church -- the inner circle of he choose ` hidden one ' -- be he bride and what can be more glorious than to be the bride of the king of king the dear soul who only serve he with fear do not get the sweetness out of it at all how can they when they life be all duty ` perfect love casteth out fear ' and there be no duty about it for when we love it be a joy to serve and give it hurt the christ to have we content to be simply servant when he would lift we up to the higher plane of friendship when he have put upon we the high honor of the dearest friend of all earthly bride spend a vast deal of time and think over they trousseau so i think christ 's bride should walk among man with a sweet aloofness while the spiritual garment be be fashion in which she be to dwell with he the bible say a great deal about dress ` let thy garment be always white ' -- the sunshine color the joy color -- for bye and bye we be to walk with he in white you know we spiritual wardrobe must be fit and wear down here it be a terrible mistake to put off don the wedding robe until we come to the feast and the wardrobe be very ample christ would have he bride luxuriously apparele ` be clothe with humility ' that be a fine close-fitting suit for every day but over it we be to wear the garment of praise and the warm shine robe of charity can you fancy anything more beautiful than a life clothe in such garment as these and to I the loveliest of all be charity the highest praise i ever hear give to a woman be that ` she have such a tender way of make excuse for everybody ' very fair must be the bride in the eye of she royal lover clothe in the garment which he have select -- all light and joy and tenderness for the king 's daughter be all glorious within aunt marthe say evadne after a long silence in which they have be tasting the sweetness of it i do not need to ask if you know jesus christ

settle down for they evening talk what do it all mean ` the victory of we faith ' you know and the ` overcometh ' in revelation i think christ get the victory for we so he do dear child and we through he i come across a lovely explanation of it some time ago which i will copy for you it have be such a inspiration listen -- ` when you be forget or neglect or purposely set at naught and you smile inwardly glory in the insult or the oversight -- that be victory ` when you good be evil speak of when you wish be cross you taste offend you advice disregard you opinion ridicule and you take it all in patient and loving silence -- that be victory ` when you be content with any food any raiment any climate any society any position in life any solitude any interruption -- that be victory ` when you can bear with any discord any annoyance any irregularity or unpunctuality -lrb- of which you be not the cause -rrb- -- that be victory ` when you can stand face to face with folly extravagance spiritual insensibility contradiction of sinner persecution and endure it all as jesus endure it -- that be victory ` when you never care to refer to yourself in conversation nor to record you work nor to seek after commendation when you can truly love to be unknown -- that be victory ' now i see exclaimed evadne it mean the beautiful patience with which you bear aggravate thing and the gentle courtesy with which you treat all sort of troublesome people oh my princess i envy you you altitude chapter xiv professor trenton have come and go and the glory of the autumn be over the land the early supper be end and evadne have ensconce herself in she favorite window to catch the sun 's last smile before he fall asleep in the room across the hall mr everidge recline in he luxurious arm-chair and leisurely turn the page of the last north american review it be Saturday evening why horace can this be possible mr everidge enter the room quickly and stand before she husband neither of they notice evadne my dear many thing be possible in this terrestrial sphere what particular possibility do you refer to that you have discharge reuben the sweet voice tremble mr everidge 's tone keep they usual complacent calm that possibility my dear have take definite form in fact but horace the boy be heart-broken time be a mighty healer my love he will recover he mental equipoise in due course but you might have give he a month 's warning where be the poor boy to find another place it be cruel to turn he off like this really my dear marthe i do not feel myself competent to solve all the problem of the labor question say mr everidge carelessly reuben must take he chance in common with the rest of he class but horace i can not imagine what you reason for this can be where will you find so good a boy i be not aware that socrate think it necessary to acquaint the worthy xantippe with the reason for he conduct remark mr everidge suavely the feminine mind be too much disposed to jump to hasty conclusion to prove of any assistance in decide matter of importance the masculine brain on the contrary take time for calm deliberation and weigh the pro and con in the scale of a well balanced judgment before arrive at any definite decision but my reason in this case will soon become apparent to you i do not intend to keep a boy at all but who will take care of atalanta be you go to forsake you cherish book for a curry-comb really marthe exclaim she husband in a aggrieved tone it be incomprehensible that you should have such a total disregard for the delicacy of my constitution -- especially when you know that the very odor of the stable be abhorrent to my olfactory sens atalanta have quarter provide for she at the vernon livery and one of the groom have order to bring the carriage to the door at two o'clock every afternoon but that will make it very awkward horace i so often have to use the carriage in the morning ` have ' my dear marthe be a word which admit of many substitution -- ` can not ' in this case will be a suitable one i find it be necessary to resume possession of the rein atalanta be retrograde and be rapidly lose that characteristic of speed which make she name a fitting one there be a lack of mastery about a woman 's handling of the ribbon which be quickly detect by horse especially when they be of more than average intelligence but horace if reuben go joanna will go too you know she promise she mother she would never leave he in that event my dear you will have a opportunity to become more intimately acquaint with the mystery of the culinary art observe mr everidge cheerfully it will be a splendid chance to evolve that finest of character combination spartan endurance couple with american progressiveness mr everidge smile but what if i do not have the spartan strength horace that be merely a matter of imagination my love it prove the truth of my theory that necessity develop capacity a woman of leisure for want of suitable mental pabulum grow to fancy she have every ill that flesh be heir to whereas when she be oblige by compelling circumstance to put she muscle into practice she mind acquire a more healthy tone self-contemplation be a most enervating exercise and involve a tremendous drain on the moral force do you think i waste much time in that way horace mr everidge speak wistfully and evadne force to be a unwilling listener to the conversation feel she cheek grow hot with indignation my dear i merely refer to the deplorable tendency of you sex all you require be moral stamen to tear yourself away from the arm of morpheus at a earlier hour in the it be a popular illusion you know that work perform before sunrise take less time to accomplish and be better do than later in the day my mother use to affirm that she accomplish the work of two day in one when she arise at three be but then my mother be a most exceptional woman with which parting thrust mr everidge retire behind the page of he magazine upstairs in she own room evadne pace the floor with tightly clench hand oh she cry what shall i do i hate he i hate he how dare he he ought to be glad to go down on he knee to serve she she be so sweet so dear oh i can not bear it that she should be compel to endure such servitude and i can do nothing to help nothing nothing she throw herself across the bed and burst into a passion of tear be this the silent girl whom isabelle have vote tiresome and slow a little later than usual she hear the low knock which always precede the visit which she look forward to as the sweetest part of the day could it be possible she would come to-night be no thought of self ever permit to enter that brave suffer heart she rise and open the door the dear face be paler than usual but there be no shadow upon the smooth brow marthe everidge have cross the tempest-tossed ocean of human passion into the sun-kissed calm of christ 's perfect peace evadne throw she arm around she neck and lay she storm-swept face upon she shoulder forgive I she cry i hear it all i could not help it i think my heart be break do not be angry you see i love you so how can i bear to have you subject to this you be so tender so true there be such a charm about you you be so beautifully unselfish oh my dear my dear how can you do you bear it mr everidge lift she face tenderly and kiss the quiver lip it be ` not i but christ ' dear child that make it possible then she draw she over to the lounge and begin to undress she as if she have be a baby my dear little sister you be utterly exhaust you be not strong enough to suffer so oh will you let I be you sister and help you bear you burden cry evadne unconscious that all the time the skilful hand be keep up they sweet ministry and that she burden be be lift for she by the one who have the greater burden to bear when she be comfortably settle for the night mr everidge draw she low chair up beside the bed evadne catch she hand in hers and kiss it reverently i wish i could make you understand how i honor you she say you must not do it dear say aunt marthe quickly honor the king after a pause she begin to speak slowly and she voice be sweet and low when the first night you come you ask I if i know jesus christ i tell you he be my life that explain it all it be very sweet of you to say the kind thing that you have about I but they be not true in and of herself marthe everidge be nothing the moment she try to live she own life she utterly fail if there be anything good about she life it be only as she let christ live it for she i do not understand say evadne with a puzzle look how be it possible for any one else to live we life for we no one can but jesus say aunt marthe with a smile he do the impossible take that exquisite fifteenth chapter of st john and study it verse by verse ` abide in I and i in you ' there you have the two abiding we be _ in _ christ when we believe in he and be accept through the merit of he blood and bring by adoption into the family of god but not until he abide in we heart shall we life become as beautiful as god mean they to be fruitfulness -- that be the cry everywhere man be call for intellectual fruitfulness and mechanical fruitfulness and be bend they energy to find the soil which will develop at once the best quality and greatest amount of fruit take a tree to make my meaning clearer the tree may abide in the soil and be just alive but it be not until the essence of the soil enter into and abide in the tree that it really grow and bear fruit grower of the finest variety will show you plum that look as if they have be frost with silver and peach with cheek like the first blush of dawn the ` fruit of the spirit ' have a wondrous bloom and a exquisite fragrance ` love joy peace ' evadne repeat slowly ` long-suffering gentleness goodness faith ' but those belong to the spirit aunt marthe yes dear child the spirit of jesus the spirit whom he send to comfort he people when he take he bodily presence from the earth the holy indwelling presence which be to reveal the christ to we and prepare we for the abide of the father and the son it be the beautiful mystery of the trinity but we can not have the trinity abide in we heart say evadne in a awestruck voice the bible teach we so not god aunt marthe jesus be god little one he say to the jew ' i and my father be one ' he say plainly ` if any man love I he will keep my word and my father will love he and we will come unto he and make we abode with he ' and in another place we be tell to be fill with the spirit it be three person but three in one i do not understand aunt marthe no dear we never shall down here thomas want to do that and christ say ` bless be they that have not see and yet have believe ' the spirit be continually give we deeper insight into the love of the son just as the son come to make know to the world the wonderful love of the father but ` be fill ' say evadne that look as if we have something to do with it so we have dear child suppose a man own one hundred acre of land and give you the right of way through it from one public road to another -- that would leave he many acre for he own use on which you have no right to trespass i think we treat jesus so we be willing that he should have the right of way through we heart but we forget that every acre must be the king 's property there must be no rights reserve no fenced corner jesus must be a absolute monarch mr everidge speak the last word softly and evadne look at she uplifted face shine now with the radiance which always fill it when she speak of she lord see again that glowing face which she have watch across the gate at hollywood and hear the strange exultant tone ` he be my king ' ah that be beautiful that be what aunt marthe mean and pompey and dyce jesus must come to abide not merely as a transient guest aunt marthe continue in she low tone we must give he full control of we thought and will we must hand he the key of the citadel we must give the all for the all -- that be only fair deal you see dear child christ can not fill we until we be willing to be empty of self he must have undivided possession there be a vast amount of heartache little one in this old world and self be at the bottom of it all when we stop to analyze it we want to be first to be think much of to be love best no wonder that the selfless life seem impossible to most people think what a continuous self-sacrifice christ 's life be so utterly alone and lonely among such uncongenial surroundings with people uncouth and totally foreign to he taste ah we do not realize it we look at he do the splendid thing amidst the plaudit of the multitude but think of the monotonous weary day go up and down the sun-baked street surround by a crowd of noisy beggar full of all sort of loathsome disease and the humdrum life in nazareth and all the time the great heart ache with that ceaseless sorrow -- ` he own receive he not ' oh what a waste of love we do not realize that it be in these footstep of he that we be call to follow we be willing to do the great thing with the world look on but not for the loneliness and the pain it seem a strange antithesis that paul should count that as he highest glory and yet how comparatively few seem count worthy to enter with christ into the shadow of that

one that loveth be bear of god but love be not merely veneration nor respect nor justice nor passion nor jealousy nor sympathy nor pity nor self-gratification to love something as we own be but a form of self-love to love something in order to win it for ourselves be just a perpetration of the same mistake ' dr karl gerok write -- ` love be the fundamental law of the world first as write in heaven for god be love second as write on the cross for christ be love third as write in we heart for christianity be love ' and drummond tell we that ` love -- be the rule for fulfil all rule the new commandment for keep all the old commandment christ 's one secret of the christian life ' and another writer say -- ` you be a personality only as you heart life and the heart live only as it love love be all action therefore the amount of you active love measure the size of you personal heart ' love have be define as ` the desire to bless ' that be like divine love for there can be no self think in god god 's love be over all and above all but when we love respond to he he love become to we a personal experience love can reach down when in loving trust we reach up love be like the seed it manifest no life until it begin to grow like the seed it must rise out of the dark ground into the light of heaven -- out of self think into god god 's love to we be like the sunlight we can make it we own only by be in it if we try to shut up the sunlight we shut it out we forget to do wrong when loving god as we love god the love we feel for he go out to other evadne sigh you make it seem a

beautiful year of ministry in nazareth and galilee there be a truer give than of we temporal goods we friend if they really love we want most of all what we can give they of ourselves it be those who give themselves to the world 's need who come nearest to the divine pattern christ have set for we to copy and if we truly love he we shall want not he gift but himself people seek after holy living instead of perfect loving they do not realize that we can be truly holy only as we love for ` love be the great reality of the spiritual world ' evadne lay she cheek caressingly against mr everidge 's

with I now i never have such a lovely vacation in my life there seem to be some excitement every day -- picnic and boat party and tennis match and five o'clock -- evadne laugh you would better not let uncle horace know you be ' a votary of the deadly five o'clock ' or he will empty he vial of denunciation upon you unlucky head oh aunt kate he send you a large bundle of fraternal greeting he say that ` view through the glamour of memory you impress he like a alpine landscape when the sun be rise and he hope the soft brilliance of prosperity will ever envelop you in its radiance and serve to enhance the beauty of you stately calm ' mr hildreth smile well pleased horace be so poetical she say but all the everidge be clever what a shame it seem that a man of he talent should be force by ill health to exist in a place where there be not a single soul capable of appreciate he rare quality even he wife do not begin to understand he it seem like cast pearl before swine evadne 's eye flash and she lip press themselves tightly together but mrs hildreth 's gaze be fix intently upon the lace shawl she be knit and loui just then give a sudden turn to the conversation she go up to she room with a great homesickness surge at she heart only last night all have be lightsome and happy now the old darkness seem to have settle down about she again she kneel before she window and look at the strip of sky which be all a marlborough residence allow she happy star she murmur for you be shine on aunt marthe far into the night she kneel there until a great peace flood she soul she raise she hand towards the sparkling sky to make the world brighter to make the world better to lift the world nearer to god bless christ that be thy mission i will make it mine the next morning loui draw she aside so little coz you do not coincide with the lady mother 's eulogium of we respected collateral last night why i say nothing cry evadne in astonishment loui laugh have you never hear of eye that speak and face that tell tale he say i will just whisper a word of warn before you play havoc with you web of destiny do not let a suspicion of you dislike cross the lady mother 's mind for uncle horace be she beau-ideal of a man i agree with you i think he be a cad chapter xvi a invitation to professor joliette 's and isabelle toss a gilt-edged card across the table to marion Wednesday evening it be not a very long invitation what dress will you wear but you be engage marion say evadne Wednesday evening you know yes say marion with a sigh it be awkward i do wish they would choose some other night for prayer meeting Wednesday seem such a favorite with everybody what a little prig you be get to be evadne say isabelle with a sneer you only diversion seem to be prayer meeting and church you be as bad as aunt marthe aunt marthe a prig oh that be too funny and evadne give one of she low sweet laugh besides do keep one 's engagement constitute a prig isabelle you would not think so if you be invite to the president 's reception the president 's reception what do get into the child i do not see much analogy between the two case no one consider prayer meeting a binding engagement and i be sure we go as often as we can not bind echo evadne so christ be not of as much importance as the president of the united state you do have such a way of put thing evadne say marion thoughtfully i expect we have better refuse isabelle refuse -- nonsense say isabelle sharply you always meet the best people at the joliette ' -- besides why should we run the risk of offend they why should they run the risk of offend you by choose a night they know you can not come asked evadne ridiculous what do they care about we church concern the joliette be foreigner people in polite society do not give religion such a unpleasant prominence as you delight in evadne for my part i consider it very bad form breaker ahead evadne say loui with he cynical laugh good form be isabelle 's fetich woe betide the unlucky wight who dare to hold a opinion of he own but say evadne the old puzzle look come into she eye i wish i could understand be christian ashamed of the religion of jesus that be about the amount of it little coz it be a sort of kedge anchor which they keep on board in case of danger for my part i think it be better to sail clear it be only a uncomfortable addition which spoil the trim of the ship oh loui do not exclaim marion with a sigh it be so hard to know what be right sometimes i wish i be a nun shut up in a convent and then i should have nothing else to do doubtless the lord would appreciate that sort of faithfulness say loui gravely although i notice christianity seem to be a sort of sing-sing arrangement with the majority everything be do under a sense of compulsion and the air be lurid with trial and lamentation and woe it be not a alluring life and in my opinion the jolly old world show its sense in steer clear of it you irreverence be shocking loui say isabelle severely and you be as much of a extremist as evadne no one could live such a life as you seem to expect religion have its proper place of course but i do not think it be wise to speak of the deep thing of life on all occasion ' i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and he crucify ' quote evadne be paul mistaken then certainly my dear coz say loui as he prepare to leave the room the greatest man be subject to that infirmity the only one who have never be mistake be isabelle \* \* \* \* \* it be so provoke that we can not have the carriage grumble isabelle as when Wednesday evening come they wait for loui in the dining-room at the joliette ' of all place i be sure i do not see papa why you can not insist upon pompey 's take some other night off when we need he on wednesday it be horribly awkward she father shake he head as he slowly peel a orange because i have give he my word my dear the only stipulation he make when i engage he be that he should not be require to drive on sunday and Wednesday evening and when i hear people complain about they surly incapable coachman i consider it be a light price to pay pompey be as sober as a church and as pleasant-tempered in a rain storm as a water-spaniel -- no matter what hour of the night you keep he wait so it be the least we can do to let the poor fellow be sure of one evening to himself and the judge open he time and begin to study the money market well say isabelle crossly i for one do not believe in allow servant to have such cast-iron rule it savor too much of socialism exactly so say loui from the doorway where he stand leisurely button he glove you will never pose as the goddess of liberty _ ma belle soeur _ it be a good thing that lincoln get the emancipation bill sign before you come into power or dusky million might still be weep tear of blood isabelle sweep past he with a indignant toss of she head and the front door close after the trio with a metallic clang i do not wonder the poor child be annoy say mr hildreth as she play with she grape it be very embarrassing when people know that we keep a carriage and the joliette be such stickler in the matter of etiquette it be a ridiculous fad of yours lawrence to be so punctilious but my dear i give he my word of honor what if you do there be exception to every rule not in the hildreth code of honor kate nonsense what do a color coachman understand about that why evadne you can not go to prayer meeting alone she exclaim as evadne come into the room with she hat on you uncle be busy and i be too tired so there be no way for you to get home i be go to dyce 's church aunt kate pompey will bring I home among a lot of shout negro you must be crazy child they soul be white aunt kate and there be no color line on the rock of age oh well taste differ say she aunt carelessly but it be a strange fancy for judge hildreth 's niece next thing you will suggest go to board with pompey i might fare a good deal worse say evadne with she soft laugh dyce keep she room like waxwork and she be a capital cook really evadne i be in despair you have not a iota of proper pride how be you go to maintain you position in society i do not believe i care to test the question aunt kate but i think my position will maintain itself well say evadne say she uncle look up from he paper you will never forget you be a hildreth eh higher than that uncle say evadne softly i be a sister of jesus christ i do not know what to make of the child say mr hildreth discontentedly as the door close behind she i believe she would rather associate with such people than with those of she own class she have a bowing acquaintance with the most _ outré _ look individual i ever see i really do not think dr jerome be wise setting young girl to visit in the german quarter it do not hurt marion now she only do it as a disagreeable duty and be immensely relieve when she round of visit be make for the month but evadne take as much interest in they as if they be she relation next thing we know she will be want to take up slum work i hope she will not come to any harm down among those crazy black they always seem to get possess the moment they touch religion i do not think evadne will ever come to any harm the judge say slowly the lord take pretty good care of he own he wife look at he with a puzzle expression i fully intend go to prayer meeting myself to-night she say but it get to be a great tax -- a evening out of every week -- and i do dread the night air so much mr judge hildreth dip she jeweled finger into the perfumed water of she finger glass and dry they on she silk-fringed napkin oh lawrence do not forget judge tracer 's dinner to-morrow night you will have to come home earlier than usual for it be such a long drive and it will never do to keep he mulligatawny wait and by the way i make a new engagement for you to-day mr general leighton have invite we to join the shakespearean club which she be get up it be to be very select will meet at the different house you know with a choice little supper at the close she say the one she belong to in atlanta be a brilliant affair she come from one of georgium 's first family you remember a shakespearean club and judge hildreth smile incredulously why my dear i never know you and the immortal will have much affinity for each other oh of course it be more for the prestige of the thing mr leighton say the general assure she you would never find leisure for it but i say i would promise for you it be only one evening a week you know she think we american retire far too early from the enjoyment of life in favor of we child and i believe she be right i certainly do not feel myself in the sere and yellow and mr judge hildreth regard herself complacently in the long mirror before which she stand you will manage to make the time lawrence what other answer but ` yes ' can petruchio make to ` the prettiest kate in christendom ' reply the judge bow gallantly to the face in the mirror as he come up and stand beside he wife it be a handsome face but there be a hardness about it and the line around the mouth which bespeak a indomitable will have deepen with the year only one evening a week kate but you think that too much of a tax just now how absurd you be lawrence when shall i make you understand that there be sacrifice that must be make we owe a duty to society we can not afford to let ourselves drop wholly out of the world a little later judge hildreth enter he library with a heavy sigh he have attain the end he have strive for he be respect alike in the church and the world he hold a high and lucrative position he have a well appoint home over which he handsome wife preside with dignity and grace and yet as he take he seat before he desk in the lofty room whose shelf be line with gem of think in fragrant costly binding life seem to have miss its sweetness to lawrence hildreth evadne 's word haunt he and like a accuse angel the letter which still lay hide under the mass of papers in the drawer which he never open seem to look at he reproachfully a sister of jesus christ sister and brother live together be it possible that jesus christ could be in this house -- this very room the idea be appalling he be familiar with the truism that god be everywhere but he have never really believe it and as the year pass he have find it convenient to remove he to a shadowy distance in space less likely to interfere with modern business method jesus christ enshrine in a far off glory among he angel appeal to the decorum of he religious sentiment but jesus christ face to face to be reckon with in the practical detail of honesty and fair deal that be a different matter and this be the violation of a dead man 's trust who have put everything in he power because he have faith in he he see again the young brother handsome easy-going to a fault but with a sense of honor so fine as to shrink in indignation from the slightest breath of shame read again the closing word of the farewell letter which he have read for the first time on the day now so long ago which he would have give world to recall and which from out the shadowy recess of eternity laugh at he futile wish so my dear brother the letter run i be give you this responsibility as only a brother can i have leave evadne absolutely untrammelled i have no fear that my little girl will abuse the trust she be wise beyond she year with a sense of honor as keen as you own the judge 's head sink upon he hand it be for evadne 's good he have persuade himself she be too much of a child -- and now -- the letter could not be deliver it mean disgrace and shame it be he duty as a father to shield he family from that how well he could picture evadne 's look of bewildered incredulous surprise and then the pain tinge with scorn which would creep into the clear eye and jesus christ the judge 's head sink lower as he hear the voice which have ring down through the age in scathing denunciation of all subterfuge and lie woe unto you hypocrite for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin and have leave undo the weightier matter of the law justice and mercy and faith woe unto you hypocrite for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they be full from extortion and excess woe unto you hypocrite for ye be like unto whited sepulchre which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly be full of dead man 's bone lower and lower sink the judge 's head until at last it rest upon the desk with a groan \* \* \* \* \* they be singing when evadne reach the humble church which dyce and pompey call they spiritual home the wall be white-washed and the seat be hard for the disciple of jesus possess but little of this world 's goods two prayer follow full of rich imagery and fervid passion and then a young girl with a deep contralto voice begin to sing -- steal away steal away steal away to jesus steal away steal away home we be not get long to stay here the soft deep note of the weird melody end in a burst of triumph and evadne bent she head while she tired heart thrill with joy when she look up again dyce be speak i have ben

worn and spend with he emotion lift he head and look at the judge with daze lack-luster eye not connect with the enterprise he repeat why the whole thought of the thing come from you and you have draw thousand of dollar -- i have simply give advice interrupt the judge haughtily advice echo the man and do not advice count in law if you can prove it say the judge with a cold smile do you ever remember have any of my opinion in write president peter the law take cognizance only of black and white you know the victim writhe in he chair as the trap in which he be catch reveal itself heavily he eye search judge hildreth 's face for some sign of pity or relent but in vain and if there should come a run on the fund he question dully if there should come a run on the fund answer the judge _

face upon the hem of he robe to let he lay he cool soothing healing hand upon you soul and draw all the hurry and fever away to realize that you be not a mighty messenger a important worker of he full of care and responsibility but only a little child with a father 's gentle bidding to heed and fulfil to lay you busy plan and ambition confidently in he hand as the child bring its broken toy at its mother 's call to serve he by wait to praise he by say ` holy holy holy ' a single note of praise as do the seraph of the heaven if that be he will to cease to live in self and for self and to live in

the religion of jesus and that afternoon she be go to give such a pleasure to gretchen and little han it be beautiful to be able to give pleasure to people she could just fancy how gretchen 's eye would glisten as she talk to she in she mother tongue while little han ' shyness would vanish under the genial influence of pompey 's sympathetic companionship and he would clap he hand with delight as brutus and caesar draw they under the arch of evergreen beauty bend low beneath they ermine robe while the silver bell break the hush of silence which dwell among the forest hall with a subdue melody and then ring out joyously as they emerge into the open where the sun shine bright and clothed denuded twig and tree in the bewitching beauty of a silver thaw it would always seem to little han like a dream of fairyland and she would be remember as he fairy godmother it be a pleasant role -- that of a fairy godmother she start for loui be say carelessly to the servant -- tell pompey to have the sleigh ready by half-past two sharp why loui she speak as if in a dream i be go to have the sleigh this afternoon that be unfortunate coz say loui lightly as probably we be go in different

pang how old and careworn he look kate he call as just then he hear he wife 's step in the hall come here what do you wish lawrence and there be a soft _ frou frou _ of silken drapery as mr hildreth 's dress sweep over the carpet evadne wish to become a nurse be you crazy there be a steely glitter in mr hildreth 's eye and she tone fall cold and measure through the room she say not say the judge

do this thing you will be ostracize by the world people make a great talk about the dignity of labor but a girl who work have no footing in polite society evadne 's sweet laugh fall softly through the silence i do not believe i have any time for society aunt kate life seem too real to be fritter away over afternoon tea be you mad lawrence to let she take this step think of the hildreth honor again judge hildreth laugh -- that strange feeble laugh evadne be of age kate she must do as she think right as to the rest -- i think the less we say about the hildreth honor now the better for we all he be alone mrs hildreth have sweep away in a storm of wrath evadne have follow she leave a soft kiss upon he brow he lift he hand to the place she lip have touch -- he feel as if he have be sting -- but there be no outward wound the hildreth honor the letter in the drawer at he side seem to confront he with scorn blaze from every page he put forth he hand with a sudden determination he would crush they impertinent obtrusiveness under he heel then when they damaging evidence be bury in the dust of oblivion he would be safe and fret evadne know she father have leave she something he would make special mention of it in he will -- a trust fund -- enough to yield she maintenance and the paltry pin money which be all the allowance he have ever see he way clear to make he brother 's child it be not he fault he argue -- he have mean to do right -- but gilt-edged security be as waste paper in the unprecedented monetary depression which be sweeping stronger man than himself to the verge of ruin he could not foresee such a crisis even the solon of wall street have not anticipate it it be not he fault he have mean to make all right in a few year what be that they say be pave with good intention he could not remember he seem to have strange fit of forgetfulness lately he must see that everything be put in proper shape in the event of he death people die suddenly sometimes one never know it would be safer to make re-investment yes that be a good thought he wonder it have never occur to he before he wisest plan be to have all money and security in he own name it would make it so much easier for the executor it be not fair to burden any one with a business so involve as he be now of course he would make a mental note of just how much belong to he brother it would not be safe to put it in black and white -- executor have such a unpleasant habit of go over one 's private papers -- but he would be sure to remember and if he ever get out of this bog as he expect to do of course shortly he would give evadne back she own it would leave he badly cripple for fund but one must expect to make sacrifice for the sake of principle then when these letter be destroy they would have no clue -- he frown what a unfortunate word for he to use a clue wag suggestive of criminality what possible connection could there be between judge hildreth and that he fit the key in the lock and turn it then he hand fall by he side no no he have not come to that -- yet he have always hold that tamper with the mail evince the blackest turpitude he be a honorable gentleman he start what be that a long low blood-curdling laugh as if a dozen mock fiend stand at he elbow -- or be it just the shrieking of the wind among the gable it be a wild night the rain dash against the window pane in sheet of vengeful fury and the howling of the storm make he shudder as he think of the ship at sea now and then a loose slate fall from a adjoining roof and be shiver into atom upon the pavement while the wind sweep along the street and lash the branch of the tree into a panic of helpless quiver rage could any poor beggar be without a shelter on such a night as this how do such people live he catch himself doze he feel strangely drowsy he straighten himself resolutely in he chair and draw a package of stock certificate from one of the secret drawer of the desk he would see about sell the stock and make re-investment to-morrow it must be do -- to save the hildreth honor chapter xxiv once more the hildreth household be unite if such a thing as union could be possible among so many diverse

white beauty be at its zenith and the social attention she be begin to receive only serve to render she elder sister more than ever irritable and envious loui be he old nonchalant self careless and listless with a ever deepen expression of _ ennui _ which be pitiful in one so young he european travels have not improve he in evadne 's opinion she see but little of she cousin they pass they day in pleasure she in work but marion in she rare moment of reflection as she think of the strangely peaceful face of the young nurse wonder sadly whether evadne have not choose the better part after all oh

light weight in the race but i assure you such people be need to balance matter if every one be in such deadly earnest as you evadne the old world would go to piece but loui it be dreadful to have no

uncalled for mr hildreth say in a annoyed tone when she hear of it you father never _ will _ learn to have a proper regard for _ les convenances _ uncalled for ejaculate loui i 'll venture to say the judge will never have a chance to follow such a brave man again he send he carriage that be all that be necessary doubtless dyce find that superlative honor a perfect panacea for she grief say loui sarcastically it be eminently fitting that brutus and caesar should have walk as chief mourner for they have lose the truest friend they ever have chapter xxv i be afraid poor evadne will be wear out with such constant attendance upon loui say marion some week after pompey 's death i do not see how she stand it it be hardly worth she while to undertake nursing say isabelle coldly if she can not stand such a trifle as this why isabelle just think of the strain night after night you would not like it i know i want mamma to get a pay nurse but loui will not have any one near he but evadne of course _ i _ could not stand be break of my rest rejoin isabelle it be hard enough for I to get any under the most favorable circumstance but probably evadne sleep like a log in the daytime it be the least return she can make for have disgrace the family to be of some use in it now marion laugh incredulously i should never think of associate evadne 's name with disgrace she say what _ do _ you mean isabelle mamma say this nursing fad of hers upset papa completely he say the hildreth honor have better not be mention any more well i do not know it seem to I she be of a good deal more value to he now than the hildreth honor dr russe say she be one of the best nurse he ever see that be a high compliment for he be dreadfully particular it be my opinion isabelle that loui be a good deal worse than we think he to be do not mention it to mamma for she be so nervous but i hear dr russo talk to papa in the hall this morning something about a inherit tendency and a derangement of the nervous system i could not understand -- he speak so low -- but papa look dreadfully worry after he have go do not you think papa look very badly isabelle and he seem so absent as if he have something on he mind i notice it long before this happen isabelle laugh carelessly what a girl you be marion you be always imagine thing about people for my part i have too many worry of my own upstairs evadne be say wistfully do not you think you life should be very precious loui now that two people have die two people evadne i know there be good old pompey -- the thought of that haunt I night and day -- but who else do you mean jesus christ oh do you never think about he loui my dear coz i find it wiser not to think every other man you meet hold a different creed and each one think he be the right one why should i set myself up as know better than other people the only way be to have a sort of nebulous faith god will not expect too much of we if we do the best we can a ` nebulous faith ' will not save you loui evadne answer sadly god expect we to believe he word when he tell we that he have open a way for we into the holiest by the blood of he son that atonement theory be a uncanny doctrine it be the only way by which sinner can be make ` at one ' with a absolutely holy god jesus say ` and i if i be lift up will draw all man unto I ' he humanitarianism do not win the heart of the multitude the very man he have feed and heal hound he _ on to he cross _ it be not philosophical i read this morning that ` the move energy in the world 's history to-day be not a philosophy but a cross ' the god of the present be humanitarianism humanitarianism be not christ paul say -- ` though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor but have not love it profiteth I nothing ' the love which he mean be the christ power for no mere human love could reach the altitude of the 13th of 1st corinthian real religion be not a creed but a christ it seem to I the most important question we have to answer be what we think of christ and what we be go to do with he when peter give he answer -- ` thou art the christ -- the anointed one -- the son of the living god -- ' christ say ` on this rock -- the faith of thine -- i will build my church ' humanitarianism pure and simple seem to I but a attempt to imitate christ it be beautiful as far as it go but it be not my idea of follow he what be evadne when jesus tell he disciple to follow he mean they to be with he i do not think we can ever hope to be like christ unless we believe he to be god and walk with he every day if we have the spirit of jesus in we heart we shall be model humanitarian for we shall love we neighbor as ourselves loui catch she hand in he begin by loving I he cry suddenly i love you dear these long day of watch have teach I that although i begin to suspect it some time ago it be no use say anything he go on hurriedly as evadne begin to protest you must be my wife for i can not live without you he draw a handsome ring of

when i see isabelle and marion playing at it but i have never sneer at you now take you choice shall the devil have he own he voice be quiet but she could see he be labor under intense excitement evadne be in despair what should she do only that morning dr russe have say to she -- it be not the injury he sustain in the fall that worry I he will get over that but the shock to the nervous system have be tremendous humor he in everything and avoid the least excitement as you value he life she lean over he and say gently -- dear loui you be not strong enough to talk any more to-day i will wear the ring a little while to please you but remember this other thing you want can never be he look up at she he face pallid with exhaustion promise I he say faintly that the ring shall stay on you finger until i take it off and evadne promise chapter xxvi three year have slip away and evadne still wear she cousin 's ring a great tenderness be grow up in she heart toward he she yearn over he as

thing the ring fret she and she long to be free from its presence but loui hold she to she promise if he only wait long enough he persuade himself he patience would be reward some day this shy sweet bird would nestle against he heart in the meantime he would keep the ungenerous advantage which he illness have give he he forget that it need more to tame a bird than merely put it in a cage isabelle have be intensely curious but she question have elicit no satisfaction from she brother and evadne have answer simply loui take a fancy to put it on my finger : i be wear it to please he that be all : and even isabelle find she cousin 's sweet dignity a effectual bar against she morbid inquisitiveness they have see comparatively little of each other evadne be constantly busy either at private or hospital nursing and very short be the furlough which she spend under she uncle 's roof loui have spend the first winter after he illness with he mother in the south of france now he be in florida but he write regularly and evadne answer -- when she could sweet plead letter which he read over and over and honestly try to be better : but it be only for she sake he know no higher motive -- yet it be a perfect day down by the river a alligator be sun himself and the resinous breath of the pine tree sweep its aromatic fragrance over loui as he lay at full length in a hammock with he hand behind he head he have throw the magazine he have be read on the ground and it lay open at the article on heredity which he have just finish he desultory thought be roam idly over the subject when one more far reach than the rest make he start lip with a sudden shock of unwelcome surprise by jove can it be that i be a victim of it too it look confoundedly like it although even my sweet little puritan have
