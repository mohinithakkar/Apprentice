the constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law and unite in common effort for the common good all too will bear in mind this sacred principle that though the will of the majority be in all case to prevail that will to be rightful must be reasonable that the minority possess they equal rights which equal law must protect and to violate would be oppression let we then fellow-citizen unite with one heart and one mind let we restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself be but dreary thing and let we reflect that have banish from we land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bleed and suffer we have yet gain little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and bloody persecution during the throe and convulsion of the ancient world during the agonizing spasm of infuriate man seek through blood and slaughter he long-lost liberty it be not wonderful that the agitation of the billow should reach even this distant and peaceful shore that this should be more feel and fear by some and less by other and should divide opinion as to measure of safety but every difference of opinion be not a difference of principle we have call by different name brethren of the same principle we be all republican we be all federalist if there be any among we who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let they stand undisturbed as monument of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerate where reason be leave free to combat it i know indeed that some honest man fear that a republican government can not be strong that this government be not strong enough but would the honest patriot in the full tide of successful experiment abandon a government which have so far keep we free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government the world 's best hope may by possibility want energy to preserve itself i trust not i believe this on the contrary the strongest government on earth i believe it the only one where every man at the call of the law would fly to the standard of the law and would meet invasion of the public order as he own personal concern sometimes it be say that man can not be trust with the government of himself can he then be trust with the government of other or have we find angel in the form of king to govern he let history answer this question let we then with courage and confidence pursue we own federal and republican principle we attachment to union and representative government kindly separate by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminate havoc of one quarter of the globe too high-minded to endure the degradation of the other possess a choose country with room enough for we descendant to the thousandth and thousandth generation entertain a due sense of we equal right to the use of we own faculty to the acquisition of we own industry to

: it be a circumstance of sincere gratification to I that on meet the great council of we nation i be able to announce to they on grounds of reasonable certainty that the war and trouble which have for so many year afflict we sister nation have at length come to a end and that the communication of peace and commerce be once more opening among they whilst we devoutly return thanks to the beneficent be who have be please to breathe into they the spirit of conciliation and forgiveness we be bind with peculiar gratitude to be thankful to he that we own peace have be preserve through so perilous a season and ourselves permit quietly to cultivate the earth and to practice and improve those art which tend to increase we comfort the assurance indeed of friendly disposition receive from all the power with whom we have principal relation have inspire a confidence that we peace with they would not have be disturbed but a cessation of irregularity which have affect the commerce of neutral nation and of the irritation and injury produce by they can not but add to this confidence and strengthen at the same time the hope that wrong commit on unoffending friend under a pressure of circumstance will now be review with candor and will be consider as found just claim of retribution for the past and new assurance for the future among we indian neighbor also a spirit of peace and friendship generally prevail and i be happy to inform yon that the continued effort to introduce among they the implement and the practice of husbandry and of the household art have not be without success that they be become more and more sensible of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and subsistence over the precarious resource of hunting and fishing and already we be able to announce that instead of that constant diminution of they number produce by they war and they want some of they begin to experience a increase of population to this state of general peace with which we have be bless one only exception exist tripolus the least considerable of the barbary state have come forward with demand unfounded either in right or in compact and have permit itself to denounce war on we failure to comply before a give day the style of the demand admit but one answer i send a small squadron of frigate into the mediterranean with assurance to that power of we sincere desire to remain in peace but with order to protect we commerce against the threaten attack the measure be seasonable and salutary the bey have already declare war he cruiser be out two have arrive at gibraltar we commerce in the mediterranean be blockade and that of the atlantic in peril the arrival of we squadron dispel the danger one of the tripolitan cruiser have fall in with and engage the small schooner _ enterprise _ command by lieutenant sterret which have go as a tender to we larger vessel be capture after a heavy slaughter of she man without the loss of a single one on we part the bravery exhibit by we citizen on that element will i trust be a testimony to the world that it be not the want of that virtue which make we seek they peace but a conscientious desire to direct the energy of we nation to the multiplication of the human race and not to its destruction unauthorized by the constitution without the sanction of congress to go beyond the line of defense the vessel be disable from commit further hostility be liberate with its crew the legislature will doubtless consider whether by authorize measure of offense also they will place we force on a equal footing with that of its adversary i communicate all material information on this subject that in the exercise of this important function confide by the constitution to the legislature exclusively they judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight i wish i could say that we situation with all the other barbary state be entirely satisfactory discover that some delay have take place in the performance of certain article stipulate by we i think it my duty by immediate measure for fulfil they to vindicate to ourselves the right of consider the effect of departure from stipulation on they side from the papers which will be lay before you you will be enable to judge whether we treaty be regard by they as fix at all the measure of they demand or as guard from the exercise of force we vessel within they power and to consider how far it will be safe and expedient to leave we affair with they in they present posture i lay before you the result of the census lately take of we inhabitant to a conformity with which we be now to reduce the ensue ratio of representation and taxation you will perceive that the increase of number during the last ten year proceed in geometrical ratio promise a duplication in little more than twenty-two year we contemplate this rapid growth and the prospect it hold up to we not with a view to the injury it may enable we to do other in some future day but to the settlement of the extensive country still remain vacant within we limit to the multiplication of man susceptible of happiness educate in the love of order habituate to self-government and value its blessing above all price other circumstance combine with the increase of number have produce a augmentation of revenue arise from consumption in a ratio far beyond that of population alone and though the change in foreign relation now take place so desirably for the whole world may for a season affect this branch of revenue yet weigh all probability of expense as well as of income there be reasonable ground of confidence that we may now safely dispense with all the internal tax comprehend excise stamp auction licens carriage and refine sugar to which the postage on newspaper may be add to facilitate the progress of information and that the remain source of revenue will be sufficient to provide for the support of government to pay the interest of the public debt and to discharge the principal within shorter period than the law or the general expectation have contemplate war indeed and untoward event may change this prospect of thing and call for expense which the impost could not meet but sound principle will not justify we tax the industry of we fellow-citizen to accumulate treasure for war to happen we know not when and which might not perhaps happen but from the temptation offer by that treasure these view however of reduce we burthen be form on the expectation that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction may take place in we habitual expenditure for this purpose those of the civil government the army and navy will need revisal when we consider that this government be charge with the external and mutual relation only of these state that the state themselves have principal care of we person we property and we reputation constitute the great field of human concern we may well doubt whether we organization be not too complicated too expensive whether office and officer have not be multiply unnecessarily and sometimes injuriously to the service they be mean to promote i will cause to be lay before you a essay toward a statement of those who under public employment of various kind draw money from the treasury or from we citizen time have not permit a perfect enumeration the ramification of office be too multiply and remote to be completely trace in a first trial among those who be dependent on executive discretion i have begin the reduction of what be deem unnecessary the expense of diplomatic agency have be considerably diminish the inspector of internal revenue who be find to obstruct the accountability of the institution have be discontinue several agency create by executive authority on salary fix by that also have be suppress and should suggest the expediency of regulate that power by law so as to subject its exercise to legislative inspection and sanction other reformation of the same kind will be pursue with that caution which be requisite in remove useless thing not to injure what be retain but the great mass of public office be establish by law and therefore by law alone can be abolish should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review and try all its part by the test of public utility they may be assure of every aid and light which executive information can yield consider the general tendency to multiply office and dependency and to increase expense to the ultimate term of burthen which the citizen can bear it behoove we to avail ourselves of every occasion which present itself for take off the surcharge that it never may be see here that after leave to labor the smallest portion of its earnings on which it can subsist government shall itself consume the whole residue of what it be institute to guard in we care too of the public contribution intrust to we direction it would be prudent to multiply barrier against they dissipation by appropriate specific sum to every specific purpose susceptible of definition by disallow all application of money vary from the appropriation in object or transcend it in amount by reduce the undefined field of contingency and thereby circumscribe discretionary power over money and by bring back to a single department all accountability for money where the examination may be prompt efficacious and uniform a account of the receipt and expenditure of the last year as prepare by the secretary of the treasury will as usual be lay before you the success which have attend the late sale of the public land shew that with attention they may be make a important source of receipt among the payment those make in discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt will shew that the public faith have be exactly maintain to these will be add a estimate of appropriation necessary for the ensue year this last will of course be affect by such modification of the system of expense as you shall think proper to adopt a statement have be form by the secretary of war on mature consideration of all the post and station where garrison will be expedient and of the number of man requisite for each garrison the whole amount be considerably short of the present military establishment for the surplus no particular use can be point out for defense against invasion they number be as nothing nor be it conceive needful or safe that a standing army should be keep up in time of peace for that purpose uncertain as we must ever be of the particular point in we circumference where a enemy may choose to invade we the only force which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose they be the body of neighbor citizen as form into a militia on these collect from the part most convenient in number proportion to the invade force it be best to rely not only to meet the first attack but if it threaten to be permanent to maintain the defense until regular may be engage to relieve they these consideration render it important that we should at every session continue to amend the defect which from time to time shew themselves in the law for regulate the militia until they be sufficiently perfect nor should we now or at any time separate until we can say we have do everything for the militia which we could do be a enemy at we door the provision of military store on hand will be lay before you that you may judge of the addition still requisite with respect to the extent to which we naval preparation should be carry some difference of opinion may be expect to appear but just attention to the circumstance of every part of the union will doubtless reconcile all a small force will probably continue to be want for actual service in the mediterranean whatever annual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate to naval preparation would perhaps be better employ in provide those article which may be keep without waste or consumption and be in readiness when any exigence call they into use progress have be make as will appear by papers now communicate in provide material for 74-gun ship as direct by law how far the authority give by the legislature for procure and establish site for naval purpose have be perfectly understand and pursue in the execution admit of some doubt a statement of the expense already incur on that subject be now lay before you i have in certain case suspend or slacken these expenditure that the legislature might determine whether so many yard be necessary as have be contemplate the work at this place be among those permit to go on and five of the seven frigate direct to be lay up have be bring and lay up here where besides the safety of they position they be under the eye of the executive administration as well as of its agent and where yourselve also will be guide by you own view in the legislative provision respect they which may from time to time be necessary they be preserve in such condition as well the vessel as whatever belong to they as to be at all time ready for sea on a short warning two other be yet to be lay up so soon as they shall have receive the repair requisite to put they also into sound condition as a superintend officer will be necessary at each yard he duty and emolument hitherto fix by the executive will be a more proper subject for legislation a communication will also be make of we progress in the execution of the law respect the vessel direct to be sell the fortification of we harbor more or less advanced present consideration of great difficulty while some of they be on a scale sufficiently proportion to the advantage of they position to the efficacy of they protection and the importance of the point within it other be so extensive will cost so much in they first erection so much in they maintenance and require such a force to garrison they as to make it questionable what be best now to be do a statement of those commence or project of the expense already incur and estimate of they future cost as far as can be foresee shall be lay before you that you may be enable to judge whether any alteration be necessary in the law respect this subject agriculture manufacture commerce and navigation the four pillar of we prosperity be then most thriving when leave most free to individual enterprise protection from casual embarrassment however may sometimes be seasonably interpose if in the course of you observation or inquiry they should appear to need any aid within the limit of we constitutional power you sense of they importance be a sufficient assurance they will occupy you attention we can not indeed but all feel a anxious solicitude for the difficulty under which we carry trade will soon be place how far it can be relieved otherwise than by time be a subject of important consideration the judiciary system of the united state and especially that portion of it recently erect will of course present itself to the contemplation of congress and that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bear to the business it have to perform i have cause to be procure from the several state and now lay before congress a exact statement of all the cause decide since the first establishment of the court and of those which be depend when additional court and judge be bring in to they aid and while on the judiciary organization it will be worthy you consideration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of jury have be extend to all the case involve the security of we person and property they impartial selection also be essential to they value we ought further to consider whether that be sufficiently secure in those state where they be name by a marshal depend on executive will or designate by the court or by officer dependent on they i can not omit recommend a revisal of the law on the subject of naturalization consider the ordinary chance of human life a denial of citizenship under a residence of fourteen year be a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it and control a policy pursue from they first settlement by many of these state and still believe of consequence to they prosperity and shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitive from distress that hospitality which the savage of the wilderness extend to we father arrive in this land shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe the constitution indeed have wisely provide that for admission to certain office of important trust a residence shall be require sufficient to develop character and design but might not the general character and capability of a citizen be safely communicate to everyone manifest a bona fide purpose of embark he life and fortune permanently with we with restriction perhaps to guard against the fraudulent usurpation of we flag a abuse which bring so much embarrassment and loss on the genuine citizen and so much danger to the nation of be involve in war that no endeavor should be spare to detect and suppress it these fellow-citizen be the matter respect the state of the nation which i have think of importance to be submit to you consideration at this time some other of less moment or not yet ready for communication will be the subject of separate message i be happy in this opportunity of commit the arduous affair of we government to the collect wisdom of the union nothing shall be want on my part to inform as far as in my power the legislative judgment nor to carry that judgment into faithful execution the prudence and temperance of you discussion will promote within you own wall that conciliation which so much befriend rational conclusion and by its example will encourage among we constituent that progress of opinion which be tend to unite they in object and in will that all should be satisfy with any one order of thing be not to be expect but i indulge the please persuasion that the great body of we citizen will cordially concur in honest and disinterested effort which have for they object to preserve the general and state government in they constitutional form and equilibrium to maintain peace abroad and order and obedience to the law at home to establish principle and practice of administration favorable to the security of liberty and property and to reduce expense to what be necessary for the useful purpose of government th jefferson special message December 11 1801 _ gentleman of the senate _ : early in the last month i receive the ratification by the first consul of france of the

a early attention the lot in the city which be chargeable with the payment of these money be deem not only equal to the indemnification of the public but to insure a considerable surplus to the city to be employ for its improvement provide they be offer for sale only in sufficient number to meet the exist demand but the act of 1796 require that they shall be positively sell in such number as

affection and harmony with we indian neighbor we burthen lighten yet we income sufficient for the public want and the produce of the year great beyond example these fellow-citizen be the circumstance under which we meet and we remark with special satisfaction those which under the smile of providence result from the skill industry and order of we citizen manage they own affair in they own way and for they own use unembarrassed by too much regulation unoppressed by fiscal exaction on the restoration of peace in europe that portion of the general carry trade which have fall to we share during the war be abridged by the return competition of the belligerent power this be to be expect and be just but in addition we find in some part of europe monopolize discrimination which in the form of duty tend effectually to prohibit the carry thither we own produce in we own vessel from exist amity and a spirit of justice it be hope that friendly discussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity but should false calculation of interest defeat we hope it rest with the legislature to decide whether they will meet inequality abroad with countervail inequality at home or provide for the evil in any other way it be with satisfaction i lay before you a act of the british parliament anticipate this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the duty and countervail duty

rescue they from the danger into which they distress might plunge they and save they to they country have find it necessary in some case to return they at the public charge the cession of the spanish province of louisiana to france which take place in the course of the late war will if carry into effect make a change in the aspect of we foreign relation which will doubtless have just weight in any deliberation of the legislature connect with that subject there be reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we be engage with tripolus might be take up by some other of the barbary power a reenforcement therefore be immediately order to the vessel already there subsequent information however have remove these apprehension for the present to secure we commerce in that sea with the smallest force competent we have suppose it best to watch strictly the harbor of tripolus still however the shallowness of they coast and the want of smaller vessel on we part have permit some cruiser to escape unobserved and to one of these a american vessel unfortunately fall a prey the captain one american seaman and two other of color remain prisoner with they unless exchange under a agreement formerly make with the bashaw to whom on the faith of that some of he captive subject have be restore the convention with the state of georgium have be ratify by they legislature and a repurchase from the creek have be consequently make of a part of the talasscee country in this purchase have be also comprehend a part of the land within the fork of oconee and oakmulgee river the particulars of the contract will be lay before congress so soon as they shall be in a state for communication in order to remove every ground of difference possible with we indian neighbor i have proceed in the work of settle with they and mark the boundary between we that with the choctaw nation be fix in one part and will be through the whole within a short time the country to which they title have be extinguish before the revolution be sufficient to receive a very respectable population which congress will probably see the expediency of encourage so soon as the limit shall be declare we be to view this position as a outpost of the united state surround by strong neighbor and distant from its support and how far that monopoly which prevent population should here be guard against and actual habitation make a condition of the continuance of title will be for you consideration a prompt settlement too of all exist rights and claim within this territory present itself as a preliminary operation in that part of the indiana territory which include vincenne the line settle with the neighbor tribe fix the extinction of they title at a breadth of 24 league from east to west and about the same length parallel with and include the wabash they have also cede a tract of 4 mile square include the salt spring near the mouth of that river in the department of finance it be with pleasure i inform you that the receipt of external duty for the last twelve month have exceed those of any former year and that the ratio of increase have be also greater than usual this have enable we to answer all the regular exigency of government to pay from the treasury within one year upward of $ 8000000 principal and interest of the public debt exclusive of upward of one million pay by the sale of bank stock and make in the whole a reduction of nearly five million and a half of principal and to have now in the treasury $ 4500000 which be in a course of application to the further discharge of debt and current demand experience too so far authorize we to believe if no extraordinary event supervene and the expense which will be actually incur shall not be greater than be contemplate by congress at they last session that we shall not be disappoint in the expectation then form but nevertheless as the effect of peace on the amount of duty be not yet fully ascertain it be the more necessary to practice every useful economy and to incur no expense which may be avoid without prejudice the collection of the internal tax have be complete in some of the state the officer employ in it be of course out of commission in other they will be so shortly but in a few where the arrangement for the direct tax have be retard it will be some time before the system be close it have not yet be think necessary to employ the agent authorize by a act of the last session for transact business in europe relative to debt and loan nor have we use the power confide by the same act of prolong the foreign debt by reloan and of redeeming instead thereof a equal sum of the domestic debt should however the difficulty of remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any time the power shall be execute and the money thus unemployed abroad shall in conformity with that law be faithfully apply here in a equivalent extinction of domestic debt when effect so salutary result from the plan you have already sanction when merely by avoid false object of expense we be able without a direct tax without internal tax and without borrow to make large and effectual payment toward the discharge of we public debt and the emancipation of we posterity from that mortal canker it be a encouragement fellow-citizen of the highest order to proceed as we have begin in substitute economy for taxation and in pursue what be useful for a nation place as we be rather than what be practice by other under different circumstance and whensoever we be destine to meet event which shall call forth all the energy of we countryman we have the firmest reliance on those energy and the comfort of leave for call like these the extraordinary resource of loan and internal tax in the meantime by payment of the principal of we debt we be liberating annually portion of the external tax and form from they a grow fund still further to lessen the necessity of recur to extraordinary resource the usual account of receipt and expenditure for the last year with a estimate of the expense of the ensue one will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury no change be deem necessary in we military establishment a estimate of its expense for the ensue year on its present footing as also of the sum to be employ in fortification and other object within that department have be prepare by the secretary of war and will make a part of the general estimate which will be present you consider that we regular troops be employ for local purpose and that the militia be we general reliance for great and sudden emergency you will doubtless think this institution worthy of a review and give it those improvement of which you find it susceptible estimate for the naval department prepare by the secretary of the navy for another year will in like manner be communicate with the general estimate a small force in the mediterranean will still be necessary to restrain the tripoline cruiser and the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the barbary power may eventually require that force to be augment the necessity of procure some smaller vessel for that service will raise the estimate but the difference in they maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy presume it will be deem expedient to expend annually a convenient sum toward provide the naval defense which we situation may require i can not but recommend that the first appropriation for that purpose may go to the save what we already possess no care no attention can preserve vessel from rapid decay which lie in water and expose to the sun these decay require great and constant repair and will consume if continue a great portion of the money destine to naval purpose to avoid this waste of we resource it be propose to add to we navy-yard here a dock within which we present vessel may be lay up dry and under cover from the sun under these circumstance experience prove that work of wood will remain scarcely at all affect by time the great abundance of run water which this situation possess at height far above the level of the tide if employ as be practice for lock navigation furnish the means for raise and lay up we vessel on a dry and sheltered bed and should the measure be find useful here similar depository for lay up as well as for building and repair vessel may hereafter be undertake at other navy-yard offer the same mean the plan and estimate of the work prepare by a person of skill and experience will be present to you without delay and from this it will be see that scarcely more than have be the cost of one vessel be necessary to save the whole and that the annual sum to be employ toward its completion may be adapt to the view of the legislature as to naval expenditure to cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all they lawful enterprise to foster we fishery as nursery of navigation and for the nurture of man and protect the manufacture adapt to we circumstance to preserve the faith of the nation by a exact discharge of its debt and contract expend the public money with the same care and economy we would practice with we own and impose on we citizen no unnecessary burthen to keep in all thing within the pale of we constitutional power and cherish the federal union as the only rock of safety -- these fellow-citizen be the landmark by which we be to guide we self

the house of representative sir : although a informal communication to the public of the substance of the inclosed letter may be proper for quiet the public mind yet i refer to the consideration of the house of representative whether the publication of it in form might not give dissatisfaction to the writer and tend to discourage the freedom and confidence of communication between the agent of the two government accept assurance of my high consideration and respect th jefferson natchez _ November 25 1802 _ the honorable the secretary of state _ washington _ sir : i have the honor to inclose you a original copy of a communication -lrb- together with a translation thereof -rrb- which i this morning receive from the governor-general of the province of louisiana in answer to my letter of the 28th ultimo i be sir with respect and esteem you humble servant william cc claiborne -lrb- translation -rrb- new orlean _ November 15 1802 _ he excellency william cc claiborne most excellent sir : i receive a few day past you excellency 's esteemed letter of the 28th ultimo in which you excellency refer to the twenty-second article of the treaty of friendship navigation and limit agree upon between the king my master and the united state of america have be please to inquire after transcribe the literal text of say article -lrb- which you find so explicit as not to require any comment nor to admit of dubious construction -rrb- if he majesty have be please to designate any other position on the bank of the mississippus and where that be if he royal pleasure do not continue the permission stipulate by the say treaty which entitle the citizen of the united state to deposit they merchandise and effect in the port of new orlean and you request at the same time that as the affair be so interesting to the commerce of the united state and to the welfare of its citizen i may do you the favor to send you a answer as early as possible i can now assure you excellency that he catholic majesty have not hitherto issue any order for suspend the deposit and consequently have not designate any other position on the bank of the mississippus for that purpose but i must inform you in answer to you inquiry that the intendant of these province -lrb- who in the affair of he own department be independent of the general government -rrb- at the same time that in conformity with the royal command -lrb- the peace in europe have be publish since the 4th of may last -rrb- he suspend the commerce of neutral also think proper to suspend the tacit prolongation which continue and to put a stop to the infinite abuse which result from the deposit contrary to the interest of the state and of the commerce of these colony in consequence of the experience he acquire of the fraud which have be commit and which it have be endeavor to excuse under the pretext of ignorance as be manifest by the number of cause which now await the determination of he majesty as soon as they can be bring to he royal knowledge besides many other which have be dropt because the individual have abscond who introduce they property into the deposit and do not extract they thus defraud the royal interest it might appear on the first view that particular case like these ought not to operate against a general privilege grant by a solemn treaty and it be a incontestable principle that the happiness of nation consist in a great measure in maintain a good harmony and correspondence with they neighbor by respect they rights by support they own without be deficient in what be require by humanity and civil intercourse but it be also indubitable that for a treaty although solemn to be entirely valid it ought not to contain any defect and if it be pernicious and of a injurious tendency although it have be effectuate with good faith but without a knowledge of its bad consequence it will be necessary to undo it because treaty ought to be view like other act of public will in which more attention ought to be pay to the intention than to the word in which they be express and thus it will not appear so repugnant that the term of three year fix by the twenty-second article be complete without the king 's have grant a prolongation the intendancy should not after put a stop to the commerce of neutral take upon itself the responsibility of continue that favor without the express mandate of the king a circumstance equally indispensable for designate another place on the bank of the mississippus from the foregoing i trust that you will infer that as it be the duty of the intendant who conduct the business of he ministry with a perfect independence of the government to have inform the king of what he have do in fulfillment of what have be expressly stipulate it be to be hope that he majesty

compose that portion of the mississippus territory which so soon as certain individual claim be arrange the united state will be free to sell and settle immediately th jefferson January 11 1803 _ gentleman of the senate _ : the cession of the spanish province of louisiana to france and perhaps of the florida and the late suspension of we right of deposit at new orlean be event of primary interest to the united state on both occasion such measure be promptly take as be think most likely amicably to remove the present and to prevent future cause of inquietude the object of these measure be to obtain the territory on the left bank of the mississippus and eastward of that if practicable on condition to which the proper authority of we country would agree or at least to prevent any change which might lessen the secure exercise of we rights while my confidence in we minister plenipotentiary at paris be entire and undiminished i still think that these object might be promote by join with he a person send from hence directly carry with he the feeling and sentiment of the nation excite on the late occurrence impress by full communication of all the view we entertain on this

both jointly or to either on the death of the other to enter into a treaty or convention with the first consul of france for the purpose of enlarge and more effectually secure we rights and interest in the river mississippus and in the territory eastward thereof but as the possession of these province be still in spain and the course of event may retard or prevent the cession to france be carry into effect to secure we object it will be expedient to address equal power to the government of spain also to be use only in the event of its be necessary i therefore nominate charle pinckney to be minister plenipotentiary and jame monroe of virginium to be minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary with full power to both jointly or to either on the death of the other to enter into a treaty or convention with he catholic majesty for the purpose of enlarge and more effectually secure we rights and interest in the river mississippus and in the territory eastward thereof th jefferson January

validity of the residue have be make the ground of further instruction to we minister on the subject of a additional article which it be to be hope will not be without effect th jefferson January 18 1803 _ gentleman of the senate and of the house of representative _ : as the continuance of the act for establish trading house with the indian tribe will be under the consideration of the legislature at its present session i think it my duty to communicate the view which have guide I in the execution of that act in order that you may decide on the policy of continue it in the present or any other form or discontinue it altogether if that shall on the whole seem most for the public good the indian tribe reside within the limit of the united state have for a considerable time be grow more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy although effect by they own voluntary sale and the policy have long be gain strength with they of refuse absolutely all further sale on any condition insomuch that at this time it hazard they friendship and excite dangerous jealousy and perturbation in they mind to make any overture for the purchase of the smallest portion of they land a very few tribe only be not yet obstinately in these disposition in order peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide a extension of territory which the rapid increase of we number will call for two measure be deem expedient first to encourage they to abandon hunting to apply to the raise stock to agriculture and domestic manufacture and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain they in this better than in they former mode of live the extensive forest necessary in the hunting life will then become useless and they will see advantage in exchange they for the means of improve they farm and of increase they domestic comfort secondly to multiply trading house among they and place within they reach those thing which will contribute more to they domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wild experience and reflection will develop to they the wisdom of exchange what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want in lead they thus to agriculture to manufacture and civilization in bring together they and we sentiment and in prepare they ultimately to participate in the benefit of we government i trust and believe we be act for they greatest good at these trading house we have pursue the principle of the act of congress which direct that the commerce shall be carry on liberally and require only that the capital stock shall not be diminish we consequently undersell private trader foreign and domestic drive they from the competition and thus with the good will of the indian rid ourselves of a description of man who be constantly endeavor to excite in the indian mind suspicion fear and irritation toward we a letter now inclose show the effect of we competition on the operation of the trader while the indian perceive the advantage of purchase from we be solicit generally we establishment of trading house among they in one quarter this be particularly interesting the legislature reflect on the late occurrence on the mississippus must be sensible how desirable it be to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river from we southern limit to the illinoi at least so that we may present as firm a front on that as on we eastern border we possess what be below the yazoo and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the illinoi and wabash to the ohio but between the ohio and yazoo the country all belong to the chickasaw the most friendly tribe within we limit but the most decide against the alienation of land the portion of they country most important for we be exactly that which they do not inhabit they settlement be not on the mississippus but in the interior country they have lately show a desire to become agricultural and this lead to the desire of buy implement and comfort in the strengthening and gratifying of these want i see the only prospect of plant on the mississippus itself the means of its own safety duty have require I to submit these view to the judgment of the legislature but as they disclosure might embarrass and defeat they effect they be commit to the special confidence of the two house while the extension of the public commerce among the indian tribe may deprive of that source of profit such of we citizen as be engage in it it might be worthy the attention of congress in they care of individual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizen as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public the river missourus and the indian inhabit it be not as well know as be render desirable by they connection with the mississippus and consequently with we it be however understand that the country on that river be inhabit by numerous tribe who furnish great supplies of fur and peltry to the trade of another nation carry on in a high latitude through a infinite number of portage and lake shut up by ice through a long season the commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the missourus traverse a moderate climate offering accord to the best account a continued navigation from its source and possibly with a single portage from the western ocean and find to the atlantic a choice of channel through the illinoi or wabash the lake and hudson through the ohio and susquehanna or potomac or jame river and through the tennessee and savannah river a intelligent officer with ten or twelve choose man fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it take from we post where they may be spare without inconvenience might explore the whole line even to the western ocean have conference with the native on the subject of commercial intercourse get admission among they for we trader as other be admit agree on convenient deposit for a interchange of article and return with the information acquire in the course of two summer they arm and accouterment some instrument of observation and light and cheap present for the indian would be all the apparatus they could carry and with a expectation of a soldier 's portion of land on they return would constitute the whole expense they pay would be go on whether here or there while other civilized nation have encounter great expense to enlarge the boundary of knowledge by undertake voyage of discovery and for other literary purpose in various part and direction we nation seem to owe to the same object as well as to its own interest to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent and so directly traverse we own part of it the interest of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional power and care of congress and that it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge of we own continent can not but be a additional gratification the nation claim the territory regard this as a literary pursuit which it be in the habit of permit within its dominion would not be dispose to view it with jealousy even if the expire state of its interest there do not render it a matter of indifference the appropriation of $ 2500 for the purpose of extend the external commerce of the united state while understand and consider by the executive

that we would so employ they as to enable they to procure there the necessary supplies of salt indeed it would be the most proper and acceptable form in which the annuity could be pay which we propose

ensue year a further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern angle of the united state have evince that the boundary establish by the treaty of pari between the british territory and ours in those part be too imperfectly describe to be susceptible of execution it have therefore be think worthy of attention for preserve and cherish the harmony and useful intercourse subsist between the two nation to remove by timely arrangement what unfavorable incident might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding a convention have therefore be enter into which provide for a practicable demarcation of those limit to the satisfaction of both party a account of the receipt and expenditure of the year end the 30th of September last with the estimate for the service of the

installment due under the british convention of January 8 1802 and two million be what have be before mention as place by congress under the power and accountability of the president toward the price of new orlean and other territory acquire which remain untouched be still applicable to that object and go in diminution of the sum to be fund for it should the acquisition of louisiana be constitutionally confirm and carry into effect a sum of nearly $ 13000000 will then be add to we public debt most of which be payable after fifteen year before which term the present exist debt will all be discharge by the established operation of the sink fund when we contemplate the ordinary annual augmentation of impost from increase population and wealth the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new acquisition and the economy which may still be introduce into we public expenditure i can not but hope that congress in review they resource will find means to meet the intermediate interest of this additional debt without recur to new tax and apply to this object only the ordinary progression of we revenue its extraordinary increase in time of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measure of safety or precaution which that state of thing may render necessary in we neutral position remittance for the installment of we foreign debt have be find practicable without loss it have not be think expedient to use the power give by a former act of congress of continue they by reloan and of redeeming instead thereof equal sum of domestic debt although no difficulty be find in obtain that accommodation the sum of $ 50000 appropriate by congress for provide gunboat remain unexpended the favorable and peaceable turn of affair on the mississippus render a immediate execution of that law unnecessary and time be desirable in order that the institution of that branch of we force might begin on model the most approve by experience the same issue of event dispense with a resort to the appropriation of $ 1500000 contemplate for purpose which be effect by happier means we have see with sincere concern the flame of war light up again in europe and nation with which we have the most friendly and useful relation engage in mutual destruction while we regret the misery in which we see other involved let we bow with gratitude to that kind providence which inspiring with wisdom and moderation we late legislative council while place under the urgency of the greatest wrong guard we from hastily enter into the sanguinary contest and leave we only to look on and to pity its ravages these will be heaviest on those immediately engage yet the nation pursue peace will not be exempt from all evil in the course of this conflict let it be we endeavor as it be we interest and desire to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nation by every act of justice and of innocent kindness to receive they armed vessel with hospitality from the distress of the sea but to administer the means of annoyance to none to establish in we harbor such a police as may maintain law and order to restrain we citizen from embark individually in a war in which they country take no part to punish severely those person citizen or alien who shall usurp the cover of we flag for vessel not entitle to it infect thereby with suspicion those of real american and commit we into controversy for the redress of wrong not we own to exact from every nation the observance toward we vessel and citizen of those principle and practice which all civilized people acknowledge to merit the character of a just nation and maintain that of a independent one prefer every consequence to insult and habitual wrong congress will consider whether the exist law enable we efficaciously to maintain this course with we citizen in all place and with other while within the limit of we jurisdiction and will give they the new modification necessary for these object some contravention of right have already take place both within we jurisdictional limit and on the high sea the friendly disposition of the government from whose agent they have proceed as well as they wisdom and regard for justice leave we in reasonable expectation that they will be rectify and prevent in future and that no act will be countenance by they which threaten to disturb we friendly intercourse separate by a wide ocean from the nation of europe and from the political interest which entangle they together with production and want which render we commerce and friendship useful to they and theirs to we it can not be the interest of any to assail we nor ours to disturb they we should be most unwise indeed be we to cast away the singular blessing of the position in which nature have place we the opportunity she have endow we with of pursue at a distance from foreign contention the path of industry peace and happiness of cultivate general friendship and of bring collision of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force how desirable then must it be in a government like ours to see its citizen adopt individually the view the interest and the conduct which they country should pursue divest themselves of those passion and partiality which tend to lessen useful friendship and to embarrass and embroil we in the calamitous scene of europe confident fellow-citizen that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral disposition toward the observance of neutral conduct that you will be sensible how much it be we duty to look on the bloody arena

small portion and with the cession heretofore make by the kaskaskias nearly consolidate we possession north of the ohio in a very respectable breadth -- from lake erie to the mississippus the piankeshaw have some claim to the country cede by the delaware it have be think best to quiet that by fair purchase also so soon as the treaty on this subject shall have receive they constitutional

disapprove by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of we territory would endanger its union but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively the larger we association the less will it be shake by local passion and in any view be it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippus should be settle by we own brethren and child than by

independent of the power of the general government i have therefore undertake on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercise suit to it but have leave they as the constitution find they under the direction and discipline of the church or state authority acknowledge by the several religious society the aboriginal inhabitant of these country i have regard with the commiseration they history inspire endowed with the faculty and the rights of man breathe a ardent love of liberty and independence and occupy a country which leave they no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflow population from other region direct itself on these shore without power to divert or habit to contend against it they have be overwhelm by the current or drive before it now reduce within limit too narrow for the hunter 's state humanity enjoin we to teach they agriculture and the domestic art to encourage they to that industry which alone can enable they to maintain they place in existence and to prepare they in time for that state of society which to bodily comfort add the improvement of the mind and moral we have therefore liberally furnish they with the implement of husbandry and household use we have place among they instructor in the art of first necessity and they be cover with the aegis of the law against aggressor from among ourselves but the endeavor to enlighten they on the fate which await they present course of life to induce they to exercise they reason follow its dictate and change they pursuit with the change of circumstance have powerful obstacle to encounter they be combate by the habit of they body prejudice of they mind ignorance pride and the influence of interested and crafty individual among they who feel themselves something in the present order of thing and fear to become nothing in any other these person inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the custom of they ancestor that whatsoever they do must be do through all time that reason be a false guide and to advance under its counsel in they physical moral or political condition be perilous innovation that they duty be to remain as they creator make they ignorance be safety and knowledge full of danger in short my friend among they also be see the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry they too have they antiphilosophist who find a interest in keep thing in they present state who dread reformation and exert all they faculty to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty of improve we reason and obey its mandate in give these outline i do not mean fellow-citizen to arrogate to myself the merit of the measure that be due in the first place to the reflect character of we citizen at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measure it be due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duty it be due to the zeal and wisdom of the character thus select who lay the foundation of public happiness in wholesome law the execution of which alone remain for other and it be due to the able and faithful auxiliary whose patriotism have associate they with I in the executive function during this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery of the press have be level against we charge with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare these abuse of a institution so important to freedom and science be deeply to be regret inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety they might indeed have be correct by the wholesome punishment reserve to and provide by the law of the several state against falsehood and defamation but public duty more urgent press on the time of public servant and the offender have therefore be leave to find they punishment in the public indignation nor be it uninteresting to the world that a experiment should be fairly and fully make whether freedom of discussion unaided by power be not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth -- whether a government conduct itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and do no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be write down by falsehood and defamation the experiment have be try : you have witness the scene we fellow-citizen look on cool and collect they see the latent source from which these outrage proceed they gather around they public functionary and when the constitution call they to the decision by suffrage they pronounce they verdict honorable to those who have serve they and consolatory to the friend of man who believe that he may be trust with the control of he own affair no inference be here intend that the law provide by the state against false and defamatory publication should not be enforce he who have time render a service to public moral and public tranquillity in reform these abuse by the salutary coercion of the law but the experiment be note to prove that since truth and reason have maintain they ground against false opinion in league with false fact the press confine to truth need no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinion on a full hearing of all party and no other definite line can be draw between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness if there be still impropriety which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be seek in the censorship of public opinion contemplate the union of sentiment now manifest so generally as augur harmony and happiness to we future course i offer to we country sincere congratulation with those too not yet rally to the same point the disposition to do so be gain strength fact be pierce through the veil draw over they and we doubt brethren will at length see that the mass of they fellow-citizen with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principle and measure think as they think and desire what they desire that we wish as well as theirs be that the public effort may be direct honestly to the public good that peace be cultivate civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved equality of rights maintain and that state of property equal or unequal which result to every man from he own industry or that of he father 's when satisfy of these view it be not in human nature that they should not approve and support they in the meantime let we cherish they with patient affection let we do they justice and more than justice in all competition of interest and we need not doubt that truth reason and they own interest will at length prevail will gather they into the fold of they country and will complete that entire union of opinion which give to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength i shall now enter on the duty to which my fellow-citizen have again call I and shall proceed in the spirit of those principle which they have approve i fear not that any motive of interest may lead I astray i be sensible of no passion which could seduce I knowingly from the path of justice but the weakness of human nature and the limit of my own understanding will produce error of judgment sometimes injurious to you interest i shall need therefore all the indulgence which i have heretofore experience from my constituent the want of it will certainly not lessen with increase year i shall need too the favor of that be in whose hand we be who lead we father as israel of old from they native land and plant they in a country flow with all the necessaries and comfort of life who have cover we infancy with he providence and we riper year with he wisdom and power and to whose goodness i ask you to join in supplication with I that he will so enlighten the mind of you servant guide they council and prosper they measure that whatsoever they do shall result in you good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation of all nation march 4 1805 fifth annual message December 3 1805 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ at a moment when the nation of europe be in commotion and arm against each other and when those with whom we have principal intercourse be engage in the general contest and when the countenance of some of they toward we peaceable country threaten that even that may not be unaffected by what be pass on the general theater a meeting of the representative of the nation in both house of congress have become more than usually desirable come from every section of we country they bring with they the sentiment and the information of the whole and will be enable to give a direction to the public affair which the will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support in take a view of the state of we country we in the first place notice the late affliction of two of we city under the fatal fever which in latter time have occasionally visit we shore providence in he goodness give it a early termination on this occasion and lessen the number of victim which have usually fall before it in the course of the several visitation by this disease it have appear that it be strictly local incident to city and on the tide water only incommunicable in the country either by person under the disease or by goods carry from diseased place that its access be with the autumn and it disappear with the early frost these restriction within narrow limit of time and space give security even to we maritime city during three-fourth of the year and to the country always although from these fact it appear unnecessary yet to satisfy the fear of foreign nation and caution on they part not to be complain of in a danger whose limit be yet unknown to they i have strictly enjoin on the officer at the head of the custom to certify with exact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respect this fever which prevail at the place from which she sail under every motive from character and duty to certify the truth i have no doubt they have faithfully execute this injunction much real injury have however be sustain from a propensity to identify with this endemic and to call by the same name fever of very different kind which have be know at all time and in all country and never have be place among those deem contagious as we advance in we knowledge of this disease as fact develop the source from which individual receive it the state authority charge with the care of the public health and congress with that of the general commerce will become able to regulate with effect they respective function in these department the burthen of quarantine be feel at home as well as abroad they efficacy merit examination although the health law of the state should be find to need no present revisal by congress yet commerce claim that they attention be ever awake to they since we last meeting the aspect of we foreign relation have considerably change we coast have be infested and we harbor watch by private armed vessel some of they without commission some with illegal commission other with those of legal form but commit piratical act beyond the authority of they commission they have capture in the very entrance of we harbor as well as on the high sea not only the vessel of we friend come to trade with we but we own also they have carry they off under pretense of legal adjudication but not daring to approach a court of justice they have plunder and sink they by the way or in obscure place where no evidence could arise against they maltreat the crew and abandon they in boat in the open sea or on desert shore without food or cover these enormity appear to be unreached by any control of they sovereign i find it necessary to equip a force to cruise within we own sea to arrest all vessel of these description find hover on we coast within the limit of the gulf stream and to bring the offender in for trial as pirate the same system of hover on we coast and harbor under color of seek enemy have be also carry on by public armed ship to the great annoyance and oppression of we commerce new principle too have be interpolate into the law of nation found neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment of nation accord to these a belligerent take to itself a commerce with its own enemy which it deny to a neutral on the ground of its aid that enemy in the war but reason revolt at such a inconsistency and the neutral have equal right with the belligerent to decide the question the interest of we constituent and the duty of maintain the authority of reason the only umpire between just nation impose on we the obligation of provide a effectual and determine opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nation indeed the confidence we ought to have in the justice of other still countenance the hope that a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more correct observance of they with spain we negotiation for a settlement of difference have not have a satisfactory issue spoliation during a former war for which she have formally acknowledged herself responsible have be refuse to be compensate but on condition affect other claim in no wise connect with they yet the same practice be renew in the present war and be already of great amount on the mobile we commerce pass through that river continue to be obstruct by arbitrary duty and vexatious search proposition for adjust amicably the boundary of louisiana have not be accede to while however the right be unsettled we have avoid change the state of thing by take new post or strengthen ourselves in the disputed territory in the hope that the other power would not by a contrary conduct oblige we to meet they example and endanger conflict of authority the issue of which may not be easily control but in this hope we have now reason to lessen we confidence inroad have be recently make into the territory of orlean and the mississippi we citizen have be seize and they property plunder in the very part of the former which have be actually deliver up by spain and this by the regular officer and soldier of that government i have therefore find it necessary at length to give order to we troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect we citizen and to repel by arm any similar aggression in future other detail necessary for you full information of the state of thing between this country and that shall be the subject of another communication in review these injury from some of the belligerent power the moderation the firmness and the wisdom of the legislature will all be call into action we ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as well as of character will produce the justice we be bind to expect but should any nation deceive itself by false calculation and disappoint that expectation we must join in the unprofitable contest of try which party can do the other the most harm some of these injury may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy where that be competent it be always the most desirable but some of they be of a nature to be meet by force only and all of they may lead to it i can not therefore but recommend such preparation as circumstance call for the first object be to place we seaport town out of the danger of insult measure have be already take for furnish they with heavy cannon for the service of such land battery as may make a part of they defense against armed vessel approach they in aid of these it be desirable we should have a competent number of gunboat and the number to be competent must be considerable if immediately begin they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season whether it will be necessary to augment we land force will be decide by occurrence probably in the course of you session in the meantime you will consider whether it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as of war so to organize or class the militia as would enable we on any sudden emergency to call for the service of the younger portion unencumbered with the old and those have family upward of 300000 able-bodied man between the age of 18 and 26 year which the last census shew we may now count within we limit will furnish a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may be want and will give time for raise regular force after the necessity of they shall become certain and the reduce to the early period of life all its active service can not but be desirable to we younger citizen of the present as well as future time inasmuch as it engage to they in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose in the bosom of they family i can not then but earnestly recommend to you early consideration the expediency of so modify we militia system as by a separation of the more active part from that which be less so we may draw from it when necessary a efficient corps fit for real and active service and to be call to it in regular rotation considerable provision have be make under former authority from congress of material for the construction of ship of war of 74 gun these material be on hand subject to the further will of the legislature a immediate prohibition of the exportation of arm and ammunition be also submit to you determination turn from these unpleasant view of violence and wrong i congratulate you on the liberation of we fellow-citizen who be strand on the coast of tripolus and make prisoner of war in a government bottom on the will of all the life and liberty of every individual citizen become interesting to all in the treaty therefore which have conclude we warfare with that state a article for the ransom of we citizen have be agree to a operation by land by a small band of we countryman and other engage for the occasion in conjunction with the troops of the ex-bashaw of that country gallantly conduct by we late consul eaton and they successful enterprise on the city of derne contribute doubtless to the impression which produce peace and the conclusion of this prevent opportunity of which the officer and man of we squadron destine for tripolus would have avail themselves to emulate the act of valor exhibit by they brethren in the attack of the last year reflect with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery display whenever occasion permit in the late mediterranean service i think it would be a useful encouragement as well as a just reward to make a opening for some present promotion by enlarge we peace establishment of captain and lieutenant with tuni some misunderstanding have arise not yet sufficiently explain but friendly discussion with they ambassador recently arrive and a mutual disposition to do whatever be just and reasonable can not fail of dissipate these so that we may consider we peace on that coast generally to be on as sound a footing as it have be at any precede time still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of we force from that sea the law provide for a naval peace establishment fix the number of frigate which shall be keep in constant service in time of peace and prescribe that they shall be man by not more than two-third of they complement of seaman and ordinary seaman whether a frigate may be trust to two-third only of she proper complement of man must depend on the nature of the service on which she be order that may sometimes for she safety as well as to insure she object require she fullest complement in adverting to this subject congress will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on the executive discretion in this case would not be by the number of seaman which may be employ in the whole service rather than by the number of the vessel occasion oftener arise for the employment of small than of large vessel and it would lessen risk as well as expense to be authorize to employ they of preference the limitation suggest by the number of seaman would admit a selection of vessel best adapt to the service we indian neighbor be advance many of they with spirit and other begin to engage in the pursuit of agriculture and household manufacture they be become sensible that the earth yield subsistence with less labor and more certainty than the forest and find it they interest from time to time to dispose of part of they surplus and waste land for the means of improve those they occupy and of subsist they family while they be prepare they farm since you last session the northern tribe have sell to we the land between the connecticut reserve and the former indian boundary and those on the ohio from the same boundary to the rapid and for a considerable depth inland the chickasaw and cherokee have sell we the country between and adjacent to the two district of tennessee and the creek the residue of they land in the fork of ocmulgee up to the ulcofauhatche the three former purchase be important inasmuch as they consolidate disjoined part of we settled country and render they intercourse secure and the second particularly so as with the small point on the river which we expect be by this time cede by the piankeshaw it complete we possession of the whole of both bank of the ohio from its source to near its mouth and the navigation of that river be thereby render forever safe to we citizen settle and settle on its extensive water the purchase from the creek too have be for some time particularly interesting to the state of georgium the several treaty which have be mention will be submit to both house of congress for the exercise of they respective function deputation now on they way to the seat of government from various nation of indian inhabit the missourus and other part beyond the mississippus come charge with assurance of they satisfaction with the new relation in which they be place with we of they disposition to cultivate we peace and friendship and they desire to enter into commercial intercourse with we a state of we progress in explore the principal river of that country and of the information respect they hitherto obtain will be communicate so soon as we shall receive some further relation which we have reason shortly to expect the receipt at the treasury during the year end on the 30th day of September last have exceed the sum of $ 13000000 which with not quite five million in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enable we after meet other demand to pay nearly two million of the debt contract under the british treaty and convention upward of four million of principal of the public debt and four million of interest these payment with those which have be make in three year and a half precede have extinguish of the funded debt nearly eighteen million of principal congress by they act of November 10 1803 authorize we to borrow $ 1750000 toward meet the claim of we citizen assume by the convention with france we have not however make use of this authority because the sum of four million and a half which remain in the treasury on the same 30th day of September last with the receipt which we may calculate on for the ensue year besides pay the annual sum of $ 8000000 appropriate to the funded debt and meeting all the current demand which may be expect will enable we to pay the whole sum of $ 3750000 assume by the french convention and still leave we a surplus of nearly $ 1000000 at we free disposal should you concur in the provision of arm and armed vessel recommend by the circumstance of the time this surplus will furnish the means of do so on this first occasion of address congress since by the choice of my constituent i have enter on a second term of administration i embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that i will exert my best endeavor to administer faithfully the executive department and will zealously cooperate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty property and personal safety of we fellow-citizen and to consolidate the republican form and principle of we government in the course of you session you shall receive all the aid which i can give for the dispatch of public business and all the information necessary for you deliberation of which the interest of we own country and the confidence repose in we by other will admit a communication th jefferson special message December 6 1805 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : the depredation which have be commit on the commerce of the united state during a precede war by person under the authority of spain be sufficiently know to all these make it a duty to require from that government indemnification for we injured citizen a convention be accordingly enter into between the minister of the united state at madrid and the minister of that government for foreign affair by which it be agree that spoliation commit by spanish subject and carry into port of spain should be pay for by that nation and that those commit by french subject and carry into spanish port should remain for further discussion before this convention be return to spain with we ratification the transfer of louisiana by france to the united state take place a event as unexpected as disagreeable to spain from that moment she seem to change she conduct and disposition toward we it be first manifest by she protest against the right of france to alienate louisiana to we which however be soon retract and the right confirm then high offense be manifest at the act of congress establish a collection district on the mobile although by a authentic declaration immediately make it be expressly confine to we acknowledged limit and she now refuse to ratify the convention sign by she own minister under the eye of he sovereign unless we would consent to alteration of its term which would have affect we claim against she for the spoliation by french subject carry into spanish port to obtain justice as well as to restore friendship i think a special mission advisable and accordingly appoint jame monroe minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to madrid and in conjunction with we minister resident there to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention and to come to a understanding with spain as to the boundary of louisiana it appear at once that she policy be to reserve herself for event and in the meantime to keep we difference in a undetermined state this will be evident from the papers now communicate to you after nearly five month of fruitless endeavor to bring they to some definite and satisfactory result we minister end the conference without have be able to obtain indemnity for spoliation of any description or any satisfaction as to the boundary of louisiana other than a declaration that we have no rights eastward of the iberville and that we line to the west be one which would have leave we but a string of land on that bank of the river mississippus we injured citizen be thus leave without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer and as to boundary each party be to take its own course that which they have choose to pursue will appear from the document now communicate they authorize the inference that it be they intention to advance on we possession until they shall be repress by a oppose force consider that congress alone be constitutionally invest with the power of change we condition from peace to war i have think it my duty to await they authority for use force in any degree which could be avoid i have barely instruct the officer station in the neighborhood of the aggression to protect we citizen from violence to patrol within the border actually deliver to we and not to go out of they but when necessary to repel a inroad or to rescue a citizen or he property and the spanish officer remain at new orlean be require to depart without further delay it ought to be note here that since the late change in the state of affair in europe spain have order she cruiser and court to respect we treaty with she the conduct of france and the part she may take in the misunderstanding between the united state and spain be too important to be unconsidered she be prompt and decide in she declaration that we demand on spain for french spoliation carry into spanish port be include in the settlement between the united state and france she take at once the ground that she have acquire no right from spain and have mean to deliver we none eastward of the iberville she silence as to the western boundary leave we to infer she opinion might be against spain in that quarter whatever direction she might mean to give to these difference it do not appear that she have contemplate they proceeding to actual rupture or that at the date of we last advice from paris she government have any suspicion of the hostile attitude spain have take here on the contrary we have reason to believe that she be dispose to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what we minister have propose and so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds of future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as western side of the mississippus the present crisis in europe be favorable for press such a settlement and not a moment should be lose in avail ourselves of it should it pass unimproved we situation would become much more difficult formal war be not necessary -- it be not probable it will follow but the protection of we citizen the spirit and honor of we country require that force should be interpose to a certain degree it will probably contribute to advance the object of peace but the course to be pursue will require the command of means which it belong to congress exclusively to yield or to deny to they i communicate every fact material for they information and the document necessary to enable they to judge for themselves to they wisdom then i look for the course i be to pursue and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve th jefferson December 11 1805 _ to the senate of the united state _ : i now lay before the senate the several treaty and convention follow which have be enter into on the part of the united state since they last session : 1 a treaty of peace and amity between the united state of america and the bashaw bey and subject of tripolus in barbary 2 a treaty between the united state and the wyandot ottawa chippewa munsee and delaware shawnee and potawatamie nation of indian 3 a treaty between the united state and the agent of the connecticut land company on one part and the wyandot ottawa chippewa munsee and delaware shawnee and potawatamie nation of indian 4 a treaty between the united state and the delaware potawatamy miami eel-river and weea 5 a treaty between the united state and the chickasaw nation of indian 6 a treaty between the united state of america and the cherokee indian 7 a convention between the united state and the creek nation of indian with the several document necessary for they explanation the senate have dissent to the ratification of the treaty with the creek submit to they at they last session which give a sum of $ 200000 for the country thereby convey it be proper now to observe that instead of that sum which be equivalent to a perpetual annuity of $ 12000 the present purchase give they a annuity of $ 12000 for eight year only and of $ 11000 for ten year more the payment of which would be effect by a present sum of $ 130000 place at a annual interest of 6 per cent if from this sum we deduct the reasonable value of the road cede through the whole length of they country from ocmulgee toward new orlean a road of indispensable necessity to we the present convention will be find to give little more than the half of the sum which be formerly propose to be give this difference be think sufficient to justify the present this subject a second time to the senate on these several treaty i have to request that the senate will advise whether i shall ratify they or not th jefferson December 23 1805 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : the governor and preside judge of the territory of michigan have make a report to I of the state of that territory several matter in which be within the reach of the legislative authority only i lay the report before congress th jefferson December 31 1805 _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i now communicate to the house of representative all the information which the executive office furnish on the subject of they resolution of the 23d instant respect the state indebted to the united state th jefferson January 10 1806 _ to the senate of the united state _ : in compliance with the request of the senate express in they resolution of December 27 i now lay before they such document and papers -lrb- there be no other information in my possession -rrb- as relate to complaint by the government of france against the commerce carry on by the citizen of the united state to the french island of st domingo th jefferson January 13 1806 _ to the senate of the united state _ : accord to the request of the senate of December 30 i now lay before they the correspondence of the naval commander barron and rodger and of mr eaton late consul at tunis respect the progress of the war with tripolus antecedent to the treaty with the bey and regency of tripolus and respect the negotiation for the same and the commission and instruction of mr eaton with such other correspondence in possession of the office as i suppose may be useful to the senate in they deliberation upon the say treaty the instruction which be give to mr lear the consul-general at algier respect the negotiation for the say treaty accompany the treaty and the message concern the same and be now with they in possession of the senate so much of these papers have be extract and communicate to the house of representative as relate to the principle of the cooperation between the united state and hamet caramallus which be the subject of a joint message to both house of congress bearing equal date with the present and as those now communicate to the senate comprehend the whole of that matter i request that they may be consider as comprise the document state in that message as accompany it be mostly original or sole copy a return of they be request at the convenience of the senate we have no letter from mr lear respect tripoline affair of later date than that of July 5 which be transmit to the senate with the treaty nor consequently any later information what step have be take to carry into effect the stipulation for the delivery of the wife and child of the brother of the reign bashaw of tripolus th jefferson January 13 1806 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i lay before congress the application of hamet caramallus elder brother of the reign bashaw of tripolus solicit from the united state attention to he service and suffering in the late war against that state and in order to possess they of the ground on which that application stand the fact shall be state accord to the view and information of the executive during the war with tripolus it be suggest that hamet caramallus elder brother of the reign bashaw and drive by he from he throne meditate the recovery of he inheritance and that a concert in action with we be desirable to he we consider that concerted operation by those who have a common enemy be entirely justifiable and might produce effect favorable to both without bind either to guarantee the object of the other but the distance of the scene the difficulty of communication and the uncertainty of we information induce the less confidence in the measure it be commit to we agent as one which might be resort to if it promise to promote we success mr eaton however -lrb- we late consul -rrb- on he return from the mediterranean possess personal knowledge of the scene and have confidence in the effect of a joint operation we authorize commodore barron then proceed with he squadron to enter into a understanding with hamet if he should deem it useful and as it be represent that he would need some aid of arm and ammunition and even of money he be authorize to furnish they to a moderate extent accord to the prospect of utility to be expect from it in order to avail he of the advantage of mr eaton 's knowledge of circumstance a occasional employment be provide for the latter as a agent for the navy in that sea we expectation be that a intercourse should be keep up between the ex-bashaw and the commodore that while the former move on by land we squadron should proceed with equal pace so as to arrive at they destination together and to attack the common enemy by land and sea at the same time the instruction of June 6 to commodore barron shew that a cooperation only be intend and by no mean a union of we object with the fortune of the ex-bashaw and the commodore 's letter of march 22 and may 19 prove that he have the most correct idea of we intention he verbal instruction indeed to mr eaton and captain hull if the expression be accurately commit to write by those gentleman do not limit the extent of he cooperation as rigorously as he probably intend but it be certain from the ex-bashaw 's letter of January 3 write when he be proceed to join mr eaton and in which he say you operation should be carry on by sea mine by land that he leave the position in which he be with a proper idea of the nature of the cooperation if mr eaton 's subsequent convention should appear to bring forward other object he letter of April 29 and may 1 view this convention but as provisional the second article as he expressly state guard it against any ill effect and he letter of June 30 confirm this construction in the event it be find that after place the ex-bashaw in possession of derne one of the most important city and province of the country where he have reside himself as governor lie be totally unable to command any resource or to bear any part in cooperation with we this hope be then at a end and we certainly have never contemplate nor be we prepare to land a army of we own or to raise pay or subsist a army of arab to march from derne to tripolus and to carry on a land war at such a distance from we resource we means and we authority be merely naval and that such be the expectation of hamet he letter of June 29 be a unequivocal acknowledgment while therefore a impression from the capture of derne might still operate at tripolus and a attack on that place from we squadron be daily expect colonel lear think it the best moment to listen to overture of peace then make by the bashaw he do so and while urge provision for the united state he pay attention also to the interest of hamet but be able to effect nothing more than to engage the restitution of he family and even the persevere in this demand suspend for some time the conclusion of the treaty in operation at such a distance it become necessary to leave much to the discretion of the agent employ but event may still turn up beyond the limit of that discretion unable in such a case to consult he government a zealous citizen will act as he believe that would direct he be it apprise of the circumstance and will take on himself the responsibility in all these case the purity and patriotism of the motive should shield the agent from blame and even secure a sanction where the error be not too injurious should it be think by any that the verbal instruction say to have be give by commodore barron to mr eaton amount to a stipulation that the united state should place hamet caramallus on the throne of tripolus -- a stipulation so entirely unauthorized so far beyond we view and so onerous could not be sanction by we government -- or should hamet caramalli contrary to the evidence of he letter of January 3 and June 29 be think to have leave the position which he now seem to regret under a mistaken expectation that we be at all event to place he on he throne on a appeal to the liberality of the nation something equivalent to the replace he in he former situation might be worthy its consideration a nation by establish a character of liberality and magnanimity gain in the friendship and respect of other more than the worth of mere money this appeal be now make by hamet caramallus to the united state the ground he have take be different not only from we view but from those express by himself on former occasion mr eaton be desire to state whether any verbal communication pass from he to hamet which have vary what we see in write he answer of December 5 be herewith transmit and have render it still more necessary that in present to the legislature the application of hamet i should present they at the same time a exact statement of the view and proceedings of the executive through this whole business that they may clearly understand the ground on which we be place it be accompany by all the papers which bear any relation to the principle of the cooperation and which can inform they judgment in decide on the application of hamet caramallus th jefferson January 15 1806 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i now render to congress a account of the grant of $ 20000 for the contingent charge of government by a act make appropriation for the support of government for the year 1805 of that sum $ 198750 have be necessarily apply to the support of the territorial government of michigan and louisiana until a opportunity could occur of make a specific appropriation for that purpose the balance of $ 1801250 remain in the treasury th jefferson January 17 1806 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : in my message to both house of congress at the opening of they present session i submit to they attention among other subject the oppression of we commerce and navigation by the irregular practice of armed vessel public and private and by the introduction of new principle derogatory of the rights of neutral and unacknowledged by the usage of nation the memorial of several body of merchant of the united state be now communicate and will develop these principle and practice which be produce the most ruinous effect on we lawful commerce and navigation the rights of a neutral to carry on commercial intercourse with every part of the dominion of a belligerent permit by the law of the country -lrb- with the exception of blockade port and contraband of war -rrb- be believe to have be decide between great britain and the united state by the sentence of they commissioner mutually appoint to decide on that and other question of difference between the two nation and by the actual payment of the damages award by they against great britain for the infraction of that right when therefore it be perceive that the same principle be revive with other more novel and extend the injury instruction be give to the minister plenipotentiary of the united state at the court of london and remonstrance duly make by he on this subject as will appear by document transmit herewith these be follow by a partial and temporary suspension only without any disavowal of the principle he have therefore be instruct to urge this subject anew to bring it more fully to the bar of reason and to insist on rights too evident and too important to be surrender in the meantime the evil be proceed under adjudication found on the principle which be deny under these circumstance the subject present itself for the consideration of congress on the impressment of we seaman we remonstrance have never be intermit a hope exist at one moment of a arrangement which might have be submit to but it soon pass away and the practice though relax at time in the distant sea have be constantly pursue in those in we neighborhood the grounds on which the reclamation on this subject have be urge will appear in a extract from instruction to we minister at

place in we negotiation with the british government appear to have proceed from cause which do not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session i may be enable to lay before you they final issue what will be that of the negotiation for settle we difference with spain nothing which have take place at the date of the last dispatch enable we to pronounce on the western side of the mississippus she advance in considerable force and take post at the settlement of bayou pierre on the red river this village be originally settle by france be hold by she as long as she hold louisiana

special order to take measure for prevent and suppress this enterprise for seize the vessel arm and other mean provide for it and for arrest and bring to justice its author and abettor it be due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transaction it be due to good order and regular government that while the public force be act strictly on the defensive and merely to protect we citizen from aggression the criminal attempt of private individual to decide for they country the question of peace or war by commence active and unauthorized hostility should be promptly and efficaciously suppress whether it will be necessary to enlarge we regular force will depend on the result of we negotiation with spain but as it be uncertain when that result will be know the provisional measure requisite for that and to meet any pressure intervene in that quarter will be a subject for you early consideration the possession of both bank of the mississippus reduce to a single point the defense of that river its water and the country adjacent it become highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security some position above its mouth command the passage of the river should be render sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessel which may be station there for defense and in conjunction with they to present a insuperable obstacle to any force attempt to pass the approach to the city of new orlean from the eastern quarter also will require to be examine and more effectually guard for the internal support of the country the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western side of the mississippus within reach of new orlean will be worthy the consideration of the legislature the gunboat authorize by a act of the last session be so advanced that they will be ready for service in the ensue spring circumstance permit we to allow the time necessary for they more solid construction as a much larger number will still be want to place we seaport town and water in that state of defense to which we be competent and they entitle a similar appropriation for a further provision for they be recommend for the ensue year a further appropriation will also be necessary for repair fortification already establish and the erection of such other work as may have real effect in obstruct the approach of a enemy to we seaport town or they remain before they in a country whose constitution be derive from the will of the people directly express by they free suffrage where the principal executive functionary and those of the legislature be renew by they at short period where under the character of juror they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary power where the law be consequently so form and administer as to bear with equal weight and favor on all restrain no man in the pursuit of honest industry and secure to everyone the property which that acquire it would not be suppose that any safeguard could be need against insurrection or enterprise on the public peace or authority the lawr however aware that these should not be trust to moral restraint only have wisely provide punishment for these crime when commit but would it not be salutary to give also the means of prevent they commission where a enterprise be meditate by private individual against a foreign nation in amity with the united state power of prevention to a certain extent be give by the law would they not be as reasonable and useful where the enterprise prepare be against the united state while adverting to this branch of law it be proper to observe that in enterprise meditate against foreign nation the ordinary process of bind to the observance of the peace and good behavior could it be extend to act to be do out of the jurisdiction of the united state would be effectual in some case where the offender be able to keep out of sight every indication of he purpose which could draw on he the exercise of the power now give by law the state on the coast of barbary seem generally dispose at present to respect we peace and friendship with tuni alone some uncertainty remain persuade that it be we interest to maintain we peace with they on equal term or not at all i propose to send in due time a reen-forcement into the mediterranean unless previous information shall shew it to be unnecessary we continue to receive proof of the grow attachment of we indian neighbor and of they disposition to place all they interest under the patronage of the united state these disposition be inspire by they confidence in we justice and in the sincere concern we feel for they welfare and as long as we discharge these high and honorable function with the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle we to they continuance we may expect to reap the just reward in they peace and friendship the expedition of messr lewis and clarke for explore the river missourus and the best communication from that to the pacific ocean have have all the success which could have be expect they have trace the missourus nearly to its source descend the columbium to the pacific ocean ascertain with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across we continent learn the character of the country of its commerce and inhabitant and it be but justice to say that messr lewis and clarke and they brave companion have by this arduous service deserve well of they country the attempt to explore the red river under the direction of mr freeman though conduct with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation have not be equally successful after proceed up it about 600 mile nearly as far as the french settlement have extend while the country be in they possession we geographer be oblige to return without complete they work very useful addition have also be make to we knowledge of the mississippus by lieutenant pike who have ascend it to its source and whose journal and map give the detail of he journey will shortly be ready for communication to both house of congress those of messr lewis clarke and freeman will require further time to be digest and prepare these important survey in addition to those before possess furnish material for commence a accurate map of the mississippus and its western water some principal river however remain still to be explore toward which the authorization of congress by moderate appropriation will be requisite i congratulate you fellow-citizen on the approach of the period at which you may interpose you authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizen of the united state from all further participation in those violation of human rights which have be so long continue on the unoffending inhabitant of africa and which the morality the reputation and the best interest of we country have long be eager to proscribe although no law you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the year 1808 yet the intervene period be not too long to prevent by timely notice expedition which can not be complete before that day the receipt at the treasury during the year end on the 30th day of September last have amount to near $ 15000000 which have enable we after meet the current demand to pay $ 2700000 of the american claim in part of the price of louisiana to pay of the funded debt upward of three million of principal and nearly four of interest and in addition to reimburse in the course of the present month near two million of 5-1\/2 per cent stock these payment and reimbursement of the funded debt with those which have be make in the four year and a half precede will at the close of the present year have extinguish upward of twenty-three million of principal the duty compose the mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of the present session consider however that they be levy chiefly on luxury and that we have a impost on salt a necessary of life the free use of which otherwise be so important i recommend to you consideration the suppression of the duty on salt and the continuation of the mediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation when both of these branch of revenue shall in this way be relinquish there will still ere long be a accumulation of money in the treasury beyond the installment of public debt which we be permit by contract to pay they can not then without a modification assent to by the public creditor be apply to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete liberation of we revenue the most desirable of all object nor if we peace continue will they be want for any other exist purpose the question therefore now come forward to what other object shall these surplus be appropriate and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those interval when the purpose of war shall not call for they shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufacture on a few article of more general and necessary use the suppression in due season will doubtless be right but the great mass of the article on which impost be pay be foreign luxury purchase by those only who be rich enough to afford themselves the use of they they patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purpose of the public education road river canal and such other object of public improvement as it may be think proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal power by these operation new channel of communication will be open between the state the line of separation will disappear they interest will be identify and they union cement by new and indissoluble tie education be here place among the article of public care not that it would be propose to take its ordinary branch out of the hand of private enterprise which manage so much better all the concern to which it be equal but a public institution can alone supply those science which though rarely call for be yet necessary to complete the circle all the part of which contribute to the improvement of the country and some of they to its preservation the subject be now propose for the consideration of congress because if approve by the time the state legislature shall have deliberate on this extension of the federal trust and the law shall be pass and other arrangement make for they execution the necessary fund will be on hand and without employment i suppose a amendment to the constitution by consent of the state necessary because the object now recommend be not among those enumerate in the constitution and to which it permit the public money to be apply the present consideration of a national establishment for education particularly be render proper by this circumstance also that if congress approve the proposition shall yet think it more eligible to find it on a donation of land they have it now in they power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income this foundation would have the advantage of be independent of war which may suspend other improvement by require for its own purpose the resource destine for they this fellow-citizen be the state of the public interest at the present moment and accord to the information now possess but such be the situation of the nation of europe and such too the predicament in which we stand with some of they that we can not rely with certainty on the present aspect of we affair that may change from moment to moment during the course of you session or after you shall have separate we duty be therefore to act upon thing as they be and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be be army to be raise whenever a speck of war be visible in we horizon we never should have be without they we resource would have be exhaust on danger which have never happen instead of be reserve for what be really to take place a steady perhaps a quicken pace in preparation for the defense of we seaport town and water a early settlement of the most expose and vulnerable part of we country a militia so organize that its effective portion can be call to any point in the union or volunteer instead of they to serve a sufficient time be mean which may always be ready yet never prey on we resource until actually call into use they will maintain the public interest while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation but much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be bring into activity if war be force upon we in spite of we long and vain appeal to the justice of nation rapid and vigorous movement in its outset will go far toward secure we in its course and issue and toward throw its burthen on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force the result of we negotiation or such incident in they course as may enable we to infer they probable issue such further movement also on we western frontier as may shew whether war be to be press there while negotiation be protracted elsewhere shall be communicate to you from time to time as they become know to I with whatever other information i possess or may receive which may aid you deliberation on the great national interest commit to you charge th jefferson special message December 3 1806 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i have the satisfaction to inform you that the negotiation depend between the united state and the government of great britain be proceed in a spirit of

the commissioner appoint by that government to resume the negotiation have shewn every disposition to hasten its progress it be however a work of time as many arrangement be necessary to place we future harmony on stable grounds in the meantime we find by the communication of we plenipotentiary that a temporary suspension of the act of the last session prohibit certain importation would as a mark of candid disposition on we part and of confidence in the temper and view with which they have be meet have a happy effect on its course a step so friendly will afford further evidence that all we proceedings have flow from view of justice and conciliation and that we give they willingly that form which may best meet corresponding disposition add to this that the same motive which produce the postponement of the act till the 15th of November last be in favor of its further suspension and as we have reason to hope that it may soon yield to arrangement of mutual consent and convenience justice seem to require that the same measure may be deal out to the few case which may fall within its short course as to all other precede and follow it i can not therefore but recommend the

constant expectation of receive such further information as would have enable I to lay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity so far as it have be act on the ohio and its water from this the state of safety of the lower country might have be estimate on probable grounds and the delay be indulge the rather because no circumstance have yet make it necessary to call in the aid of the legislative function information now recently communicate have bring we nearly to the period contemplate the mass of what i have receive in the course of these transaction be voluminous but little have be give under the sanction of a oath so as to constitute formal and legal evidence it be chiefly in the form of letter often contain such a mixture of rumor conjecture and suspicion as render it difficult to sift out the real fact and unadvisable to hazard more than general outline strengthen by concurrent information or the particular credibility of the relator in this state of the evidence deliver sometimes too under the restriction of private confidence neither safety nor justice will permit the expose name except that of the principal actor whose guilt be place beyond question some time in the latter part of September i receive intimation that design be in agitation in the western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the union and that the prime mover in these be aaron burr heretofore distinguish by the favor of he country the grounds of these intimation be inconclusive the object uncertain and the fidelity of that country know to be firm the only measure take be to urge the informant to use they best endeavor to get further insight into the design and proceedings of the suspect person and to communicate they to I it be not till the latter part of October that the object of the conspiracy begin to be perceive but still so blended and involve in mystery that nothing distinct could be single out for pursuit in this state of uncertainty as to the crime contemplate the act do and the legal course to be pursue i think it best to send to the scene where these thing be principally in transaction a person in whose integrity understanding and discretion entire confidence could be repose with instruction to investigate the plot go on to enter into conference -lrb- for which he have sufficient credentials -rrb- with the governor and all other officer civil and military and with they aid to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the design of the conspirator arrest they means bring they person to punishment and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which it should be find they be engage by this time it be know that

partly oral explain he design exaggerate he resource and make such offer of emolument and command to engage he and the army in he unlawful enterprise as he have flatter himself would be successful the general with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good citizen immediately dispatch a trusty officer to I with information of what have pass proceed to establish such a understanding with the spanish commandant on the sabine as permit he to withdraw he force across the mississippus and to enter on measure for oppose the project enterprise the general 's letter which come to hand on the 25th of November as have be mention and some other information receive a few day earlier when bring together develop burr 's general design different part of which only have be reveal to different informant it appear that he contemplate two distinct object which might be carry on either jointly or separately and either the one or the other first as circumstance should direct one of these be the severance of the union of these state by the alleghany mountain the other a attack on mexico a third object be provide merely ostensible to wit the settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the washita claim by a baron bastrop this be to serve as the pretext for all he preparation a allurement for such follower as really wish to acquire settlement in that country and a cover under which to retreat in the event of a final discomfiture of both branch of he real design he find at once that the attachment of the western country to the present union be not to be shake that its dissolution could not be effect with the consent of its inhabitant and that he resource be inadequate as yet to effect it by force he take he course then at once determine to seize on new orlean plunder the bank there possess himself of the military and naval store and proceed on he expedition to mexico and to this object all he means and preparation be now direct he collect from all the quarter where himself or he agent possess influence all the ardent restless desperate and disaffected person who be ready for any enterprise analogous to they character he seduce good and well-meaning citizen some by assurance that he possess the confidence of the government and be act under its secret patronage a pretense which procure some credit from the state of we difference with spain and other by offer of land in bastrop 's claim on the washita this be the state of my information of he proceedings about the last of November at which time therefore it be first possible to take specific measure to meet they the proclamation of November 27 two day after the receipt of general wilkinson 's information be now issue order be dispatch to every interesting point on the ohio and mississippus from pittsburg to new orlean for the employment of such force either of the regular or of the militia and of such proceedings also of the civil authority as might enable they to seize on all the boat and store provide for the enterprise to arrest the person concern and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise a little before the receipt of these order in the state of ohio we confidential agent who have be diligently employ in investigate the conspiracy have acquire sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that state and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the state to crush the combination governor tiffin and the legislature with a promptitude a energy and patriotic zeal which entitle they to a distinguished place in the affection of they sister state effect the seizure of all the boat provision and other preparation within they reach and thus give a first blow materially disable the enterprise in its outset in kentucky a premature attempt to bring burr to justice without sufficient evidence for he conviction have produce a popular impression in he favor and a general disbelief of he guilt this give he a unfortunate opportunity of hasten he equipment the arrival of the proclamation and order and the application and information of we confidential agent at length awaken the authority of that state to the truth and then produce the same promptitude and energy of which the neighboring state have set the example under a act of they legislature of December 23 militia be instantly order to different important point and measure take for do whatever could yet be do some boat -lrb- account vary from five to double or treble that number -rrb- and person -lrb- differently

state be dispatch by express to the governor and a general officer of the western division ofthe state and on the 23d of December we confidential agent leave frankfort for nashville to put into activity the means of that state also but by information receive yesterday i learn that on the 22d of December mr burr descend the cumberland with two boat merely of accommodation carry with he from that state no quota toward he unlawful enterprise whether after the arrival of the proclamation of the order or of we agent any exertion which could be make by that state or the order of the governor of kentucky for call out the militia at the mouth of cumberland would be in time to arrest these boat and those from the fall of ohio be still doubtful on the whole the fugitive from the ohio with they associate from cumberland or any other place in that quarter can not threaten serious danger to the city of new orlean by the same express of December 19 order be send to the governor of orlean and mississippus supplementary to those which have be give onthe 25th of November to hold the militia of they territory in readiness to cooperate for they defense with the regular troops and armed

be join by he troops from the sabine great zeal be shewn by the inhabitant generally the merchant of the place readily agree to the most laudable exertion and sacrifice for man the armed vessel with they seaman and the other citizen manifest unequivocal fidelity to the union and a spirit of determine resistance to they expect assailant surmise have be hazard that this enterprise be to receive aid from certain foreign power but these surmise be without proof or probability the wisdom of the measure sanction by congress at its last session have place we in the path of peace and justice with the only power with whom we have any difference and nothing have happen since which make it either they interest or ours to pursue another course no change of measure have take place on we part none ought to take place at this time with the one friendly arrangement be then propose and the law deem necessary on the failure of that be suspend to give time for a fair trial of the issue with the same power friendly arrangement be now proceed under good expectation and the same law deem necessary on failure of that be still suspend to give time for a fair trial of the issue with the other negotiation be in like manner then prefer and provisional measure only take to meet the event of rupture with the same power negotiation be still prefer and provisional measure only be necessary to meet the event of rupture while therefore we do not deflect in the slightest degree from the course we then assume and be still pursue with mutual consent to restore a good understanding we arc not to impute to they practice as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith and change necessarily the relation of peace and justice between we to those of war these surmise be therefore to be imputed to the vaunting of the author of this enterprise to multiply he partisan by magnify the belief of he prospects and support by letter from general wilkinson of the 14th and 18th of December which come to hand two day after the date of the resolution of the house of representative -- that be to say on the morning of the 18th instant -- i receive the important affidavit a copy of which i now communicate with extract

annual appropriation of money for the purpose of defense it have be conclude to combine first land battery furnish with heavy cannon and mortar and establish on all the point around the place favorable for prevent vessel from lie before it second movable artillery which may be carry as occasion may require to point unprovided with fixed battery third float battery and fourth gunboat which may oppose a enemy at he entrance and cooperate with the battery for he expulsion on this subject professional man be consult as far as we have opportunity general wilkinson and the late general gate give they opinion in write in favor of the system as will be see by they letter now communicate the higher officer of the navy give the same opinion in separate conference as they presence at the seat of government offer occasion of consult they and no difference of judgment appear on the subject those of commodore barren and captain tingey now here be recently furnish in write and transmit herewith to the legislature the efficacy of gunboat for the defense of harbor and of other smooth and inclosed water may be estimate in part from that of galley formerly much use but less powerful more costly in they construction and maintenance and require more man but the gunboat itself be believe to be in use with every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defense in the mediterranean on which be several small power whose system like ours be peace and defense few harbor be without this article of protection we own experience there of the effect of gunboat for harbor service be recent algier be particularly know to have owe to a great provision of these vessel the safety of its city since the epoch of they construction before that it have be repeatedly insult and injure the effect of gunboat at present in the neighborhood of gibraltar be well know and how much they be use both in the attack and defense of that place during a former war the extensive resort to they by the two greatest naval power in the world on a enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect shew they confidence in they efficacy for the purpose for which they be suit by the northern power of europe whose sea be particularly adapt to they they be still more use the remarkable action between the russian flotilla of gunboat and galley and a turkish fleet of ship of the line and frigate in the liman sea in 1788 will be readily recollect the latter command by they most celebrated admiral be completely defeat and several of they ship of the line destroy from the opinion give as to the number of gunboat necessary for some of the principal seaport and from a view of all the town and port from orlean to maine inclusive entitle to protection in proportion to they situation and circumstance it be conclude that to give they a due measure of protection in time of war about 200 gunboat will be requisite accord to first idea the follow would be they general distribution liable to be vary on more mature examination and as circumstance shall vary that be to say : to the mississippus and its neighboring water 40 gunboat to savannah and charleston and the harbor on each side from st mary to currituck 25 to the chesapeake and its water 20 to delaware bay and river 15 to new york the sound and water as far as cape cod 50 to boston and the harbor north of cape cod 50 the flotilla assign to these several station might each be under the care of a particular commandant and the vessel compose they would in ordinary be distribute among the harbor within the station in proportion to they importance of these boat a proper proportion would be of the larger size such as those heretofore build capable of navigate any sea and of reenforce occasionally the strength of even the most distant port when menace with danger the residue would be confine to they own or the neighbor harbor would be smaller less furnished for accommodation and consequently less costly of the number suppose necessary 73 be build or building and the 127 still to be provide would cost from $ 500000 to $ 600000 have regard to the convenience of the treasury as well as to the resource for build it have be think that the one-half of these might be build in the present year and the other half the next with the legislature however it will rest to stop where we be or at any further point when they shall be of opinion that the number provide shall be sufficient for the object at time when europe as well as the united state shall be at peace it would not be propose that more than six or eight of these vessel should be keep afloat when europe be in war treble that number might be necessary to be distribute among those particular harbor which foreign vessel of war be in the habit of frequent for the purpose of preserve order therein but they would be man in ordinary with only they complement for navigation rely on the seaman and militia of the port if call into action on any sudden emergency it would be only when the united state should themselves be at war that the whole number would be bring into active service and would be ready in the first moment of the war to cooperate with the other means for cover at once the line of we seaport at all time those unemployed would be withdraw into place not expose to sudden enterprise haul up under shed from the sun and weather and keep in preservation with little expense for repair or maintenance it must be superfluous to observe that this species of naval armament be propose merely for defensive operation that it can have but little effect toward protect we commerce in the open sea even on we own coast and still less can it become a excitement to engage in offensive maritime war toward which it would furnish no means th jefferson February 11 1807 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : i now lay before congress a statement of the militia of the united state accord to the latest

hospitality and commercial intercourse take no part in the question which animate these power against each other nor permit themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace they

principle of public law which have be establish by the reason and usage of nation as the rule of they intercourse and the umpire and security of they rights and peace and all the circumstance which induce the extraordinary mission to london be already know to you the instruction give to we minister be frame in the sincerest spirit of amity and moderation they accordingly proceed in conformity therewith to propose arrangement which might embrace and settle all the point in difference between we which might bring we to a mutual understanding on we neutral and national rights and provide for a commercial intercourse on condition of some equality after long and fruitless endeavor to effect the purpose of they mission and to obtain arrangement within the limit of they instruction they conclude to sign such as could be obtain and to send they for consideration candidly declare to the other negotiator at the same time that they be act against they instruction and that they government therefore could not be pledge for ratification some of the article propose might have be admit on a principle of compromise but other be too highly disadvantageous and no sufficient provision be make against the principal source of the irritation and collision which be constantly endanger the peace of the two nation the question therefore whether a treaty should be accept in that form could have admit but of one decision even have no declaration of the other party impair we confidence in it still anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment new modification be frame and further concession authorize than could before have be suppose necessary and we minister be instruct to resume they negotiation on these grounds on this new reference to amicable discussion we be repose in

authority of the country by habitual violation of its jurisdiction and at length by put to death one of the person whom they have forcibly take from on board the _ chesapeake _ these aggravation necessarily lead to the policy either of never admit a armed vessel into we harbor or of maintain in every harbor such a armed force as may constrain obedience to the law and protect the life and

appropriation of the last session for the defense of we seaport town and harbor be make under expectation that a continuance of we peace would permit we to proceed in that work accord to we convenience it have be think better to apply the sum then give toward the defense of new york charleston and new orlean chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection and to leave place less immediately in danger to the provision of the present session the gunboat too already provide have on a like principle be chiefly assign to new york new orlean and the chesapeake whether we movable force on the water so material in aid of the defensive work on the land should be augment in this or any other form be leave to the wisdom of the legislature for the purpose of man these

the harbor where they shall happen to be the ordinary militia of the place furnish that portion which may consist of landsman the moment we peace be threaten i deem it indispensable to secure a greater provision of those article of military store with which we magazine be not sufficiently furnished to have await a previous and special sanction by law would have lose occasion which might not be retrieve i do not hesitate therefore to authorize engagement for such supplement to we exist stock as would render it adequate to the emergency threaten we and i trust that the legislature feel the

and these post depend for protection on the strength of they garrison the principle of we government lead we to the employment of such moderate garrison in time of peace as may merely take care of the post and to a reliance on the neighbor militia for its support in the first moment of war i have think it would be important to obtain from the indian such a cession in the neighborhood of these post as might maintain a militia proportion to this object and i have particularly contemplate with this view the acquisition of the eastern moiety of the peninsula between lake michigan and huron comprehend the water of the latter and of detroit river so soon as it could be effect with the perfect good will of the native governor hull be therefore appoint a commissioner to treat with they on this subject but be instruct to confine he proposition for the present to so much of the tract before describe as lay south of saguina bay and round to the connecticut reserve so as to consolidate the

peculiar necessity to leave to themselves and to the pressure of they own convenience only to come forward with offer of sale to the united state the choctaw be indebted to certain mercantile character beyond what could be discharge by the ordinary proceeds of they hunting and press for payment by those creditor propose at length to the united state to cede land to the amount of they debt and designate they in two different portion of they country these designation not at all suit we they proposal be decline for that reason and with a intimation that if they own convenience should ever

cession which should be to we convenience jame robertson of tennessee and sila dinsmore be thereupon appoint commissioner to treat with they on that subject with instruction to purchase only on the mississippus on meet they chief however it be find that such be the attachment of the nation to they land on the mississippus that they chief could not undertake to cede they but they offer all they land south of a line to be run from they and we boundary at the omochita eastwardly to they boundary with the creek on the ridge between the tombigbee and alabama which would unite we possession there from natchez to tombigbee a treaty to this effect be accordingly sign at pooshapekanuk on the 16th of November 1805 but this be against express instruction and not accord with the object then in view i be disincline to its ratification and therefore do not at the last session of congress lay it before the senate for they advice but have suffer it to lie unacted on progressive difficulty however in we foreign relation have bring into view consideration other than those which then prevail it be now perhaps become as interesting to obtain footing for a strong settlement of militia along we southern frontier eastward of the mississippus as on the west of that river and more so than higher up the river itself the consolidation of the mississippus territory and the establish a barrier of separation between the indian and we southern neighbor be also important object the cession be suppose to contain about 5000000 acre of which the greater part be say to be fit for cultivation and no inconsiderable proportion of the first quality on the various water it include and the choctaw and they creditor be still anxious for the sale i therefore now transmit the treaty for the consideration of the senate and i ask they advice and consent as to its ratification i communicate at the same time such papers as bear any material relation to the subject together with a map on which be sketch the northern limit of the cession rather to give a general idea than with any pretension to exactness which we present knowledge of the country would not warrant th jefferson January 20 1808 _ to the

of the present government touch combination with foreign agent for dismember the union or the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of the united state from the agent of foreign government can be comply with but in a partial degree it be well understand that in the first or second year of the presidency of general washington information be give to he relate to certain combination with the agent of a foreign government for the dismemberment of the union which combination have take place before the establishment of the present federal government this information however be believe never to have be deposit in any public office or leave in that of the president 's secretary these have be duly examine but to have be consider as personally confidential and therefore retain among he private papers a communication from the governor of virginium to president washington be find in the office of the president 's secretary which although not strictly within the term of the request of

the information on the subject deposit in the public office during the precede administration as far as have yet be find but it can not be affirm that there may be no other because the papers of the office be file for the most part alphabetically unless aid by the suggestion of any particular name which may have give such information nothing short of a careful examination of the papers in the office generally could authorize such a affirmation about a twelvemonth after i come to the administration of the government mr clark give some verbal information to myself as well as to the secretary of state relate to the same combination for the dismemberment of the union he be listen to freely and he then deliver the letter of governor gayoso address to himself of which a copy be now

secretary of state and that they would be hold subject to he order these papers have not yet be find in the office a letter therefore have be address to the former chief clerk who may perhaps give information respect they as far as we memory enable we to say they related only to the combination before speak of and not at all to the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of the united state

think proper to institute in the course of the communication make to I on the subject of the conspiracy of aaron burr i sometimes receive letter some of they anonymous some under name true or false

government that which have be recently communicate to the house of representative and by they to I be the first direct testimony ever make know to I charge general wilkinson with the corrupt receipt of money and the house of representative may be assure that the duty which this information devolve on I shall be exercise with rigorous impartiality should any want of power in the court to compel

daily in the list keep for that purpose the letter i receive daily by the name of the writer and date of time and place and this have be do with such exactness that i do not recollect ever to have detect a single omission i have carefully examine that list from the 1st of November 1806 to the last of June 1807 and i find no note within that period of the receipt of any letter from matthew nimmo but that now transmit nor of any one of the date of January 1807 from john smith of ohio the letter note as receive from he within that period be date at washington February 2 2 7 and 21 which i have

presume have relate to burr 's conspiracy and have be deliver to the attorney-general i recollect nothing of they particular contents i must repeat therefore my firm belief that the letter of nimmo of November 28 1806 and of john smith of January 1807 never come to my hand and that if such be write -lrb- and nimmo 's letter expressly mention he of November 28 -rrb- they have be intercept or

jefferson by the president : jame madison _ secretary of state _ eighth annual message November 8 1808 _ to the senate and house of representative of the united state _ : it would have be a source fellow-citizen of much gratification if we last communication from europe have enable I to inform you that the belligerent nation whose disregard of neutral rights have be so destructive to we commerce have become awaken to the duty and true policy of revoke they unrighteous edict that no means might be omit to produce this salutary effect i lose no time in avail myself of the act authorize a suspension in whole or in part of the several embargo law we minister at london and paris be instruct to explain to the respective government there we disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on of which the aggression be originally found and open the way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it be allege on all side have be reluctantly obstruct as each of those government have pledge its readiness to concur in renounce a measure which reach its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutral only and as the measure have be assume by each as a retaliation for a assert acquiescence in the aggression of the other it be reasonably expect that the occasion would have be seize by both for evince the sincerity of they profession and for restore to the commerce of the united state its legitimate freedom the instruction to we minister with respect to the different belligerent be necessarily modify with a reference to they different circumstance and to the condition annex by law to the executive power of suspension require a decree of security to we commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decree of france instead of a pledge therefore of a suspension of the embargo as to she in case of such a repeal it be presume that a sufficient inducement might be find in other consideration and particularly in the change produce by a compliance with we just demand by one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the relation between the other and the united state to great britain whose power on the ocean be so ascendant it be deem not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on she rescind she order in relation to the united state they trade would be open with she and remain shut to she enemy in case of he failure to rescind he decree also from france no answer have be receive nor any indication that the requisite change in she decree be contemplate the favorable reception of the proposition to great britain be the less to be doubt as she order of council have not only be refer for they vindication to a acquiescence on the part of the united state no longer to be pretended but as the arrangement propose whilst it resist the illegal decree of france involve moreover substantially the precise advantage professedly aim at by the british order the arrangement have nevertheless be reject this candid and liberal experiment have thus fail and no other event have occur on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive be authorize it necessarily remain in the extent originally give to it we have the satisfaction however to reflect that in return for the privation impose by the measure and which we fellow-citizen in general have bear with patriotism it have have the important effect of save we mariner and we vast mercantile property as well as of afford time for prosecute the defensive and provisional measure call for by the occasion it have demonstrate to foreign nation the moderation and firmness which govern we council and to we citizen the necessity of unite in support of the law and the rights of they country and have thus long frustrated those usurpation and spoliation which if resist involved war if submit to sacrifice a vital principle of we national independence under a continuance of the belligerent measure which in defiance of law which consecrate the rights of neutral overspread the ocean with danger it will rest with the wisdom of congress to decide on the course best adapt to such a state of thing and bring with they as they do from every part of the union the sentiment of we constituent my confidence be strengthen that in form this decision they will with a unerring regard to the essential rights and interest of the nation weigh and compare the painful alternative out of which a choice be to be make nor should i do justice to the virtue which on other occasion have mark the character of we fellow-citizen if i do not cherish a equal confidence that the alternative choose whatever it may be will be maintain with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire the document contain the correspondence on the subject of the foreign edict against we commerce with the instruction give to we minister at london and paris be now lay before you the communication make to congress at they last session explain the posture in which the close of the discussion relate to the attack by a british ship of war on the frigate _ chesapeake _ leave a subject on which the nation have manifest so honorable a sensibility every view of what have pass authorize a belief that immediate step would be take by the british government for redress a wrong which the more it be investigate appear the more clearly to require what have not be provide for in the special mission it be find that no step have be take for the purpose on the contrary it will be see in the document lay before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstruct the adjustment be still adhere to and moreover that it be now bring into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the order in council the instruction which have be give to we minister at london with a view to facilitate if necessary the reparation claim by the united state be include in the document communicate we relation with the other power of europe have undergo no material change since you last session the important negotiation with spain which have be alternately suspend and resume necessarily experience a pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguish she internal situation with the barbary power we continue in harmony with the exception of a unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of algier toward we consul to that regency its character and circumstance be now lay before you and will enable you to decide how far it may either now or hereafter call for any measure not within the limit of the executive authority with we indian neighbor the public peace have be steadily maintain some instance of individual wrong have as at other time take place but in no wise implicate the will of the nation beyond the mississippus the loway the sac and the alabama have deliver up for trial and punishment individual from among themselves accuse of murder citizen of the united state on this side of

by disorderly person of they tribe and generally from a conviction that we consider they as a part of ourselves and cherish with sincerity they rights and interest the attachment of the indian tribe be gain strength daily -- be extend from the nearer to the more remote and will amply requite we for the justice and friendship practice toward they husbandry and household manufacture be advance among they more rapidly with the southern than northern tribe from circumstance of soil and climate and one of the two great division of the cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the united state and to be identify with we in law and government in such progressive manner as we shall think best in consequence of the appropriation of the last session of congress for the security of we seaport town and harbor such work of defense have be erect as seem to be call for by the situation of the several place they relative importance and the scale of expense indicate by the amount of the appropriation these work will chiefly be finish in the course of the present season except at new york and new orlean where most be to be do and although a great proportion of the last appropriation have be expend on the former place yet some further view will be submit to congress for render its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise a view of what have be do at the several place and of what be propose to be do shall be communicate as soon as the several report be receive of the gunboat authorize by the act of December last it have be think necessary to build only 103 in the present year these with those before possess be sufficient for the harbor and water most expose and the residue will require little time for they construction when it shall be deem necessary under the act of the last session for raise a additional military force so many officer be immediately appoint as be necessary for carry on the business of recruiting and in proportion as it advance other have be add we have reason to believe they success have be satisfactory although such return have not yet be receive as enable I to present you a statement of the number engage i have not think it necessary in the course of the last season to call for any general detachment of militia or of volunteer under the law pass for that purpose for the ensue season however they will be require to be in readiness should they service be want some small and special detachment have be necessary to maintain trie law of embargo on that portion of we northern frontier which offer peculiar facility for evasion but these be replace as soon as it could be do by body of new recruit by the aid of these and of the armed vessel call into service in other quarter the spirit of disobedience and abuse which manifest itself early and with sensible effect while we be unprepared to meet it have be considerably repress consider the extraordinary character of the time in which we live we attention should unremittingly be fix on the safety of we country for a people who be free and who mean to remain so a well organize and arm militia be they best security it be therefore incumbent on we at every meeting to revise the condition of the militia and to ask ourselves if it be prepare to repel a powerful enemy at every point of we territory expose to invasion some of the state have pay a laudable attention to this object but every degree of neglect be to be find among other congress alone have the power to produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defense the interest which they so deeply feel in they own and they country 's security will present this as among the most important object of they deliberation under the act of march 11 and April 23 respect arm the difficulty of procure they from abroad during the present situation and disposition of europe induce we to direct we whole effort to the means of internal supply the public factory have therefore be enlarged additional machinery erect and in proportion as artificer can be find or form they effect already more than double may be increase so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia the annual sum appropriate by the latter act have be direct to the encouragement of private factory of arm and contract have be enter into with individual undertaker to nearly the amount of the first year 's appropriation the suspension of we foreign commerce produce by the injustice of the belligerent power and the consequent loss and sacrifice of we citizen be subject of just concern the situation into which we have thus be force have impel we to apply a pbrtion of we industry and capital to internal manufacture and improvement the extent of this conversion be daily increase and little doubt remain that the establishment form and form will under the auspices of cheaper material and subsistence the freedom of labor from taxation with we and of protect duty and prohibition become permanent the commerce with the indian too within we own boundary be likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal source and will secure to they peace and the progress of civilization undisturbed by practice hostile to both the account of the receipt and expenditure during the year end the 30th of September last be not yet make up a correct statement will hereafter

enable we after meet the current demand and interest incur to pay $ 2300000 of the principal of we funded debt and leave we in the treasury on that day near $ 14000000 of these $ 5350000 will be necessary to pay what will be clue on the 1st day of January next which will complete the reimbursement of the 8 per cent stock these payment with those make in the six year and a half precede will have extinguish $ 33580000 of the principal of the funded debt be the whole which could be pay or purchase within the limit of the law and of we contract and the amount of principal thus discharge will have liberate the revenue from about $ 2000000 of interest and add that sum annually to the disposable surplus the probable accumulation of the surplus of revenue beyond what can be apply to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and safety of we commerce shall be restore merit the consideration of congress shall it lie unproductive in the public vault shall the revenue be reduce or shall it not rather be appropriate to the improvement of road canal river education and other great foundation of prosperity and union under the power which congress may already possess or such amendment of the constitution as may be approve by the state while uncertain of the course of thing the time may be advantageously employ in obtain the power necessary for a system of improvement
