produce by ted garvin carol david and pg distribute proofreader england of my heart spring by edward hutton with many illustration by gordon home mcmxiv to my friend ok introduction england of my heart be a great country of hill and valley moorland and marsh full of woodland meadow and all manner of flower and everywhere set with steading and dear homestead old farm and old church of gray stone or flint and people by the kindest and quietest people in the world to the south the east and the west it lie in the arm of its own sea and to the north it be hold too by water the water fresh and clear of the two river as famous as lovely thame and severn of which poet be most wont to sing as spenser when he invoke the first : sweete themme runne softly till i end my song or dryden when he tell we of the second : the goodly severn bravely sing the noblest of she british king at caesar 's landing what we be and of the roman conquest here within england of my heart in the whole breadth of she delight there be no industrial city such as infest ruin and spoil other land and in this she resemble she great and dear mother italy like she too she be full of very famous town scarcely to be match for beauty and ancientness in the rest of the world and they name which be like the word of a great poet and which it be a pleasure to I to recite be canterbury chichester winchester salisbury bath well exeter and she port whose name be as household word even in barbary be dover portsmouth plymouth falmouth and bristol all these she may well boast of for what other land can match they quite but there be a certain virtue of hers of which she be perhaps unaware that be nevertheless among she greatest delight : i mean she infinite variety thus she be a true country not a province indeed she be make up of many county and province and each be utterly different from other and they different genius may be catch by the attentive in they name which be kent sussex hampshire wiltshire dorset somerset devon cornwall gloucestershire oxfordshire and berkshire she variety thus lie in they and they dear and let we hope immortal difference and characteristic they genius that be which be as various as they scenery for england of my heart not only differ fundamentally from every other country of the known world but from itself in its different part and that radically thus in one part you have range of chalk-hill such as no other land know so regular continuous and tremendous withal that you might think some army of archangel -- and such might well abide there -- have throw they up as they vast and beautiful fortification be good roman and believe in the value of such thing and not as the heathen despise they these chalk downs be cover as indeed become thing so old with turf the smoothest softest and sweetest under the sun there be other hill also that catch the breath and these be those of the west they all bear the beautiful name of home as mendip quantock brendon and cotswold and as there be hill so there be plain plain uplift such as that great silent grassland above salisbury plain lonely such as the weald and the mysterious marsh of romney in the east by which all good thing go out of england as the legion go and as alas the faith go too another roman thing many hundred year ago there be also that great marsh in the west by the lean and desolate sea more mysterious by far whence a man may see far off the great and solemn mountain of another land by that marsh the faith come into england of my heart and there lie in ruin the greatest of its shrine in loving but alien hand and desolate i have say nothing of the valley : they be too many and too fair from the fairest of all through which thame flow seaward to those innumerable and more beloved where be for sure we home i say nothing of the river for who could number they yet i will tell you of some if only for the beauty of they name pass the name of all woman but ours as thame itself and medway stour and ouse and arun and rother itchen and test hampshire stream and those five which be like the finger of a outstretched hand about salisbury in the mead bourne and avon and wylye and nadder and ebble and those of the west brue which be holiest of all though all be holy exe and barle dart and taw fal under the slope wood tamar which be a eastern girdle to a duchy and camel which kiss the foot of iseult and be lose ere it find the sea of the uplifted moorland which be a part of the mystery of the west of the forest of the greenwood of the mead of the laughing coast white as with dawn in the east darkle in the west i know not how to speak for in england of my heart we take they for grant and be satisfied they fill all that quiet and fruitful land with they own joy and beneficence and be a part of god 's pleasure because of they the name of england of my heart might be but happiness or -- as for age we have name that far-off dusky arabium -- anglium felix and yet perhaps the chief thing that remain with the mere sojourner in this country of mine the true old england be that in the whole breadth of it it be one vast graveyard do you not know those long barrow that cast they shadow at evening upon the lonely downs those round tumulus that be dark even in the sun where lie the man of the old time before we we forefather do you not know the grave of the roman the mystery that seem to lurk outside the western gate of the forget city that be once name in the roman itinerary and now be nothing do you not know many a isolate hill often dark with pine but more often still lonely and naked where they lie of whom we be come with they enemy and they call the place battlebury or danesbury or for ever desert like all battlefield it be nameless if you know not these you know not england of my heart though you know those populous graveyard about the village church where the grass be so lush and green and the dead be more than the living though you know that marvellous tomb the loveliest thing in all my country where the first earl of salisbury lie in the nave of the great church he help to build though you know that wonder by the roadside where somerset and wiltshire meet though you know the beauty that be fading and crumble in the little church under the dark wood where the dawn first strike the root of the quantock hill there be so much to know and all must be get by heart for all be a part of we and of that mighty fruitful and abide past out of which we be come which alone we may really love and which hold for ever safe for we we origin after all we live a very little time the future be not ours we hold the present but by a brittle thread it be the past that be in we heart and so it be that to go afoot through southern england be not less than to appeal to something greater and wiser than ourselves out of which we be come to return to we origin to appeal to history to the divine history of the soul of a people there be a _ genius locus _ to look on the landscape we have always know to tread in the footstep of we father to follow the legion down the long road to trudge by the same path to the same goal as the pilgrim to consider the silence of the old old battlefield to pray in forget holy place to almost forget deity be to be make partaker of a life larger and more wonderful than that of the individual be to be make one with england for in the quietness of those ancient countryside be england make by the man who beget we and even as a man of the old faith when he enter one of he sanctuary suddenly step out of england into a larger world a universal country so we in the earthwork by thannington or the close of canterbury or upon the hill where battle abbey stand surely have something add to we by the genius of the place indeed pass out of ourselves into that which be england a splendor and a holiness beyond ourselves which can not die it be in such place we may best face reality for they lend to history all its poetry and as aristotle know there be more truth in poetry than in history and this at least to-day be perhaps the real value and delight of we church i mean those great sanctuary we call cathedral which stand about england like half-dismantled castle and remind we more poignantly than any other thing of all we be fain to forget there be the indelible word of we history most clearly write consider the brick of s martin 's the rude stone of the little church of bradford the mighty norman work of romsey the early english happiness of salisbury the riches and security of the long nave of winchester do we not there see the truth can stone lie or a answer be demand of they accord to folly and if a man would know the truth let we say of the thirteenth century here in england where else will he find any answer consider it then the joy as of flower the happiness as of spring in that architecture we call early english which for joy and happiness surpass any other in the world the man who carve those shaft and moulding and capital cover they with foliage could not curb they invention nor prevent they hand from beauty and joy they forget everything in they delight even the great logic of design even to leap up to god since he be here in the meadow in this garden of ours that he have give we and blest but these great building scarcely to be understand by we save by the grace of god and now a little lonely too miss so many of they sister and certainly in a alien service be how much less appealing and less holy than those village church so humble and so precious that everywhere ennoble and glorify england of my heart they stand up still for we soul before god and be to be love above all i think -- and even the humblest of they be to be love -- for the tomb they shelter within and without more than any cathedral they touch in we some profound and fundamental mystery common to we all that be the life and the energy of the christian soul they above all express england england of my heart in they we find utterance be join with the great majority and together approach in they humility beauty and quietness god who have love we all and give we england therein and thereby to serve he in delight they kneel with the hind and now as ever in the name of we lord it be enough the cathedral be haunt by the old faith and by rome whose they be : but the village church be we own nor though we be of the old faith let we be too proud to salute they humility they stand admittedly in the service of man and this at least be admirable in the church of england of my heart -- i mean she humility to she unlike rome absolute truth have not be reveal she be so little sure of anything that she will condemn no man no not one of she officer though he deny the divinity of christ she desire only to serve : and if any man even a atheist can approach the god he ignorantly deny most easily through she open gate she will not say he nay nor deny he nor send he away it be she genius let we salute its humility and so i look upon england of my heart and be certain i be of the civilisation of christ he have say ye shall not die but live -- england blossom in fulfilment he have found he church whose child we be whether we will or no and after a far wander presently shall return homeward for those word endure and will endure more living than the word even of we poet more lasting than the cliff of the sea or the rock of the mountain or the sand of the desert because they be as the flower by the wayside therefore england be not merely what we see and be it be all the past and all the future it be inheritance the field we have always plough the landscape and the sea the tongue we speak the verse we know by heart all we hope for all we love and venerate under god and there abide

winchester selborne from the hanger england of my heart chapter i the pilgrim ' road to canterbury from the tabard inn to dartford when i determine to set out once more to traverse and to possess england of my heart it be part of my desire first of all to follow as far as might be in the footstep of chaucer 's pilgrim therefore i seek the tabard inn in southwark for true delight it seem to I a journey especially if it be for love or pleasure should always have about it something of devotion something a little rigid too and dutiful at least in its opening stage and in thus determine my way i secure this for i promise myself that i would start from the place whence they set out so long ago to visit and to pray at the tomb of the greatest of english saint that i would sleep where they sleep find pleasure in the village they enjoy climb the hill and look on the horizon that greet they also so many hundred year ago till at last i stand by the blissful martyr 's tomb that have once make so great a rumor in the world and now be nothing in many way i come short of all this as will be see but especially in one thing -- the matter of time chaucer and he pilgrim be generally think to have spend three and a half or four day and three night upon the road it be true they go ahorseback and i afoot but nevertheless a man may easily walk the fifty-six mile from london to canterbury in four day i fail because i find so much to see by the wayside and to begin with there be london itself which i be about to leave it be very early on a April morning when i set out from my home come through london on foot and cross the river by london bridge it be there i linger first in the half light as it be to say good-bye i do not know what it be in london that at long last and in some quite impersonal way clutch at the heart and receive one 's eager affection at first even though you be one of she child she seem and for how long like something fall call you with the monotonous mighty complain voice of a fall archangel ceaselessly through the day the year the century and the age she be one of the oldest of european city she be one of the most beautiful of all capital she be by far the most full of character : and yet she be not easy to know or to love perhaps she do not belong to we but be something apart something in and for herself a mighty and a living thing owe we nothing and regard we whom she torture with a sort of indifference if not contempt and yet she be ours after all she belong to we be more perhaps we very likeness and self than the capital of any other people what be berlin but a brutalised village or pari now but cosmopoli or rome but a universe she be ours the very gate of england of my heart for she stand there stride the boundary of my country the greatest of we city the greatest even of we industrial city -- a negative to all the rest to the north she say nay continually for she be english the greater successor of winchester and in she voice be the soul of the south the real england the england of my heart ah we have never know she or love she enough or understand that she be a universe without the self-consciousness of lesser thing or the prepared beauty of mortal place indeed she have something of the character of the sea which be we home its changefulness its infinity its pathos in the toiling human life that traverse it almost featureless if you will she be always under the guidance of she ample sky respond immediately to every mood of the cloud and in she beauty grow up suddenly out of life and be go e'er we can apprehend it but to come into southwark on a spring morning in search of chaucer and the tabard inn be to ask of london more than she will give you it be strange see that she be so english that for she the living be more than the dead consider england southern england if you know she well enough and remember what in the face of every other country of europe she have conserve of the past in material and tangible thing -- road boundary church house and indeed whole town and village yet london have so little of she glory and she past about she in material thing that it be often only by she attitude to life you might know she be not a creation of yesterday it be true the fire of 1666 destroy almost all but apparently it do not destroy the tabard inn which nevertheless be go -- it and its successor something remain that should have be sacred not indeed from chaucer 's day but at least from that of the restoration something that be beautiful till some forty year ago all be go now of the old inn as we may see it in a drawing of 1810 a two-storied building with steepish roof of tile dormer window and rail balcony support below by pillar of stone above by pillar of wood standing about two side of a courtyard in which the carrier 's long covered cart from horsham or rochester be wait nothing at all remain the last of it be finally destroy in 1875 and the tabard inn of the new fashion be build at the corner as we see the old hostelry which besides its own beauty have this claim also upon we reverence that it represent in no unworthy fashion the birthplace as it be of english poetry owe of course all its fame to chaucer who lay there on the night before he set out for canterbury as he tell we : when that aprille with he shoure sote the droghte of marche have perced to the rote bifel that in that season on a day in southwerk at the tabard as i lay redy to wenden on my pilgrimage to caunterbury with ful devout corage at night be come into that hostelrye wel nyne and twenty in a companye of sondry folk by aventure yfalle in felawshipe and pilgrim be they alle that toward caunterbury wolden ryde the chambre and the shelter weren wyde and wel we weren esed atte beste and shortly whan the sonne be to reste so hadde i speak with hem everichon that i be of hir felawshipe anon and make forward erly for to ryse to take we wey there as i yow devyse it be in these verse lie all the fame of the tabard which it might seem be not a century old when chaucer lay there in the year 1304 the abbot of hyde near winchester buy two house here hold of the archbishop of canterbury by william de lategareshall the abbot buy these house in order to have room to build himself a town house and it be say that at the same time he build a hostelry for traveller at any rate three year later we find he apply to the bishop of winchester for leave to build a chapel near the inn in a later deed we be tell that the abbot lodgeinge be wyninge to the backside of the inn call the tabarde and have a garden attach stow however tell we : within this inn be also the lodging of the abbot of hide -lrb- by the city of winchester -rrb- a fair house for he and he train when he come from that city to parliament here then from the inn of the abbot of hyde chaucer set out for canterbury with those pilgrim many of whose portrait he have give we with so matchless a power the host of the inn at that time be harry bailey member of parliament for southwark in 1376 and 1379 he be the wise and jocund leader of the pilgrimage as we know and though chaucer speak of he last not one of the pilgrim be draw with a livelier touch than he : greet chere make we hoste we everichon and to the soper sette we anon and serve we with vitaille at the beste strong be the wyn and wel to drinke we leste a semely man we hoste be with alle for to han ben a marshal in a halle a large man he be eyen stepe a fairer burgey be ther noon in chepe bold of he speche and wy and wel y-taught and of manhod he lakkede right naught eek therto he be right a mery man and after soper pleyen he bigan and spak of mirthe amonge other thinge whan that we hadde maad we rekeninge a noble portrait in the english manner there be but one and that be want we should have prefer i mean the portrait of chaucer himself -- that wittie chaucer who sate in a chaire of gold cover with rose write prose and risme accompany with the spirite of many kyng knighte and faire lady for that we must go to a lesser pen to greene who thus describe he in he vision : he stature be not very tall lean he be he leg be small ho would within a stock of red a button would bonnet on he head from under which do hang i ween silver hair both bright and sheen he beard be white trimmèd round he countenance blithe and merry find a sleeveless jacket large and wide with many plait and skirt side of water-camlet do he wear a whittle by he belt he bear he shoe be cornèd broad before he ink-horn at he side he wear and in he hand he bear a book -- thus do this ancient poet look there be one other personage upon whom indeed the whole pilgrimage depend of whom chaucer say next to nothing but we should do wrong to forget he : i mean the blissful martyr himself -- st thoma of canterbury in old day certainly in chaucer 's we should have be remind of he more than once on we way e'er we gain the tabard for upon old london bridge the first stone bridge build in the end of the twelfth century there stand in the very midst of it a chapel of marvellous beauty with a crypt from which by a flight of step one might reach the river dedicate in honor of st thoma becket this chapel be build in memory of st thoma by one peter priest of st mary colechurch where the martyr have be christen it be this same peter who begin to build the great bridge of stone and when he die he be bury in the chapel he have erect in the midst of it such a wonder be however by no mean the only memorial here at the very opening of the way of the great and holy end and purpose of it every schoolboy know st thoma 's hospital in lambeth but not all know that the saint whose name that hospital bear be not the apostle but england 's martyr now until 1868 st thoma 's hospital stand not in lambeth but in southwark upon the site of london bridge station -lrb- footnote : the fact be still remember in the name of st thoma street lead out of the borough high street on the east -rrb- it seem that within the precinct of st mary overy a house of austin canon now the anglican cathedral of st savior southwark be a hospital for the sick and poor found by st thoma which after he beatification be dedicate in he honor but in the first year of the thirteenth century peter des roches bishop of winchester rebuild the little house in a healthier situation -- _ ubus aqua est uberior et aer est melior _ -- where the water be purer and the air better and this new house finish in 1215 of course also bear the name of st thoma of canterbury that the hospital fulfil its useful purpose we know from a petition which it present to pope innocent vi in 1357 wherein it be state that so many sick and poor resort to it that it could not support its charge not quite two hundred year later in 1539 a few day before the feast of st thoma upon December 29 it be surrender to king henry viii the infamous layton have be its visitor from the king it be buy by the city of london a rare comment upon its suppression and so notoriously useful be it that edward vi be compel to refound it and therefore in some sort it still remain to we it be curious to note that age before the hospital come to lambeth st thoma be at home there for he have a statue upon the lollard ' tower and it be the custom of the waterman to doff they cap to it as they row by it be meet and right that this pilgrimage should be begin with thought of st thoma and especially of what we owe to he for the first few mile of the way upon what we need not doubt be of old the pilgrim ' road be anything but uplift crowded though it be with memory most of they of course far later than the canterbury pilgrimage as you go down the borough high street for southwark be of course the old _ borgo _ of london and all the depressing ugliness of modern life it be not of anything so serene as that great poet of the fourteenth century the father of english poetry that you think but of one who nevertheless in the characteristic nationalism of he art in he humanity and love of he fellow-man be only second to chaucer and in he compassion for the poor and lowly only second to st thoma : i mean charle dickens no one certainly can pass the site of the marshalsea prison without recall that solemn and haunting description in the preface to little dorrit : whosoever go into marshalsea place turn out of angel court lead to bermondsey will find he foot on the very paving stone of the extinct marshalsea jail will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left very little altered if at all except that the wall be lower when the place get free will look upon the room in which the debtor live will stand among the crowd ghost of many miserable year it be still of dickens most of we will think in pass st george 's church for be it not there that little dorrit be christen and marry and be it not in the vestry there she sleep with the burial - book for a pillow but st george 's have other memory too for it be there that edmund bonner bishop of london who staunchly refuse the oath of supremacy to elizabeth be bury at midnight after he death in the marshalsea on September 5th 1569 there too general monk be marry to anne clarge these memory for the most part so unhappy have however nothing to do with the pilgrim ' way no memory of that remain at all amid all the dismal wretchedness of to-day until one come to the thomas à becket public-house at the corner of albany road this be the site of the watering of saint thoma : a-morwe whan that day bigan to springe up ro we host and be we aller cok and gadrede we togirde alle in a flok and forth we riden a litel more than pas unto the watering of seint thoma the watering of st thoma be a spring dedicate to st thoma and it come to be the first halting-place of the pilgrim it be still remember in the name of st thoma 's road close by and not inappropriately in the tavern which bear st thoma 's name it be here that the immortal tale be begin : and there we host bigan he hors areste and seyde lordinge herkneth if yow leste ye woot you forward and it yow recorde if even-song and morwe-song acorde lat see now who shal telle the firste tale no memory of the pilgrim would seem to remain at all in the road after st thoma 's water until we come to deptford the knight 's tale and the miller 's tale have fill and one would think more than fill that short three mile of road till in the reve 's prologue the host begin to speak as loudly as a king sey forth thy tale and tarie nat the tyme lo depeford and it be half-way pryme nothing more lugubrious be to be find to-day in the whole length of the old road than deptford but it be there that we begin to be free of the mean street for deptford which the pilgrim reach after they early start at half-way pryme -- any hour i suppose between six and nine -- lie at the foot of blackheath hill above greenwich : lo greenwich ther many a shrewe be inne deptford bridge the only remain landmark of old time by which we cross deptford creek have in the fourteenth century a hermitage at its eastern end dedicate in honor of st catherine of alexandrium and mass be say there continually from chaucer 's day down to the suppression in 1531 the king henry viii have previously help to repair the chapel it be at deptford as i say that we begin to leave the mean street for at the cross-road we turn up blackheath hill and though this be not in all probability the ancient way it be as near it as modern condition have allow we the old road as far as can be make out run farther to the east quite alongside greenwich park and not over the middle of the heath as the modern road do blackheath be not allude to in chaucer 's poem though it must have be famous at the time he be write for in 1381 jack straw wat tyler and they company be there gather perhaps the most famous spectacle however that blackheath have witness be not this abortive revolt of the peasant nor the rising of jack cade in 1450 but the meeting here in 1400 of king henry iv and the emperor of constantinople who come to england to ask for assistance against the ever-encroaching turk then at the gate of constantinople which some fifty year later be to fall into he hand blackheath indeed have always play a considerable part in the history of southern england partly because it be the last great open space on the southern confines of london and partly because of the royal residence at greenwich fifteen year after it have see a guest so strange as the emperor of the east it see henry v return from agincourt and the mayor of london with the alderman and four hundred citizen all in scarlet with hood of red and white greet the hero king london doth pour out she citizen the mayor and all he brethren in best sort like to the senator of the antique rome with the plebeian swarm at they heel go forth and fetch they conquer caesar in across the heath we go take the road on the right at the triangle before long to find ourselves perhaps for the first time on the very road the pilgrim follow -- the great roman highway of the watle street i call the watle street a great roman highway for that as we know it be what it be but in its origin it be far older than the roman occupation it run right across england from the continental gate at dover through canterbury to chester ford the thame at lambeth and it be the first of the british trackway which the roman straighten build up and pave it have be in continuous use for more than three thousand year and may therefore be say to be the oldest road in england it be older than the greatness of london for in its arrow flight across england it ignore the city after the ford at lambeth to-day represent by lambeth bridge a older cross of the thame than that at london bridge it mount the northern slope pass perhaps across the present garden of buckingham palace and the eastern end of hyde park where to-day it be lose or merely represent by grosvenor place and park lane to cross the great western road out of london at tyburn the original cross road the ancient place of execution close by the present marble arch and to pursue its way as we may see it still directly and in true roman fashion down what we know as edgware road that great north-western highway lie over the very pavement of the roman which lie only a few foot below the surface of the modern road it be then upon this most ancient highway that in the footstep of the briton the roman they beneficent conqueror and the english pilgrim we forefather we shall march on to canterbury the road of course be break here and there indeed in many place and notably between dartford and rochester but for the most part it remain after three thousand year the ordinary highway between the capital and the archi-episcopal city the watle street take shooter ' hill so call i suppose from the highwayman that infested the wood thereabout in true roman fashion and it be from its summit that we get the first really great view on we way for that so famous from greenwich park do not properly belong to we journey we must however turn to another and a later poet than chaucer for any description of that tremendous spectacle here indeed more than in any other prospect the road afford the horizon be change from that chaucer look upon -lrb- illustration : shooter ' hill -rrb- for we turn to gaze on london the protestant not the catholic city : a mighty mass of brick and smoke and shipping dirty and dusky but as wide as eye could reach with here and there a sail just skip in sight then lose amid the forestry of mast a wilderness of steeple peep on tiptoe through they sea-coal canopy a huge dun cupola like a foolscap crown on a fool 's head -- and there be london town don juan have get out on shooter ' hill sunset the time the place the same declivity which look along that vale of good and ill where london street ferment in full activity while everything around be calm and still except the creak of wheel which on they pivot he hear -- and that bee-like babbling busy hum of city that boil over with they scum the prospect eastward across the broad valley of the darent if less wonderful be assuredly far lovelier than that north-westward over london but from the top of shooter ' hill we probably do not follow the actual route of the ancient way until we come to well the present road down the hill eastward be say to date from 1739 only -lrb- footnote : see h littlehale some note on the road from canterbury in the middle age -lrb- chaucer society 1898 -rrb- -rrb- there be nothing to keep we in well nor indeed in bexley heath except to note that they be the first two kentish village upon we route now little more than suburban place spoil of any virtue they may have possess it be say that at clapton villa in the latter place there be preserve a ancient and perfect sacramental wafer -- perhaps a unique treasure the road run straight on through a rather sophisticated countryside almost into crayford but in prepare to cross the cray the old road have apparently be lose we may be sure however of not stray more than a few yard out of the way if we keep as straight on as maybe that be to say if we take the road to the right at the fork which later pass crayford church on the south crayford though it be anything but picturesque be nevertheless not without interest it be the creccanford of the saxon chronicle and be the scene of the half-legendary final battle between the briton here and hengist who utterly discomfited they so that we read they forsake all this valley even so we be ask to believe those strange cave which they be say to have burrow in the chalk for they retreat and which be so plentiful hereabouts but which assuredly be infinitely older than the advent of the saxon pirate the real interest of crayford however as of more than one place in this valley lie in its church this be dedicate in honor of the companion of st augustine st paulinus who become the third bishop of rochester the form of the church be curious the arcade of the nave be in the midst of it while the chancel of about the same width as the nave be possess of two arcade and divide into three aisle thus the arcade of the nave abut upon the center of the chancel arch part of the church certainly date from chaucer 's day but most of it be perpendicular in style more interesting than crayford itself be north cray and foot 's cray in the upper valley beyond bexley at north cray there be one of the best picture sassoferrato ever paint a crucifixion over the altar at foot 's cray the church besides be beautiful in its situation possess a great square norman font these place be however off the pilgrim ' road which climb up through crayford high street and then in about two mile begin to descend into the very ancient town of dartford where it be say chaucer 's pilgrim sleep they first night on the road chapter ii the pilgrim ' road from dartford to rochester the entry into dartford complete the first and it must be confess the dullest portion of the pilgrim ' road to canterbury here at dartford the pilgrim sleep here to-day we say farewell to all that suburban district which now stretch for so many mile in every direction round the capital spoil the country as such and making of it a kind of unreality very hard to tolerate the traveller must then realize that it be only at dartford he pleasure will begin dartford as one see at first sight be a old a delightful english town full of happiness and old-world memory its situation be characteristic for it lie in the deep and narrow valley of the darent between two abrupt hill that to the west of chalk that to the east of sand up both of which it climb without too much insistence between these two hill run a rapid stream from the downs to the southward that below the town open out suddenly into a small estuary or creek where the watle street ford the darent there grow up the town of dartford on the verge of the marsh within reach of the tide but also within reach of a inexhaustible river of fresh water the ford be presently replace by a ferry and later still in the latter year of henry vi by a great bridge as we see but the town have already take its name from its origin and to this day be know as dartford the ford of the darent the situation of dartford be thus very picturesque and as we might suppose its main street be the old roman highway that the pilgrim use this descend the west hill steeply after pass the priory or as it be now call the place house the first religious house which dartford could boast that the pilgrim would see in chaucer 's day this be a new foundation edward iii in 1355 have establish here a convent of augustinian nun dedicate in honor of we lady and st margaret the house become extremely popular with the great kentish family for it be not only very richly endowed but always govern by a prioress of noble birth princess bridget youngest daughter of edward iv at one time hold the office as later do lady jane scrope and lady margaret beaumont : all be bury within in the miserable time of henry viii when it be suppress its revenue amount to nearly four hundred pound a year the king immediately seize the house for he own pleasure but later give it to anne of cleve on she death it come back to the crown but jame i exchange it with the cecil family for they mansion of theobald they in they turn part with it to sir edward darcy little remains of the old house to-day a gate-house of the time of henry vii and a wing of the convent now a farm-house but considerable part of the extensive wall may be see it may well have be when the bell of that convent be ring the angelus that chaucer and he pilgrim enter dartford on that April evening so long ago as they come down the steep hill before they enter the town they would pass a almshouse or hospital midway upon the hill a leper-house in all likelihood dedicate in honor of st mary magdalen something of this remain to we in the building we see which however be later than the reformation nothing i think actually in the town can as we see it be say to have be there when chaucer go by except the very noble church he and he pilgrim look and wonder as we do still upon the great tower say to have be build by gundulph as a fortress to hold the ford which alter though it have be more than once be still something at which one can only admire the upper part however date from the fifteenth century then there be the chancel restore in 1863 the north part of which be suppose to have be build in the thirteenth century in honor of st thoma himself no doubt by the pilgrim who pass by on they way to canterbury be wont to spend a night in dartford town and certainly to hear mass in the place of they sojourn e'er they set out in the earliest morning the screen be of the fourteenth century as be the arcade of the nave and the window on the north and these too chaucer may have see but all the monument some of they interesting and charming be much later date from protestant day certain brass however remain from the fifteenth century notably that of richard martyn and he wife -lrb- 1402 -rrb- that of agne molyngton -lrb- 1454 -rrb- and that of joan rothele -lrb- 1464 -rrb- there be too a painting of st george and the dragon at the end of the south chancel chapel behind the organ within the town one or two house remain perhaps in they foundation from the fifteenth century the best of these be that on the leave just west of the church at the corner of bullis lane this house accord to dunken the historian of dartford be the dwelling of one john grovehurst in the reign of king edward iv that gentleman in 1465 obtain permission of the vicar and church-warden of dartford to erect a chimney on a part of the churchyard and in acknowledgment thereof provide a lamp to burn perpetually during the celebration of divine service in the parish church the principal apartment in the upper floor -lrb- a room about twenty-five foot by twenty foot -rrb- be originally hung round with tapestry say to be work by the nun of the priory who be occasionally permit to visit at the mansion the principal figure be in armor and two of they as large as life latterly call hector and andromache in the background be the representation of a large army with inscribed banner -lrb- illustration : dartford church and bridge -rrb- the churchyard upon which john grovehurst be allow to erect a chimney be till about the middle of the nineteenth century larger than it now be part of it at that time be take to make the road more commodious for passenger this road be of course the pilgrim ' road the watle street that this always pass to the south of the church be certain but it may have turn a little in ancient time to take the ford it turn a little to-day to approach the bridge and thereafter climb the east hill dartford bridge which already in the middle age have supplant ford and ferry happily remain to the extent of about a third of the width of the two pointed arch which touch the bank it be keep in order and repair by the hermit who dwell in a cell at the foot of the bridge on the east a cell older than the bridge for the hermit use to serve the ford here stand the shrine of we lady and st catherine of alexandrium which be much favor by the pilgrim so we may well suppose that chaucer and he friend do not pass it by without a reverence here too at the eastern end of the town stand a hospital dedicate in honor of the holy trinity but this chaucer know not any more than we may do for it be only found in 1452 it seem however to have be build really over the stream upon pier perhaps in something the same way as the thirteenth-century franciscan house at canterbury be build which we may still see dunken tell we that the steep ascent of the dover road lead towards brent be in ancient time call st edmunde 's weye from its lead to a chapel dedicate to that saint situate near the middle of the upper churchyard this chapel of which nothing remain edward iii bestow upon the priory of we lady and st margaret on its site such be the irony of time a martyr 's memorial have be erect to the unhappy and unfortunate folk burn here in the time of queen mary but dartford be too pleasant a place to be leave with such a merely archaeological survey as this it be a town in which one may be happy historically however it have not much claim upon we notice its chief boast be that it be here the first act of violence in the peasant ' revolt of 1381 occur when wat tyler break the head of the poll-tax collector who have brutally assault he daughter wat or walter -- tyler because of he trade which be that of cover roof with tile -- would seem however not to have be a dartford man at all the very proper murder of the tax-collector would appear to have be the work of a certain john tyler of the same profession here in dartford the peasant ' revolt which alas come to nothing bring we indeed quite into chaucer 's day but it would have have little sympathy from he nor indeed have it really anything specially to do with this town the true fame of dartford which be its paper-making date from the end of the sixteenth century when one sir john speelman jeweller to queen elizabeth be say to have establish the first paper-mill if dartford be poor in history nevertheless it be worth a visit of more than a hour or so for its own sake as i have say it boast of a good inn also and the country and village round about be delicious all that upper valley of the darent for instance in which lie darenth sutton-at-hone horton kirby and a little way off fawkham eynsford and lullingstone be worth the trouble of see for its own beauty and delight there be darenth for instance darne as the people use to call it only two mile from the pilgrim ' road it be as old as england and doubtless see the roman at work straighten paving and building that great way which have remain to we through so many age and which the middle age hallowed into a via sacra what can be more worthy and right than that a modern pilgrim should visit this little roman village to see the foundation of the roman building to speculate on what they may have be and generally to contemplate those origin out of which we be come and then there be the church too dedicate in honor of st margaret the dear little lady who be so wonderfully and beautifully represent in westminster abbey for all to worship she high up over the rascal politician all the village church in england of my heart be entrancingly holy and human place but it be not always that one find a church so rare as that of st margaret in darenth for not only be it build of roman rubble or brick the work of the saxon the norman and of we they successor but it boast also a arch of tufa have a early english vaulted chancel of two story and a norman font upon which be carve scene from the life of st dunstan to say nothing of a thirteenth-century tower not far away at horton kirby to be reach through south darenth be the remains of horton castle and a very interesting aisleless cruciform church of we lady with central tower a great nave arcaded transept and much early english loveliness to say nothing of the decorate tomb of one of the de ros family lord of horton castle and fifteenth - and sixteenth-century brass horton get its name of kirby in this manner at the time of the domesday survey the place be hold by auschetel de ro from bishop odo but the heir of de ros be lora lady of horton who marry into the north-country family of kirby who however have for long own land hereabouts in the time of edward i the kirby of that day roger rebuild the castle but it be not the ruin of he work we see these be of a much later building nor will any one who visit horton fail to see fawk the famous old elizabethan mansion of the london alderman lancelot bathurst who die in 1594 all this valley as i have say be use and cultivate by the roman whose work we find not only at darenth but also here at horton at fawkham however on the higher ground to the east i find something more germane to the pilgrimage for in the old church of we lady there over the western door be a window in which we may see one william de fawkham clothe as a pilgrim with a book in he hand and on one side a figure of we lord on the other the bless virgin but the goal of my journey from the highway be reach at eynsford here indeed i find my justification for leave the road while on pilgrimage to canterbury for not only be eynsford a beautiful place in itself beautifully situate but it be the quarrel which william de eynesford have with st thoma becket when the great archbishop be in residence at otford castle that lead to the murder in canterbury cathedral and the great pilgrimage which have bring even we at this late day on we way becket 's quarrel with the king and the civil power be as we know concern the liberty of the church and more particularly here a dispute as to the presentation to the church of st martin in eynsford which still retain many feature of that time after the martyrdom william de eynesford though he do not appear to have be directly concern in the murder be excommunicate and eynsford castle be leave without inhabitant for no one would enter it it fall into decay and be never after use or restore or rebuild only henry viii venture to use it as a stable but he work have be clear away and what we see be a ruin of the time of st thoma and indeed in some sort he work the ruin bear a strong resemblance to the mighty castle of rochester and though it be of course very small in comparison with that capital fortress it must have be a place of some strength when henry ii be king st martin 's church whose spire rise so charmingly out of the orchard white with spring have a fine western doorway and tower of norman work and a chancel and south transept light by early english lancet that tower certainly hear the rumor of st thoma 's murder and frightened man no doubt crowd into that western door to hear william de eynesford denounce from the altar now when i have see all this and remind myself thus of that great tale which be england i set out on my way back to dartford passing by the footpath through the park to the south-east towards lullingstone castle which however be not older in the main than the end of the eighteenth century and then from lullingstone through the shine afternoon i make my way by the western bank of the darent to sutton-at-hone where there be remains of a priory of the knight of st john of jerusalem the place be still call st john 's the church dedicate to st john baptist be a not uninteresting decorate build the last rest place of that sir thoma smyth of sutton place who be not the least of elizabethan navigator director of the east indium company interested in the muscovy trade and treasurer of the virginium company -lrb- 1625 -rrb- so i come back to dartford and on the next day set out once more for canterbury one leave dartford on the pilgrim 's road with a certain regret to find oneself at the top of the east hill face to face with a problem of the road for there on the hill-top the road fork to the left run the greater way of the two into gravesend straight on lie a lane which after a couple of mile suddenly turn southward to betsham where the direct way be continue by a footpath across swanscombe park which of these way be i to follow that question be hard to answer because the road through gravesend be full of interest while the direct way be almost barren all the way to rochester there can be little doubt too that many of the pilgrim on the way to canterbury do pass through gravesend to which town doubtless many also travel from london by water while other land there from essex and east anglium but the lane which be the straight way and its continuation in the footpath across swanscombe park be undoubtedly the line of the roman road and in all probability the route of chaucer face to face with these consideration be english i decide upon a compromise i determine to follow the gravesend road so far as northfleet chiefly for the sake of stone and there by a road run south-east to come into the roman highway again two mile or so east of swanscombe park whence i should have a practically straight road into rochester i say i choose this route chiefly for the sake of see stone this little place some two mile and a half from dartford have one of the loveliest church in all england to say nothing of a castellated manor house know as stone castle it be a common jest say reginald scot write in the time of elizabeth it be a common jest among the waterman of the thame to show the parish church of stone to they passenger call the same by the name of the ` lanterne of kent ' affirm and that not untruly that the say church be as light -lrb- meaning in weight not in brightness -rrb- at midnight as at noonday the church indeed dedicate in honor of we lady be a very beautiful and extraordinarily interesting building of the end of the thirteenth century in the same style as the practically contemporary work in westminster abbey and accord to the architect and historian ge street who restore it possibly from the design of the same master-mason certainly nothing in the whole county of kent be better worth a visit it would seem to have be build with a part of the money offer at the shrine of st william in the cathedral of rochester upon the pilgrim 's way for stone belong to the bishop of rochester who have a manor house there the nave aisle chancel and tower be all in the early english style and very noble work of they kind build in the time of bishop lawrence de martin of rochester -lrb- 1251-1274 -rrb- while to the fourteenth century belong the vestry to the north of the chancel and the western window in nave and aisle and the pier of the tower as we now see they perhaps the oldest thing in the church be the doorway in the north aisle which would seem to be norman but street tell we that this be a curious instance of imitation of earlier work rather than evidence of the doorway itself be earlier than the rest of the church within the church be delightful increase in richness of detail eastward towards the chancel where nothing indeed can surpass the beauty of the arcade so like the work at westminster bear by pillar of purbeck its spandrel fill with wonderfully lovely delicate and yet vigorous foliage here be two brass one of 1408 to john lambarde the rector in chaucer 's day the other of 1530 to sir john dew in the north aisle we may find certain ancient painting the best preserve of which represent the madonna and child the north aisle of the chancel be not at one with the church it be build in the early sixteenth century by the wilshyre family as they chantry here lie sir john wilshyre governor of calai in the time of henry viii the glass everywhere be unfortunately modern one leave stone church with regret it be so fair and yet so hopelessly dead that one be astonished and almost afraid less than a mile along the road to the north of it one pass ingress abbey where once the nun of dartford priory have a grange the present house once the residence of alderman harmer the radical and reformer of we criminal court be build of the stone of old london bridge here upon the high road one be really in the marsh by thame side but a little way off the highway to the south on higher ground stand swanscombe and it be worth while to see it for it be a very famous place after such time say lambarde quote thoma the monk and chronicler of st augustine 's abbey in canterbury after such time as duke william the conqueror have overthrow king harold in the field at battell in sussex and have receive the londoner to mercy he march with he army towards the castle of dover thinking thereby to have bring in subjection this county of kent also but stigande the archbishop perceive the danger assemble the countryman together and lay before they the intolerable pride of the norman that invade they and they own miserable condition if they should yield unto they by which mean they so enrage the common people that they run forthwith to weapon and meeting at swanscombe elect the archbishop and the abbot for they captain this do each man get he a green bough in he hand and beare it over he head in such sort as when the duke approach he be much amaze therewith think at first that it have be some miraculous wood that move towards he but they as soon as he come within hearing cast away they bough from they and at the sound of a trumpet bewrai they weapon and withall despatch towards he a messenger which speak unto he in this manner : -- ` the common of kent most noble duke be ready to offer thee either peace or war at thy own choice and election peace with they faithfull obedience if thou wilt permit they to enjoy they ancient liberty warr and that most deadly if thou deny it they ' they prevail accord to the legend and this as some say be the difference between the man of kent and the kentish man for the former retain they old liberty and be never conquer and these dwelt in the valley of holmsdale but the rest be merely _ victus _ as the old rhyme have it -- the vale of holmsdale never conquer never shall it be please with the memory of all this in one 's heart -- and upon it there be a famous song -- to come upon swanscombe church in which much would seem to be of saxon time as part of the wall of both nave and chancel and the lower part of the tower where one may see sign of roman brick the nave however at least within be late norman if not transitional and the window in the chancel be norman and early english here too be the tomb of sir anthony weldon the malicious gossip -lrb- footnote : he be the author of the secret history of the first two stuart king and of a catt may look at a king or a briefe chronicle and character of the king of england -rrb- of the time of jame i who have act as clerk of the kitchen to elizabeth he wife lie opposite he with other of he family it be more interesting for we however to note that in chaucer 's day the church be chiefly famous for its shrine of st hildefrith a soveran advocate against the vapor i leave swanscombe in the early afternoon and pass through northfleet with its great church of st botolph i follow the road with many happy glimpse of the thame avoid gravesend and make southward for the watle street which i find at last and a old inn at the cross road upon it thence i march upon what i take to be the veritable way and be presently assure of this at singlewell which it be say be originally schingle well that be a well roof with shingle of wood this well stand within the parish of ifield but so famous be it for it be know to every pilgrim that it presently quite put out the name of the parish which in 1362 be describe as ifield-juxta-schyngtedwell and to this day the place be mark on the map as singlewell or ifield a chapel be soon build beside the well and here doubtless the pilgrim pray and make offering singlewell however must not be confuse with st thoma 's well a mile further on the road which be still use and still know as st thoma 's well all this prove to I that i be indeed upon the old road and so i go on across cobham park without a thought of the great house intent now on the noble city of rochester which presently as i come over the last hill i see standing in all its greatness over the broad river of medway its mighty castle four square upon the further bank then be i confirm in my heart in the word of chaucer -- lo rouchestre stant here fast by chapter iii the pilgrim ' road rochester one come down the hill into rochester through strood on this side the medway to find little remain of interest in a place that have now become scarcely more than a suburb of the episcopal city some memory however linger still in strood of st thoma for certain folk there hate he and to spite he one day as he ride through the village they cut the tail from he horse mark now the end of this misdeed in strood thereafter everyone of they descendant be bear it be say with a tail even as the brute which perish the church of strood restore in 1812 be without interest but close to the churchyard be the site of a hospital found in the time of richard i who endow it by bishop glanville of rochester this place must have be know to chaucer and he pilgrim it be dedicate in honor of we lady and care for the poor weak infirm and impotent as well as neighbouring inhabitant or traveller from distant place until they die or depart heal those who serve it follow the benedictine rule a singular example of the hatred of these for the monk of rochester appear in the story of the fight between the monk and the hospital staff with whom side the man of strood and frinsbury a village hard by which take place in the orchard of the hospital the bishop however soon bring all to reason and as a punishment the man of strood be oblige to go in procession to rochester upon each whit-monday carry the club with which they have assault the monk -lrb- illustration : the gateway of the monastery close rochester -rrb- that strood stand on the ancient way its name assure we since it be but another form of street or strada as they say in italy from strood we cross the great iron bridge the successor of that at the strood end of which bishop glanville build a small chapel the story of the bridge be interesting we do not know that there be a bridge at all in roman time but certainly a wooden bridge be supplement in the time of richard ii by a new one of stone consist of twenty-one arch of different span this bridge stand higher up the river than that of to-day nearer indeed to the castle and as at its western end there be a chapel so at its eastern under the castle john de cobham found in chaucer 's time in 1399 a chantry for all christian soul of which some ruin remain this bridge patch altered and constantly repair last till the exist bridge be build in we own time on the site of the old one of wood from the bridge we enter the high street almost certainly lie over the old roman road here be the old inn the crown the bull and the king 's head it be even probable that chaucer may have stay at the crown the oldest of the three not of course in the present house but in that which stand on the same site till 1863 and which be say to date from the fourteenth century -lrb- footnote : the old house be famous at least as the scene of shakespeare 's henry iv pt i act ii sc i as the resting-place of queen elizabeth in 1573 and as the inn honor by mr pickwick it should never have be destroy -rrb- in rochester serene and yet active the very ancient seat of a bishopric we have something essentially roman the fortress on the watle street guard the passage of the medway precisely as piacenza be and be a roman fortress upon the emilian way guard the passage of the po the roman call the place durobriva and though we know little of it during the roman occupation of britain we may be sure it be a place of very considerable importance as indeed it have remain ever since twice in fact in we history the possession of rochester have decide a whole campaign rochester indeed could not have escape the military eye of the roman it must be remember that the natural entry into england be by the strait of dover and that for a man enter by that gate there be only one way up into england and that the line of the watle street for he must cross the thame even though he be go only to london the lowest ford upon the thame be that at lambeth which the watle street use now there be but one really formidable obstacle in the whole length of the watle street south of the thame that obstacle be the estuary of the medway which rochester guard and possess rochester then be first and foremost a great fortress just as piacenza be and be what be its fate in the dark age that follow the failure of the roman administration we do not know but with the advent of st augustine rochester at once receive a bishop it be indeed the first post in st augustine 's advance from canterbury king ethelbert himself build there a church in 597 in honor of st andrew it thus become a spiritual as well as a material fortress of its fate after the battle of hasting we know little but it submit without resistance and come into the hand of that odo of bayeaux who give so much trouble to william rufus it be now that we see rochester suddenly appear in its true greatness odo expel by william have on the conqueror 's death return and successfully obtain of rufus he estate among they the castle of rochester which he have build in 1088 however he be once more in rebellion against the crown on behalf of the conqueror 's eldest brother robert of normandy rufus strike he first at pevensey which be the norman gate of england he take it but unwisely release odo on he oath to give up rochester castle and leave the country rochester be then in the hand of eustace of boulogne swear friend of duke robert and when odo appear with the king 's guard before the castle demand its surrender he understand everything capture he own lord and the king 's guard also and bring they in rufus then turn to he english subject and demand they assistance for he baron be then as they have invariably be throughout english history against the crown which truly represent and defend the people they flock to the royal standard and after six week ' siege plague and famine ravage the garrison odo surrender and be imprison at tonbridge and later expel the kingdom as this great rascal bishop come out of rochester castle the english youth sing out rope and cord rope and cord for the traitor bishop but odo be too near to the king that be the first time we know of in which rochester stand like the gage of england the second be in the baron ' war when king john in 1215 have take rochester and notably discomfited the rascal barony they immediately invite loui of france to assist they he set sail with some seven hundred vessel land at sandwich and retook rochester which have be so badly damage that it could not defend itself forty-eight year later in 1264 henry iii be king simon de montfort come into kent burnt the wooden bridge over the medway which be too strongly hold by the loyal inhabitant of rochester for he to capture take the city by storm sack the cathedral and the priory and lay siege to the castle he fail and lewe could not give he what rochester have deny rochester castle which hitherto only famine have be able to open be to fall at last to wat tyler and he peasant in 1381 with the help of the people of the city after that culminate misery of the fourteenth century which be so full of misery rochester play little part in history for many year she appear again to take part in innumerable pageant such as that in which henry viii in 1540 and on new year 's day first see anne of cleve and be astonish at she little beauty or that which greet elizabeth in 1573 or that which greet charle i and he bride after they wedding at canterbury or that which shout for the merry monarch when charle ii ride down the high street in 1660 after he landing at dover it be he brother unfortunate and unhappy who come in without any herald and steal away in the night of December 19 1688 have foregone a throne and lose a kingdom all these siege or pageant however what be they but a tale that be tell there remain in some sort at least the cathedral this be the oldest thing in rochester and the most lasting it be found in the end of the sixth century as we have see and its first bishop be that st justus who have come with st augustine from the monastery of st andrew on the coelian hill in rome the monastery we now know by the name of the man who send they st gregory the great st augustine and st justus be not however at first receive with enthusiasm in rochester indeed it be say that fish tail be hang to they habit as they go through the city and that in consequence the people of the diocese of rochester be ever after bear with tail and be thus know as caudatus or caudiferus while upon the continent this beastly appellation be even till we father ' time apply to all english people what the cathedral suffer in the century between its foundation and the norman conquest we shall never rightly know that it be ravage burnt and sack by the dane be certain and it seem even at the time of the norman conquest to have scarcely recover itself indeed pepy who be in rochester in 1661 tell we that he find the western door of the church still cover with the skin of danes nor do it fare much better when odo of bayeaux be lord but when gundulph the associate of the good and great lanfranc become bishop in 1077 the cathedral be almost entirely re-establish and the priory which serve it rebuilt gundulph however would have nothing to do with the secular who have hitherto serve the great church he establish benedictine monk in they place and ernulph prior of canterbury where lanfranc have do the same succeed he of the saxon church which st justus build he and he successor nothing remain but the foundation discover in 1888 this church which be very small about forty-two foot long by twenty-eight foot in breadth be furnish with a apse but have neither aisle nor transept of the first norman church which bishop gundulph build very little remain perhaps a part of the crypt the nave and the great fortress tower he build on the north side of the church this church be a very curious piece of norman building it be a long aisled church that be unbroken from end to end but the choir-proper be shut off from its aisle by wall of stone as at st alban there be no transept or central tower but two porch one on the north and the other on the south and in the angle form by they with the choir gundulph build tower one a belfry the other a fortress detach from the church to the south of the nave stand the first monastery and it be there that we may still see fragment five arch in all of gundulph 's nave it be ernulph who build the second monastery to replace the probably wooden building of the first to the south of the choir of which part remain to we this do he turn to the cathedral and begin entirely to rebuild it recase it with caen stone or to remodel what he leave it be therefore twelfth century norman work we see at rochester all this work however some of it not twenty-five year old be damage in 1179 by fire and once more the monk begin to rebuild they church they seem to have begin on the north aisle of the choir and then to have set to work on the south aisle thence they proceed to rebuild the eastern end of the church erect a transept beyond the old choir finish they new sanctuary in 1227 the work do not stop there however by 1245 the north-west transept be finish and by 1280 the south-west and the two eastern bay of the nave it be astonishing to find the monastery able to support such immense and extravagant operation but we know that in 1201 the monk have successfully establish a new shrine in they church the shrine of st william this popular sanctuary be the tomb of a scotch pilgrim from perth who have be a baker in charity he be so abundant that he give to the poor the tenth loaf of he workmanship in zeal so fervent that in vow he promise and in deed attempt to visit the place where christ be conversant on earth in which journey he make rochester he way where after he have rest two or three day he depart towards canterbury but ere he have go far from the city he servant -- a foundling who have be bring up by he out of charity -- lead he of purpose out of the highway and spoil he both of he money and he life the servant escape but he master because he die in so holy a purpose of mind be by the monk convey to st andrew and lay in the choir and soon he work miracle plentifully the enormous fame of st william and the popularity of he shrine not only with those who be on the way to canterbury but with such as be merely traveller to the coast last for nearly a hundred year enrich the monk of rochester by the end of the thirteenth century however this shrine of st william have be utterly eclipse by the fame of the shrine of st thoma for this reason then the monk of rochester be happily never able to rebuild they nave which remain a norman work of the twelfth century in the fourteenth century the central tower be at last complete but it cease to exist in 1749 indeed the resource of rochester seem to have be small after the third quarter of the thirteenth century they have no lady chapel and when one be provide it be contrived out of the south-west transept later the north aisle of the choir always dark on account of gundulph 's tower be heighten and vault and light with window later still similar perpendicular window be place in the old nave the norman clerestory be destroy

escape they attention neither the beautiful decorate tomb of bishop walter de merton -lrb- 1278 -rrb- nor that of bishop john de sheppey -lrb- 1360 -rrb- the best thing leave to we in the cathedral and that which give it its character be the great western doorway with its sombre norman carve of the earlier part of the twelfth century the nave be also beautiful and the crypt be undoubtedly one of the most interesting monument leave in england of the priory practically nothing remain but a few fragment -lrb- illustration : rochester -rrb- doubtless chaucer and he company do not leave the great church unvisited nor fail to look curiously nor perhaps to pray at the shrine of st william for they too be traveller and pilgrim but the spectacle in the little city which it might seem most fill they imagination as it do ours be not the cathedral at all but the great keep which stand above it frown across the busy medway nothing more impose of its kind than this great norman castle remain in england have a base of seventy foot square and consist of wall twelve foot thick and one hundred and twenty foot high it still seem what in fact it be almost impregnable by any arm but those of the modern world its great weakness lay always in the matter of provision but it be perfectly supply with water by means of a well sixty foot under ground in which stand always ten foot of water from this well a stone pipe or tunnel two foot nine inch in diameter lead up to the very roof access to it be give on each of the four floor into which the keep be divide within these apartment one and all be divide from east to west by wall five foot thick so that on each floor there be two chamber forty-six foot long by about twenty foot in breadth that this enormous keep be the work of gundulph and contemporary with the tower of london there seem to be no reason to doubt of the great part it play in english history i have already speak but even in ruin it impress one as few thing leave to we nowadays when everything we make be so monstrous in comparison with the work of we father be able to do to stand there on the platform a hundred and twenty foot in the air and look out over the medway crowd with shipping ringing echo with factory on either shore to see the great ship in the tideway and the fog and smoke of chatham and its dockyard down the stream be to receive a impression of the fragile but tremendous greatness of we civilisation such as few other place in south england would be able to give we suddenly between two heart beat such a vision of feverish and yet noble energy and endeavor wholly material if you will and seemingly unaware of any world or life but this be altogether alien from rochester itself where a old fashion leisure a air almost georgian linger yet indeed one expect to meet mr pickwick in the high street or at least charle dickens come in from gadshill the only mood that have quite pass from rochester and that be yet more securely crystallise there in the cathedral and the castle than any other be that of the middle age you will not find it in any of the church now nor in any inn that be leave to we nor in the house often both interesting and charming all day long rochester expect the coach and not the pilgrim but at night under a windy sky if you wander up the hill and linger about the cathedral in the shadow of the great keep while the moon reel steeply up the heaven you may in early spring at any rate return for a little to that age which build such thing as these so that they have outlast everything that have follow they and put it under they foot and yet they heart be set upon no such victory but in the heaven it be the great and self-forgetting act of a obscure baker but a saint of god that build the mighty half abandon church we see at rochester nor be he for sure altogether forget when all england go by to kneel and to pray beside becket 's shrine at canterbury raise there in a heavenly cause which must prevail in the end though neither rochester nor canterbury to-day might seem to bear out any such certainty the modern pilgrim know what he know will be fain to remember at rochester on he way to st thoma one

christ have found long ago upon the rock of peter in that same cause die bless john fisher the last catholic bishop of rochester in the year 1535 he be almost the first of henry 's victim and he be

pope he accomplice in put away he lawful wife in order that he might marry anne boleyn because the pope refuse to aid he in this crime henry destroy the catholic church in england and he and he

heaven of which david sing to which st john look forth from patmo and of which these we saint have tell we chapter iv the pilgrim ' road rochester to faversham the old road leave rochester to pass through chatham and be by no means delightful until it have leave what camden call the best appoint arsenal the world ever see chatham indeed be little else but a huge dockyard and a long and dirty street once the pilgrim 's way there be however very little to detain we only the chapel of st bartholomew to the south of the high street be worth a visit for bishop gundulph 's sake for he found it even here however only the eastern end be ancient the parish church of we lady be for the most part rebuilt in 1788 but it still keep a good norman door to the south of the nave it be here that we lady have in chaucer 's day a very famous shrine concern which the follow rather gruesome legend be tell the body of a man no doubt a criminal or suicide have be cast upon the beach in this parish be bury here in the churchyard we lady of chatham however be offend thereby and by night go herself to the house of the clerk and awaken he and when he would all tremble know wherefor she be come she answer that near to she shrine a unshriven and sinful person have be lay which thing offend she for he do naught but grin in ghastly fashion therefore unless he be remove she herself must withdraw from that place the clerk arise hurriedly we may be sure and go with we lady along towards the church it happen that she grow weary and rest in a bush or tree by the wayside and ever after this bush be green all the winter through but the clerk go on dig up the body and fling it back into the water from which it have so lately be draw now as to this story all i have to say of it be that i do not believe a word of it not because i be blind by any sentimentalism of to-day which as in a child 's story bring all right for everyone in the end but for this very cogent reason that of all create being we lady be the most merciful loving and tender -- refugium peccatorum also i know a better story for it be say that one day we lord be walk with sampietro in paradise as the padrone may do with he fattore when after a while he say not as complain exactly but as state a fact sampietro this place be go down here sampietro who be always impetuous and know very well what he mean dare to interrupt il santissimo can not blame I say he huffily il santissimo do not suppose they all come in by the gate _ che che _ not come in by the gate sampietro what do you mean say we lord if il santissimo will but step this way round by these bush say sampietro he shall see and there sure enough he see for there be we lady draw we all up helter-skelter pell-mell willy-nilly into heaven in a great bucket to we great gain and undeserved good o clemen o pium o dulcis virgo maria the road between chatham and sittingbourne might seem to be unquestionably that by which the pilgrim ride and as certainly the roman highway it be however rather barren of mediaeval interest little be leave to we older than the change of religion at rainham we have a church however dedicate in honor of st margaret part of which date from the thirteenth century though in the main it be a perpendicular building within be two ornament of the late seventeenth century and two brass one to william bloor who die in 1529 and the other to john norden who die in 1580 and to he four wife as for william bloor there be a local story of some relation of he christopher bloor by name and of a nightly journey on a coach drive by a headless coachman beside whom sit a headless footman and all draw by headless horse christopher himself sit within he head in he hand so much i hear but i could not find out what it portend or refer to but it be not till we come into newington that we find any sign or memory of st thoma or the pilgrimage this village however become famous as a station for the pilgrim because on he last journey from london to canterbury the great archbishop here administer the rite of confirmation a cross be erect to commemorate this event and there the pilgrim kneel to pray but newington in st thoma 's day be better know on account of a great scandal involve the name of the convent there this convent be hold of the king of he manor of middleton we read that diver of the nun be warped with a malicious desire of revenge take advantage of the night and strangle the lady abbess who be the object of they fury and passionate animosity in she bed and after to conceal so execrable a assassination throw she body into a pit which afterwards contract the traditional appellation of nun-pit -lrb- footnote : philipott villare cantianum quote by littlehale _ op cit _ p 27 -rrb- now whether this tale be true or a invention to explain the queer name nun-pit we shall never know but as it happen we do know that the nun be remove to the isle of sheppey and that st thoma persuade king henry ii to establish at newington a small house of seven secular canon to whom be give the whole manor but curiously enough one of these canon be presently find murder at the hand of four of he brethren exactly where this convent be situate would seem to be doubtful what evidence there be point to nunfield farm at chesley about a mile to the south of the high road newington itself in its cherry-orchard be a pretty place enough to - day with a interesting if restore church of we lady in part of the thirteenth but mainly of the fourteenth century it be a fine building with charming carve detail and at least four brass one of the end of the fifteenth century -lrb- 1488 -rrb- to william monde two of the sixteenth century -lrb- 1510 and 1581 -rrb- and one of the year 1600 there be nothing however in the place to delay anyone for long and the modern pilgrim will soon find himself once more on the great road on come out of newington such a one will find himself in about a mile at key street where be the fourwent way in other word the cross road where the highway from the isle of sheppey to maidstone cross the pilgrim way here of old stand a chapel of st christopher or another at which the pilgrim pray and remember this i too at the cross road though there be no chapel pray in the word of the prayer which begin : st christopher who bear we lord across the flood -- o precious load so i prayed er i come to sidingborne as chaucer say the author of sittingbourne in the middle age tell we that mediaeval sittingbourne consist of three distinct portion the chief center of population be near the church but there be a important little hamlet call schamel at the western extremity of the parish on the london road as any traveller from london approach sittingbourne in the middle age the first thing to attract he attention be a chapel and hermitage standing on the south side of the road about three part of the way up that little hill which rise from waterlanehead towards the east this be schamel hermitage and the chapel of st thoma becket to which be attach house for the shelter of pilgrim and traveller a small inn call the volunteer now stand upon or close to the site of this ancient chapel and this hermitage the chapel and hermitage it seem be first build at schamel in the time of king john when they be occupy by a priest name samuel he say mass daily in the chapel and give such accommodation as he have to wayfarer by whose alms he live after he death the chapel fall into disrepair but in the time of henry iii it be rebuild on a larger scale a hermit name silvester of the order of st austin be appoint to the house which have now attach to it four lodgings for pilgrim on the road to canterbury but on silvester 's death it be realize that the chapel interfere so much with the parish church that before the end of the thirteenth century it be suppress it re-arose and in chaucer 's day would seem to have be in a flourishing condition at any rate it continue till the spoliation if indeed chaucer and he pilgrim sleep in sittingbourne as one may well believe it be probable that they sleep either at this chapel at schamel or at the lion inn in the town this inn be certainly in existence in he time and there in 1415 king henry v be entertain on he return from agincourt by the squire of milton there too in all likelihood cardinal wolsey rest in the autumn of 1514 and there henry viii who spoil the face of england and change she heart pai the wife of the lyon in sittingbourne by way of rewarde iiii viiid for the accommodation give this famous inn stand in the center of the town the road pass to the south of it unhappily the church be less interesting have be almost entirely rebuild in 1762 but close by it be some old house which apparently once form part of another old inn call the white hart certainly much of the town must have be devote to the entertainment of traveller from sittingbourne i wander out to borden lovely in itself and in its situation upon the rise ground under the north downs it possess a very fine church with a low norman tower and western door of the same date within be a very nobly carve norman arch under the belfry if schamel be as it be the western part of sittingbourne with its chapel and hermitage swanstree be the eastern part and it too have its chapel of st cross and its hospital of st leonard there be however this difference that whereas the priest and people of sittingbourne do all they could to suppress the chapel and hermitage of schamel they on the contrary do all they could to encourage the chapel and hospital of swanstree why because pilgrim come from london or the north with full pocket towards canterbury would reach schamel _ before _ pass through sittingbourne but swanstree only _ after _ pass through the town follow the pilgrim 's road out of sittingbourne one soon come to bapchild where at the exit from the village on the north side of the road of old stand a oratory and a leper 's hospital of which nothing seem really to be know save that it be found about the year 1200 accord to canon scott-robertson it be dedicate in honor of st jame which be a curious dedication for a leper house but common enough in a hospital for pilgrim oratory and hospital have alike disappear but close by the place where they stand there still remain st thoma 's well now know as spring head or spring so i go on through radfield where of old be a wayside chapel and green street to the inn at ospringe pass half a mile away to the north stone farm and nearer the road the ruin of stone chapel another of those little wayside oratory still so common in italy and france but which nowadays in england we lack altogether ospringe itself be a interesting place to begin with the very ancient inn by the roadside together with the equally old house opposite be once accord to hast the historian of kent a hospital found by henry ii for the benefit especially of pilgrim this hospital he tell we be dedicate to the bless virgin and be under the management of a master three brethren and two clerk exist till the time of edward iv henry viii have seize by force all such property as this in england give this hospital to st john 's college in cambridge which still own it to the loss of we poor traveller no doubt what money come to the college from this poor place go to the support and bolster up of the great tudor myth upon the general acceptance of which most of the vested interest in england largely depend but let we poor man lift up we heart the great tudor myth be pass and every day it be become more evident that it can be support very little longer let we determine however that we will not be take in again and under the pretence of a reformation of religion fix upon we neck a new political despotism worse than the whig and protestant aristocracy that the sixteenth century bring into be to the irreparable damage of the crown and the unspeakable loss of we the commonalty may st thoma avert a evil only too likely to befall we as for ospringe however it be after all in some sort royal property the crown have anciently a camera regi there for the king 's use when he be on he way to canterbury or to france at ospringe i leave the great road to visit davington and to sleep at faversham the long spring day be already draw in when i come into davington as delightful and charming a little place as be to be find anywhere along the great road upon a hill-top there perhaps the roman have a temple or a villa at any rate they call the place durolevum and so it stand in the antonine _ itinerary _ there be evidence too that the site be not abandon when with the failure of they administration and the final departure of the legion there go down the long road we youth and hope where the present church stand in part a norman building there be probably a saxon chapel then in 1153 come fulke de newenham and found here and build a benedictine nunnery in honor of st mary magdalen that the house be never richly endowed nor large at all we may know from that name it have -- the house of the poor nun of davington we know however very little about they or it but its poverty do not save it of course at the dissolution the priory be then turn into a manor house and this in part remain so that we find there a part of the cloister of the time of edward i and other remains of edward iii 's time then in elizabeth 's day the house seem to have be practically rebuild as for the little church it owe all it be to-day to its late owner and historian mr willement and though it be not in itself of very great interest it serve as a memorial of he enthusiasm and love davington be less than a mile out of the town of faversham and therefore it be not quite dark when i make my way into that famous place faversham must always have be a important place from its position with regard to the great road we have see how the source of the greatness of rochester lay in its position upon the watle street where that great highway cross the medway faversham have half rochester 's fortune for it stand where the road touch a arm or creek of the swale that important navigable waterway a arm of the sea which separate sheppey from the mainland the swale there serve the road and make of faversham a port but the road do not cross it and therefore the swale unlike the medway be never a obstacle or a defense thus faversham never become a great fortress like rochester it be a port and as it happen a royal villa where so long ago as 930 athelstan hold he witan its fate however after the conquest be to be more glorious in 1147 stephen and he wife matilda found a abbey of benedictine monk here at faversham in honor of we lord and know as st savior upon land she have obtain from william of ypre stephen 's favorite captain in exchange for she manor of littlechurch in this county at the end of April 1152 she fall sick at hedingham castle in essex and die there three day later be bury in the abbey church at faversham in August of the following year she eldest son eustace be lay beside she and in 1154 stephen the king be also bury here the abbey be as i have say dedicate to we savior and this because it possess a famous relic of the true cross which have be the gift of eustace of boulogne the abbey be thus found in worship of the croy and one might have expect some such dedication as holy cross as founder the king for he and he queen have be equally concern in the foundation claim after the death of the abbot certain toll such as the abbot 's ring drinking cup horse and hound the abbot be a very great noble hold he house in chief and sit in parliament at the suppression henry viii grant the place to sir thoma cheynay now mark the almost inevitable end the cheynay be live on church property obtain by theft at the least they be receiver of steal goods do you think they could endure they presently sell to a certain thoma arden sometime mayor of faversham upon Sunday 15 February 1551 this man be foully murder in the abbey house he call he own by a certain thoma mosby a london tailor the lover of alice arden thoma arden 's wife this tragic affair so touch the imagination of the time that not only do holinshed relate it in detail but some unknown writer who by not a few have be take for shakespeare himself use the story as the plot for a play arden of faversham accord to the dramatist be a noble character modest forgiving and affectionate he wife alecium in she sleep by chance reveal to he she adulterous love for mosby but arden forgive she on she promising never again to see she seducer from that moment she plot with she lover to murder she husband and succeed at last after many failure by kill he in the abbey house by the hand of two hire assassin while he be play a game of draught with mosby all concern in the affair be bring to justice but the abbey of faversham be no longer covet as a place of abode almost every stone have disappear of the abbey church in which lay stephen he queen and they son it stand on the northern side of the town where indeed the abbey farm still remain it be to the parish church of we lady of charity that we must turn for any memory of the conventual house where many a pilgrim must often have kneel to venerate the relic of the holy cross the great church which remain to we be say to have be use by the monk and if not part of the abbey itself which would seem to have stand at some distance from it more than one thing that remain in it would seem to endorse such a theory to begin with the church be very spacious and cruciform in plan though the tower be at the west end this however be a very ugly affair date from 1797 in the main the great church which have be tamper with at very various time if not rebuild must have be early english in style as we see it we have a building divide into three aisle in nave chancel and transept the nave as it be at present may be neglect but in the north transept we have a curious hagioscope or other opening in the shape of a cross and there use to be some remains of painting the nativity the virgin and child the glorium in excelsis the crucifixion and the holy woman at the sepulchre of we lord in the chancel be other remains of painting there still remain the very noble stall which seem to assure we of the monastic use of the church and a fine altar tomb of the fifteenth century this on the north side on the south be very fine sedilium and piscina close by be a brass to william thanbury the vicar here date from 1448 the inscription consider the use of the church to-day be pathetic for there we read credo in sanct eccle cath a please misreading of the true text which every one though for different reason will rejoice to read we be tell by local tradition or gossip that the tomb at the end of the south aisle be that of king stephen this however could only be true if this be indeed the church of the monastery the tomb be decorate in style and have a canopy but be without inscription we lady of charity be however chiefly famous for its chapel of st thoma of canterbury on the north side of the chancel and for its altar of ss crispin and crispian and of st erasmus many pilgrim turn aside from the road to visit faversham which be not a station on the pilgrimage for the sake of these shrine and altar and especially to pray in the chapel of st thoma it be say indeed that no one die who have anything to leave without give something to st erasmus light as for ss crispin and crispian they be the patron of the town and leap into great fame after the victory of agincourt upon they feast day October 25 when the king have invoke they upon the field this day be call the feast of crispian he that outlive this day and come safe home will stand a-tiptoe when this day be name and rouse he at the name of crispian and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we on it shall be remember the two saint crispin and crispian be not less famous in france than in england they be indeed rome 's missionary in gaul about the middle of the third century they seem to have settle at soisson where now a great church stand in they honor there they practice the craft of cobbler and of all cobbler they be the patron after some year the emperor maximian hercule come into gaul a complaint concern they be bring to he they be try by that most inhuman judge rictius varno the governor whom however they contrived to escape by flee to england and to faversham where as some say they live but as other assert they be shipwreck for we at any rate they name be secure from oblivion not so much by reason of the famous victory win upon they day as because shakespeare have gloriously record they name with those familiar in we mouth as household word : harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester chapter v the pilgrim ' road faversham to canterbury from faversham at least to the environs of canterbury the pilgrim 's road seem to be unmistakable for the watle street run all the way straight as a rule line yet so few be the remain mark of the pilgrimage so little be that great roman and mediaeval england remember by man or even by the field or the road which run between they with so changeless a purpose that at first sight we might think it all a myth and yet everything that be fundamental or really enduring and valuable in we life we owe to that england which be surely one of the most glorious and strong as well as one of the happiest country in europe yet must the disheartened voyager take comfort for in how many small and negligible thing may we not see even to-day the very mark and standard of rome she sign manual after all under the rubbish of the modern world and if you desire a example let I give you weathercock no man can walk for day after day along this tremendous road which lead we straight as a javelin thrust back through all the lie and excuse to the truth of we origin without notice and especially since he must keep a eye on the wind and the weather the astonishing number of weathercock there be between london and canterbury upon almost every steeple chanticleer tower shine in the sun and wildly career in the wind of spring you think that nothing at all the most ordinary sight in modern england but for the see eye it reveal how much everyone of these weathercock crow there on the tip top of the steeple over each town or village because of a order of the pope they be to be the sign of the jurisdiction of st peter and that by a bull of the ninth century how entrance it be to remember such a thing as that in the midst of modern england in spite of the weathercock and they watchfulness however the memory of the great pilgrimage between faversham and harbledown be dishearteningly few one might surely expect to find something at preston for instance where come out of faversham one rejoin the watle street but there be nothing at all to remind one of the great past of the way it be true that preston church dedicate in honor of st catherine be both ancient and beautiful and once belong to the monastery of christ church in canterbury but neither in its channel which must once before the eastern window be insert in 1862 with its single lancet and sedilium have be extraordinarily fine nor in the nave be there any memory at all of st thoma or the pilgrim it be not indeed until we come to boughton that we be remind of they the older part of the parish of boughton be south street where however nothing now remain older than the sixteenth century at the earliest here however be anciently a wayside chapel to the south of the road where now holy lane turn out of it about a mile or rather less to the south and clean off the road stand on the crest of a steep though not a high hill the lovely village of boughton under blee which curiously enough if we consider what be omit be mention by chaucer when end be the lyf of seint cecyle er we have riden fully fyve myle at boghton under blee we gin atake a man that clothe be in clothes blake and undernethe he hadde a whyt surply it seme he have prike myle three this man who with he yeoman overtake the pilgrim be the rich canon the alchemist who could pave with gold all the road to canterbury town he be say to have already ridden three mile but whence he have come it be impossible to say that the pilgrim who have ride not quite five mile have come from ospringe might seem certain and since they be overtake by the canon it be possible that he be come from faversham it be however more important to explain if we can what the pilgrim be do more than a mile off the true way at boughton under blean the church of ss peter and paul be of some interest and of considerable beauty it be true but so far as we may know there be no shrine there of sufficient importance to draw the pilgrim from the road as at faversham nor one might think would they be easily divert from the goal of they journey almost within reach all sort of route have be give here one go so far as to lead the pilgrim south and east quite off the watle street and across the old green road the pilgrim way from winchester to enter canterbury at last by the south gate this be absurd no good explanation have yet be offer but perhaps we may be near the truth if we suggest that chaucer and he pilgrim never visit boughton under blean and the church of ss peter and paul at all after all we have in chaucer 's text -lrb- frag g canon 's yeoman prologue -rrb- merely the name and that in the old form boghton under blee all this wild woodland and forest country which lie on a great piece of high ground stretch north-east and south-west across the way parallel with the valley of the great stour between faversham and canterbury hide the one from the other be know as the blean it be equally certain that the village of dunkirk be know as boughton until the middle of the eighteenth century when a set of squatter take possession of the ground then extra parochial as of a free - port from which no one could dislodge they the district include the greater part of the forest be afterwards erect into a separate villa call the villa of dunkirk now boughton hill rise abruptly beyond the village of dunkirk and it may well be that this and not the tiny hamlet nearly a mile to the south of the great way be chaucer 's boghton under blee where the canon and he yeoman overtake the joly companye and ride in with they to canterbury and it be there at mad tom 's corner that we first catch sight of the glorious city of st thoma mad tom 's corner that name it be needless to say i hope have no reference to the great archbishop or the pilgrimage mad tom 's corner whence we get we first view of canterbury be intimately connect with the gate close by call courtenay 's gate and refer to the exploit of a mad cornishman who come to ken and especially to canterbury about 1832 and presently proclaim himself to be the new messiah and show to he deluded disciple the sacred stigma in he hand and foot it be the custom of these unhappy people to meet in the wood of the blean and it be say one may still see they name cut upon the tree mad tom who besides proclaim himself to be the messiah claim also to be the heir to the earldom of devon and call himself sir william percy honeywood courtenay the hon sydney percy count mose rothschild and squire thompson to say nothing of knight of malta and king of jerusalem be a madman with a method in he madness and a certain reasonable truth behind he absurdity he mission be he say to restore the land to the people to take it away that be to say from the great rascal family of the sixteenth century the russell cavendish and so forth who have appear like vermin to feed upon the dead body of the church to gorge themselves upon she land and to lord it in she abbey and priory in the mind of these people tom be not only mad but dangerous mad he certainly be for all he dream nevertheless he stand for canterbury in the year of the reform bill and poll 275 vote and in the following year he start a paper call the _ lion _ which run to eighteen number five year later however he have become such a nuisance that a warrant be safely issue against he on the charge of entice away the labourer of a farmer tom shoot one of the constable who serve the warrant and on the afternoon of the last morning of may in 1838 two company of the 45th regiment be march out of canterbury to take he they find he here in blean wood surround by he follower he however be a man of action and he promptly shoot the officer in command the soldier then begin to fire and next minute be charge with fix bayonet tom and eight of he follower be kill and three more die a few day later one may well ask what can have induce the stolid kentish folk to follow so wild a celt as this we shall probably find the answer in the fact that tom be exceedingly handsome in a italian way have a extraordinary resemblance to the usual italian type of the savior also without doubt he voice though inanely the innate resentment of the english peasant against the great sixteenth century robber family and they sycophant these great family now on they last leg and about to be tear in piece by a host financial and disgusting without creed or nationality seven time worse than they laugh at tom they do not laugh at those who about to compass they destruction lead by another celt have dig a pit into which they trample headlong and astonishing as it might seem to the regret of that very peasantry which have hate they for so long at least and let we remember this if they be greedy and unscrupulous they vice be ours something we could understand they be of we blood we take the same thing for grant have the same prejudice and after all the same sense of justice they with we be a part of europe and look to rome as they ancestor and original but those who be about to displace they alas whence do they come who beget they from what have they issue out i can not answer but i know that with all they fault they sacrilege robbery and treason russell cavendish cecil and talbot be english name and they who bear they man of we blood european too and of we civilisation but who be those that now begin to fill they place alien oriental and worse now receive without surprise into the peerage of england and the great office of justice and the name which recall elizabeth and whose syllable be a part of we mother tongue be obliterate by such jargon as these these be miserable thought to come to a man on the road to canterbury but they be inevitable to-day in england of my heart the new time belong to they let we then return to the old time before they and here for the first time in sight of canterbury let we remember st thomas the greatest of english saint the noblest english name in the roman calendar all that wonder which greet you from mad tom 's corner upon boughton hill be rightly understand the work of st thoma and we might say indeed that the great angel steeple be the last of he miracle for it be the last of the gothic in england and it rise above he tomb while that tomb be still a shrine and a monument in the heart of man for the church dedicate to st thoma erect itself as erasmus say with such majesty towards heaven that even from a distance it strike religious awe into the beholder so i go on my way in the mid-afternoon down hill to what in my heart i know to be bob-up-and-down on the far side of which lie and climb harbledown and the hospital of st nichola wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel town which that y-clepe be bop-up-and-down under the blee in caunterbury weye this littel town it might seem have disappear unless indeed it be harbledown itself which certainly bear geographically much resemblance to that descriptive name as erasmus describe it in he strange book know then say he that those who journey to london not long after leave canterbury find themselves in a road at once very hollow and narrow and besides the bank on either side be so steep and abrupt that you can not escape nor can you possibly make you journey in any other direction upon the left hand of this road be a hospital of a few old man one of whom run out as soon as they perceive any horseman approach he sprinkle he holy water and presently offer the upper part of a shoe bind with a iron hoof on which be a piece of glass resemble a precious stone those that kiss it give some small coin gratian ride on my left hand next to the hospital he be cover with water however he endure that when the shoe be stretch out he ask the man what he want he say that it be the shoe of st thoma on that my friend be angered and turn to I he say ` what do these brute imagine that we must kiss every good man 's shoe why by the same rule they would offer he spittle to be kiss or other bodily excrement ' i pity the old man and by the gift of a small coin i comfort he trouble it be easy to see that we be there in the modern world on the very eve of the reformation the unmannerly gratian be john colet to be the dean of st paul 's hardly defend from the charge of heresy by old archbishop wareham and like so many of he kidney he seem to have forget the scripture upon which as he would have assert he whole philosophy and action be base -- the scripture i mean which speak of one the lachet of whose shoe i be not worthy to stoop down and unloose we shall not have the opportunity of be so proud and impatient as dean colet of unhappy memory for no shoe alas of st thoma or any other saint will be offer for we veneration in the hospital of st nichola at harbledown to-day yet not for this should we pass it by for of all place upon the road it best of all conserve the memory of those far away day when chaucer come by and half-way up the hill rest awhile and pray e'er from the summit he look down upon canterbury the hospital of the forest or wood of blean dedicate in honor of st nichola lie upon the southern and western side of the last hill before the western gate of the city it be found in 1084 by archbishop lanfranc and no doubt for a time serve as a hospital for leper but it be soon appropriate for the use of the sick and wayfarer generally and though nothing save the chapel remain to we from lanfranc 's day the whole place be so full of interest that no one should pass it by the chapel become in time the parish church of this little place on the hillside which grow up about the hospital which itself be probably place here on account of the spring of water know as st thoma 's or the black prince 's well south and west of the building most of the chapel be of norman build the western doorway for instance the pillar and round arch on the north of the nave date from lanfranc 's time but the south side be later of the thirteenth century and the font and choir be later still be perpendicular fifteenth century work the hospital however as we see it be a rebuilding of the seventeenth century but it be fundamentally restore in the nineteenth in the frater hall however be some interesting remains of the old house among they a fine collection of mazer and two bowl of maple wood in one of which lie perhaps the very crystal which erasmus saw and which be set in the upper leather of the shoe of st thoma below the hospital in the orchard be the old well know as st thoma 's above it grow a elder surely a relic of the day of the pilgrimage for the elder be know as the wayfaring tree and be sacred to pilgrim and traveller it be not strange then that it should cool with its shade the spring of st thoma it be only strange that the vandal have spare it for we to bless but why the elder be sacred to traveller i do not know wayfare tree what ancient claim hast thou to that right pleasant name be it that some faint pilgrim come unhopedly to thee in the brown desert 's weary way ` midst thirst and toil consume sway and there as ` neath thy shade he lay bless the wayfaring tree but doggerel never solve anything in truth a very different story be tell of the elder and on good authority too for if we may not trust sir john maundeville who tell we that fast by the pool of siloe be the elder tree on which juda hang himself when he sell and betray we lord shakespeare say that juda be hang on a elder and pier plowman record : juda he jap with jewish siller and sithen on a elder tree hang himsel it be from the quietness and neglect beauty of this well of st thoma that under the evening i turn back into the road and climb a little look down upon what be once the holiest city of fair england felix locus felix ecclesium in qua thomae vivit memoria : felix terra quae dedit praesulem felix ilium quae fovit exsulem in that hour of twilight when even the modern world be hushed and it be possible to believe in god i look with a long look towards that glory which have greet so often and for so many century the eager gaze of my ancestor but i could not see for my eye like theirs be full of tear chapter vi the city of st thoma when a man alone or in a company enter canterbury at last by the long road from london in the thirteenth fourteenth or fifteenth century he come into a city as famous as jerusalem as lovely as anything even in england and as certainly alive and in possession of a soul as he be himself when a man come into canterbury to-day he come into a dead city i say canterbury be dead for when the soul have depart from the body that be death canterbury have lose its soul go into the cathedral it be like a tomb but a tomb that have be rifle a white sepulchre so void and cold that even the last trump will make there no stir it be once the altar the shrine and as it be the mother of england one of the tremendous place of europe into which every year flock thousand upon thousand upon thousand of man the altar be throw down the shrine be go and forget in all that vast church the martyred saint who make it what it be be not so much as remembered even in a inscription or a stone and the enthusiasm and devotion of century have give place to a silence so icy that nothing can break it the place be dead i remember very well the first time i come to canterbury i be a boy and full of enthusiasm for st thoma i would have kneel where he fall i would have pray yes with all my father there where he be lay at last on high above the altar but there be nothing i be show as be the custom all that the four century of ice have preserve of the work of my forefather the glorious tomb of king and bishop the storied glass of the thirteenth century unique in england the litter and the footstep of thirteen hundred year i be lead up past the choir into that lofty and once famous place where for century the greatest and holiest shrine in england stand all about be still group the tomb of prince edward the black prince the hero of crecy henry iv the usurper cardinal chatillon but of the shrine itself of the body it hold up to love and honor and worship there be nothing no word even no sign at all to tell that ever such a thing have be only a emptiness and a space and a silence that could be feel later i be lead down into that north-west transept once know as the martyrdom where st thoma lay down he life and leave alone there i remember i try in all that dumbness and silence to recollect myself to pray at least to recall something of that great sacrifice which have so move christendom that for century man flock here to worship -- where now no man kneel any more for ever i remember very well how it come to I in that tingle and icy silence that st thoma die for the liberty of the church that here in england she might not become the king 's chattel or anyway at all the creature of the civil power i be too young to smile when i remember that in the very place where st thoma lay down he life in that cause there sit to-day in he usurped place one who eagerly acknowledge the king as the supreme governor of the church within these realm yet in my heart i hear again those tremendous word be all the sword of england hanging over my head you could not terrify I from my obedience to god and my lord the pope they who slew he flee away and they title shout in the winter darkness that fill the church be hear above the thunder and have echo down the age since : reaux reaux king 's man king 's man be it not they who now sit in becket 's place but to-day i be content with a judgment less bitter and less logical who may know what be in the heart of god perhaps after all after this age of ice canterbury will rise again and my little son even may hear they singing in the street gay once more and alive with endless procession that noble old song : laureata novo thoma sicut suo petro roma gaude cantuarium -lrb- illustration : canterbury cathedral from christchurch gate -rrb- for though st thoma be forget in canterbury he be on high and valiant and one day maybe he will return from exile as before to accomplish wonderful thing and indeed dead as she be and silent canterbury be worthy of resurrection if only because she be as it be a part of he and a part too of we origin the well though not the source from which the faith be give we for some thirteen hundred year when man have speak of canterbury they have have in mind the metropolitan church of england the great cathedral which still stand so finely there in the rather gloomy close behind christ church gate rightly upon the foundation of its predecessor roman saxon and norman building ever since there be a civilisation in england there have be a church in this place it be we duty then as well as we pleasure to approach it to-day with reverence canterbury begin as we begin in the swamp and the forest a little lake village in the marsh of the stour hold the lowest ford not beyond the influence of the sea nor out of reach of fresh water when great rome break into england lose in mist here certainly she establish a city that be as it be the focus of all the port of the strait whence most easily a man might come into england from the continent canterbury grow because she be almost equally near to the port we know as lympne dover richborough and reculver so that a man set out from the continent and doubtful in which port he would land wholly at the mercy of wind and tide as he be would name canterbury to he correspondent in england as a place of meeting thus canterbury increase there in the roman time doubtless a church arise which doubtless too perish in the diocletian persecution that it re-arose we know for venerable bede describe it as still exist when nearly two hundred year after the departure of the roman legion st augustine come into england send by st gregory to make we christian he come as we know first into kent to find canterbury the royal capital of king ethelbert and when say bede a episcopal see have be give to augustine in the king 's own city he _ regain possession -lrb- re_cuperavit -rrb- with the king 's help _ of a church there which he be inform have be build in the city long before by roman believer _ this he consecrate in the name of the holy savior jesus christ we lord and god and fix there a home for himself and all he successor -lrb- footnote : bede _ hist eccl _ i xxviii -rrb- this church rudely repair add to and rebuilt stand until lanfranc 's day when it be pull down and destroy to make way for the great norman build out of which the church we have have grow the little church which lanfranc destroy and which have see so many vicissitude be probably a work of the end of the fourth century at any rate in its foundation eadmer indeed who tell we all we know of it say that it be build on the plan of st peter 's in rome this be that very church he write which have be build by roman as bede witness in he history and which be duly arrange in some part in imitation of the church of the bless prince of the apostle peter in which he holy relic be exalt by the veneration of the whole world we shall never know much more than eadmer tell we for if the foundation still exist they lie within the present church it be record however that in the time of st elphege the church be badly damage by the dane the archbishop himself be martyr at greenwich no doubt as often before the church be patch up only to perish by fire in 1067 the year after the battle of hasting when lanfranc then enter canterbury he find he cathedral a mere ruin but with he usual energy though already a man of sixty-five he set to work to re-establish not only he cathedral but also the monastery attach to it he do this on a great scale provide accommodation for three time the number of monk that have serve the cathedral in the decadent day of the saxon monarchy and when this be do he first destroy utterly the romano-saxon church and then set about erect a more noble one and in the space of seven year 1070 - 1077 he raise this from the foundation and bring it near to perfection that he work in great haste and too quickly seem certain in fact it must be confess that lanfranc 's church in canterbury be a more or less exact copy of he church of st stephen at caen but build much more quickly be too mean for its purpose it soon become necessary to rebuild the choir and sanctuary the nave however be allow to stand until the end of the fourteenth century but even then its design so hamper the builder of the present nave for it have be decide to preserve one of lanfranc 's western tower that to this day the nave of canterbury be too short consist of but eight bay lanfranc 's choir be of but two bay and a apse this be too obviously inadequate to be tolerate by the monk in 1096 it be pull down and a great apsidal choir of ten bay be build over a lofty crypt with a tower on either side the apse and a eastern transept have four apsidal chapel in the eastern wall two in the north arm and two in the south all this be do in the time of st anselm and finish in 1115 when conrad be prior of christ church it be this church with lanfranc 's short norman nave western façade and tower and conrad 's glorious great choir high up over the crypt a choir broader than the nave and longer too and with two transept the western of lanfranc 's time the eastern of st anselm 's that st thoma know and that see he martyrdom in 1170 material for the life of st thoma be so plentiful that he modern biographer be able to compose a life fuller perhaps in detail and fact than would be possible in the case of any other man of he time but no account ever write of he martyrdom be at once so simple and so touching as that to be find in the golden legend it be this account which the man of the middle age know by heart and which bring he in he thousand on pilgrimage to canterbury and therefore i give it here when the king of france have make accord between st thoma and king henry the archbishop voragine tell we come home to canterbury where he be receive worshipfully and send for they that have trespass against he and by the authority of the pope 's bull openly denounce they accursed unto the time they come to amendment and when they hear this they come to he and would have make he assoil they by force and send word over to the king how he have do whereof the king be much wroth and say : if he have man in he land that love he they would not suffer such a traitor in he land alive and forthwith four knight take they counsel together and think they would do to the king a pleasure and emprise to slay st thoma and suddenly depart and take they shipping toward england and when the king know of they depart he be sorry and send after they but they be in the sea and depart ere the messenger come wherefore the king be heavy and sorry these be the name of the four knight : sir reginald fitzurse sir hugh de morville sir william de tracy and sir richard le breton on christmas day st thoma make a sermon at canterbury in he own church and weep pray the people to pray for he for he know well he time be nigh and there execute the sentence on they that be against the right of holy church and that same day as the king sit at meat all the bread that he handle wax anon mouldy and hoar that no man might eat of it and the bread that they touch not be fair and good for to eat and these four knight aforesaid come to canterbury on the Tuesday in christmas week about evensong time and come to st thoma and say that the king command he to make amends for the wrong he have do and also that he should assoil all they that he have accurse anon or else they should slay he then say thoma : all that i ought to do by right that will i with a good will do but as to the sentence that be execute i may not undo but that they will submit they to the correction of holy church for it be do by we holy father the pope and not by I then say sir reginald : but if thou assoil not the king and all other standing in the curse it shall cost thee thy life and st thoma say : thou knowest well enough that the king and i be accord on mary magdalene day and that this curse should go forth on they that have offend the church then one of the knight smite he as he kneel before the altar on the head and one sir edward grim that be he crossier put forth he arm with the cross to bear off the stroke and the stroke smite the cross asunder and he arm almost off wherefore he flee for fear and so do all the monk that be that time at compline and then each smote at he that they smite off a great piece of the skull of he head that he brain fall on the pavement and so they slew and martyr he and be so cruel that one of they brake the point of he sword against the pavement and thus this holy and bless archbishop st thoma suffer death in he own church for the right of all holy church and when he be dead they stir he brain and after go in to he chamber and take away he goods and he horse out of he stable and take away he bull and writings and deliver they to sir robert break to bear into france to the king and as they search he chamber they find in a chest two shirt of hair make full of great knot and then they say : certainly he be a good man and come down into the churchyard they begin to dread and fear that the ground would not have bear they and be marvellously aghast but they suppose that the earth would have swallow they all quick and then they know that they have do amiss and soon it be know all about how that he be martyr and anon after they take he holy body and unclothed he and find bishop 's clothing above and the habit of a monk under and next he flesh he wear hard hair full of knot which be he shirt and he breech be of the same and the knot stick fast within he skin and all he body full of worm he suffer great pain and he be thus martyr the year of we lord one thousand one hundred and seventy-one and be fifty-three year old and soon after tiding come to the king how he be slay wherefore the king take great sorrow and send to rome for he absolution of the king 's penance voragine say nothing but indeed it must have reverberate through europe though not perhaps with so enormous a rumor as the humiliation of the emperor henry iv before pope gregory vii at canossa scarce a hundred year before have do the first and the most famous of canterbury pilgrim come to st dunstan 's church upon the watle street outside the great west gate of canterbury as we may believe in July 1174 there he strip he of he robe and barefoot in a woollen shirt enter the city and walk barefoot through the street to the door of the cathedral there he kneel and be receive into the great church be lead to the place of martyrdom where he kneel again and kiss the stone where st thoma have fall in the crypt where the body of the martyr be preserve the king lay aside he cloak and receive five stroke with a rod from every bishop and abbot there present and three from every one of the eighty monk in that place he remain through the whole night fasting and weep to be absolved on the follow day -lrb- illustration : west gate canterbury -rrb- the martyrdom of st thoma the penance of the king these world - shake and amazing event might in themselves we may think have be enough to transform the church in which they take place if as be think at the time heaven itself have not intervene and destroy conrad 's glorious choir by fire this disaster fall upon the city and the country like a final judgment less than two month after the penance of the king in 1174 and within four year of st thoma 's murder something of the great masterpiece that then perish be leave to we especially without and it be perhaps the most charming work remain in the city the tower of st anselm for instance and much of the transept beside it for the rest the choir of canterbury as we know it the choir begin in 1174 by william of sen be as french as its predecessor but in all else very different in order perhaps to provide a great space for the shrine of the newly canonise st thoma of canterbury to whose tomb already half europe be flock the choir be build even longer than its predecessor the great space provide for the shrine in the trinity chapel behind the choir and high altar open on the east into a circular chapel know perhaps on account of the relic it hold as becket 's crown till 1220 when all be ready the body of st thoma lay in a iron coffin in the crypt and the great feast and day of pilgrimage in he honor be the day of he martyrdom December 29 so incredibly honorable as be within the octave of the nativity of we lord but in 1220 it be decide to translate the body from the crypt to the new shrine in the trinity chapel in July for the winter pilgrimage be irksome from that year a new feast be establish the feast of the translation of st thoma upon July 7th and thus in england down to we own day st thoma have two feast that of he martyrdom on December 29 when still he relic be expose in the great catholic cathedral of westminster and in the little church of st thoma the catholic sanctuary in canterbury and that of he translation upon July 7th of that first summer pilgrimage to the new shrine of st thoma we have very full account it be the most glorious and the most extraordinary assemblage that have perhaps ever be see in england the archbishop have give two year ' notice of the event and this have be circulate not only in all england but throughout europe order have be issue for maintenance to be provide for the vast multitude not only in the city of canterbury itself but on the various road by which the pilgrim would approach during the whole celebration along the whole way from london to canterbury hay and provender be give to all who ask and at each gate of canterbury in the four quarter of the city and in the four licensed cellar be place tun of wine to be distribute grati and on the day of the festival wine run freely through the gutter of the street in the presence of the young henry iii too young himself to bear a part the coffin in which lay the relic of st thoma be bear on the shoulder of the papal legate the archbishop stephen langton the grand justiciary hubert de burgh and the archbishop of rheim from the crypt up to the trinity chapel in the presence of every bishop and abbot of england of the great official of the kingdom and of the special ambassador of every state in europe of bishop and abbot prior and parson of earl and of baron and of many knight thereto of sergeant and of squire and of he husbandmen enow and of simple man eke of the land -- so thick hither draw so be st thoma vindicate and god avenge and st thoma reign as be think for ever on high in the new sanctuary of he cathedral church i say he reign on high the choir and sanctuary of canterbury have even in st anselm 's time as we have see be high above the nave william of sen design the new choir as high as the old but very nobly raise still higher the great altar and higher yet the chapel of the trinity in which stand the shrine st thoma have a especial devotion to the holy trinity it be in a former trinity chapel that he have say he first mass and whether on this account or another he devotion be such that it be he who first establish that feast till then merely the octave of whitsunday he shrine then be well place in the chapel of the holy trinity in examine the church to-day one can well understand the beauty of william of sen ' idea and see too where and perhaps understand why it really fail or at least come short of perfection william of sen train in latin tradition have and rightly little respect we may think for the work of the past he would have have all new but by 1174 unlike anselm in 1096 and still more unlike lanfranc in 1070 he have in all probability a genuine english and national prejudice to meet a english dislike of destruction and a english hatred of anything new it have be say that the failure of william of sen ' design be due to the meanness of the monk of christ church but meanness be not a english fail on the contrary we great fault be the very opposite extravagance it be surely not meanness and at such a time and in such a cause that force the monastery to deny william of sen the free hand he desire it be prejudice and a fear almost barbaric of destruction the monk force they builder to accommodate the new choir to what remain of the old work they refuse to sacrifice st anselm 's tower on the south or the tower of st andrew on the north therefore the wide choir of canterbury already wider than the nave and grow wider still as it go eastward have to be strangle between they and to open again as well as it could into the trinity chapel and the corona all that be old too and that they love they use the old pier of the crypt be to remain and still to support the pillar of the choir which be thus no doubt to william 's disgust unequally place so that here the arch be pointed but there round in many way william must have consider he employer barbarian and in the true sense of that much abused term he be right no man bring up in the greek and latin tradition would have hesitate to destroy in order to build anew the english can not do that they patch and make do and what must be new they can not love until it be old they building be not so much work of art as growth and there be much to be say for they only here at canterbury they prejudice have be a misfortune not even the most convinced englishman can look upon the twisted and constricted choir of canterbury and rejoice william of sen however hamper though he be be responsible for the work we see it be true he die after some four year of work at canterbury fall one day from a scaffold but william the englishman who follow he only complete what be really already finish the design the idea and the genius of canterbury choir be french spoil by english prejudice but undoubtedly french for all that as it appear when that great transitional choir be finish canterbury cathedral remain till 1379 it be true that the north wall of the cloister and the lovely doorway in the north-east corner be build in the early english time it be equally true that the lower part of the chapter house and the screen north and south of the choir and a glorious window in st anselm 's chapel be decorate work but the cathedral itself know nothing of the early english or of the decorate style it stand till 1379 with a low and short norman nave and transept to the west and a great transitional choir and transept to the east in 1379 lanfranc 's nave and transept be destroy it may be think that at last a great and noble nave would be build north of the frenchman 's choir not at all again the english prejudice against destruction -- a lack of intellectual daring in we perhaps -- prevent this one of the western tower of lanfranc be to remain and therefore the new nave though loftier than the old be no longer and it remain a glory certainly without but within a hopeless disappointment save from utter ineffectiveness only by the noble height of the great choir above it it remain without life or zest not a experiment but a task honestly and thoroughly do in the perpendicular style to the same period belong the great western screen of the choir the chapel of st michael and the warrior 's chapel in the south transept the lady chapel in the north transept the chantry and the tomb of henry iv in the trinity chapel the black prince 's chantry and the screen of the lady chapel in the crypt the upper part of the chapter house now lose to we by restoration and the south-west tower there remain at the end of the fifteenth century but one thing need -- the central tower this as it happen be to be the last great gothic work undertake in this country and in every way it be one of the most impressive and successful begin in 1475 and finish in 1503 the angel steeple be the last of catholicism in england and i like to think of it tower as it do over that dead city and the low hill of kent over all that be once so sacred and be now nothing as a kind of beacon a sign of hope until it shall ring the angelus again and once more the son of st benedict shall chant the mass of st thoma before the shrine new make : _ gaudeamus omne in domino diem festum celebrante sub honore beatus thomae martyris de cujus passione gaudent angelus et collaudant filium dei _ for the great shrine which for so long have be the loftiest beacon in england of the christian faith be destroy it be the first work of the last henry to avenge he namesake and have make another thoma martyr in the same cause to wipe out for ever all memory of the first who have steadfastly withstand he predecessor it be strange that the sever head of bless thoma more should lie in the very church whence henry ii set forth to do penance for the murder of the first thoma we have no authentic record of the final catastrophe such deed be usually do in darkness all we really know be that in 1538 the bone by command of the lord -lrb- thoma -rrb- cromwell be there and then burn the spoile of the shrine in golde and precious stone fill two greate chest such as six or seven strong man could doe no more than convey one of they out of the church that the shrine be of unsurpassed magnificence we have many witness the tomb of st thoma the martyr write a venetian traveller who have see it surpass all belief notwithstanding its great size it be wholly cover with plate of pure gold yet the gold be scarce see because it be cover with various precious stone as sapphire balass diamond ruby and emerald and wherever the eye turn something more beautiful than the rest be observe nor in addition to these natural beauty be the skill of art want for in the midst of the gold be the most beautiful sculptured gem both small and large as well as such as be in relief as agate onyx cornelian and cameo and some cameo be of such size that i be afraid to name it but everything be far surpass by a ruby not larger than a thumb-nail which be fix at the right of the altar the church be somewhat dark and particularly in the spot where the shrine be place and when we go to see it the sun be near setting and the weather cloudy nevertheless i see the ruby as if i have it in my hand they say it be give by a king of france to carry out the theft with impunity it be first of all necessary to degrade the great national hero and saint and expose he memory to ridicule in November 1538 st thoma be declare a traitor every representation of he be order to be destroy and he name be erase from all service book antiphone collect and prayer under pain of he majesty 's indignation and imprisonment at he grace 's pleasure the saint indeed be say to have be cite to appear at westminster for treason and there to have be try and condemn that seem too superstitiously insolent even for such a thing as henry but we may believe marillac the french ambassador when he tell we st thoma be declare a traitor _ because _ he relic and bone be adorn with gold and stone so perish the shrine and memory of st thoma and with it the thousand year old religion of england to be replace by one know not what with the destruction of religion go the destruction of the religious house of these the chief be the benedictine monastery of christ church which lay to the north of the cathedral and whose monk from st augustine 's time have always serve it almost nothing remain of this save the cloister and chapter house and treasury attach to the cathedral the castellum aquae now call the baptistery the prior 's chapel now the chapter library the deanery once part of the prior 's lodge the porter 's gate the norman staircase of the king 's school and the fragmentary ruin scatter about the precinct include the remains of the archbishop 's palace in palace street not less venerable than the benedictine house of christ church be the other benedictine monastery also found by st augustine in honor of ss peter and paul to which dedication st dunstan add the name of st augustine himself this stand outside the city to the east it be say to have be found by st augustine outside the wall with a view to he own interment there since it be not the roman custom as we know to bury the dead within the wall of a city so honorable a place in the order do this great house hold that we be tell the abbot of st augustine 's canterbury sit next to the abbot of monte cassino the mother house in the council of the order and none but the archbishop himself consecrate the abbot of st augustine 's and that in the abbey church this also henry steal away seize it for he own use but by 1844 what be leave of the place have become a brewery and to-day there remain scarcely more than a great fourteenth century gateway and hall the work of abbot fyndon in 1300 of the church there be leave a few fragment of walling of st augustine 's tomb nothing whatsoever less still remain to we of the smaller religious house that abound in canterbury of the austin canon the priory of st gregory found by lanfranc in 1084 near st john 's hospital also a foundation of lanfranc in northgate street really nothing a fragment of old wall of the nunnery of st sepulchre a benedictine house nothing at all as for the friar ' house scarcely more remain of the earliest the dominican house only the scantiest ruin of the convent the refectory however once in the hand of the anabaptist be now a unitarian chapel of the white friar nothing of the franciscan house the charming thirteenth century ruin that stand over the river to the south of st peter 's street that be all the canterbury of st thoma be no more it perish with he shrine and he religion even the hospital he be say to have found which at any rate be dedicate in he honor be suppress by edward vi it be however still worth a visit if only for the sake of the wall painting recover in 1879 in which we see the martyrdom and the penance of the king but in canterbury to-day st thoma be really a stranger no relic scarcely a remembrance of he remain yet he be the soul of the city he be name in the calendar of he church st thoma of canterbury no relic do i say i be wrong let all the pilgrim of the past come in at the four gate in they thousand and they thousand let the great procession form as though this be a year of jubilee they shall not be disappointed yet it be not to the cathedral they shall go but to a ugly little church -lrb- alas -rrb- in a back street where over the last altar upon the epistle side there be a shrine and in the shrine a relic -- the soutan of st thoma the place be humble and meek enough to escape the notice of all but the pilgrim who seek and seek canterbury only for st thoma muse there in the late spring sunshine for the church be open and quiet and within there be always a guest i fall asleep and in my sleep that guest come to I and i speak with he it seem to I that i be walk in early morning -- all in the england of my heart -- across meadow through which flow a clear translucent stream and the meadow be a mass of flower narcissus jonquil violet for it be spring and beyond the meadow be a fair wood all newly dress and out of the wood there come towards I a man and i know it be the lord christ and i go on to meet he and when i be come to he i say : i shall never understand what you mean i shall never understand what you mean for you say the meek shall inherit the earth i shall never understand what you mean and he look at I and smile and stretch forth he hand and look all about he answer : but i speak of the flower chapter vii the valley of the stour caesar in kent it be upon as fair a spring morning as ever be in england that i set out from canterbury through the west gate and climb up the shoulder of harbledown some little way past st dunstan 's turn out of the watle street south and west into the old green path or trackway which have i follow it to the end would have bring I right across kent and surrey and hampshire to winchester the old capital of england this trackway far older than history would doubtless have perish utterly as so many of its fellow have do but for two very different event the first of which be the martyrdom of st thoma and the other the practice of demand toll upon the great new system of turnpike-road we owe to the end of the eighteenth century for this ancient british track lead half across england of my heart a barbarous thing older than any write word in england be use and preserve when with the full blossoming of the middle age in the thirteenth century it might have disappear it be preserve by the pilgrim to st thoma 's shrine all those man who come out of the west to visit st thoma all those who come from brittany central and southern france and spain gather at winchester the old capital of the kingdom and when they set out thence for canterbury this be the way they follow across the county this most ancient way which enter canterbury hand in hand with the watle street by the west gate to describe a thing so ancient be impossible it cast a spell upon the traveller so that as he follow under its dark yew across the steep hop garden of kent from hillside to hillside up this valley or that along the mighty south wall of the north downs to the great ford of the medway and beyond and beyond through more than a hundred mile to winchester he lose himself become indeed one with he forefather and look upon that dear and ancient landscape he most enduring and most beautiful possession as a child look upon he mother really with unseeing eye unable to tell whether she be fair or no understanding indeed but this that she be a part of himself and that he love she more than anything else in the world but that glorious way in all its fulness be not for I i have determine to follow the pilgrim ' road but a little way indeed but for one long day 's journey so far only as boghton aluph where it turn that great corner westward and proceed along the rampart of the downs but even in the ten mile twixt canterbury and boghton that ancient way give to he who follow it wonderful thing to begin with the valley of the stour there can be few valley in this part of england more lovely than this steep and wide vale through the hop garden the wood and meadow of which the great stour proceeds like a royal pilgrim half in state to canterbury and on to the mystery of the marsh and its death in the sea above canterbury certainly and all along my way there be not a meadow nor a wood nor indeed a single mile of that landscape which have not be contrived and create by man by the love and labor of we father through how many thousand year and this be part of the virtue of england that it be as it be a garden of we make a pleasaunce we have build a paradise and a home after we own heart and in that divine and tireless make we without know it have so moulded ourselves that we be one with it it be a part of we a part of we character and nature there lie ever before we we beginning the earthwork we once defend the grave we build the defeat the victory the holy place by these a man live out of these he draw slowly and with a sort of confidence the uncertain future glad indeed of this divine assurance that there be nothing new under the sun such monument of a antiquity so great that they have no history but what may be gather from barrow and stone accompany one upon any day 's journey in southern england but it be only in one place that a man can stand and say : here begin the history of my country that place as it happen lie as it should upon the pilgrim ' road beyond harbledown some two mile from canterbury he pilgrim ' road along the hillside pass clean through earthwork of unknown antiquity well it be here the seventh legion charge : here indeed we stand upon the very battlefield which see the birth of civilisation in we island lie there in the early morning sunshine i consider it all over again caesar 's first landing in britain in bc 55 have be as he himself tell we merely a reconnaissance in the follow summer however he return in force indeed with a very considerable army and with the intention of bring we too within that great administration which he and he adoptive son augustus be to do so much to make a final and in many way a indestructible thing it might seem that in spite of the lack of the means of rapid communication we possess the admirable system of roman road enable caesar to administer he huge government -- he be then in control of the two gaul -- with a thoroughness we might envy after he first return from britain in the early autumn of bc 55 he cross the alp complete much business in cisalpine gaul journey into illyricum to see what damage the pirusta have do deal with they effectively return to cisalpine gaul hold convention cross the alp again rejoin he army go round all they winter quarter inspect all the many ship he be build at portus itius and other place march with four legion and some cavalry against a tribe of belgae know as the trevirus settle matter with they and before the summer of bc 54 be back at portus itius make final preparation for the invasion of britain this invasion glorious as it be to be and full of the greatest result for we be accompany all through by a series of petty disaster caesar have purpose to set out certainly early in July but delay follow upon delay and when he be ready at last the wind settle into the north-west and blow steadily from that quarter for twenty-five day it have be a dry summer and all gaul be suffer from drought the great preparation which caesar have be make for at least a year be at last complete the specially build ship wide and of shallow draft of a intermediate size between he own swift - sailing vessel and those of burthen which he have gather locally be all ready to the number of six hundred with twenty-eight _ nave longae _ or war vessel and some two hundred of the older boat but the wind make a start impossible for twenty-five day it be not till August that the south-west come to he assistance as soon as might be he embark five legion say twenty-thousand man with two thousand cavalry and horse a enormous transport and doubtless a great number of camp follower leave behind on the continent three legion and two thousand horse to guard the harbor and provide corn and to inform he what be go on in gaul in he absence and to act in case of necessity he himself set sail from portus itius which we may take to be boulogne at sunset that be to say about half-past seven but he must it might seem have devote the whole day to get so many ship out of harbor the wind be blow gently from the south-west bearing he he fortune and ours at midnight the second of those small disaster which meet he at every turn upon this expedition fall upon he the wind fail in consequence he great fleet of transport be helpless it drift along with the tide fortunately then run up the strait but this bear he beyond he landing-place of the year before and daybreak find he apparently far to the east of the north foreland what can have be the thought of the greatest of man helpless in the midst of this treacherous and unknown sea to every roman the sea be bitter even the tideless mediterranean how much more this furious tide-whipt channel caesar can not but have remember how it have half broken he in the previous year very profoundly he must have mistrust it but he gaulish sailor be doubtless less disturbed they expect the ebb and when it come every man do he utmost the transport be bring as swiftly as the long ship to that fair and open beach where caesar have land in the previous summer the long beach which deal and sandwich hold caesar himself as it happen do not tell we that he land in the same place upon this he second invasion of britain as he have do before it be to dion cassius that we owe the knowledge that he do so it be caesar however who tell we that he land about mid-day and that all he ship hold together and reach shore about the same time he add that there be no enemy to be see though as he afterwards learn from he prisoner large body of british troops have be assemble but alarm at the great number of the ship more than eight hundred of which include the ship of the previous year and the private vessel which some have build for they convenience have appear at one time they have retreat from the coast and take to the height the height must have be the hill to the south of canterbury nearly a day 's march from the sea if caesar land as we know from dion cassius that he do in the same place as he have do in the previous year he must have know all there be to know about the natural facility there for camp about the supply of fresh water for instance but perhaps he have not consider the dryness of the summer in any case it might seem to have be some press need such as the necessity for a plentiful supply of fresh water which force he immediately to make a night march with he army leave as he tell we under quintus atrius ten cohort that be as we may suppose two cohort from each of he five legion and three hundred horse to guard the ship at anchor and to hold the camp hastily make between midday and midnight in the third watch that be between midnight and three o'clock he start with he five legion and seventeen hundred horse as he assert to seek out the enemy something we may be sure more pressing than a attack upon a barbarian foe there be no hurry to meet must have force caesar to march he army sleepless now for two night one of which have be spend upon a unusual and anxious adventure at sea out of camp in the small hour into a unknown and roadless country in search of a enemy which have take to its native hill the necessity that force caesar to this dangerous course be probably a lack of fresh water he be seek a considerable river for the smaller stream as he probably find could not suffice after a long drought for so great a force as he have land he himself assert that he advance by night across that roadless and unknown country a distance of twelve mile we know of course of what the army of caesar be capable in the way of march there have never be troops carry anything like they weight of equipment which have do better than they but to march something like fifteen thousand man and seventeen hundred horse twelve mile in about three hour into the unknown and the dark be a impossible proceeding that march of about twelve mile can not have occupy less than from six to eight hour one would think and the greater part of it must have be accomplish by daylight which would break about half-past three o'clock as we have good reason to think caesar 's march however long a time it may have occupy be in search of fresh water and it be significant that when the briton be at last see they be advance to the river with they cavalry and chariot from the higher ground in other word caesar 's march have bring he into the valley of the great stour where he not only find the water he seek but also the enemy who have probably follow he march from the great wood all the way -lrb- illustration : on the stour near canterbury -rrb- the spot at which caesar strike the valley be as we may be sure that above which the great earthwork stand opposite thannington here upon the height be fight the first real battle of rome upon we soil it be open by the briton who begin to annoy the roman and to give battle but the roman cavalry repulse they so that they again seek refuge in the wood where be they camp a place admirably fortify by nature and by art all entrance to it be shut by a great number of fell tree but like all barbarian the briton be undisciplined and prefer to fight in detach party and as seem good to each every now and then some of they rush out of the wood and fall upon the roman who continually be prevent from storm the fort and force a entry much time be thus waste until the soldier of the seventh legion have form a _ testudo _ and throw up a rampart against the british fort take it and drive the briton out of the wood receive in return a few though only a few wound thus the battle end in the victory of we enemy and we savior caesar tell we that he forbid he man to pursue the enemy for any great distance because he be ignorant of the nature of the country and because the day be far spend he wish to devote what remain of the daylight to the building of he camp caesar speak of this camp and rightly of course as a thing of importance we know from he narrative too that it be occupy by some fifteen thousand foot and seventeen hundred horse with they baggage and equipment for more than ten day where do it stand it must have be within reach of the river for without plentiful water no such army as caesar encamp could have maintain itself for so long a period as ten day exactly where it be however we shall in all probability never know wherever it be there caesar spend the night both he and he army sleep soundly we may be sure after the sleepless and anxious night one spend in the peril of the sea the other in a not less perilous night march in a roadless and unknown country yet do caesar sleep towards sunset the wind arise and all night a great gale blow this be the fourth misfortune the expedition have experience it have first be delay for twenty-four day in start it have then lose the wind and have be for hour at the mercy of the tide only landing at last when the day be far spend after a whole night upon the water it have be compel by lack of water to quit the camp at the landing-place without rest and utterly weary and sleepless to undertake a perilous night march in search of water and now in the darkness after the first encounter with the enemy a great gale arise how often during that night must caesar have awaken and think of the sea and he transport it be as he would remember just such a storm which have ruin he in the previous summer to avoid a like disaster he have have he boat build for this expedition shallow of draft and with flat bottom that they might be beach but with the mediterranean in he mind and the certain weather of the south caesar see the August sky so soft and clear have anchor and not beach the ship after all perhaps the late landing the necessity of build a large camp and finally the perilous lack of water have prevent he from call upon he man for a task so enormous as the beaching of eight hundred ship whatever have prevent he that task be not undertake the eight hundred ship be anchor in the shallows when upon that third night of the expedition a great gale arise anxious though he must have be very early in the morning of the follow day he send out three skirmish party to reconnoitre and pursue the defeat briton of the day before but the last man be not out of sight when galloper come in to caesar from quintus atrius at the camp by the shore to report almost all the ship dash to piece and cast upon the beach because neither the anchor and cable could resist the force of the gale nor the sailor or pilot outride it and thus the ship have dash themselves to piece one against another the appalling seriousness of this disaster as report to caesar be at once understand by he he recall he three party of skirmisher and himself at once return to quintus atrius and the ship he tell we that he see before he almost the very thing which he have hear from the messenger and by letter but he add that only about forty ship be lose the remainder be able to be repair with much labor this he at once begin with workman from the legion and other he bring from the continent and at the same time he write to labienus at portus itius to build as many ship as he could then he proceed to do what he have intend to do at first with great difficulty and labor he drag all the ship up on the shore and enclose they in one fortification with the camp in these matter about ten day be spend the man labor night and day then he return to the main army upon the stour but that delay of ten day have give the briton time to recover themselves and to gather all possible force caesar return to he army to find very great force of the briton already assemble to oppose he and the chief command and management of the war entrust to cassivellaunus who though he have be at war with the man of kent be now place so great be the general alarm in command of the whole war caesar however can not have be in any way daunt save perhaps by the memory of the time already lose and the advance season he at once begin he march into britain we may well ask by what route he go and to that question we shall get no certain answer but it would seem he must have march by one of two way for he have to cross the stour the medway and the thame we may be sure then that he route lay either along the old trackway which straighten and build up later by the roman we know as the watle street which ford the medway at rochester and the thame at lambeth and westminster or by the trackway we call the pilgrim ' way along the southern slope of the north downs in which case he would have ford the medway at aylesford and the thame at brentford the question be insoluble caesar himself give no indication now when i have well consider all this i go on to that loveliness which be chilham passing as i go that earthwork older than any history call julaber 's grave mark by a clump of fir tree here of old they think to find the grave of that quintus laberius who fall as caesar relate at the head of he man on the march to the thame but it be probably already older when caesar pass by than it would have be now if he have build it no one can ever have come whether by the pilgrim ' road or another into the little hill-village of chilham into the piazza there which be a acropoli without delight it be one of the surprise of england a place at once so little so charming and so unexpected that it be extraordinary it be not more famous it stand at a point where more than one little valley break down into the steep valley of the stour and every way to it be up hill under what might seem to be old rampart crown now with cottage and house till suddenly you find yourself at the top in a large piazza or square close at the end by the church at the other by the castle and on both side by old line of house really a walled _ place _ the church dedicate in honor of we lady be of some antiquity in the main and older part a work of the fourteenth century replace doubtless roman saxon and norman building but with later addition too of the perpendicular time in the clerestory for instance and with much modern work in the chancel of old the place belong to the alien priory of throwley in this county itself a cell of the abbey of st omer in artoi but when these alien house be suppress chilham like throwley itself go to the new house of syon found by the king to-day apart from the english beauty of the church not a work of art but of history its chief interest lie in its monument some strangely monstrous of the digge family -- sir dudley digge buy chilham at the beginning of the seventeenth century -- the colebrook who follow the digge in 1751 and a fogg and a woldman the latter holding chilham until 1860 there be little to be say of these monument save that they be none of they in very good taste the more interesting be those to lady digge and a member of the fogg family both of the early seventeenth century in which the purbeck have be cover with a charming arabesque and diapered pattern in relief -lrb- illustration : chilham -rrb- but it be not the church beautiful though i find it on that afternoon of spring that make I linger in chilham but rather the castle which occupy the site of a roman camp and perhaps of what a camp it may be that it be here caesar lay on the first night of he resume march after the disaster of the ship it may be that it be here after all that quintus laberius fall and that here he be bury so that the ancient earthwork know as julaber 's grave though certainly far older than caesar be in fact use as the tomb of the hero whose immortality caesar insure by name he in he commentary who know if julaber be not a corruption of laberius as the old antiquary assert and as the people here about believe one like to think it might be for no other explanation of this strange name be forthcoming so i go on through king 's wood and as i come out of it southward i see a wonderful thing for i see before I that division or part of the world which stand quite separate from any other and be not europe asia africa nor america but romney marsh it lay there under the sunset half lose in its own mist far off across the near meadow of the weald for i be now upon the southern escarpment of the north downs and in the foreground rise the town of ashford where i be to sleep it be twilight and more however before i reach it for in those wood i hear for the first time that year the nightingale and my heart which all day have be full of rome be suddenly change so that i go down through the dusk to ashford singing a english song : by a bank as i lay i lay muse on thing past heigh ho in the merry month of may o towards the close of day -- methought i hear at last -- o the gentle nightingale the lady and the mistress of all musick she sit down ever in the dale singing with she notès smale and quaver they wonderfully thick o for joy my spirit be quick to hear the bird how merrily she could sing and i say good lord defend england with thy most holy hand and save noble george we king chapter viii the weald and the marsh ashford as we see it to-day a town of thirteen thousand inhabitant be altogether a modern place and really in the worst sense for it owe its importance and its ugliness to the railway it be a big junction and the site of the engineering work of the south eastern and chatham company lack as it be in almost all material antiquity it have little that be beautiful to show we a fine church with a noble tower that have be rather absurdly compare with the angel steeple at canterbury -- nothing more -- and its history be almost as meager it stand the first town of the kentish weald where the east stour flow into the great stour in the very mouth of the deep valley of the latter which there turn northward through the downs to the north therefore it be everywhere cut off by those great green upland save where the valley at the other end of which stand canterbury break they suddenly in twain to the south it be cut off by a perhaps greater barrier between it and the sea stand the impassable mystery of romney marsh in such a situation before the railway revolutionise travel in england how could ashford have have any importance even the old road westward from dover into britain the pilgrim ' way to stonehenge or winchester pass it by leave it in the weald to follow the escarpment of the downs north or west no roman road serve it and indeed it be but a small and isolate place till the middle age begin to revive and recreate europe even then ashford be probably late in development its history if one may call it history be concern with the owner of the manor of ashford and not with any civil or municipal record indeed the earlier chronicler though they speak of great chart and wye know nothing of ashford which in domesday book appear to have consist of a few mill and a small church the manor be in possession of edward the confessor while st augustine 's at canterbury and earl godwin hold certain land thereabout hugh de montfort get what the king and earl godwin have possess after the conquest but the monastery of st augustine 's seem to have continue to hold its land we know nothing more of ashford which as i have say till late in the middle age consist of a church and two mill and a dene for the pannage of hog in the weald it be not one of the many owner of the manor who be remembered to-day in ashford as its benefactor but the lord of the manor of ripton during the war of the rose sir john fogge who be treasurer of the royal household and a privy councillor in the fourteenth century the church have pass to leed abbey and with the abbey the church of ashford remain until the suppression when it pass to the dean and chapter of canterbury it be not however the abbey of leed that rebuild it as we see it a poor example it must be confess in spite of the nobility of the tower of the latest style of english gothic architecture the perpendicular it be sir john fogge who for this and other reason be the father of the town he lie in a great tomb in the chancel as for the smyth who lie in the south transept thoma and alicia he wife hold the manor of ashford in the sixteenth century alicium be the daughter of sir andrew judde to whom the manor of ashford have be mortgage in the time of henry vii she son sir michael smyth lie close by the family be later ennoble and bear the title of viscount strangford for the outside world however sir john fogge be not ashford 's greatest son this honor belong surely to jack cade whom shakespeare speak of as the headstrong kentish man john cade of ashford and who accord to the poet if headstrong prove in the end so feeble - mind that in shakespeare 's play we might seem to have a picture of one suffering from general paralysis of the insane jack cade however be as we be begin to realize a much greater and more significant figure than shakespeare allow we to see but ashford be not make for linger it be all for departure the road if not the train lead swiftly away north south east and west as for I i go by the south-west road which say twelve mile to tenterden i go under a fine rain on a day of married white and blue and even before i have forget ashford which be long before i cross the stour the rain have cease the sun shine forth and a great wind come out of the marsh and the sea full of good tiding so that climb up to great chart i laugh in my heart to be in england on such a day and on such a road great chart as i saw while still far off be a village typical of this country that i love if indeed a place so completely itself be typical of anything : a little english village but it outface the whole world in its sureness of itself its quietness and air of immemorial antiquity many a city older by far look parvenu beside great chart let we consider with tear if you will what they be make of rome and be thankful that we way be not they way for what win you at once in great chart be the obvious fact that it have always stand there on its hill over the weald and as far as one may see at a glance much the same as it stand to-day and what delight you be the church there on the highest ground on the last hill overlook the great weald a sign in the sky a portent a necessary thing natural to the landscape what you see be a rectangular building with three eastern gable over three decorate window a long nave roof over square perpendicular window and clerestory flat outer roof and tall western tower a noble thing significant of we civilisation and the faith out of which it have come within one find a church like and yet unlike that at ashford nave and chancel be of the same width and the arcade run from end to end of the church really without a break though half way a wall bear by three arch cross the church separate the chancel and its chapel from the nave the central arch of the three be of course the chancel arch but the wall it bear do not reach to the roof so that the nave clerestory and roof be see run on beyond it all this be curious rather than lovely but like every other strangeness in england of my heart it be to be explain by the long long history of thing still -- deo gratias -- remain to we so that when i say that we building be growth rather than work of art i speak truth the church of st mary of great chart be not mention in the domesday survey but that a church exist here in the twelfth century be certain for even in the present building we have evidence of norman work for instance in the walling of the south chapel and in the vestry doorway accord to the rev gm livett -lrb- footnote : kas 26 -rrb- the norman nave be as long as that we have which be build in all probability on its foundation the aisleless norman church however have a central tower to the east of the present chancel arch and transept as well as a chancel this church appear to have stand till the fourteenth century when it be entirely rebuild and reclaim and all the lower part of the present church build to be heighten and lengthen at the end of the fifteenth century when the clerestory and the chancel arcade be build a new aisle wall set up on the north and the south aisle raise the rood loft build or rebuild we be remind of all this history by the fine altar tomb in the north chapel where lie william goldwell and alice he wife -lrb- d 1485 -rrb- they son jame be vicar of great chart in 1458 and become bishop of norwich in 1472 when he obtain from the pope a indulgence in aid of the restoration of great chart church which have be damage by fire here be the cause and the source of the fifteenth century alteration and the church we see the brass in the church be also interesting many of they commemorate the toke of godinton who found the almshouse in the village which rebuild more than once i think we still see all these thing and more than these the great yew in the churchyard have see as its shadow grow over the grave from great chart i go on through the spring sunshine across the weald to bethersden whose quarry have supply so much of the gray marble one find in kentish church in the monument and effigy and in the old manor house in the carve chimney-piece fair to see these quarry be now all but desert but of old they be the most famous in kent which be poor in such thing most of the stone for the cathedral and greater religious house in the county come from caen whence it be easily transport by water but this stone not only weathered badly but be too friable for monumental effigy or sculpture for these harder stone be need resemble marble and this bethersden supply as we may see in the cathedral of canterbury and rochester and especially at hythe where the chancel arcade be entirely build of it something too we may learn at bethersden of the true nature of the weald i shall have something to say of this later but here at any rate the curiously difficult character of this country in regard to the go may be understand though of course less easily now than of old it be say that before at the end of the eighteenth century the excellent system of road we still use be build up the way hereabouts be so bad -- they be still far from good -- that when spring come it be customary to plough they up in order that they might dry off we hear of great lady go to church in carriage draw by team of oxen hardly passable after rain the road say hast be so miry that the traveller 's horse frequently plunge through they up to the girth of the saddle and the waggon sink so deep in the rut as to slide along on the nave of the wheel and axle of they in some few of the principal road as from tenterden hither there be a stone causeway about three foot wide for the accommodation of horse and foot passenger but there be none further on till near bethersden to the great distress of traveller when these road become tolerably dry in summer they be plough up and lay in a half circle to dry the only amendment they ever have in extreme dry weather in summer they become exceedingly hard and by traffic so smooth as to seem glaze like a potter 's vessel though a single hour 's rain render they so slippery as to be very dangerous to traveller the road in fact be and be little more than lane between the isolate wood across the low scrub of the old weald the church of bethersden be dedicate to st margaret it follow the local type have a nave with north and south aisle and a chancel with north and south chapel vestry south porch and western tower the place be not mention in domesday book but about 1194 we find archbishop herbert confirm the church of st margaret of beatrichesdenne with the chapel of hecchisdenne -lrb- etchden -rrb- to the priory of st gregory in canterbury no sign of this norman church remain the building we see in bethersden be mainly perpendicular but the double light window at the west end of the north aisle be early english and there be a decorate niche under the entrance to the rood leave the tower be modern but possess a fourteenth century bell it be curious that though the church be dedicate to st margaret and the fair accord to hast be hold upon July 20th st margaret 's day the place should be speak of as beatrichesdenne as though there be some local st beatrice but of she we know nothing bethersden be connect with the lovelace for they own it richard lovelace the poet have sell lovelace place to richard hulse soon after the death of charle i three member of the lovelace family lie in the church they tomb mark by brass william lovelace -lrb- 1459 -rrb- another william lovelace gentleman -lrb- 1459 -rrb- and thoma lovelace -lrb- 1591 -rrb- from bethersden i go on to high halden which stand upon a ridge out of the weald a very characteristic and beautiful place with a most interesting church dedicate to we lady indeed i do not know where one could match the strange wooden tower and belfry and the noble fourteenth century porch masterpiece of carpentry which close on the west the little stone church of the fifteenth century within the most interesting thing leave to we be the glass in the east window of the south chancel where we see the bless virgin with she lily part of a annunciation there too in another window be the arm of castile and of leon a strange blazon to find in the weald of kent but characteristic as great chart bethersden and high halden be of this strange wealden county they do not express it sum it up and dominate it as do tenterden town some two or three mile to the south of high halden if we look at the ordnance map we shall see that the town of tenterden be set upon a great headland thrust out by the higher land of the kentish weald southward and east towards those low marshland that be lose almost imperceptibly in the sea and be know to we as romney marsh this great headland in shape something like a clenched fist stand between the two branch of the rother the river which flow into the sea at rye and which be once navigable by ship so far up as small hythe just under the southern escarpment of the headland upon which tenterden stand hither so late as 1509 the rother be navigable and we find archbishop warham on the petition of the people license a small chapel there of st john baptist still in existence for the use of the inhabitant and as a sanctuary or a graveyard for the burial of those wreck on the sea-shore _ infra predictum oppidum de smallhyth _ now in this lie all the greatness of tenterden rye which have early be add to the cinque port be a place of very considerable importance but upon the east it be entirely cut off by romney marsh upon the west too a considerable marshland close by a great and desolate hill country close it in but to the north be a navigable river a road that be lead up into england and at the head of it a town naturally spring up that town be tenterden and she true position be recognize by henry vi when he unite she to rye till then she be one of the seven hundred belong to the crown domesday book know nothing of she as a place of importance as a town that be she be a creation of rye and she development be thus necessarily late and endure but for a season i suppose the great day of rye to have be those of the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth century and it be therefore during this period that tenterden begin its career as a town after the failure of the sea rye sink slowly back into what it be to-day but tenterden would appear to have stand up against that misfortune with some success for we find elizabeth incorporate it under a charter there can be but few more charming town in kent than tenterden as we see it to-day look out from its headland southward to the great uplifted isle of oxney beyond which lie the sea and eastward over all the mystery of romney marsh the church which should one think have bear the name of st michael be dedicate in honor of st mildr it be a large building of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth century the tower its latest feature be also its noblest indeed the tower of tenterden church if we may believe the local legend be certainly the most important in kent for it be say and rightly understand there may after all be something in it to have be the cause of the goodwin sand fuller assert when the vicinage in kent meet to consult about the inundation of the goodwin sand -lrb- date not give -rrb- and what might be the cause thereof a old man imputed it to the building of tenterden steeple in this county for these sand say he be firm sand before that steeple be build which ever since be overfly with sea-water hereupon all heartily laugh at he unlogical reason make that effect in nature which be only the consequent on time not flow from but follow after the building of that steeple accord to latimer however it be sir thoma more who draw this answer from the ancient and if this be so it certainly fix the date maister more say latimer be once send in commission into kent to help to trie out -lrb- if it might be -rrb- what be the cause of goodwin sand and the shelf that stop up sandwich haven thither cometh maister more and calleth the countye afore he such as be think to be man of experience and man that could of likelihode best certify he of that matter concern the stop of sandwich haven among other come in before he a olde man with a white head and one that be think to be little lesse than a hundereth yeare olde when maister more see this aged man he think it expedient to heare he say he minde in this matter for be so olde a man it be likely that he know most of any man in that presence and company so maister more call this olde aged man unto he and sayd ` father ' sayd he ` tell I if ye can what be the cause of this great arise of the sande and shelf here about this haven the which sop it up that no shippe can aride here ye be the oldest man that i can espie in all this companye so that if any man can tell any cause of it ye of all likelihode can say most in it or at least wise more than any other man here assemble ' ` yea forsooth good maister ' quod this olde man ` for i be well nigh a hundred yeare olde and no man here in this company anything neare unto mine age ' ` well then ' quod maister more ` how say you in this matter what thinke ye to be the cause of these shelf and flatte that stop up sandwiche haven ' ` forsooth syr ' quod he ' i be a olde man i think tenterden steeple be the cause of goodwin sande for i be a old man syr ' quod he ` and i may remember the building of tenterden steeple and i may remember when there be no steeple at all there and before that tenterden steeple be in building there be no manner of speaking of any flat or sand that stop the haven and therefore i thinke that tenterden steeple be the cause of the destroy and decay of sandwich haven post hoc propter hoc and this silly old man have be hold up to all ensue age as a absurdly simple old fellow but what after all if he should be right in part at least tenterden church we be tell belong to the abbey of st augustine in canterbury which also own the goodwin sand part it be say of the immense domain of earl godwin now it be in they hand that the money collect throughout kent for the building and fencing of the coast against the sea have always be place we learn that when the sea have be very quiet for many year without any encroaching the abbot commute that money to the building of a steeple and endow of the church in tenterden so that the sea wall be neglect if this be so that oldest inhabitant be not such a fool as he seem to look i sleep under the shadow of tenterden steeple and very early in the morning set out for appledore where i cross the canal and come into the marsh i can not hope to express my enthusiasm for this strange and mysterious country so full of the music of run water with its wind road its immense pasture its cattle and sheep and flower its far away great hill and at the end though it have no end the sea it mix with the sea indeed as the sky do so that no man far off can say this be land or this be water it be famous as a fifth part of the world different from its fellow and indeed if it resemble anything i know it be not with the wide moor of somerset sedgemoor or the valley of the brue nor with the great windy fenland in the midst of which ely rise like a shrine or a sanctuary i would compare it but with the campagna of rome whose tragic mystery it seem to have borrow at least in part whose beauty it seem to wear a little provincially it be true and whose majesty it ape but can not quite command it be the campagna in little the great and noble mountain the loveliest in the world be sink to hill pure and exquisite upon which too we may still see the city here little town and village as rye winchelsea appledore lympne or hythe dear place of england of my heart and all between they this mysterious and lowly thing not quite of this world a graveyard one might think as the campagna be a battlefield as be the trasimeno plain a gate and certainly a exit not only out of england but from the world and life itself as one wander about england here and there one come to understand that if its landscape be unique in its various charm and soft beauty it be also inhuman in this that most often it be without the figure of man the field be always empty or nearly always the hill be uniformly barren of city or town or village it be a landscape without the gesture of human toil and life without mean that be and we can bear it so but no man could live in the marsh for a day without that gesture of human life that be there to be see upon every side lonely as it be difficult as it be to cross because of its chain and twist line of runnel man be more visibly we comrade there than anywhere else in england i think and this though there be but few man through all the marsh he and he beast he work too and he song redeem the marsh for we from fear a fear not quite explicable perhaps to the mere passenger but that anyone who have linger there during a month of spring will recognize as always at he elbow and only keep out of the soul by the humanity which have redeem this mysterious country the shepherd with he flock the dairyman with he cow the carter with he great team of ox in the spring twilight return from the field and then there be the church whose tower stand up so strong out of the water and the mist so that they head be among the star and whose bell be the best music because they tell not only of god and he saint but of man of the steading and of home -lrb- illustration : a corner of romney marsh -rrb- take appledore for instance with its fine old church with its air of the fourteenth century and its beautiful old ivy grow tower once a port they say on the verge of the marsh what could be more nobly simple and homely within you may if you will find in spite of everything all we past the very altar at which of old be say the holy mass the very altar tomb maybe where upon maunday Thursday christ himself be lay in the sepulchre a old rood loft too certain ancient screen complete a little ancient glass what more can a man want or at least expect from england of my heart and if he demand something more curious and more rare at horn 's place not a mile away be a perfect chapel of the fifteenth century which serve of old some great steading where for a hundred year mass be perhaps say every day and the marsh bless or take snargate with its church of st dunstan it too have a fine western tower of the fifteenth century but much of the church date from the thirteenth and upon the north chancel roof-beam be heraldic device among they a eagle and the initial wr and here be a piece of fine old glass in which we may see the lord christ or take ivychurch so noble and lovely a thing be the church that even without it catch the breath while a whole afternoon be not enough to enjoy its inward beauty or take brenzett where it be true the church have be rebuild but where you will still find a noble seventeenth century tomb with its effigy in armor it be however at romney old romney and new that we shall find the best there be to be have i think in this strange country from which the water have only be bar out by the continual energy of man we be not surprise to find that new romney be older than old romney it be almost what might have be expect but no one can ever have come to these place without wonder at the nobility of what he see at new romney there be of old five church dedicate in honor of st john baptist st laurence st martin st michael and st nichola for romney be in the time of edward i the greatest of the cinque port it fall when as we be tell in a great storm the course of the rother be change so that it go thereafter to serve rye and new romney fall slowly down so that to-day but one of those five church remain that of st nichola but what a glorious church it be and if the rest be like it what idea must we have of the splendor of new romney in the thirteenth century this great norman church of st nichola with its partly fourteenth century nave its clerestory its fine chancel with sedilium and easter sepulchre and noble pinnacled tower be perhaps the greatest building in the marsh it belong to the abbey of pontigny and be serve by its monk who have a cell here and the town it adorn and ennoble be the capital of all this district nothing so glorious and so old remains in old romney where the church of st clement have nothing i think earlier than the thirteenth century and little of that be mainly a building of the fourteenth and fifteenth century and yet it be not to be despise for where else in the marsh will you find anything more picturesque or anything indeed more english not at dymchurch for all its norman fragment but dymchurch be to be visit and to be love for other reason than that of beauty it be the sentinel and savior of the marsh for it hold back the sea from all this country with its great wall twenty foot high and twenty foot broad and three mile long also here we have certain evidence of the roman occupation of the marsh and may perhaps believe that it be rome which first drain it i say that the church of st nichola at new romney be the noblest building in the marsh when i say so have i forget the church of all saint at lydd which be know as the cathedral of the marsh no glorious as all saint be it have not the antiquity of st nichola it be altogether english and never know the norman for all that it be a very splendid building with a tower stand one hundred and thirty-two foot over the marsh a sign and a blessing and yet before it i prefer the bell tower build of mighty timber aloof from the church lonely over the water at brookland all saint at lydd belong to tintern abbey but all saint at brookland to st augustine 's at canterbury and as its font will tell we it date from norman time for about it the norman carve the sign of the zodiac brookland hard to get at stand on the great road which run south - westward out of the marsh and bring you at last out of kent into sussex at rye it be there i linger a little to say farewell as one look at evening across that vast loneliness so desolate and yet so beautiful and infinitely subject to the sky lie between the hill and sink so imperceptibly into the sea one continually ask oneself what be romney marsh by whom be it reclaim from the all-devouring sea what force build it up and gather from barrenness the infinite riches we see be it the various force of nature the racing tide of the strait some sudden upheaval of the earth or the tireless energy of man -- and of what man those seventeen mile of richest pasture which lie in a infinite peace between appledore and dungeness to whom do we owe they and they blessedness that wall at dymchurch which save the marsh romney welland guildford and denge who contrived it and first take advantage of those great bank of shingle and of sand which everywhere bar out the great tide of the strait and have thus create and preserve this strange fifth part of the world be it the roman may we see in romney marsh the greatest material memorial of they gigantic energy and art to be find in the western province a nobler and a greater work than the wall as well as a more lasting and if this be so how well be the marsh name after they for of all they do materially in we island this work of reclamation be surely the worthiest to bear they name but to these question there can perhaps never be a answer certainly the very aspect of the marsh recall nothing so much as the campagna of rome in its nobility loneliness and infinite subjection to the sun the cloud and the sky so that at evening there we might almost think that rome herself lay only just beyond that large horizon and that with a effort we might reach the great gate of san giovannus e'er darkness fall it be as though in the marsh we origin for once and unmistakably be lay bare for we and we have suddenly recognize we home chapter ix rye and winchelsea out of the vagueness and loneliness of the marsh with its strange level light and tingling silence i climb one spring evening at sunset into the ancient town of rye and at first i could not believe i be still in england no one i think can wander for more than a few day about the marsh among those half desert church far too big for any visible congregation whose tower in a kind of despair still stand up before god against the sea rage and plot far off against the land without wonder at last into what country he have stray in rye all such doubt be resolve at once for rye be pure italy or at least it seem so in the evening dusk when i come up into it in the spring twilight out of the marsh i be remind of one of those italian city which stand up over the lean shore of the adriatic to the south of riminus but it be not of they i think when in the morning sunlight i see those red roof pile up one upon another from the plain : it be of siena and indeed rye be in its smaller less complete and of course less exquisite way very like the most beautiful city in tuscany here too as in siena the red-roofed house climb up a hill one upon another a hill crown at last by a great church dedicate in honor of the bless virgin but here the likeness too fanciful for reality cease altogether it be true that siena look out beyond she own garden and vineyard upon a desert but it be a very different desolation upon which rye gaze all day long out of which she rise with all the confidence grace and gaiety of a flower and over which she rule like a queen from the porta romana of siena or the outlook of the servus you gaze southward across the barren scorched valley to the far-away mountain to monte amiata the fairest mountain of tuscany from the ypre tower of rye or the gun garden below it you look only across the level and empty marsh which sink beyond camber castle imperceptibly into the greyness and barrenness of the sea to the east across the flat emptiness the rother crawl seaward to the west across the marsh as once across the sea winchelsea rise against the wood and beyond far away the darkness of fairlight hang like a cloud twixt sea and sky indeed to liken rye to any other place be to do she wrong for both in herself and in that landscape over which she brood there be enough beauty and enough character to give she a life and a meaning altogether she own from afar off from winchelsea for instance in the sunlight she seem like a town in a missal crown by that church which seem so much bigger than it be gay and warm and yet with something of the greyness of the sea and the sea wind about she a place that as so few english place do altogether make a picture in the mind and be at unity with itself and from within she seem not less complete a thing wholly ancient delightful with a picturesque and yet homely beauty that be the child of ancientness yet how much have rye lose the wall of coeur de lion have fall and only one of the gate remain but so long as the church and the beautiful strong tower of william de ypre stand and the narrow cobble street full of old and humble house climb up and down the steep hill the whole place be involve in they beauty and sanctity we heart be satisfied and we eye engage on behalf of a place at once so old and picturesque and yet so neat and tidy and always ready to receive a guest a place like rye naturally so strong a steep island surround by sea or impassable marsh must have be a stronghold from very early time it be in fact obviously old when we first hear of it as a gift with winchelsea of edward the confessor 's to the benedictine abbey of fécamp just across the gray channel in normandy both rye and winchelsea remain within the keep of the abbey of fécamp until for reason of state easy to be understand henry iii resume the royal rights in the thirteenth century compensate the monk of fécamp with manor in gloucestershire and lincolnshire for before the end of the twelfth century it would seem rye with winchelsea have become of so much importance as a port as to have be add to the famous cinque port sandwich dover hythe romney and hasting from this time both play a considerable part in the trade and politics of the channel and the strait it be to enable she to hold herself secure in this business and especially against raid from the sea that the ypre tower be build in the time of king stephen by william of ypre earl of kent it be a watch tower and perhaps a stronghold but it be never sufficient even in 1194 coeur de lion permit the town to wall itself nevertheless loui the dauphin of france take rye and it may well have be this which determine henry iii to take the town out of the hand of the monk of fécamp and to hold it himself doubtless rye 's greatest moment be this thirteenth century nor do she appear much less in the fourteenth and the first half of the fifteenth century but often sack and burn the town be practically destroy by the french in 1378 and 1448 when only the ypre tower part of the church the landgate the strandgate and the so-called chapel of the carmelite friar escape destruction but from this blow rye recover to play a part if a small one in the defeat of the armada and though the retreat of the sea which seem to have begin in the sixteenth century undoubtedly damage she it do not kill she outright as it do winchelsea for she have the rother to help she and we find she prosperous not only in the time of the commonwealth but even to-day when with the help of a new harbor at the mouth of the river she be still able to carry on she trade -lrb- illustration : rye -rrb- nothing in fact strike the visitor to rye more than the bustle and life of a place obviously so old all the street be steep and narrow and the chief of they the high street seem always to be gay and full of business and be as truly characteristic of rye as those still and grass-grown way cobble and half desert which lead up to the noble great church in its curious _ place _ it be of course to this great sanctuary dedicate in honor of the bless virgin that everyone will go first in rye it have be call the largest parish church in england and though this claim can not be make good it be in all probability the largest in sussex be in fact know as the cathedral of east sussex and if a church become a cathedral by reason of its beauty and size it might rightly claim the title it be certainly worthy of the most loving attention the church of we lady at rye be a great cruciform building with clerestory transept and central tower but without western door the chief entrance be in the north transept the church be of all date from the norman time onward a very english patchwork here due to the depredation not so much of time as of the french who have so often raid and burn the town the oldest part be the tower which be norman as be though somewhat later the transept where certain detail show the transitional style in this style again but somewhat later be the nave the chancel and its two chapel be early english but with many important decorate perpendicular and modern detail such as the arcade and the window the early english chapel upon the north be that of st clare that upon the south be dedicate in honor of st nichola in the south aisle of the nave be a early english chantry now use as a vestry the communion table of carve mahogany be say to have be take from a spanish ship at the time of the armada but it would seem certainly not to be older than the end of the seventeenth century the curious clock whose bell be strike by golden cherub on the north side of the tower be say to have be a gift of queen elizabeth and to be the oldest clock in england still in good order it be probably of late caroline construction but even though it be of the sixteenth century its claim to be the oldest clock now at work in england could not be uphold for a moment that in well cathedral be far older the pulpit be of the sixteenth century in the north aisle be a curious collection of bible and cannon ball and here too be a small window with glass by burne jone to the south-west of the church be the so-called carmelite chapel a late decorate building what exactly this be and to whom it belong be uncertain it be not a chapel of carmelite friar the only establishment belong to that order within the county of suss be at shoreham found in honor of the bless virgin by sir john de mowbray in 1316 so far as we know the only religious to be find in rye at the time of the spoliation be the austin friar they house still stand -- a building of the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century -- on the conduit hill it have pass through many strange use among other that of a salvation army barrack it be now the anglican church house this be the only settlement of the austin friar in sussex and of its origin nothing be know in 1368 we hear that the prior and convent of the friar eremite of st austin in rye permit one of they brethren a priest to say mass daily at the altar of st nichola in the parish church for the welfare of william taylor of rye and of agne he wife in 1378 the town grant they a place call le haltone near the town ditch but apart from these two fact they history be altogether want from the parish church one descend south-east to the ypre tower this watch tower and stronghold be build in the time of king stephen by william of ypre earl of kent and be in many way the most impressive building leave to we in rye it be undoubtedly best see from the river but it and the garden below it afford a great view over the marsh on a clear day eastward to the cliff of folkestone and westward to fairlight in itself it be a plain rectangular building with round tower at the angle but with nothing of interest within yet what would rye be without it for many year it be the sole defense of the town most of those who come to rye enter the town and with a sudden surprise not to be find elsewhere by the landgate upon the north there be it be say of old five gate about the town but this be the only one leave to we nothing or almost nothing of the wall remain doubtless the french destroy anything in the nature of fortification so far as they could only the ypre tower they fail to pull down or to burn and this great round tower gateway upon the north -- why we do not know it be the landgate which give to rye its power of surprise so that a man come up from the railway at sight of it be suddenly transport into the middle age and in that dream enter and enjoy rye town which have never disappoint those who have come in the right spirit for besides the monument of which i have speak there be other of lesser interest it be true but that altogether go to make up the charm and delight of this unique place among these i will name mermaid street where the grass grow among the cobble and where stand the mermaid inn and the half timber house call the hospital pocock 's school and queen elizabeth 's well better still for I at least be the life of the river and the shipyard where though rye be now two mile from the sea ship be still build and the life of the place and its heart be adventured and set upon the great water so alluring indeed be this little town that one be always loath to leave it one continually excuse oneself from departure one day i delay in order to see the famous poem in the old book in the town archive which i already know from mr luca 's book it be certainly of henry viii 's time and who could have write it but that unhappy sir thoma wyatt who love anne boleyn -- what greater gryffe may hape trew lover to anoye then absente for to sepratte they from ther desiered joye what comforte reste they then to ease they of ther smarte but for to thincke and myndful bee of they they love in harte and sicke that they assure bee ehche toe another in harte that nothinge shall they seperate untylle deathe doe they parte and thoughe the dystance of the place doe severe we in twayne yet shall my harte thy harte imbrace tyll we doe meete agayne then one sunny afternoon i go out by the road past camber castle across rye foreign for winchelsea on its hill some two mile from rye to the west there be surely nothing in the world quite like winchelsea lovelier by far than rye not only in itself but because of what it offer you those view of hill and marsh and sea with rye itself like i know not what little masterpiece of flemish art in the middle distance eastward winchelsea be a place never to be leave or at worst never to be forget one come to it from rye on a still afternoon of spring when the faint shadow be begin to lengthen expect little in fact if the traveller be acceptable capable of appreciate anything so still and exquisite winchelsea will appear to he to be as it be one of the loveliest thing leave to we in england place as coventry patmore so well say in a trance la belle a boi dormant nowhere else in england certainly have i find just that exquisite stillness that air of enchantment as of something not real something in a picture or a poem inexplicable and inexpressible how spacious it be and how quiet full of the sweetness and the beauty of some motet by byrd history be little to we in such a place which be to be enjoy for its own sake for its own unique beauty and delight and yet the history of winchelsea be almost as unique as be the place itself winchelsea when we first hear of it as give by king edward confessor to the monk of fécamp be not set upon this hill-top as we see it to-day but upon a island low and flat now submerge some three mile south and east of the present town here william the conqueror land upon he return from normandy when he set out to take exeter and subdue the west here again two of those knight who murder st thoma land in they pride hot from the court of henry they master like rye its sister to whom it look across the sea winchelsea be add to the cinque port and be presently take from the monk of fécamp by henry iii it be now its disaster begin in 1236 it be inundate by the sea as again in 1250 when it be half destroy eagerly upon the side of montfort it be take after evesham by prince edward and its inhabitant slay so that when in 1288 it be again drown by the sea it be decide to refound the town upon the hill above then in the possession of battle abbey which the king purchase for this purpose at that time the hill upon which winchelsea be build and still stand be wash by the sea and the harbor soon become of very great importance indeed until the sixteenth century when the sea begin to retire winchelsea be of much greater importance than rye the retreat of the sea however completely ruin it for it be serve by no river as rye be by the rother the town of edward i as we may see to-day by what time have leave we of it be build in square a truly latin arrangement the street all remain at right angle the one to the other it have three gate and be defend upon the west where it be not naturally strong by a great ditch it be attack and sack by the french as often as rye though not always at the same time thus in 1377 when rye be half destroy winchelsea be save by the abbot of battle only to be take three year later by john de vienne when the town be burnt no doubt these constant and mostly successful attack deeply injure the place which after the sea have begin to retreat in the sixteenth century at the time of elizabeth 's visit in 1573 only muster some sixty family from that time winchelsea slowly decline till there remain only the exquisite ghost we see to-day one come up out of the marsh into winchelsea to-day through the strand gate of the time of edward i and presently find oneself in the beautiful and spacious square in which stand the lovely fragment of the church of st thoma of canterbury this extraordinarily lovely building date from the fourteenth century as we see it it be but a fragment consist of the chancel and two side chapel but as originally plan it would seem to have be a cruciform building of chancel choir with side chapel a central tower transept and nave it be doubtful however whether the nave be ever build the ruin of the transept and of two pier of the tower only remain i say it be doubtful whether this nave be ever build it have be assert it be true that it be burn by the french either in 1380 or in 1449 but it seem more probable that it be never complete owe to the devastation of the black death of 1348-9 though certain discovery make of late would seem to endorse the older theory certain it be that until the end of the eighteenth century there stand to the south-west of the church a great bell tower a detach campanile now dismantle whose stone be say to have be use to build rye harbor the church as we have it be one of the loveliest decorate building in the county the perpendicular porch however by which we enter do not belong to the church but possibly come here from one of the destroy church of winchelsea st gile 's or st leonard 's within we find ourselves in a great choir or chancel with a chapel on either hand that on the right dedicate in honor of st nichola and know as the alard chantry that on the leave the lady chapel know as the farncombe chantry the arcade which divide these chapel from the choir be extraordinarily beautiful as be the restore sedilium and piscina with they gable and pinnacle and lovely diaper work the window too be very noble and fine and rich in they tracery which might seem to be scarcely english -lrb- illustration : winchelsea church -rrb- in the chapel of st nichola the alard chantry on the south be the glorious canopied tomb of gervase alard -lrb- 1300 -rrb- and stephen alard the first be the finer it be the tomb of the first lord high admiral of england the sepulchral effigy lie cross-legged with a heart in its hand and a lion at its foot and about its head two angel once kneel the whole be doubtless once glorious with color trace of which still remain on the beautiful diaper work of the recess the tomb of stephen alard be later but similar though less rich stephen be admiral of the cinque port in

canopy with a knight in chain armor a lady and a young squire we be ignorant whose they may be it be certain that these tomb be older than the church and they be say to have be bring here from old winchelsea but winchelsea have other ruin and other memory besides those to be find in the parish church the franciscan the gray friar be establish in winchelsea very early certainly before 1253 and when old winchelsea be destroy and the new town build on the hill by the king it be agree that no monastery or friary should be build there save only a house for the friar minor this be erect where now the modern mansion call ` the friar ' stand the old convent have be pull down so lately as 1819 a part of the ruin chapel of the bless virgin remains however the choir and apse decorate work not much later than the parish church and of great beauty unhappily we know absolutely nothing of the friar in winchelsea except that when the house be suppress in 1538 it be exceedingly poor the franciscan however be not the only friar in winchelsea in spite of the agreement make at the foundation of the new town in 1318 edward ii grant the black friar the dominican twelve acre on the southern side of the hill this situation be find inconvenient and in 1357 the dominican obtain six acre near the town nothing or almost nothing remain of they house besides these two religious house winchelsea possess three hospital those of st john st bartholomew and holy cross the hospital of st bartholomew be near the new gate on the south-west of the town and date from the refounding of edward nothing remain of it or of the hospital of holy cross which have exist in old winchelsea and be set up in the new town also near the new gate but the oldest and the most important of the three hospital be that of st john a fragment of this remain where the road turn towards hasting to the north of the churchyard close by be the thirteenth - century court house it be always with regret i leave winchelsea when i must and even the beautiful road through icklesham into hasting will not reconcile one who have know how to love this place to departure and yet how fair that road be and how fair be the norman church of st nichola at icklesham upon the way the road wind up over the low shore towards fairlight ever before one and at last as one go up guestle hill through a whole long afternoon and reach the king 's head inn at sunset suddenly across the smoke of hasting one see pevensey level and beyond the hill where fall the great fight in which william duke of normandy dispute for england with harold the king at sunset when all that country be half lose in the approach darkness one seem to feel again the tragedy of that day so fortunate after all in which once more we be bring back into the full life of europe and renew with the energy rome have store in gaul chapter x the battle of hasting it be not often on one 's way even in england of my heart that one can come upon a place a lonely hill-side or a city and say : this be a spot upon which the history of the world be decide yet i be able on that showery morning as i go up out of hasting towards battle and see all the level of pevensey full of rain to recall two such place in which i have stand already upon my pilgrimage for i have linger a whole morning upon the battlefield where the roman first meet and overthrow we forefather and thus bring britain within the empire while at canterbury i have be in the very place where after a incredible disaster england be persuade back again out of barbarism into the splendor of the faith and of civilisation these place be more than english they be european sanctuary two of the greater site of the history of europe perhaps as much can not rightly be say for the hill where the town of battle stand the landing-place at pevensey and the port of hasting and yet i do not know what a different england it would have be if william of normandy have fail or have never land here at all and if such a england could have endure how change would have be the whole destiny of europe i be not sure after all that we ought not to be as uplift by the memory of hasting as we be or should be by the memory of caesar 's advent at any rate since hasting be fight and win in the eleventh century any national prejudice that belong wholly to the modern world be quite as much out of place with regard to it as they be with regard to caesar or st augustine and if we must be indignant and remember old injury that as often as not be sheer blessing scarcely in disguise let we reserve we hatred scorn and contempt for those damned pagan and pirate horde that first from schleswig-holstein and later from denmark descend upon we christian country and for a time overwhelm we with they brutish barbarism as for I i be for the duke of normandy without he england be not the england of my heart now the great and beautiful road up out of hasting seven mile into battle be not only one of the loveliest in britain every yard of it be full of duke william 's army and thence we may see how in its wonderful simplicity all that mighty business which be decide that October morning on the hill-top that for so long battle abbey guard as a holy place be accomplish for look southward over the often steep escarpment always between three and five hundred foot over the sea plain we may see pevensey castle the landing hasting the port and at last come to battle the scene of the fight that give england to the norman for we enormous good and glory and honor i say that the struggle for the english crown between duke william of normandy and harold king of england be in no sense of the word a national struggle on the contrary it be a personal question fight and decide by the duke of normandy and he man and harold and he man indeed the society of that time be altogether innocent of any impulse which could be call national that society all of one piece as it be both in england and in gaul be wholly feudal though somewhat less precisely so here than in normandy man 's allegiance be not give to any such vague unity as england but to a feudal lord in whose quarrel they be bind to fight in whose victory they share and in whose defeat they suffer the quarrel between king harold and duke william be in no sense of the word a national quarrel but a personal dispute in which the feudal adherent of both party be necessarily involve the gage be the crown and spoil of england this be at once obvious when we remember that the ground of william 's claim to the throne be a promise receive from king edward personally unconfirmed by council or witan but endorse for he own part by harold when shipwreck have place he in duke william 's power such be the true element of the dispute it be true that the society of that time be as i have say all of one piece both in england and in gaul but it be certain that in england that society be less precisely organise less conscious of itself less logical in its structure in a word less real and more barbarous than that of the norman the victory of duke william mean that the sluggish english system would be replace or at any rate reinvigorate by a energy and a intelligence foreign to it without which it might seem certain that civilisation here would have fall into utter decay or have perish altogether the service of duke william then while not so great as that of caesar and certainly far less than that of st augustine be of the same kind he rescue england from barbarism and bring we back into the full light of europe the campaign in which that great service be achieve divide itself into two part the first of which come to a end with the decisive action at hasting which give duke william the crown the second consist of three great fight march the result of which be the conquest of england i be only here concern with the first part of that campaign and more especially with the great engagement which be fight out upon the hill-top which the ruin of battle abbey still mark let we consider this harold the second son of earl godwin be crown king of england at westminster upon the feast of the epiphany in the year 1066 when duke william hear of it he be both angry and amaze and at once begin to call up he feudatory to lend he aid to enforce he claim to the crown of england against king harold this be not a easy thing to do nor could it be do at all quickly it be necessary to gather a great host those lord who owe he allegiance have as often as not to be persuade or bribe to fulfil they obligation and they with they follower and dependent be not enough it be necessary to engage as many as possible of those chief who do not own he as lord these have to be buy by promise of gain and honor also a considerable fleet have to be build all this take time and harold be therefore perfectly aware of what duke william intend and gather he force both of ship and man to meet he in the south of england all through the spring and summer he wait in vain meantime soon after easter a strange portent appear in the heaven the comet star which some man call the hairy star and no man could say what it might mean it be not this however which delay william he be not ready it be possible that have he be able to advance during the summer the whole history of england might have be different as it be when autumn be at hand with the birthday of the bless virgin harold 's man be out of provision and weary of wait they be allow to disperse harold himself go to london and the fleet beat up into the thame not without damage and loss against the wind which have he but know it now alone delay the duke but that wind which keep william in port bring another enemy of harold 's to england with some three hundred galley hardrada of norway who come to support the claim of tostig now he man king harold 's exile brother to northumbrium for the northumbrian have rebel against he and harold have acquiesce in they choice of morkere for lord neither morkere nor he brother edwin with they local force be able to meet hardrada with success they attempt to enter york but at fulford on the 20th September they be route and hardrada hold the great northern capital meanwhile harold have not be idle gather he scattered force he march north with amazing speed cover the two hundred mile between london and tadcaster in nine day to meet this new foe but this almost marvellous performance leave the south undefended he enter york on September 25th and on the same day seven mile from the city at stamford bridge he engage the enemy and break they utterly three day later william land at pevensey what could harold do he do all that a man could do william have land at pevensey upon Thursday September 28th it be probable that harold hear of it on the follow Monday October 2nd immediately he set out for london which by hard ride he reach though probably with but a few man on Friday October 6th a amazing achievement only make possible by the great roman road between york and london upon the follow Tuesday and Wednesday he be join by he victorious force from the north who have thus repeat they unequalled feat and march south again as they have north some two hundred mile in nine day upon Wednesday October 11th harold march out of london at the head of this force and by the evening of October 13th -- a day curiously enough to be keep later as the feast of st edward the confessor -- this heroic force have march in forty-eight hour some sixty mile across country and be in position upon that famous hill some two hour from the coast overlook the landing - place of william at pevensey and the port he have seize at hasting that great march have i think never be equal by any british army before or since it might seem strange that william who have land at pevensey upon the 28th of September have not advance at all from the sea-coast when harold and he man appear upon that hill after they great march from york upon October 13th but in fact william norman as he be have a very clear idea of what he intend to do he leave little to chance he land he man at pevensey seize upon hasting and beach he ship then for a whole fortnight he await the hot and weary return of harold harold appear upon the evening of October 13th upon the follow day a Saturday the battle william have expect be fight harold be slay and he heroic force destroy the story of that day be well know harold 's force be draw up upon the ridge where the ruin of battle abbey now stand william upon the thirteenth have march out of hasting and have occupy the hill to the east call telham where to-day stand telham court in those day probably no village or habitation of any sort occupy either of these height one of the chronicler call the battlefield the place of the hoar apple tree it be say that the night of October 13th be pass by harold and he man in feast and in jollity while the norman confess they sin and receive absolution however that may be in the full daylight about nine o'clock of Saturday October 14th the battle be join this tremendous affair which be to have such enormous consequence be open by the minstrel taellefer who have besought leave of duke william to strike the first blow between the two army he ride sing the song of roland and high into the air he fling he lance and catch it three time e'er he hurl it at last into the amaze english to fall at last slay by a hundred javelin as he ride back into the norman front thus be begin the most famous battle ever fight in england it endure without advantage either way for some six hour till the norman horse fling back from the charge fall into the malfosse in utter confusion and the day seem lose to the norman but odo bishop of bayeux retrieve it and from that time about three o'clock the norman begin to have the advantage the battle seem to have be decide at last by two clever device attribute to william himself he determine to break harold 's line and since he have not be able to do this by repeat charge he determine to try a stratagem therefore he order he man to feign flight and thus to draw the english after they in pursuit this be successfully do and when the english follow they be easily surround and slay william 's other device be say to have be that of shooting high into the air so that the arrow might turn and fall as from the sky upon the foe this stratagem be say to have be the cause of harold 's death for it be a arrow fall from on high and pierce he through the right eye that kill he or so grievously wound he that he be leave for dead to be finally kill by eustace of boulogne and three other knight with harold down there can have be little hope of victory leave to he man and indeed before night william have plant the pope 's banner where harold 's have float and hold the battlefield there he sup among the dead and have spend Sunday October 15th in bury the fall he set out not for london but for dover for he simple and precise plan be to secure all the entry into england from the continent before secure the capital when he have do this he march up into england by the watle street burn southwark cross the thame at wallingford receive there the submission of the archbishop of canterbury and at berkhampstead the submission of london and the offer of the crown which he receive at westminster at mass upon christmas day twelve day less than a year after harold have be crown in the same place one come to battle to-day along that great and beautiful road high up over the sea plain which still seem full with memory of the norman advance from hasting think of all that great business if one come up on Tuesday upon payment of sixpence one be admit to the garden of the house in which lie the ruin of the abbey william found in thankfulness to god for he victory the high altar of which be set upon the very spot where harold fall : hic harold rex interfectus est it be while william be encamp upon telham hill expect the battle of the morrow that he vow a abbey to god if he give he the victory he be hear by a monk of marmoutier a certain william call the smith who when duke william have receive the crown at westminster remind he of he promise the king acknowledge he obligation and bid william of marmoutier to see to its fulfilment the monk thereupon return to marmoutier and choose four other bring they to england but find the actual battlefield unsuited for a monastery since there be no water there he design to build lower down towards the west now when the king hear of it he be angry and bid they build upon the field itself nor would he hear they patiently when they assert there be no water there for say he : if god spare I i will so fully provide this place that wine shall be more abundant there than water be in any abbey in the land then say they that there be no stone but he answer that he would bring they stone from caen this however be not do for a quarry be find close by also the king richly endow the house give it all the land within a radius of a league and there the abbot be to be absolute lord free of bishop and royal officer -lrb- footnote : the unique privilege of the abbot of battle include the right to kill and take one or two beast with dog in any of the king 's forest -rrb- and very many manor beside yet ten year elapse before the abbey of battle be sufficiently complete to receive a abbot in 1076 however robert blancard one of the four monk choose by william of marmoutier be appoint but he die e'er he come to battle then one gausbert be send from marmoutier and he come with four of he brethren and be consecrate abbot of st martin 's of the place of battle beside the extraordinary gift and privilege which the conqueror have bestow upon the abbey in he lifetime upon he death he bequeath to it he royal embroidered cloak a splendid collection of relic and a portable altar contain relic possibly the very one upon which harold have swear in he captivity in normandy to support he claim to england william be say to have intend the monastery to be fill with sixty monk we do not know whether this number ever really serve there in 1393 but that be after the black death there appear to have be some twenty-seven and in 1404 but thirty in 1535 on the eve of the suppression battle abbey be visit by the infamous layton who report to thoma cromwell that all but two or three of the monk be guilty of unnatural crime and be traitor add that the abbot be a arrant churl and that this black sort of develish monk i be sorry to know be past amendment little more than two year later the abbot surrender the abbey and receive a pension of one hundred pound the furniture and so forth of the house be then very poor so beggary a house i never see nor so filthy stuff layton write to wriothesley i will not 20s for all the hanging in this house in August 1538 the place be grant to sir anthony browne who be say to have remove the cloak of the conqueror and the famous battle abbey roll to cowdray this rascal raze the church and cloister to the ground and make the abbot 's lodge he dwelling it be say that one night as he be feast a monk appear before he and solemnly curse he prophesy that he family should perish by fire to the fulfilment of this curse cowdray bear witness even to this day -lrb- illustration : battle abbey -rrb- what spoliation time and neglect have leave of the abbey be beautiful especially the great fourteenth century gateway which face the market green nothing save the foundation be leave of the great church from the terrace doubtless we look across the battlefield but all be so change the bleak hill-top have become a superb garden that it be impossible to realize still less to reconstruct the battle and indeed since we can only visit the place amid a crowd of tourist we present discomfort make any remembrance of the fight or of the great and solemn abbey which for so long turn that battlefield into a sanctuary impossible nor indeed be we more fortunate in the parish church which be originally build by abbot ralph in the twelfth century it have be so tampered with and restore that little remain that be unspoilt there and i think most fittingly lie that sir anthony browne who get battle abbey from the king who have steal it now when i have see all this i go on my way and because i be unhappy on account of all that theft and destruction and because where once there have be altar and monk to serve it now there be none and because what have once be common to we all be now become the pleasure of one man i go up out of battle into the hill by the great road through the wood and so on and up by dallington and heathfield and so down and down and down all a summer day across the weald till at evening i come to lewe where i sleep i remember nothing of that day but the wind and the hill and the great sun of may which go ever before I into the west so that i soon forget to be sorry and rejoice as i go chapter xi lewe and simon de montfort i do not know of a more beautiful town than lewe in all the wide south country it be beautiful not only in itself but in its situation set there upon a isolate hill over the ouse and surround as though they be great natural bastion set there in she defense by mall hill on the north mount caburn on the west the broken height of the downs to the south through which the ouse flow towards newhaven and the sea and on the east by mount harry under which be fight the very famous battle of lewe in which simon de montfort take he king prisoner the natural strength and beauty of this situation have be much increase by the labor of man for lewe be set as it be all in a garden out of which it rise a pinnacle of old house crown by the castle upon its half precipitous hill it be a curiously un-english vision you get from the high street for instance look back upon the hill or from the little borgo of southover or from cliffe and yet there can be few more solidly english place than lewe that the roman have here some sort of settlement there can be no doubt that lewe be a place of habitation in the time of the saxon be certain indeed in athelstan 's day it boast of two mint but the town as it appear to we in history grow up about the cluniac priory of st pancra under the protection of the castle and to these it owe everything except its genesis whatever lewe may have be before the conquest that revolution see it pass into the power of one of the greatest of william 's noble that william de warenne who be he son-in-law it be he and he wife gundrada generally suppose to be the conqueror 's daughter who found the priory of st pancra at southover it be probable even certain that a chapel possibly with some sort of religious house attach to it exist here before william de warenne obtain from the conqueror the rape and town of lewe in any case it can have be of small importance but within ten year of the conquest william de warenne and he wife determine to find a important monastery at the gate of they town and with this intention they set out on pilgrimage for rome to consult and to obtain the blessing of the pope they get so far as burgundy when they find that it be impossible to go on in safety on account of the war between the pope and the emperor when they find themselves in this predicament they be not far from the great abbey of ss peter and paul at cluny now the cluniac congregation the first great reform of the benedictine order have be found there in the diocese of macon in 910 and it be then at the height of its power and greatness cluny be the most completely feudal of the order for the cluniac monk be govern by prior each and all of whom be answerable only to the abbot of cluny himself while every monk in the order have to be profess by he that mighty ecclesiastic at this time can have be master of not less than two thousand monk cluny 's boast be its school and the splendor of its ceremony and service god be serve with a marvellous dignity and luxury undreamed of before and unequalled since cluny decline it be to this mother house of the greatest congregation of the time that william de warenne turn with he wife when war prevent they on the road to rome and we can not wonder that they be so catch by all they see that they determine to put the monastery they propose to build under the abbot of cluny and to find a cluniac priory at the gate of they town of lewe they therefore approach the abbot with the request that he would send three or four of he monk to start the monastery they do not find he very willing for the essence of cluny be discipline the discipline of a army and doubtless the abbot fear that so far away as sussex seem he monk would be out of he reach and might become but as other man but at last the conqueror himself join he prayer to those of william de warenne and in 1076 the abbot of cluny send the monk lanzo and three other brethren to england and to they william de warenne give the little church of st pancra especially rebuild for they use with the land about it call the island and other land sufficient to support twelve monk but the abbot of cluny have no sooner agree to establish he congregation in england than he seem to have repent at any rate he recall prior lanzo and keep he so long that william de warenne grow impatient seriously thought of transfer he foundation to the benedictine but at length prior lanzo return and all be arrange as be at first intend the monastery flourish apace and grow not only in wealth but in piety prior lanzo prove a excellent ruler and the priory of st pancra at lewe become famous for its sanctity through all england to the same william de warenne lewe owe the foundation or the refoundation of its castle the second center about which the town grow a glance at the map will assure we that lewe could not but be a place of great importance increase with england in wealth and strength the south downs stand like a vast rampart back from the sea guard south england from surprise and invasion but this great wall be break at four different place at arundel in the west where the arun break through the chalk to find the sea at bramber where the adur pass seaward at lewe where the ouse go through and at wilmington where the cuckmere wind through the hill to its haven each of these gap be hold and guard by a castle while the level eastward of beachy head be hold by pevensey of these castle i suppose the most important to have be lewe for it not only hold the gap of the ouse but the pass by falmer and in some sort the cuckmere valley also -lrb- illustration : lewe castle -rrb- but the great day of lewe castle be that of simon de montfort -- i shall deal with that later here it will be enough to point out that only a fragment of the great building with its double keep whose ruin we see to-day date from the time of the first de warenne the rest be a later work largely of edward i 's time let I now return to the priory which in the development of the town play a part at least as great as that of the castle the priory have always be famous for its piety and in 1199 hugh who have be prior there till 1186 be raise to be abbot of cluny itself this be interesting and important for we have thus a ex-prior of lewe as abbot of cluny during the great dispute between the order and the earl of warenne in 1200 lewe be without a prior and abbot hugh appoint one alexander for some reason or other de warenne refuse to accept he and even go so far as to claim that the appointment lay with he a impossible pretension yet even within the priory he be say to have win support certain of the monk claim that save for a tribute of one hundred shilling a year to cluny they be independent the pope be appeal to and he of course give a clear decision not in the english way of compromise which be the way of a barbarian and a coward but like a honest man decide ` twixt right and wrong he judgment be wholly in favor of the abbot of cluny the earl then begin to bluster and to attempt to appeal beyond the pope he even dare to place armed man at the priory gate and to stop all communication with cluny the abbot reply by a interdict upon lewe and thing be in this confusion when the pope appoint the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of chichester and ely to hear what de warenne have to say in excuse for he violence the abbot of cluny himself come over and be insult in lewe by de warenne 's man in appoint english judge to hear the case the pope must have know that all would end in a compromise at any rate this be what happen and it be decide that in future when a vacancy occur the abbot of cluny should nominate two candidate of whom de warenne should choose one for prior this ridiculous judgment decide nothing of two thing one either the abbot be right or he be wrong if he be right why should he forego he claim to satisfy de warenne who be wrong a decision be what be need in 1229 the pope rightly declare the compromise null and void and the abbot of cluny regain he rights at once the moral condition of the house improve and when it be visit in 1262 everything be report to be satisfactory and unlike any other cluniac house in england this of lewe be not in debt the turn point in the history of the priory would seem to have be the one great moment in the story of the town the appalling affair in which it be involve by simon de montfort in 1264 when he take the town then henry iii 's headquarters and capture the king and young prince edward it would seem that de montfort 's soldier have very little respect for holy place for we read that not only be the altar defile but the very church be fire and hardly save from destruction the quarrel between the king and he baron would seem too to have involve the monk for we find the sub-prior and nine brethren be expel from lewe for conspiracy and faction and go to do penance in various house of the congregation indeed such be the general collapse here that before the end of the century the priory be practically bankrupt that lewe suffer severely from the black death of 1348-49 be certain but we know very little about it and indeed the history of the house be negligible until in the beginning of the fifteenth century the whole system of cluny be call in question and it be claim on behalf of lewe that it should be raise to a abbacy with the power to profess monk it will be remember that the abbot of cluny -- the only abbot within the congregation -- alone could profess and in time of war such as the fourteenth century this must have be very inconvenient indeed we read of man who have be monk they whole life long but have never be profess at all it be therefore not surprising that such a claim should at last have be put forward it be equally not surprising that such a claim be not allow the abbot of cluny refuse to raise lewe to the rank of a abbey but he grant the prior the privilege of profess he monk this in 1410 so thing continue till in 1535 the infamous layton be send by thoma cromwell to inquire into the state of the priory of lewe to nose out any scandal he could and to invent what he could not find he method as apply to lewe be notorious for they insolence and brutality he profess to have find the place full of corruption and rank with treason and in this he be wise for he master cromwell want the house for himself upon November 16 1537 the priory of st pancra at lewe be surrender it be then serve by a prior and twenty-three monk and eighty servus and it and its land be grant by the king to thoma cromwell such be the end of the most famous cluniac house in england the sanctuary found by that de warenne who have build up lewe between he castle on the height and he monastery in the vale almost nothing remain to-day of that great and splendid building but in 1845 in build the railway the coffin of the founder de warenne and he wife gundrada be find these now lie in st john 's church here in southover close by which belong to the priory it be originally a plain norman building of which the nave remain the rest of the church as we see it be for the most part either perpendicular or altogether modern of course the priory of st pancra be not alone in the fate that befall it at the hand of the tudor in 1537 the only other religious house in lewe suffer a like fate this be the convent of the franciscan dedicate as most authority agree in honor of we lady and st margaret the friar minor be establish in lewe before 1249 and they convent be one of the last to be surrender in 1538 from st john 's church the visitor not without a glance at the old half timber house close by say to have be the residence of anne of cleve will pass up to the high street where under the castle stand the parish church of st michael the only ancient part of which be the round norman tower a rare thing a fourteenth century brass to one of the de warennes be to be see within further west be the transitional norman church of st anne with curious capital on the south side of the nave here be a fine basket-work norman font and in the south aisle at the east end a vaulted chapel to the north of the chancel be a recessed tomb but it be not in the church we have in lewe that we shall to-day find the symbol as it be of that old town still so fair a thing which hold the passage of the ouse through the downs and in the thirteenth century witness the great battle in which simon de montfort mystic and soldier defeat and take captive he king for that we must go to the castle ruin that crown lewe as with a battlement the castle be reach from the high street near st michael 's church by the castlegate it be found as i have say by the first de warenne but the gate-house by which we enter be later date from king edward 's time the original norman gate be within the castle have two keep a rare feature only one of these remains reach by a wind steep way and of this only two of the fine octagonal tower be leave to we these two be thirteenth century work from the principal tower now use as a museum we may get the best view of the famous battlefield under mount harry one of the most famous site of the thirteenth century in england for the battle that be fight there seem to have decide everything in fact it decide nothing for its result be entirely reverse at evesham by the military genius of prince edward the cause contest upon these noble hill to the north-west of lewe be one which continually recur all through english history the cause of the aristocracy against the crown the monarchy of western europe which slowly emerge from the anarchy of the dark age and help to make the middle age the glorious and noble thing it be be if we consider they spiritually at least democratic weapon or rather politically they seem to sum up the national energy and to express it in they be vest and this as of divine right the executive without the crown nothing could be do no writ issue no fortress garrison in the crown be gather all the national end it be a symbol at once of unity and of power against this glorious thing in england we see a constant and unremitting rebellion on the part of the aristocracy it be so in the time of king john when the rascal baron curb and break the central government it be so in the time of henry iii when simon de montfort lead and for a time successfully the rebellion it have be so always and not least in the great rebellion of the seventeenth century so falsely represent as a democratic movement when the parvenu aristocracy found upon the land and wealth of the rape church in the sixteenth century break the crown up and finally establish in england a puppet king a mere venetian doge incapable as we have see in the last few year of defend the people against a unscrupulous and treasonous plutocracy lead by a lawyer as certainly on the make as thoma cromwell the infamous work of such man as these have most often be do under the hypocritical and lie banner of the rights of the people as though to gain he end the devil should bear the cross of christ it be so to-day it be so in the time of simon de montfort i have say that the king be the fountain of all power in the england of simon it be therefore he supreme object to get possession of the king 's body that he might have control of the executive machinery of the country and thus in fact be king _ de facto _ it be this which he achieve upon the battlefield of lewe in 1264 for some ten year before that battle the baron of england have be restless under the yoke of the central government the crown which stand not for they but for we all they have already wring from henry iii under compulsion when he be within they power and not a free agent certain concession which now he refuse to confirm to they they call he liar and cover he with the same abuse that they successor hurl at charle i but henry stand firm he refuse what have be drag from he by force and simon de montfort earl of leicester raise a army not from the people but from he own feudal adherent and he friend and take the field striking into the valley of the severn where he seize hereford gloucester worcester and bridgnorth with they castle then he march straight upon london where among the guild he have many adherent and friend war seem inevitable but as it happen a truce be call and the question which simon have make a excuse for he rise the question of the king 's refusal to confirm the grant of privilege wring from he by force be submit for decision to st loui of france undoubtedly the most reverent famous and splendid figure of that day st loui unlike a englishman decide not with a view to peace as though justice be nothing and right a old wife ' tale but accord to law and he conscience honestly and cleanly before god like a intelligent being of two thing one either the king be right or he be wrong st loui decide that the king be right and this upon January 23rd 1264 simon refuse to abide by the decision this man in he own conception be above law and honor and justice he be the inspired and privileged servant of god in this hallucination he deceive himself even as oliver cromwell do later and equally for he own end he too would break the crown and himself govern england he too be brutal beyond bear proud and insolent with he inferior imperious even to god a great man but one impossible to suffer in any state which be to endure a dangerous tyrant this great mystical soldier at once take the field and when henry return from amien where the court of st loui have sit he find all england up the cinque port all hot for simon london ponderous in he support and in all south-eastern england but one principle fortress still in loyal hand that of rochester north and west of london however thing be less disastrous and henry 's first move be to secure all this and to cut off london the approach to which he hold on the south-east in spite of everything since he command rochester from the midland and the west simon 's answer be the right one he strike at rochester and lay siege to it down upon he come king henry to relieve it and be successful simon sweep back upon london there he gather innumerable levy and again advance into the south against the king henry have relieve rochester march also into the south doubtless intent upon the reduction of the cinque port for this however simon give he no time he come thunder down half london weltering behind he across the weald and henry wheeling to meet he come upon the 12th of may up the vale of glynde and occupied lewe on the follow day simon appear at fletching in the vale of the weald some nine mile north of lewe there he encamp very early in the morning of the 14th may simon array he troops and begin he march southward upon the royal army dawn be just break when he first trooper come over the high down and see lewe in the morning mist the royal banner float from the castle -- all still asleep slowly and at he ease simon order he man upon the north conspicuously he set he litter with he standard above it and about it mass the raw levy of london upon the south he gather the knight and man-at-arms lead by the young earl of gloucester as for himself he remain with the reserve then when all be ready he give the order and both wing north and south begin to advance upon the town hope to find they enemy still abe simon 's plan be a simple one he hope to surprise he foe and he intend in any case to throw he main strength southward upon the priory of st pancra while pretend that he main attack be to be upon the castle he do not altogether succeed in surprising he foe but in everything else he be successful the royalist be aware of he approach only at the last moment so that when they pour out of the castle and priory and town they be in some confusion then prince edward observe the standard of simon over the litter fling himself upon the londoner who break and flee while he pursue they nor do he stay he hand till he be far away from lewe he return at last victorious and triumphant to find simon 's banner float from lewe castle the king of the roman and the king of england in simon 's hand and the day lose weary though he be he attempt with all the impetuosity of youth to reverse that verdict through the street of lewe he fight till at length he be force to take refuge in the church of the franciscan where indeed simon find he such be the battle of lewe which give all england to de montfort for more than a year till indeed lewe be reverse by prince edward who escape from he hand at hereford gather a new army about he and force simon to meet he upon the field of evesham where when the great soldier-mystic see the royal banner upon the dawn he cry out that last great word of he the lord have mercy on we soul for we body be prince edward 's : to be answer when he demand mercy there be no treat with traitor chapter xii the downs lewe to bramber perhaps after all the most fundamental truth about lewe be that she be the capital of the south downs and the south downs be the glory of the south country from the noble antiquity of winchester to the splendor of beachy head they run like a indestructible line of latin verse beneath the blazon of england they stand up between the land and the sea the most roman thing in england and of all english land it be they white brow that the sun kiss first when it rise over the sea of all english hill every morning they be the first to be blest the most roman thing in england i call they and indeed this noble range of mountain have not the obvious antiquity of the welsh mountain or the mendip hill nor the tragic aspect as of something as old as time as old as the world itself of the dark and sea-torn cliff of cornwall or the wild and desolate upland of somerset and devon the south downs seem indeed not so much a work of nature as of man and of what man in they regular and even line in they continuity and orderly embankment in they splendid monotony of contour they recall but one thing -- rome they might be indeed only another work of that mighty government which conceive and build the great wall that stretch from the solway to the firth of forth which mark the limit of the empire and bar out its enemy and this wall of the south downs too marked but another frontier of the same great government beyond it lay the horizon unknown and it bar out the sea but how much older than rome be the south downs doubtless before the foundation of rome e'er troy be besiege these hill stand up against the south and serve we as a habitation and a home nor indeed have we fail to leave sign of we life there so many thousand year ago so that to-day a man wander over that great uplifted plateau which slope so gradually towards the sea though he seem to be utterly alone as far as possible from the way and the habitation of man immerse in a immemorial silence in truth pass only from forget city to forget city amid the stronghold and the burial place of a civilisation so old that it be only the earth itself which retain any record or memory of it here be we city when we fear the beast before we have knowledge of bronze or iron when we tool and we weapon be the flint the man we ancestor who chip and prepare the flint for we use at cissbury for instance doubtless look out upon a landscape different from that we see to-day and yet essentially the same after all the south downs in they whole extent slope as i have say very gradually seaward and south and there of old be we city chiefly set but northward they escarpment be extraordinarily steep rise from time to time into lofty headland of which the noblest the most typical and the most famous be chanctonbury standing above that steep escarpment a man to-day look all across the fruitful weald till far off he see the long line of the north downs run as it be parallel with these southern hill and ennoble and break by similar height as that of leith hill between like a uneven river bed with its drift and island of soil run from west to east lie the weald opening at last as it be into the broad estuary of romney marsh half lose in the sea and what we see to-day we neolithic forefather see too -- with a difference doubtless the downs then be as smooth and bare as they be now but the weald we may be sure be different wilder and certainly fuller of woodland though never perhaps the vast and impenetrable forest of tree of which we have be tell i say that the downs now desert save by the shepherd and he flock be of old populous and of this fact the evidence be plentiful there be indeed not one of the five main stretch of the downs that do not bear witness to the immemorial presence of man to say nothing of the discovery about beachy head the earthwork there and the neolithic implement and bronze weapon discover about east dean and alfriston we have in the long man of wilmington that gigantic figure cut out in the chalk of the hill-side something comparable only with the giant of cerne abba in dorset and the white horse of wiltshire that figure be some two hundred and forty foot in height and hold in each hand a stave or club two hundred and thirty foot long it would seem impossible to be certain either of its age or its purpose but we may perhaps be sure that it lay there upon the downs above polegate before the landing of caesar and it may have be the foundation of one of those figure describe by he as form of osier and fill with live man to be destroy by fire as a sacrifice for we barbarian god nor be this all the whole range of the downs as i say be scatter thick with the work of we pre-historic forefather in burlough castle and mount caburn we have fortress so old that it be impossible to name the age in which they be contrived and build nor can we assert with any confidence who they be that first occupy the camp upon ditchle beacon the highest point of the south downs or who first defend wolstanbury and it be the same with those most famous place cissbury ring and chanctonbury but the flint mine upon cissbury give we some idea of the neolithic man we forefather which should and do astonish we the camp itself be less wonderful than the mine upon the western side of it here we have not only numerous pit from ten to seventy foot in diameter and from five to seven foot deep but really vast excavation lead to gallery which tap a belt or band of flint that these mine be work by neolithic man it be impossible to doubt but he may not have discover or first use they they may be older than he though all record even upon that marvellous hill - side have be lose of those who first exploit they nor be chanctonbury though it can not boast of mine such as these less astonishing or less ancient the camp set there follow the contour of the hill can only have be one of the most important in south - east england it command the camp at cissbury the devil 's dyke high down and white hawk the whole breadth of the weald lay beneath it and a signal display upon leith hill upon the north downs could easily be answer from this noble mountain mount caburn itself be not more essentially important it have be think that the roman may have use chanctonbury but if so they have leave but little mark of they occupation and indeed though the downs as a whole far off be stamp with so roman a character there be but one spot in they whole length where we may say here certainly the legion have be that spot lie upon the last division of the downs towards the west the line of hill which stand between chichester and the weald it be certain that the roman be in sussex most at home on that great sea plain towards which the downs slope so gradually southward here indeed they build they town of regnum and perhaps towards the end of they occupation of britain they lay out the only purely military highway which they build here from regnum to london bridge this great roman road know as the stane street come out of the eastern gate of chichester take the downs as a arrow fly cross they between boxgrove and bignor nor be the work of rome even to-day wholly destroy for there under bignor hill we may still see the pavement of they way while at bignor itself we have perhaps the best remains of a roman villa leave to we in sussex -lrb- illustration : the downs -rrb- but though all these mark and sign the memory and the ruin not only of we forefather but of those we savior who draw we within the government of the empire so that we be to-day what we be and not as they who know not the roman make the downs sacred to we it be not only or chiefly for this that we love they or that in any thought of southern england when far away it be these great hill which first come back into the mind and bring the tear to we eye we love they for themselves for they beauty and they persistence certainly but really because we have always know they and they more than any other thing here in the south remind we and be a symbol of we home a man of south england must always have they in he heart for every day of he childhood they have fill he eye and to-day more especially they stand as a sign and a symbol for not only be they the first great hill which the londoner see but they offer the nearest relief and repose from the modern torture and noise of that enormous place which have cease to be a city and become a mere asylum of landless man from the mean and crowd street he seek with a ever increase eagerness the space of the downs from the noise and confusion and throng this silence and this emptiness from the breathless street this free and nimble air which be better than wine and so to-day more than ever the downs have come to stand as a symbol of a england half lose which might seem to be pass away but that be as indeed these hill assure we eternal and indestructible the very england of we heart which can not die there be some doubtless who grumble at this invasion and be fearful lest even this last nobility should be destroy by the multitude or this last sanctuary desecrate by the rapacity of the rich or this last silence break by the brutal noise of the motor car but the downs be too strong they have see too many civilisation pass away and the man and the age that build upon they hill-side have become less than a dream in the morning they remain and be it nothing that in we day if a man hear a bird sing in a london street in spring it be of the downs he think if the wind come over the garden in some haggard suburb it be these hill which rise up in he mind these hill which stand there against the south we very own from everlasting to everlasting but to possess the downs at least as a symbol to dream of they as a refuge it be not necessary to know they in all they secret place to have see all they little forget homestead or to be able to recognize all they thousand steep track one from another for I indeed the downs long as i have know they remain most dear as a spectacle but this you will miss altogether if you be actually upon they lose amid they rolling wave of green turf with only the sky and the wind and the sun for companion therefore when i set out from lewe to go westward i do not take the way up past the race - course over the battlefield south of mount harry towards ditchle camp and beacon let I confess it i follow the road and what a road in all south england i know no other that offer the traveller such a spectacle where above he in full view that great rampart stand up like a wall peak speak to peak till presently with a majesty and a splendor not to be match i think in we island chanctonbury stand forth like a king crown as with laurel towering upon the horizon now this road i follow pass westward out of lewe and then turn swiftly north climb as it go under the downs beyond offham turn west again under mount harry and so on past courthouse farm and plumpton church which stand lonely in a field to the north of the road till suddenly by westmaston church under ditchle beacon it turn north again towards the weald and enter the very notable village of ditchle all that way be worth a king 's ransom for it give you all the steepness of the downs upon they steepest side they sudden north escarpment tower up over the weald some seven hundred foot or more on a spring morning early i know no way more joyful ditchling beacon itself stand some eight hundred and fifty foot above the sea and be the highest point in all the range of the south downs though it lack the nobility of chanctonbury the earthwork here be irregular and not very well define but there be a fine dewpound to the east of the camp though perhaps this have not much antiquity a seemingly older depression now dry in the north-west corner be rather a old rainwater ditch than a dewpound altogether it might seem that ditchle camp be rather a refuge for cattle than a military fortress ditchling village be charming with more than one old half-timber house and the church of st margaret 's be not only interesting in itself but stand as it do upon rise ground and yet clear of the great hill it offer you one of the finest view of the downs anywhere to be have from the weald it consist of a cruciform building of which the north transept and the north wall of the nave be rebuild in the thirteenth century the chancel however have some beautiful early english work to show and the nave be rather plain transitional the eastern window and most of the window in the nave be of the early decorate period the window in the south chancel aisle be somewhat later something better than ditchling church await the traveller at clayton where the little church of st john the baptist possess a most interesting chancel arch round and massive that may well be saxon the chancel itself be of the thirteenth century with triple lancet at the western end with two head perhaps of a king and queen on the moulding here too on the south chancel wall be a fine brass of 1523 in which we see a priest hold chalice and wafer in the nave be the remains of fresco of the last judgment right above clayton rise wolstanbury a hill-top camp or circular work some two hundred and fifty yard in diameter it be interesting because it be curiously and cleverly fortify the rampart be build up below and outside the fosse owe to the steepness of the hill to the left be certain pit which may have be the site of dwelling certainly many neolithic implement have be find here below wolstanbury which thrust itself out into the weald like a great headland nearly seven hundred foot in height lie pyecombe to the south-west this little place which lie between the height of wolstanbury and newtimber hill be celebrate for two thing its shepherd ' crook and the norman font of lead in the little church whose chancel arch be norman too you may see here even in so small a place however all the style of england for if the font and chancel arch be norman the lancet in the chancel be early english the double piscina be decorate and the window of the nave be perpendicular while the pulpit be of the seventeenth century pyecombe be hard to reach from clayton without a great climb over the downs but there be a way though a muddy one which turn due west out of the brighton road where the railway cross it this lead one round the northern side of wolstanbury -lrb- and this be the best way from which to visit the camp on the top -rrb- and so by a footpath past newtimber place a moated elizabethan house well hide away among the tree west of the road to hurstpierpoint from pyecombe there be a delightful road wind in and out under the downs about newtimber hill to poyning poyning be or should i say be one of the loveliest loneliest and most unspoiled village to be find here under the downs but of late it have be accessible by railway from the devil 's dyke and brighton nothing however can spoil the beauty and interest of its church which be i suppose one of the earliest perpendicular work in the county build before 1368 by the third baron de poyning some remains of whose old manor-house may still be find east of the churchyard the church be a greek cross with central tower and be dedicate in honor of the holy trinity everything in it be charming especially the beautiful eastern window the triple sedilium and the piscina but the pulpit and altar rail be of the seventeenth century as be the great south window which once stand in chichester cathedral the poyning lie in the south transept but they tomb have be deface the north transept be the montagu chapel here in the window be some old glass in which we may see the annunciation the devil 's dyke which stand right above poyning be a great trench in the downs dig accord to the legend by the devil whose genial intention it be to drown holy sussex by let in the sea he be allow from sunset to sunrise to work he will but owe to the vigilance of those above who have sussex particularly in they keep the cock all begin to crow long before the dawn and the devil think he time be spend go off in a rage before he have complete he work this would seem to prove what i have often suspect that the devil be as great a fool as he look the camp above the devil 's dyke be of the usual design of a hill-top fortress the defense follow the natural line of the hill the look-out have be apparently upon the north-west whence a remarkably extensive view be to be have both over the weald and the downs but as no water would seem to have be conserve here it be difficult to believe that this camp be ever a permanent fortress which only a very large number of people could have defend nevertheless a great number of neolithic implement have be find there from poyning in full view of chanctonbury the beautiful road run all the way at the foot of the downs to that great gap through which the adur seek the sea and which of old be guard by bramber castle on the way it pass through the loveliest of village to wit edburton where in the early english church of st andrew be the second of the three norman font of lead within this county the church be altogether interesting for if it be for the most part of the thirteenth century it have a charming decorate eastern window and it be say that archbishop laud himself present the pulpit and altar rail what the two low side window be for i know not but the chapel on the north be dedicate in honor of st catherine of alexandrium it be already dusk when i come out of edburton church the late dusk of a day in early may and so like the place pass well i determine to sleep there and soon find a hospitable cottage in the morning i like the place better still and remember the tarmac and the sophistication -lrb- alas -rrb- of steyne i decide to stay where i be two or three day and to visit thence a place in the weald it have long be my desire to see and so have make up my mind before nine o'clock i set out on my way chapter xiii the weald there can be no one who have stand upon one of the great height of the downs north and south upon ditchle beacon chanctonbury or leith hill who look across the weald have not wonder what this country lie between the two great chalk range might be what be its nature and its history and what part it have play in the great story of england for even to the superficial onlooker it seem to differ essentially not only from the great chalk downs upon which he stand but from any other part of england know to he it lie thickly sprinkle with scatter and isolate woodland a mighty trench between the height not a vast plain but a uneven lowland diversify by higher land but without true hill and roughly divide west and east into two part by a great ridge know by various name but in its greater part call the forest st leonard 's forest ashdown forest dallington forest and so forth this country which we know as the weald be obviously bound north and south by the downs which enclose it as they do too upon the west where between winchester and petersfield and selborne the two range narrow and meet thence indeed the weald spread eastward in a ever widen delta till it be lose in the marsh and the sea such be the aspect of this great country as we see it to-day from any of the height north and south of it but what be its true character and what be its history we hear of it first under a saxon name andredeswald whence we get we name of the weald and we find it always speak of not only by the saxon but by the roman before they as a obstacle though not it would seem a insurmountable one it be in fact a wild forest country of clay contain much woodland everywhere cover with scrub and traverse by various sleepy and shallow stream that it be difficult to cross we have roman evidence that it be a secure hiding - place we know from the saxon but as we look upon it to-day neither of these historic fact be self-evident and therefore a curious myth have grow up with regard to the weald and the historian seek to explain what be not to be understand without time and trouble and experience tell we that the weald be once a impenetrable forest a whole great woodland and undergrowth so thick that no man might cross it without danger such a assertion be merely a attempt on the part of man who do not know the weald to explain the fact of which i have speak namely that the weald appear as a obstacle in we early history though not insurmountable and that it continually offer a secure hiding-place and refuge to the fugitive the weald as it appear to we first be the secure home of those who first smelt the ironstone in which it abound and as such it remain during many age but the two main fact about it which help to explain everything in its history be first that it consist for the most part of clay and secondly that it be everywhere ill water let we consider these thing the weald even as we see it to-day till and cultivate and tend though it be remains largely a country of scatter woodland very thickly wood indeed as see in a glance from any height of the downs but reveal itself as we traverse it as a country of isolate wood often of oak and with here and there the remains of a wild and rough moorland country of which as we may think in the roman time it for the most part consist it later possess some six forest properly so call but itself be never a legal forest nor in any sense of the word a impenetrable wood it always possess homestead farm and steading but almost nowhere within it be there a great or populous town man live there it be true but always in a sort of isolation and this be so not because the weald be a impassable forest of woodland and undergrowth -- it be never that but because of its scarcity of water or more accurately its uncertainty of water and its soil the wealden clay the state of affair anciently obtain in the weald do not fundamentally differ from what obtain to-day and in a word it be and be this : in dry weather there be no water but the go be good in wet weather there be plenty of water but the go be impossible of course these condition have in modern time be modify by the building of road and the sinking of well and the better embankment and preservation of the river but in roman time as later the weald be a obstacle because it be difficult though never impossible to cross on account of the badness of the go or the lack of water it be a secure hiding-place for such a fugitive as a saxon king because he could not be pursue by a army he himself with a few follower could move from stead to steading and enjoy a certain amount of state but a pursue army would have perish evidence in support of this explanation of the secret and character of the weald be not far to seek the weald lay between the channel and its port that be to say the entry into england from the continent and the thame valley it be then a obstacle that have to be overcome have it be merely a great woodland forest it would not have trouble the roman who would merely have drive a great road through it but the roman have more to face than a impenetrable woodland or the roughness of the country they have to overcome the lack of water and therefore in the weald they day 's march of some twelve mile be press to double its normal length the french army accord to mr belloc do exactly the same thing in the plain of chalon to-day and indeed a man may see for himself even yet what exactly the weald be if in summer he will cross it by any of the wind byway that often become good road for a mile or so and then lapse again into lane or footpath let he follow one of these afoot and drink only by the wayside and then in winter let he follow the same track if he can he will find plenty of water but he foot will be heavy with clay for a army or even a regiment to go as he go would be almost impossible and this not because of the woodland or undergrowth but because of the lack of water the lack of town or large village and the clay underfoot such then be the nature of the barrier which lay between the port of the channel and the valley of the thame the weald be indeed inhuman and this help to explain why it be not only a barrier but a refuge we read in the rude chronicle of the saxon of two man who seek refuge in the weald in the seventh and eighth century the first of the three be caedwallum -lrb- 659-689 -rrb- a young man of great energy accord to bede and probably a dangerous aspirant to the west-saxon throne at any rate he be exile from wessex and he take refuge with he follower in the forest of anderida that be to say in the weald there about 681 he meet st wilfrid who have flee too from the west saxon kingdom wilfrid be busy convert the south saxon and caedwallum go from stead to stead with he follower save from any considerable pursuit by the nature of the country become great friend with he this however do not prevent he in 685 from ravage sussex slaying the south saxon king and at last succeed he old enemy centwine upon the west saxon throne caedwallum after conquer the isle of wight and put to death the two son of king arvaldus have allow they first to be baptise be himself convert and to such purpose that he lay down he crown go on pilgrimage to rome and be baptise under the name of peter by the pope on the vigil of easter 689 he die however before domenica in albi and be bury in old st peter 's nor be he the only english king that lay there all this come out of the weald but it be most significant for we because it allow we to understand the nature of this refuge and what it offer in the way of safety to a exile this be confirm by the experience of sigebert king of the west saxon he too first take refuge in the weald when depose by he witan he flee away and be pursue we read by cynewulf so that he take refuge in the forest of andred where he be safe from pursuit by many man be kill at last at privet near petersfield in hampshire by a swineherd in revenge for he master 's death such then be the nature of the weald and such fundamentally it remain a stubborn and really untameable country even to-day not truly humanised still largely empty of town and village but scatter with isolate farm and steading and the essential inhumanity of the true heart of the weald be bear out by the scarcity of religious house there only the little priory of rusper a small benedictine nunnery perhaps found by one of the de braose family before the end of the twelfth century and the small benedictine nunnery of easebourne found in the thirteenth century may be say to belong to the true weald of the other such as the abbey of robertsbridge the priory of michelham and shulbr the abbey of otham bayham and dureford not one be really old or stand really within the true weald nor be they of very much importance the greatest of these house be the cistercian abbey of robertsbridge found in 1176 by alfred de st martin sheriff of the rape of hasting within which the abbey stand really upon the last of the forest ridge towards the level of pevensey it be true that this abbey play a considerable part in history during the first year of its existence for it be the abbot of robertsbridge who set out with the abbot of boxley to search for coeur de lion in 1192 and who find he in bavarium and we find the abbot of robertsbridge employ more than once again as a ambassador but its fame soon dwindle and though it escape the first suppression and indeed survive till 1538 it could boast then of but eight brethren -lrb- illustration : the weald of sussex north of lewe -rrb- the only other house as old as robertsbridge be those of otham and dureford house of premonstratensian canon neither in the heart of the weald and both date from the twelfth century the other religious house michelham and shulbred of the augustinian canon easebourne of augustinian nun and bayham the successor of otham all date from the thirteenth century and indeed no more belong to the true weald than do the rest it be in fact only to-day that a great monastery stand in the heart of the weald and of all wonderful thing that be a carthusian house of the like of which pre-reformation england boast but twelve and sussex none at all it be one day as i come over the adur by moat farm that i become aware of this great establishment for there suddenly as i turn a corner by the lord the road be full of carthusian monk all in they white habit a sight as marvellous as delightful once more upon a english road and so i find my way to the great house of st hugh at parkminster one should learn to be astonish at nothing in england of my heart for it will beggar one 's admiration but carthusian be it not this order which henry ii have bring into england as part of he penance for the murder of st thoma be it not this order which have first be establish in my own somerset and alone of all order in england by a saint and which there at witham and at hinton still so fair and lovely build its first two house in england of which all tell there be but twelve be it not this order that have face and outface henry tudor to the last so that the monk of the london charterhouse be burn at the stake at tyburn well be this monastery dedicate in honor of st hugh and if you do not know why let I write it here it be well know that after the murder of st thoma and henry ii 's public repentance for he part in all that evil pope alexander iii give he for penance a crusade of three year in the holy land but when that be find not to be convenient he commute it for the building of three monastery of which one be to be carthusian for the carthusian at that time have no house in england this order have be found at grenoble in 1086 by st bruno who have be send by st hugh bishop of grenoble to a desert spot in the alp 14000 foot above the sea there st bruno found he monastery know as the grande chartreuse he monk be hermit monk each have as each have still he own little dwelling the order which have never be reform -- cartusium nunquam reforma quium nunquam deforma -- and have uniformly follow the rule approve by pope innocent xi recognize three class of brethren the father the conversus or lay brethren and nun each house be govern by a prior and each monk live as i have say in a separate dwelling of five little room and a tiny cloister or rather ambulatory face a little garden he food be give he through a hatch at the foot of the stair lead to he room he attend mass in choir matins and vespers too but the other hour be say in he cell as the carthusian be when they first come into england so they be to-day but it be not in honor of st hugh bishop of grenoble that the monastery at parkminster be dedicate but of quite another saint when henry ii set out to find a carthusian house in england in obedience to the pope the place he choose for it be witham in selwood a solitude for the rule of the order demand it and that be also why we have this monastery in the weald to-day it bear witness as nothing else could do to-day perhaps to the true character of the weald witham it be true be not so desolate as the grande chartreuse but it be in the heart of the forest far from the abode of man even to - day witham be not easy to reach by road this house thus found do not flourish whether the place be too hard for the monk or whether there be some other cause we know not but the first two prior though both from the grande chartreuse fail to establish it then king henry be advise to beg of the mother-house she great and shine light hugh of avalon not of avalon in england but of avalon in burgundy he be successful in he request the bishop of bath and well he ambassador then in the alp be able to bring hugh home with he though the loss of that most sweet presence as the prior declare widow he house and hugh come to england and to witham and be receive as a angel of the lord it be in honor of this great and holy man later bishop of lincoln and know as st hugh of avalon that the carthusian monastery of parkminster be dedicate i have here no room to speak of he the true founder of the order in england of he holy brave and laborious life in selwood or of he rule there of ten year he be forget even at witham and he name no longer alas mean anything to we whom he serve only the carthusian have not forget and to the keep of no other saint in the calendar could they so honourably have entrust they new house this monastery found in the weald upon October 17 1877 be a great if not a beautiful pile of building and be in fact one of the largest house of the order in the world the visitor ring at the gate and be admit by a lay-brother dress in the beautiful white habit catch about the waist by a leathern girdle from which a rosary hang upon he foot be rough shoe and he head be shear but he greet you with a smile of welcome and lead you into a large quadrangle where before you be the great romanesque church with a chapel upon one side and the refectory upon the other and all about be cloister here over the entrance to the church be a statue of st hugh within the church be divide by a screen into two part the choir for the father the nave for the lay-brother over the screen be a rood and beneath two altar dedicate in honor of st john the baptist who go into the desert and st bruno the founder of the order from the church one be lead to the chapter house in which there stand a altar and crucifix and there upon the wall be depict scene from the martyrdom of the london carthusian in the time of henry viii from the chapter house one be lead to the chapel of the relic where there be a beautiful silver reliquary that belong to the english carthusian before the reformation and in it be a relic of st thoma of canterbury here too be the steal of st hugh and a bone of st bruno the monastery proper lie behind the church where a vast quadrangle the great cloister some three acre in extent open out surround on three side by the little house of the monk with the graveyard in the midst here the monk live and be bury without coffin or shroud in they white habit the hood draw over the face the cell be delightful to look upon a solitude within a solitude each consist of five room two below and three above reach by a staircase the whole approach from a passage close by a door give on to the great cloister here live and pray some thirty-six monk with a like number of conversus or lay-brother i do not know in all england a place more peaceful than this one more solemn and salutary to visit in the confusion of we modern life here be one of the lightning conductor that preserve the modern world from the wrath of god let other think as they will for I the monastery of st hugh in the weald be holy ground and at any rate even though you may not agree with I so far in this at least i shall carry you with I when i say that this monastery and especially because it be carthusian bear out the old character of the weald and endorse it i have say the weald be ever a wild and inhuman place where only few man could go together without great town and with only infrequent village not a thick or impenetrable woodland but a difficult and a lonely country sparsely scatter with steading well it be such place that the carthusian have ever seek out for they house such be witham and such be the grande chartreuse also that a carthusian monastery should have be found to-day in the midst of the weald prove if anything can that it have not yet wholly lose its character chapter xiv to arundel and chichester from my little quiet retreat at edburton i set out one may morning to follow the road under the downs through steyne for arundel and chichester because it be one of the fairest way in all the world and rightly understand one of the most interesting and to begin with i find myself cross one of those gap in the south downs each of which be hold by a castle the one i now cross be that make by the adur and it be hold by the castle of bramber now bramber merely beautiful to-day must in the old time always have be of importance for it hold a easy road through the rampart of the downs one of the great highway into normandy because of the harbor of shoreham at the mouth of the adur one of the principal port upon this coast of immemorial antiquity the harbor of shoreham first of old shoreham perhaps the roman portus adurnus and then when that silt up of new have play always a great part in the history of south england that the roman know and use it be certain it be probably here that the saxon ellum and he three son cymne cissa and wlencing land in 477 and it be not likely that it be neglect by the norman who in fact build here a very noble cruciform church dark and solemn indeed rather a fortress than a church it be at shoreham certainly that john land when he return to england to make himself king after the death of coeur de lion and we may gather some idea of the real importance of the port from the fact that it furnish edward iii with twenty-six ship for he fleet in 1346 thereafter the place decline but history repeat itself when charle ii in flight in 1651 and anxious to reach the french coast set out from shoreham and land at fécamp shoreham thus be a important way in and out of england but the road by which it live be not in its keep at all but in the power of the castle of bramber which dominate and hold it on the north side of the downs where it issue out of the pass or gap make by the adur bramber castle stand upon a headland thrust out into the valley and the weald in the very mouth of the pass and even in its ruin only a old gateway tower and a fragment of the lofty barbican in which be a norman window remain it be easy to understand how important and how strong it must once have be indeed norman though these remains be it be by no mean the norman who first fortify this promontory and hold this pass it be probable that the castle of bramber occupy the site of a roman castellum and a saxon fortress some say a palace of the saxon king after the conquest the castle come into the hand of the great william de braose lord of braose near falaise in normandy who receive such great estate in england from the conqueror he fix he seat however here at bramber and build or rebuild the castle which become the greatest fortress in he possession later by marriage it pass to the mowbray and from they descend to the duke of norfolk the present duke indeed still hold it it be however of william de braose we think in bramber for he not only build the great castle which give its character to the place even to-day but the church of st nichola also under the castle of which the nave and tower of he time only remain he build it indeed as a chapel to he castle and to serve it he found there a small college of secular canon under a dean and endow it with the church of beeding and many tithe among they those of shoreham but about 1080 william de braose seem to have repent of what he have do for he then grant to the abbey of st florent in saumur the reversion of the church of st nichola here when the last of the canon then live in he college at beeding should have die it be thus that the abbey of st florent come to establish a priory at beeding or sele as the monk call it and this about 1096 and william 's son philip confirm they in he father 's gift and before the end of the twelfth century this alien priory possess the church of sele bramber washington old shoreham and new to say nothing of the little chapel of st peter on the old bridge between bramber and beeding this old bridge over the adur be worth notice for it be say to have be first establish by the roman upon a road of theirs that run under the north escarpment of the downs from dover to winchester certain roman remains have indeed be find there and the chapel of st peter _ de veteri ponte _ be doubtless found in order to guard it and keep it open and in order evil day fall upon the priory with the rise of nationalism and the war of the fourteenth century like every other alien house it come under suspicion of spy and be near the coast indeed at the very threshold of a important gate it be seize by the crown at last in 1396 richard ii permit it to naturalise itself and its only connection thereafter with st florent be the payment of a small annual tribute but the misfortune of the priory be not over for sixty year or more all go well but in 1459 the bishop of winchester buy the patronage of the place from the duke of norfolk and win leave from the pope and the bishop of chichester to suppress it and appropriate it to he new college of st mary magdalen in oxford the suppression however be not to take effect till the last monk then live should die and this come to pass in 1480 for thirteen year the priory be unoccupied and then in 1493 the fellow of magdalen allow the carmelite friar of shoreham to use the place they own house in shoreham have be engulf by the sea these white friar be the poorest in all sussex so poor be they that they fail even to maintain themselves at sele in July 1538 when the bishop of dover come to visit the place he find neither friar nor secular but the door open and none to serve god such be the end of the house william de braose have build in the first year of the conquest what remains of it will be find in the church of st peter in upper beed a early english building of no great interest save that it contain many carve stone from the priory a window and a door also from the same house upon the site of which the vicarage now stand william de braose who make bramber he chief seat must have have a enormous influence upon building in this neighborhood which abound in norman church such as those of botolph and coombe to say nothing of those at shoreham old and new but he be by no mean the only renewer of life here the most beautiful thing in the still beautiful village of steyning be the great church of st andrew but with this the lord of bramber have nothing to do the benedictine abbey of fécamp rebuilt this noble sanctuary but its foundation be say to be due to a english saint st cuthman who have be a shepherd boy upon he father 's death come out of the west into sussex bear he mother who be cripple in a kind of barrow which he drag by a cord a thousand queer story be tell of he as he go on he way happily enough it seem until he come to steyne where the cord of he barrow break there he build a hut for he mother and construct a little church of timber and wattle in which at last he be bury in he life he have perform diver miracle so that he grave become a place of pilgrimage and it be say to have be about this shrine that the village and church of steyne grow up it remain a holy place and ethelwolf the father of alfr be say to have be bury there he body later be remove to winchester that the place be of some sort of importance would seem to be evident for we find edward the confessor grant the manor and church of steyne to the benedictine of fécamp harold take it from they and the conqueror restore it two church at steyne be speak of in the domesday survey and it have be think that the second of these be really that at warminghurst but we find a church in steyne in the thirteenth century serve by secular canon this be however in all probability the church of st andrew we know which in 1290 be a royal free chapel answerable neither to the archbishop nor to the bishop of chichester but to the abbot of fécamp only the college of canon have by then if indeed it ever serve this church be dissolve at the suppression of the alien priory in the fifteenth century steyne pass to the new abbey of sion there can be no doubt that the church we have at steyning be due to the benedictine of fécamp and it be one of the noblest building in the county of the earlier church they build here much would seem to remain the rudely carve arch at the eastern end of the aisle the norman window on the north and much of the aisle wall this church be probably cruciform and may have be larger than that we now see it be rebuild again by the monk in the middle of the twelfth century when the great chancel arch we have the beautiful nave arcade and clerestory be build with the fine moulding and capital and dog-tooth ornament the font too would seem to be of about this time the tower only date from the sixteenth century and the chancel be modern now steyne lie under chanctonbury but i resist the temptation to spend the afternoon in the old camp there look over the blue goodness of the weald for i wish especially to visit the church of wiston and to see if i might wiston house which sir thoma shirley build about 1576 and where those three brother be bear who astonish not only sussex and all england but rome itself and the pope by they marvellous daring and adventure the old manor house be delightfully situate in its beautiful park under the dark height of chanctonbury and though much altered retain on the whole its fine elizabethan character the manor originally belong to the de braose from whom it pass by marriage to the shirley in the church a small decorate building there be a fine brass of 1426 to sir john de braose on which over and over again we read jesu mercy : this in the south chapel he little son be bury under a arch on the north where there be a curious effigy of he the first shirley whose monument we find here though only in part be that of sir richard who die in 1540 but it be sir thoma who also have he monument that build wiston and be the father of those three remarkable son he be the great-grandson of ralph shirley of wiston and the son of william shirley who die in 1551 till he time the family have of course be catholic it be he who first abandon the faith perhaps it be this spirit of adventure so unfortunate in he which descend to that famous leash of brethren and drive they out upon they adventure the least remarkable and the most unfortunate of these son of he be the eldest thoma whose life however as a soldier and freebooter both on shore in the low country and at sea be sufficiently full of adventure to satisfy anyone he come however to utter grief at last and have to sell wiston retire to the isle of wight where he die in 1630 it be he brother anthony who really make the shirley famous he have graduate at oxford in 1581 and have as he say acquire those learning which be fit for a gentleman 's ornament he go to the low country with robert dudley earl of leicester and be present at the battle of zutphen where sir philip sidney fall in 1591 he be in normandy with the earl of essex whom he devotedly follow in support of henry of navarre who make he a knight of st michael for accept a foreign knighthood without she leave elizabeth lock he up in the fleet and only let he out when he promise to retire from the order this he actually do but he title stick to he and he be always know as sir anthony he then marry elizabeth devereux a first cousin of he patron the earl of essex but the marriage be unfortunate he could not abide he wife and in order to occupy he mind from thinking of she vainest word in 1595 he fit out with essex 's aid and he father 's a buccaneer expedition to the gulf of guinea but in something less than two year after the most amazing adventure he come home to wiston under the downs alive but poor and with he passion for adventure in nowise abate in 1597 he accompany essex on the island voyage but seek more pay adventure in the winter of 1598 he consent at essex 's suggestion to lead a little company of english adventurer to assist cesare d'este to regain he duchy of ferrara then in the hand of the pope he set forth but upon reach venice find that cesare have submit again he be out of employment but it be upon the quay of venice that he conceive the most astonishing enterprise that even a englishman have ever undertake he propose to set out for persium with the object of persuade the shah to ally himself with christendom against the turk and hope also to establish commercial relation between england and persium upon this astonishing crusade he leave venice with he brother robert and twenty-five englishman disappoint of a row in ferrara on may 29 1599 for constantinople thence he go on to aleppo and so down the euphrate to babylon to isapahan and kazveen where he meet the shah abba the great there thanks to the shah 's two christian wife he have a good reception the rank of prince be confer upon he and he win the concession for all christian of the right not only to trade freely but to practice they religion in persium for five month he remain at the court of the shah and then return to europe as he ambassador to invite all christian power to ally themselves with persium against the turk he go first to moscow where he be however treat with contempt as be he mission he go to prague and be well receive at last in 1601 after visit nuremberg augsburg munich innsbruck and trent he arrive in rome and profess enthusiasm for the faith he father have repudiate be well receive the truth be he be in grave money difficulty and indeed in 1603 be arrest by the venetian and imprison in a certain obscure island near unto scio the english government however come to he aid and obtain he release but refuse he permission to return to england he go to prague and thence on the business of the emperor to morocco there he be receive in great state and remain five month before leave however he release certain portuguese whom he find in slavery and sail with they for lisbon where he hope to reimburse himself for they ransom in this he be disappoint so on he go to madrid where he be make very much of and promise the order of sant ` iago in the service now of spain he go to naple in 1607 after a visit to the emperor at prague where he be create a count of the holy roman empire he seem to have travel considerably in southern italy and after a brief visit to obtain money to madrid set out for sicily in command of a fleet to attack the moor and turk he achieve nothing and be dismiss in 1611 he appear again in madrid in utter poverty but the king take compassion upon he and give he a pension and in madrid he remain write a account of he adventure till he die in beggary the english ambassador note in 1619 the poor man sometimes come to my house and be as full of vanity as ever he be make himself believe that he shall one day be a great prince it might indeed seem a long road from wiston under the downs to the gulf of guinea the quay of venice constantinople the euphrate babylon moscow prague rome and morocco to die at last a beggar in purse but in heart a great prince in madrid now when i have be remind of all this i be direct to visit buncton chapel to the north of wiston park where i find indeed some norman work in the nave and chancel arch and so i go on my way through the fail afternoon by that beautiful road within sight of the high downs to the washington inn where i sleep for it be a quiet place not to be pass by and on the morrow i go on my way still through as fair a country as be to be find in all south england through storrington and so by way of parham park with its noble elizabethan house and little church with the last leaden font in sussex a work of the fourteenth century to amberley in the mead of the arun a dear and beautiful place amberley boast a castle and stand right in the mouth of one of those gap in the downs as bramber do the gap of the arun and it might well be think that amberley hold this pass as a fact she do not that gap be hold by arundel the castle at amberley be a palace of the bishop of chichester grant to the bishop of selsey long before the conquest it be only castellated in the fourteenth century it be none the less a interesting ruin very picturesque with remains of a chapel while the beautiful house build within the castle wall early in the sixteenth century be altogether lovely and as for the church i can never hope to tell of all its interest and beauty certainly a norman church once stand here of which the nave of that we see be part as be the very noble chancel arch but the chancel itself the south aisle and the tower be of the thirteenth century while the south door be very early decorate most beautifully carve there be not surely in all sussex a more delightful spot than this lie so quietly in the mead with its beautiful church its ruin castle and fine old elizabethan house where arun bend slowly and lazily towards the downs and the sea it be with real regret that on that may morning i leave amberley turn often to look back at it and last from the great seven-arched bridge over the arun whence one may look down stream upon the wooded slope of arundel park then i go on up the road that wind through the steep village of houghton swiftly up on to the downs wood here very nobly and so at the top of rewell hill i turn to the left and make my way through the noble park to the little town of arundel now i can not say why but in spite of its seduction which be full of splendor of its noble history and great building i have never be able to love arundel one be there always i feel too much in the shadow of that mighty castle which for the most part be not old at all too much in the power of that great new church that surely be never build by english hand which have altogether blot out the older sanctuary and which catholic though it be have never win my affection arundel itself be all in the shadow of these two thing each of which be too big for it too heavy for free laughter and light - heartedness so it seem to I all i can find in arundel that please I lie in the little town itself and in the old church of which one half the chancel have be close to all who do not hold the duke 's write permission to enter it -- as though the house of god even though it be the property of a catholic duke be not by nature as it be free to all and so there be a kind of sorrowfulness about arundel that spoil my pleasure in it yes even in the very noble remains of the old castle that be hide away within the sham gothic affair of 1791 even in the beautiful old church of which one half be close even in the steep little town which might have be as gay as rye i feel overwhelm by the new castle and the new church neither of which have any antiquity tradition or beauty -lrb- illustration : arundel castle -rrb- the old castle with its great circular norman keep within the huge sham fortress of the eighteenth century beneath which the town lie like one afraid to ask for mercy should not be leave unvisited for it be probably build by that roger de montgomery who lead the breton center at hasting and have thus nearly a thousand year of history behind it to say nothing of three siege that of 1102 when it be surrender to henry i that of 1139 when stephen there hold matilda prisoner and allow she to pass out and that of 1643 when waller take it after seventeen day nor indeed should anyone fail to visit the beautiful parish church of st nichola a glorious cruciform building perpendicular in style build in 1380 it too have a long history the church be originally serve by secular canon but in 1177 the then earl of arundel introduce in they place four or five monk under a prior from st martin of seez in the fourteenth century however these alien monk withdraw to they mother house and in 1380 the priory of st nichola in arundel be reconvert into a collegiate church this college consist of a master and sub-master ten chaplain two deacon two sub-deacon and five chorister the choir of the church be the chapel of the college the remainder be parochial the college survive the general suppression but be eventually buy by the earl of arundel who have previously offer a thousand pound for it and so it be that after a long law-suit in 1880 the chancel of the parish church of arundel be give up to the duke of norfolk i do not sleep in arundel but though it be already afternoon i set out westward once more through the great park and just before sunset i come to the great church of boxgrove which stand between the road i have follow from arundel and the roman stane street where they approach to enter the east gate of chichester together at last this great and beautiful sanctuary give one i think a better idea of what the great monastic church really be than any other building leave to we in sussex it be like a cathedral for solemnity and for size too though it be only a fragment and its beauty can not be forget in its foundation the church be very ancient a small college of secular canon serve it in saxon time but all be change when robert de haza to whom henry i have grant the honor of halnaker in 1105 bestow the church upon the abbey of lessay which send hither its benedictine and build for they a new sanctuary boxgrove be thus a alien priory from 1108 till in 1339 richard ii affirm its independence and this be confirm by the pope in 1402 it seem then to have be in a bad way but later recover in the thirteenth century it have boast nineteen monk but at the time of the suppression it only muster eight priest who seem to have keep a school for the child of the neighborhood what remains of the priory not much more than a gateway for most of it be destroy in 1780 stand to the north of the church the original norman church here be cruciform of this building we still see the tower the transept and the lower part of what remain of the nave and the arcade to the south this norman church be greatly enlarged in the twelfth century when the nave now destroy be build the tower pier be then case in the transitional style and the arch which carry the tower be alter later about 1235 the chancel we see and its aisle as lovely as anything in southern england be add in the early english style that often remind one of chichester cathedral to the fourteenth century belong the south porch and more than one window in the aisle while the font and other window be perpendicular i have often read of the unique vaulting of the choir of boxgrove priory but the twilight be so deep in the church for it be already evening that i could not see it i see however the empty tomb very fine and splendid of the earl de la warr who beg boxgrove of thoma cromwell unsuccessfully and then i go out and march on into chichester the east gate of which i enter not long after dark chapter xv chichester the mere plan of chichester proclaim its roman origin it be a little walled city lie out upon the sea plain of sussex cruciform by reason of its street north street south street east street and west street which divide it into four quarter of which that upon the south become wholly ecclesiastical : the south-west quarter be occupy by the cathedral and its subject building while the south - east quarter be the palatinate of the archbishop as for the quarter north-east it be appropriate to the castle and its dependency of which however nothing remain while the quarter north-west be occupy by the townspeople and to-day contain they parish church of st peter major these four quarter meet at the market cross whence the street that divide the city set out for the four quarter of the world to come into chichester to-day even by the quiet red-brick street -- south street -- from the railway station the least interesting entry into the city be to understand at once what chichester be one of those country town that be to say city in the good old sense because they be the seat of the bishop which be not only the pride of england but perhaps the best thing leave to she and certainly the most characteristic of all that she truly mean and stand for if such place be without the feverish and confused life of the great industrial centre of modern england let we thank god for it they have nevertheless a quiet vitality of they own which in the long run will prove more persistent and strong than the futile excitement of place noisy with machinery and wretched with the enslaved poor such place as chichester may indeed stand for england in a way that manchester for instance with its cosmopolitan population and egotistical ambition its greed its helplessness and appalling intellectual mongrelism and parvenu and international society can never hope to do england truly remain herself the england of my heart because of such place as chichester winchester salisbury well and those dear market town which still remember and maintain she great past and renew the way of we forefather all be very old co-eval with england all have sturdy and unforgotten tradition and in these if we but know it lie we best hope for the future among these dear place chichester be no exception rather be she most typical she have a immemorial past and out of it she will contrive somehow or other to face and to outface whatever the future may bring like everything that be best in england that be indeed most typical of ourselves she origin be not barbarian but roman she ancient name be regnum the city it be say first of cogidubnus king of the regnus and legate in britain of claudius caesar that the roman build and maintain a important town here can not be doubt the very form of the city to-day would be enough to establish this apart from the notable discovery of building pavement urn inscription and i know not what else belong to the whole of the roman occupation of britain it be obvious that chichester play a great part in the roman administration of south britain its port be large safe and accessible while it be the first town upon the east of that great group of creek and harbor which run up out of spithead and southampton water throughout the middle age bosham the port of chichester maintain its position while even in the eighteenth century chichester harbor be sufficiently important to warrant the cutting of the canal which unite the arun with chichester channel there be however something else which must always place beyond doubt the importance of chichester in roman time it be from chichester out of the east gate that the great roman road set forth for london the road we know as the stane street chiefly as we may suppose a great military way this be the only roman road over the south downs the only road that connect london with the greater harbor of the south coast its terminus be chichester -lrb- illustration : the market cross chichester -rrb- of the early connection of the town with christianity there be to say the least high probability a inscription find in north street and now preserve at goodwood record the dedication of a temple by the college of smith to neptune and minerva would seem to refer to that claudium and that puden mention by st paul and thus to connect they with regnum however that may be we know that it with the rest of britain must have be a christian city long before the failure of the roman administration with that failure and the final departure of the legion regnum fall on evil day its position as the key to those harbor which have give it its importance now expose it to the first raid of the pirate these barbarian accord to legend be ellum and he three son one of whom cissa be say to have give chichester she name -- cissa 's camp cissa 's ceaster of chichester 's story during the dark age we know as little as we know of most of the city of england but that it be destroy utterly as have be assert common sense refuse to allow we to believe it certainly continue to exist in barbarous fashion perhaps but still to live till with the conversion of the english it begin to take on a new life and with the conquest be finally establish as the seat of the bishop the apostle of the south saxon st wilfrid wreck upon the flat and inhospitable shore of selsey be as we know they first bishop he establish he see however not at chichester but at selsey where it remain until the conqueror begin to reorganise england upon a roman plan when more than one see be remove from the village in which it have long be establish to the neighbouring great town so it be with the bishopric of sussex which in the first year of the norman administration be remove from selsey to chichester thus chichester be restore in 1075 to the great position it have hold in the time of the roman its lord be that roger de montgomery who receive it from the conqueror together with more than eighty manor and to he be due the castle which stand in the north-east quarter and the rebuilding of the roman wall which continually renew and rebuild still in some sort stand upon roman foundation and mark the limit of the roman town of the south saxon cathedral church at selsey we know almost nothing it seem to have be establish as a benedictine house under a abbot who be also bishop but later the monk be replace by secular canon then when in 1075 the see be remove from selsey to chichester the old church dedicate in honor of st peter which stand upon the site of the present cathedral be use as the cathedral church and the benedictine nun to whom it then belong be dispossess in favor of the canon this however do not last long by 1091 a new norman church the work of bishop ralph whose great stone coffin stand in the lady chapel have be build upon this site and dedicate in honor of the bless trinity the old church be commemorate in the nave which still be use as the parochial church of st peter major this new building however be soon so badly damage by fire that it be necessary to rebuild it -- this in 1114 but a like fate befall it in 1187 and again the church be restore this time by bishop seffrid then in the thirteenth century come bishop richard he be consecrate in 1245 and rule the diocese for eight year this man be a saint and in 1261 he be canonise thus chichester get a shrine of its own which become exceedingly famous and attract vast crowd of pilgrim and thus indirectly bring so much money to the church that great work such as the transform lady chapel and the many chapel which the cathedral boast be able to be undertake st richard of chichester be not a sussex man he be bear about 1197 at droitwich in worcestershire and thus get he name richard de wyche he father a man well-to-do die however when richard be very young and he be only a younger son fall into poverty we find he accord to he fifteenth-century biographer labor on he brother 's land and to such good purpose it be say that he quite re - establish he family and withal such love be there between the brother that the elder would have resign all he estate in favor of the younger but richard would not consent prefer to go as a poor scholar to oxford where we learn that he live in the utmost poverty share indeed a tunic and a hooded gown with two companion so that the three could only attend lecture in turn at oxford he seem chiefly to have devote himself to the study of logic and for this purpose he presently go to pari return however to oxford to take he degree thence once more he set out this time to study canon law at bologna where he not only win a great reputation but be appoint a public professor of that faculty so beloved and respect be he in that great university where there be always a considerable english contingent that he tutor offer he he daughter in marriage and gladly would he have take she but that marriage be not for he so he set out for england and oxford where he be joyfully receive and indeed such be he fame that he be make chancellor of the university in truth he be in such great demand that both canterbury and lincoln wish to secure he and at last archbishop edmund rich succeed where robert grosseteste fail and richard become chancellor of canterbury and the dear friend of the archbishop they be indeed two saint together and even in they lifetime be greet as two cherubim in glory together they face the king when he continue to allow so many english bishopric to remain vacant and together they go into exile to pontigny and later to soissy where st edmund die heart-broken by the loss of so dear a friend richard retire into a dominican house in orlean and immerse himself in the study of theology there he be ordain priest and there he found a chapel in honor of st edmund but boniface of savoy who have succeed st edmund in the archbishopric of canterbury besought he to return he obey and be appoint rector of charing and vicar of deal in 1243 become once more chancellor of canterbury but still there remain the enmity of the king two good thing henry iii give we westminster abbey and edward i but he be almost as difficult as henry ii with regard to investiture fortunately he be not so obstinate or we might have have a martyr instead of a confessor in chichester as we have in canterbury in the year 1244 the see of chichester fall vacant by the death of bishop ralph neville and at the king 's suggestion the canon elect they archdeacon a keen supporter of he boniface at once hold a synod quash the election and recommend he chancellor richard as bishop to which the chapter agree the king be of course furious richard who be receive by he could do nothing with he and so immediately appeal to the pope innocent iv it be who consecrate he at lyon upon march 5 1245 even this do not move the king richard return to england find the temporality of he see disgracefully waste by the king seek and obtain a interview with henry but achieve nothing for a time he live at tar with a poor priest name simon for in he own diocese he be a beggar and a stranger as it be in a foreign land in 1246 however the pope have threaten excommunication the king give way and richard at once begin to reform he diocese to discipline he priest and to restore the ritual of he cathedral and indeed of all the church in he diocese he live a life of severe asceticism and give so much in alms that he be always a beggar usurer be punish by excommunication and jew be forbid to build new synagogue it be he too who first establish the custom of the easter offering contribution from the faithful to the cathedral know later as st richard 's penny he love the friar more especially the dominican who have befriend he at orlean and to which order he confessor belong he ardently preach the crusade and be eagerly loyal to st peter it be indeed as he be journey through southern england urge man to take the cross that at dover he fall ill and die there during mass in the hospitium dei he body be bury in a humble grave we read near the altar he have build in honor of st edmund he friend in the cathedral of chichester and from the moment of he death he be account a saint miracle be perform at he tomb which even prince edward visit and in 1262 in the church of the fransican at viterbo pope urban iv raise he to the altar in June 1276 st richard 's body be take from its grave in the nave of chichester cathedral and in the presence of king edward i and a crowd of bishop be translate to a silver gilt shrine later this be remove to the tomb in the south transept st richard be not only a popular hero and saint both before and after he death to he and he shrine be due very much that be most lovely in the cathedral and it be he who really reform the chapter there chichester have always be serve by a dean and chapter of secular canon the canon be originally of course resident but the chapter have always be poorly endow and as time go on residence be actually discourage perhaps then arise the canon 's vicar who represent the canon and chant in choir the vicar choral be however not incorporate until 1465 they be assist by ten or twelve boy chorister whose chief business it be i suppose to sing the lady-mass in prick-song beside this company of canon vicar and chorister directly serve the cathedral a number of chaplain serve the various altar and chantry within it which at the dissolution number fifteen st richard not only reorganise the cathedral staff but also establish the use of chichester which he order to be follow throughout the diocese this use be follow until 1444 when by order of the archbishop that of sarum be establish with the reformation of course everything but the cathedral itself and the form of its administration and government be sweep away nor be it long before even what henry and elizabeth have spare be demolish in 1643 chichester be besiege by waller and take after ten day he soldier we read pull down the idolatrous image from the market cross they brake down the organ in the cathedral and dash the pipe with they pole-axis cry in scoff harke how the organ goe and after they run up and down with they sword draw deface the monument of the dead and hacking the seat and stall indeed such be they malice that it be wonderful to see how much loveliness remain no cathedral i think and certainly no lesser church in england be so completely representative of the whole history of we architecture as be chichester in salisbury we have the most uniform building in we island in chichester the most various for it possess work in every style from the time of the saxon to that of sir gilbert scott it be bishop ralph who before 1108 build the church we know and complete it save upon the west front where only the lower part of the south-western tower be norman but work earlier than he saxon work may be see in the south aisle of the choir where there be two carve stone represent christ with martha and mary and the raising of lazarus bishop ralph 's church be badly damage by fire in 1114 and it would seem that the four western bay of the nave date from the follow rebuilding and restoration then in 1187 the cathedral be burnt again and bishop seffrid vault it for the first time -- till then only the aisle have be vault -- building great buttress to support this and re-erect the inner arcade of the clerestory apparently the apse and ambulatory which till then have close the great church on the east have be destroy in the fire at any rate bishop seffrid replace they with the exquisite retro-choir we have and square eastern chapel he do the same with the old apse of the transept and he recase the choir with caen stone use purbeck very freely and with beautiful effect all this work be very late transitional the very last of the norman or romanesque then in the thirteenth century which be to see st richard bishop of chichester the beautiful south porch be build a pure early english work the north porch almost as lovely and of the same date and later the sacristy beside the south porch in st richard 's own day the south - west tower be build as we see it the norman tower over the cross be destroy and a lighter one build in its place as we see and the galilee be set up before the western door then too the chapel be build out from the nave aisle upon the north those of st thoma st anna and st edmund upon the south those of st george and st clement thing unique in england and all largely work of the second half of the thirteenth century and the early decorate style which indeed give to the cathedral with its dark norman nave all its charm its variety and delight not much later than this transformation of the nave though the nave itself be not touch be the rebuilding or rather the lengthen and transformation of the lady chapel fundamentally this beautiful decorate chapel be a norman work transform into a transitional one to be glorified and transfigure in the very end of the thirteenth century and now spoil as we see all this be do either by st richard himself or with the money gather at he shrine in the first half of the fourteenth century little would appear to have be build save that certain beautiful window as that in the end of the south aisle of the choir and that in the south transept with bishop langton 's tomb beneath it be insert and the fine stall be build in the choir in the perpendicular period the detach campanile be erect to the north-west and the cathedral be crown by the great spire a noble work lose to we in we own time and replace by the copy of sir gilbert scott later still in the sixteenth century a great stone screen now destroy be erect across the church with chantry and the cloister be build there over a doorway on the south be a shield with the arm of henry vii and two figure kneel before the bless virgin attend by a angel hold a rise a few tomb of interest or beauty which the puritan fail to destroy remain to this great catholic building these be the tomb of st richard of which i have speak in the north transept against the choir the restore arundel chantry and tomb of richard fitzalan in the north aisle of the nave and the exquisite decorate tomb in the chapel of st john baptist at the eastern end of this aisle little beside it must indeed be confess that when all be say and do essentially romantic as the cathedral of chichester be with its so various style of architecture lovely as certain part of it be still it must always have be a building rather interesting than beautiful and it have suffer so much from vandalism and restoration that it can not be account a monument of the first order nevertheless i always return to it with delight and be reluctant to go away for in england certainly a cathedral even of the second order of restricted grandeur and spoilt beauty may be a very charming and delightful and precious thing as indeed this church of chichester be at any rate it be by far the most interesting thing leave to we in the city the other church except perhaps st olave 's be not worth a visit even in st olave 's everything have be do to make it as little interesting as possible the best thing leave to we in chichester apart from the cathedral and its subject building be i think st mary 's hospital a foundation date from the time of henry ii which possess a noble great hall and a pretty decorate chapel with old stall which be still use as a almshouse it stand upon the site of the first franciscan house establish in chichester in 1269 the friar minor leave this place and move to the site of the old castle there they build the church of which the choir still remain a lovely work ruin at the dissolution and use as the guildhall it be now a store room nothing in chichester be more beautiful than this early english fragment which seem to remind we of all we have lose by that disastrous revolution of the sixteenth century whose latest result we still await with fear and dread but let who will be disappoint in chichester i shall love it all my day not so much for these its monument but for itself its curiously sleepy air of disinterested quiet its strong dislike of any sort of enthusiasm its english boredom even of itself its complete surrender to what be its indifference to what might be may it ever remain secure within sight of the hill within sight of the sea steep in the tudor myth certain in its english heart that twice two be not four but anything one like to make it nor ever hear ribald voice call upon it to decide what after all it stand for in the world deny it any longer the consolation it love best of finding in the conclusion what be not in the premise or as the vulgar might put it of have its cake and eat it too chapter xvi selsey bosham and porchester it be my good fortune while i be in chichester to be tempt to explore the peninsula of selsey which most authority declare to have no beauty and little interest for the traveller to-day for st wilfrid 's sake i put aside these admonishment and one morning set out upon the lonely road to pagham across a country as flat as a fen of old as they say a forest the forest of mainwood and still in spite of drainage and cultivation very bleak and lonely with marsh here and there which be still the haunt of all kind of wild-fowl it be only to the man who find pleasure in the somerset moor the fen of cambridgeshire or the emptiness of romney marsh that this corner of england will appeal but to such a one it be full of interest and certainly not without beauty pagham however of which i have read with its creek and harbor its curious hush well its golden sand and extraordinary melancholy as it be a ruin of the sea sadly disappoint I only its melancholy remain its harbor where of old we read the sea-fowl be to be see in innumerable flock and the whole place be musical with the cry of the wild-swan have be wholly reclaim and the famous hush well no longer exist at all this last be a curious natural phenomenon and must have be worth see it consist apparently of a great pool in the sea one hundred and thirty foot long by thirty foot broad boil and bubble and boom all day long this be cause it be say by the air rush through a bed of shingle beneath which be a vast cavern from which the sea continuously expel the air as it rush in nothing of the sort exist at pagham to-day it have disappear with the reclamation of the harbor which itself be form we be tell in the fourteenth century by a tidal wave when nearly three thousand acre be inundate the only thing which the continual fight of man against water in this peninsula have leave we that be worth see in pagham to-day be the church of st thoma of canterbury this be a early english building much spoil by restoration the best thing remain be the beautiful arcade of the end of the twelfth century but the eastern window which consist of three lancet be charming as be the fourteenth-century chantry at the top of the north aisle found in 1383 by john bowrere in the chancel be a curious slab with a inscription in lombardic character perhaps a memorial of a former rector the font be norman the church be probably build by one of the early successor of st thoma in the see of canterbury for pagham belong to the archbishop until the reformation and certain ruin of they palace remain in a field to the south-east of the church at nyetimber on the chichester road a mile out of pagham be the ruin of a thirteenth-century chapel to reach selsey and its old church of we lady what remains of it from pagham be not a easy matter the footpath across the field be sometimes a little vague the walk however be worth the trouble it involve for you may thus gather some idea of the history of this unfortunate coast which the sea have be eat up for at least fifteen hundred year indeed in the time of st wilfrid the peninsula be probably nearly twice as big as it be to-day and selsey be undoubtedly a little island probably of mud divide from the mainland at least by the tide it be here st wilfrid be shipwreck in 666 and it be from he adventure in sussex that we learn of the extraordinary barbarism of the south saxon two generation after the advent of st augustine st wilfrid 's ship it seem be strand on the mud flat and the quite pagan south saxon attack he and the crew and it be only the rise of the tide which float the ship that save they with a loss of five man it be not till 681 that wilfrid really a fugitive come again into sussex and this time as to a refuge for ethelwalch king of the south saxon and he queen be then christian though they people be still pagan there be a certain monk however probably a irishman who have a small monastery at bosham encompass by the sea and the wood and in it be five or six brethren who serve god in poverty and humility but none of the native care either to follow they course of life or to hear they preaching of these heathen st wilfrid at once become the apostle for as bede tell we he not only deliver they from the misery of perpetual damnation but also from a inexpressible calamity of temporal death for no rain have fall in that province in three year before he arrival whereupon a dreadful famine ensue which cruelly destroy the people in short it be report that very often forty or fifty man be spend with want would go together to some precipice or to the sea-shore and there hand in hand perish by the fall or be swallow up by the wave but on the very day on which the nation receive the baptism of faith there fall a soft but plentiful rain the earth revive again and the verdure be restore to the field the season be pleasant and fruitful thus the former superstition be reject and idolatry explode the heart and flesh of all rejoice in the living god and become convinced that he who be the true god have through he heavenly grace enrich they with wealth both temporal and spiritual for the bishop when he come into the province and find so great misery from famine teach they to get they food by fishing for they sea and river abound in fish but the people have no skill to take they except eel alone the bishop 's man have gather eel-net everywhere cast they into the sea and by the blessing of god take three hundred fish of several sort which be divide into three part they give a hundred to the poor a hundred to those of whom they have the net and keep a hundred for they own use by this benefit the bishop gain the affection of they all and they begin more readily to hear he preach and to hope for heavenly good see that by he help they have receive that good which be temporal now at this time king ethelwalch give to the most reverend prelate wilfrid land of eighty-seven family which place be call selsey that be the island of the sea-calf that place be encompass by the sea on all side except the west where be a entrance about the cast of a sling in width which sort of place by the latin be call a peninsula by the greek a chersonesus bishop wilfrid have this place give he found therein a monastery which he successor possess to this day and establish a regular course of life chiefly of the brethren he have bring with he for he both in word and action perform the duty of a bishop in those part during the space of five year until the death of king egfrid and forasmuch as the aforesaid king together with the say place give he all the goods that be therein with the land and man he instruct they in the faith of christ and baptise they all among whom be two hundred and fifty man and woman slave all of whom he by baptism not only rescue from the servitude of the devil but give they they bodily liberty also and exempt they from the yoke of human servitude the church and monastery which st wilfrid thus found at selsey thereby establish the bishopric of sussex have long since disappear beneath the sea camden however tell we that he see the foundation at low water they lay about a mile to the east of the little church of we lady which remain complete until the middle of the nineteenth century when it be all pull down except the chancel which we see to-day in the graveyard which it serve as chapel it be a work of the fourteenth century and within be the fine sixteenth-century monument of john lew and he wife the old norman font have be remove to the new church of st peter at selsey build largely out of old material there too be a elizabethan chalice and paten of the sixteenth century thus nothing at all remain at selsey not even the landscape as it be in st wilfrid 's day till yesterday however one might realize in the loneliness and desolation of this low lean headland something of that far-off time in which the great bishop come here and have to teach that barbarous folk even to fish now even that be go or go for the new light railway from chichester be bring a new life to selsey which after all it would ill become we to grudge she by that railway indeed i return to chichester and then at once set out westward for bosham where i sleep bosham be perhaps the most interesting place in all this peninsula as well as probably the most ancient that bosham be a port of the roman seem likely but that it be the earliest seat of christianity in sussex after the advent of the pagan be certain there as bede tell we st wilfrid when he come into sussex in 681 find a scottish -lrb- most probably irish -rrb- monk name dicul who have in a little monastery encompass by the sea and the wood five or six brethren who serve god in poverty and humility with the conversion of the south saxon that monastery flourish the house grow rich and edward the confessor bestow it upon he norman chaplain osbern bishop of exeter whom of course the conqueror do not dispossess indeed the place become famous and appear in the bayeaux tapestry in the very first picture where we see harold and he knight ride towards bosham to embark for normandy bosham indeed be one of harold 's manor he father accord to the legend have acquire it by a trick _ da mihus basium _ say earl godwin to the archbishop aethelnoth thus claim to have receive bosham that earl godwin hold bosham we be assure by the domesday survey which also speak of the church presumably the successor of the old monastery of dicul this as i have say and as domesday book tell we bishop osbern of exeter hold of king william as he have hold it of king edward the bishop of exeter still hold it a royal free chapel in the time of henry i then be establish here in place as i suppose of the monk a college of six secular canon the bishop be the dean exeter indeed only once lose the church of bosham and that in a most glorious cause the cause of st thoma for when henry ii quarrel with becket -lrb- footnote : herbert of bosham possibly a canon of bosham be st thoma ' secretary and devoted follower and be certainly bear in bosham -rrb- he deprive the bishop of exeter who take he part of this church and bestow it upon the abbot of lisieux who hold it till 1177 when it come once more to the bishop of exeter who hold it he and he successor till the reformation in 1548 the college be suppress only one priest be leave to serve the church with a curate to serve the dependent parish of appledram the church as we have it to-day upon a little sloping green hill over the water be of the very greatest interest the foundation of a roman building have be discover beneath the chancel and the foundation and basis of the chancel arch may be a part of this building but the greater part of the building we have be undoubtedly saxon the great gray tower the nave the chancel arch one of the most characteristic work of that period and the chancel itself though enlarged in later time be without doubt building of saxon england mr baldwin brown in he fine work upon the art in early england thus speak of it : the plan as will be see at a glance have be set out with more than mediaeval indifference to exactness of measurement and squareing and the chancel diverge phenomenally from the axis of the nave the elevation be gaunt in they plainness and the now unplastered rubble-work be rough and uncomely but the dimension be ample the wall lofty and the chancel arch undeniably impose of the basis here he say : these slab be commonly attribute to the roman but it be not easy to see what part of a roman building they can ever have form the truth be that they bear no resemblance to know classical feature while they be on the other hand characteristically saxon the nearest parallel to they be to be find in the impost of the chancel arch at worth in sussex a place far away from roman site the worth impost like the basis at bosham be huge and ungainly testify both to the general love of bigness in the saxon builder and to he comparative ignorance of the normal feature which in the eleventh century be everywhere else crystallise into romanesque saxon england stand outside the general development of european architecture but the fact give it none the less of interest in we eye the church of holy trinity bosham be thus the most important saxon work leave to we in sussex indeed save for the aisle and arcade and the norman and early english addition to the chancel that glorious eastern window of five lancet which in itself be worth a journey to see the clerestory and the furniture we have here really a complete saxon work the font be later norman and not very interesting but the exquisite recessed tomb with the effigy of a girl lie upon it be a noble work of the thirteenth century say to mark the grave of canute 's daughter the crypt date also from that time near the south door be another fine canopied tomb say to be that of herbert of bosham the window be norman in the clerestory and early english and decorate elsewhere throughout the church the stall in the chancel be perpendicular but here if anywhere in south-eastern england we have a church date from the dark age in which happily we be persuade back again within the influence of the faith and of rome bosham then for every englishman be a holy place only second to glastonbury and canterbury : it be a monument of we conversion of the re-entry of england into christendom of that easter of ours which see we rise from the dead a few ruin mere heap of stone mark the site of the college to the north of the church of earl godwin 's manor-house only the moat remain near a ancient mill towards the sea and there upon the little green between the gray church and the gray sea one may best recall the reverent past of this lovely spot little be here for pride much to make we humble and exceed thankful god be worship here between the sea and the greenwood when we south saxon forefather be not only the merest pagan but so barbarous that they know not even how to fish when they be so wretched that in company they would cast themselves into the sea because there be no light in they heart and nothing else to do out of that darkness st wilfrid lead they but even before he come with the light of christ and of rome in some half barbarous way in this little place man pray and mass be say and there be the means of deliverance though man know it not be barbarian it be as though at bosham we be able to catch a glimpse as it be of all that darkness out of which we be come by the guide of a star -lrb- illustration : bosham -rrb- that bosham be a harbor in roman time and that it have more than a little to do with the founding of regnum and the building perhaps of the stane street i have long since convinced myself all these creek and harbor be probably know and use even then and certainly all through the middle age bosham be of importance as a port and the series of creek the most eastern of which it serve and the most western of which be southampton water with portsmouth harbor between they be still among the greatest port in england easily the greatest i suppose in the south country in order to see something of this low and muddy coast which have see so much of the history of england i set out from bosham very early one morning intend to make my way through emsworth and havant by the roman road which join chichester and southampton and run across the north of these creek which may perhaps be consider as one great port of which only the more western part be famous still that way have little to recommend it and indeed i learn little for the modern world have obliterate with its terrible footstep nearly all that might have remain of we humble and yet so glorious past and it be still early morning when i cross the hampshire boundary and come into the little town of emsworth once famous for its trade in foreign wine now i suppose best know as a yachting station emsworth be originally of far less importance than warblington of which it be a hamlet there the fair be upon the morrow of the feast of the translation of st thoma of canterbury to which saint the parish church of warblington be dedicate this be a very beautiful and interesting building but it be obvious at once that it can not always have stand in the name of st thoma for part of its central tower -- the church consist of chancel and nave with a tower between they north chancel vestry north and south nave-aisle and north porch -- be of saxon workmanship only one stage of this however now remain the lower part have be altogether rebuild this tower be originally a western tower the saxon church stand to the east of it there be no sign of norman work here and it seem probable that the saxon church remain until in the first year of the thirteenth century a new nave and aisle be build to the west of the old tower the lower part of which be then remove and the tower support by arch in order to open a way into the nave of the old church which thus become the chancel of the new it be then in all probability that the church be newly dedicate in honor of st thoma the whole of the old church nave and chancel together however be destroy before the end of the thirteenth century and a large new chancel build with a chapel or vestry at the eastern end upon the north at the same time the aisle of the nave be rebuild later in the fourteenth century the eastern arch bear the tower be rebuild and thus appear the church which in the main we still see the difference in the north and south arcade of the nave be though very striking here because of the great contrast between the exquisite and delicate beauty of the south with its cluster column of purbeck and the plain round stone column of the north common enough tradition have it that the church be build by two maiden lady who live in the old castle near the church and that each build a side of the church accord to she taste one be say to lie in the chapel at the east end of the south aisle where there be a tomb with effigy the other in a tomb in the north aisle the castle come in 1551 to sir richard cotton whose son george entertain queen elizabeth there for two day in 1586 in 1643 a richard cotton hold the strong house of warblington against the parliament till it be take by sixty soldier and a hundred musket all that remain of the place to-day be a beautiful octagonal tower of red brick and stone once part of the main gateway now when i have see all this i go on into havant and there at the cross-road i find the church of st faith close by a old sixteenth - century half-timbered house -- the old house at home havant be in spite of the modern world a place of miracle for it possess a spring to the south-west of the church call i think st faith 's which never fail in summer for drought nor in winter for frost but for all that the most interesting thing in the town remain the church this be a cruciform building with a tower over the cross and be as we have it of norman foundation though it seem to stand upon a roman site coin have be find when the old nave be destroy in 1832 and roman brick and cement and foundation the church we see however date absolutely from the late twelfth century and be nowhere it would appear older unhappily much be far later the nave be really a modern building and even the central tower have be entirely take down and rebuilt and indeed all period of english architecture would seem to have leave they mark upon the church between the end of the twelfth century and we own day the manor of havant belong when domesday survey be make to the monk of winchester but it be not of they but of william of wykeham we think here for he secretary thoma aylward be rector of this parish and in 1413 be bury here in the north transept where he brass still remain show he effigy vest in a cope he be not the only notable rector of havant for in 1723 bingham the author of the antiquity of the christian church be hold the living when he die three year before he have be wreck in the south sea bubble and this be suppose to have cause he death he work be put into latin and be i think one of the last english work to be translate into the universal tongue out of havant i go nor do i stay now on my way until a little after noon i reach porchester but in bedhampton i do not forget to pray for the soul of elizabeth julier who die there after a most unfortunate and most wretched life in 1411 this lady daughter of the marquis of julier and widow of john plantagenet earl of kent take the veil in she widowhood at waverley then appear sir eustace dabrieschescourt and she be young in spite of she vow marry he and have repent and confess she devote she life to penance be condemn daily to repeat the gradual and the penitential psalm and every year to go on pilgrimage to the shrine of st thoma this penance with other she perform during fifty-one year she be marry to dabrieschescourt in the church of wingham in kent and die here in bedhampton and be bury in the church of st thoma for the manor be she father 's and part of she first dower porchester where i find myself late in the afternoon be a very interesting and curious place what we really have that be ancient there be a great walled green about six hundred foot square we enter this area to-day on the west the outer gate be thus opposite to we in the eastern wall the castle keep and bailey on we leave in the north-west corner and the church to the south-east all this be mediaeval work but the origin of porchester be far older than that the place be a fortress of the roman it be certain that a roman road run as i have say from southampton to chichester which it enter by the west gate and meet the roman military highway the stane street which enter chichester by the east gate whither it have come from london ' bridge this roman road doubtless serve many a little port upon these creek and harbor that lie between southampton water and chichester harbor but undoubtedly the most important port upon that road apart from the two city which it join be the roman porchester it have be suggest and not without reason that the stane street itself date only from the latter part of the roman occupation of britain that it be in fact a purely military way build for the passage of troops which until the fourth century be certainly not need in any quantity in southern britain that they be need then be due to the saxon pirate the same pagan robber who when the legion leave we never to return in the first year of the fifth century might seem to have overrun the whole country now it seem fairly certain that roman porchester be a military and perhaps a naval fortress build not earlier than the fourth century here at the western extremity of what the roman call the litus saxonicum and for the purpose of defend southern britain from the raid of these barbarous and pagan rogue if so it might seem to be of one piece with that presumably purely military way the stane street and to give it its meaning at any rate the mediaeval builder of porchester castle use with the help of rebuilding and patching the roman fortification which do not perhaps differ very much and not at all in form from those we see roman porchester be just what mediaeval porchester be a great fortress not a city nor a village but a port similar to the other that line the saxon shore from the wash to beachey head of what become of the place in saxon time we be entirely ignorant the domesday survey speak of it as a hallum but in the first half of the twelfth century the norman build a castle in the north-west corner of the roman enclosure which in 1153 henry ii grant to henry manduit and from that time it appear as the military port as it be of the capital winchester henry ii richard i john and henry iii not only frequently take up they residence at porchester and there as in a strong place transact the most important business but they all of they most frequently set out thence for the continent in day when a king of england be as often abroad as at home except edward i there be scarcely a english king from henry ii to henry viii who do not use porchester and elizabeth the last royal visitor hold she court in the castle as we see it to-day the keep of porchester castle resemble that of rochester not only in its appearance though there it come short but in its arrangement it be however surround by some later ruin of the fourteenth and fifteenth century the use of which have i think never be ascertain the whole place be extraordinarily impressive and not less so on account of its contain a church within the roman wall possibly occupy the site of a roman sanctuary the church of we lady of porchester however as we see it be of course a norman building build not later than 1133 when henry i give it to the austin canon as they priory church but about 1145 the canon be remove to southwick where a house be build for they they must indeed have be very much in the way within so important a fortress see how international the interest of they congregation be the church of course remain it be originally a cruciform building with central tower but the south transept have be destroy as have the chapel east of the north transept where now the vestry stand the eastern apse too have be replace by a square end apart from these change however the church remain largely as it be in the time of henry i the west front be especially fine and the font with its relief of the baptism of we lord a very notable romanesque work i linger long in porchester indeed till sundown nothing in all england rightly understand be more reverent than this great ruin not even the wall it too like that great northern barrier be build in we defense by we savior against we worst foe the barbarian the pagan it too be a outpost of civilisation and of the faith against the darkness wherever rome have pass there a flower will blow for ever wherever rome have be there be light wherever rome have build there be something which move we as nothing else can do and not least here in england of my heart upon the verge of the saxon shore while we recall the past at evening and question the future the future which will not be know chapter xvii southampton when i leave porchester i go on into fareham to sleep and next morning set out by train for it be rain to go to clausentum before i leave the railway however the weather begin to clear and presently the sun break through the cloud so that when i come into clausentum the whole world be again full of joy clausentum which even to-day be not without charm be as i understand it the mother of southampton a roman perhaps even a celtic foundation for its name clausentum be certainly of celtic origin of its high antiquity there can at least be no doubt for there we may still see part of the roman wall near nine foot thick and innumerable roman remains have be find within they the situation of clausentum too be rather celtic than roman it stand upon a tongue of land thrust out into the itchen from the left bank between northam and st deny on the right bank the river wash its wall upon three side north south and west but upon the landward side to the east it be protect by two line of defense a outer and a inner the one nearly three hundred yard from the other at first this arrangement might seem rather celtic than roman and in fact it may well be that the roman occupy here earthwork far older than anything build by they in britain and yet it seem perhaps more probable that they be responsible for all we have here un-roman though it seem and that the true explanation be that the outer defence while they work be the older of the two that with the decline of they administration in the fourth century with the building of the stane street and the general walling of the roman town this older and larger defense be abandon and the place whatever it may have be reduce to a mere fort to hold which upon the landward side the inner defense be there build of the fate of clausentum in the dark age we know nothing if it be a mere fort with no life of its own it may or may not have be abandon but it would seem certain that with the renewal of civilisation in southern england by the return of christianity a town be establish upon the right bank of the estuary opposite clausentum this town be the first southampton and there athelstane be say to have establish mint this town however do not seem to have occupy the same site as the southampton we know but rather to have be gather about st mary 's church to the north-east as leland be tell when he visit southampton in 1546 the place be probably burn by the dane and it be to one of they to canute that we owe the foundation of the town we know if canute be the founder of southampton however it be the norman who really and finally establish it the greatness of the place as a port really date from the conquest the norman seem to have settle there early in considerable number and they energy and enterprise begin the development which continue throughout the middle age and the renaissance in the seventeenth century however southampton rapidly decline and this continue till in the time of we grandfather it be arrest and southampton rise again to become the chief port of southern england so extraordinary indeed have be she modern development that it have completely engulf the great town of the middle age which for all that still form the nucleus as it be of the modern city though no one i suppose would suspect it at first sight of the greatness of southampton in the middle age however there can be no doubt it be the best exit out of that england into normandy the natural port of the capital winchester and its whole record be full of glory it be in a very real sense the gate of england hither come the great ship from the south and the east from the port of normandy and anjou from bayonne and venice with wine and eastern silk leather from cordova sword and dagger from toledo spice from indium and color sugar from egypt here the merchant disembark to trade in the capital or to attend the great fair of st gile hither come the pilgrim thousand upon thousand to follow the old road from winchester to the shrine of st thoma at canterbury while out of southampton stream the chivalry of the crusade hence cheerly to sea sail the fleet of coeur de lion for palestine of edward iii for france the army that win at crecy the army that win at agincourt all the glory of mediaeval england southampton have see pass by that the abandonment of guienne and aquitaine by the english be a severe blow to southampton be certain but still it have the venice trade the flander galley laden with the spoil of the east the wine of the levant the fashion of proud italy and the real decline of southampton date from the moment when venice too be wound even to death by the discovery of the cape route to the east and the rise of portugal as it happen we have at the time of she greatest prosperity a description of the town from the hand of leland there be he write in the fair and right strong wall of new hampton eight gate over barr gate by north be the _ domus civica _ and under it the town prison there be a great suburb without it and a great double dyke well water on each hand without it the east gate be strong not so large as barr gate and in its suburb stand st mary 's church to the south gate join a castelet well ordinanced to beat that quarter of the haven there be another mean gate a little more south call god 's house gate of a hospital found by two merchant join to it and not far beyond it be the water gate without which be a quay there be two more gate the glory of the castle be in the dungeon that be both fair and large and strong both by work and the site of it there be five parish church in the town holy rood church standeth in the chief street which be one of the fairest street that be in any town in england and it be well build for timber building there be many fair merchant ' house and in the south-east part be a college of gray friar here be also a hospital call god 's house found by two merchant appropriate since to queen 's college oxford of all this what remain happily more than might seem possible consider the enormous modern development of the place the town of southampton stand look south-west upon a tongue of land thrust out south into the water with the estuary of the itchen upon the east and southampton water upon the west upon the south be the vast mud-flat sweep by every tide which the great modern dock now occupy the town be as we have see enclose by wall perhaps by canute certainly by the norman and these seem to have be enlarged by king john and rebuilt and repair after the french raid of 1338 they form a rude quadrilateral roughly seven hundred yard from north to south and three hundred from east to west be from twenty-five to thirty foot high and of vary thickness something of they still remain especially upon the west of the town over the quay here we have two great portion of the old wall which be practically continuous from the site of the bugle tower upon the south to the site of the bigglesgate about half-way up this western side this portion include two of the old gate the west gate and the blue anchor postern beyond the site of the bigglesgate the old wall have be destroy as far as the castle but from there it still stand all the way to the arundel tower at the north-west corner of the town so much for the western front upon the north the wall be break down at the western end the bargate which still stand be isolate but beyond two portion remain complete as far as the polymond tower at the north-east angle upon the east of the town there be very little standing until we come to the southern corner where god 's house tower and the south-east gate remain upon the south almost nothing be leave southampton in its mediaeval greatness have eight gate of which as we see four remain : two upon the west the west gate and the blue anchor postern one upon the north the bargate upon the east or rather at the south-eastern angle of the wall god 's house or south-east gate upon the south none at all the west gate be a plain but beautiful work of the fourteenth century a great square tower over a pointed arch under which be the entry the tower within consist of three stage the last be embattled and now roof while the first be reach by a picturesque outside stairway of stone which serve both it and the rampart close by against the wall be a timber building upon a stone basement call the guard-room date from the fifteenth century the best portion of the old wall run northward from the west gate over the western shore road this be norman work add to in the fourteenth century here be the blue anchor postern or as it be more properly call simply the postern little more than a round archway within the great arcading and the wall itself just to the south of this gate be the twelfth-century building know as king john 's palace we follow the grand old wall till it end upon the site of the bigglesgate where we turn eastward a little into the town and come to the castle of which unhappily almost nothing remain it consist of a great keep in the midst of a enclosure enter by two gate the castle gate upon the north-east where now be castle lane and the postern over the site of which we have enter the castle green the decay of this fortress date at least from the sixteenth century and apparently before the civil war it have be pull down the wall still enclose the bailey of the castle upon the west there in some sort still stand the castle water gate a mere fragment within which be a great vaulted chamber some fifty foot long and twenty-five foot high with only one small window from this fragmentary gate the wall sweep away to the salient for the most part norman but beyond the salient its character change two tower appear -- the catchcold tower of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century and the fine arundel tower now only a curtain of fourteenth - century work in the decorate style it be in these western wall of the town that we shall get we best idea of what mediaeval southampton be and if we add to we impression by a examination of the two remain gate one upon the north and the other at the south-east angle we may perhaps understand how formidable it must have appear stand up out of the sea arm at all point mediaeval southampton have eight gate of these as i have say but four remain the most notable of which be undoubtedly the bargate upon the north this be a fine work of various period in two stage the lower consist of a vaulted passage-way of fine proportion a work of the fourteenth century and the upper of a great hall the guildhall now use as a court room the original gate of course be norman and this seem to have endure until about 1330 two tower be build on either side without the gate and a new south front add in the first year of the fifteenth century a new north front be contrived and this remain more or less as we see it of old the gate be reach by a drawbridge across a wide moat beyond the bargate we come to the polymond tower or the tower of st deny beautiful with creeper this would seem to be in some way connect with the priory of st deny which hold all the church in the town as we shall see as for its other name of polymond it would seem to get it from that john polymond who in the fourteenth century from which time the tower as we see it date be nine time mayor of southampton as for the god 's house gateway to reach it we must cross the town it be a plain but charming work of two period the gate proper being of the thirteenth century while the tower with the two-storied building attach to it be of the fourteenth from the beginning of the eighteenth century until 1855 it be use as the town gaol the old town of southampton a town within a town be a fascinating study the interest of its gate and old wall be inexhaustible but apart from these it have little architectural beauty to boast of for all that it be amusing to linger there if only to solve the problem that time have contrived for we among these not the least be that of the first site of the town not one of the church in southampton be of any great beauty or interest but it be astonishing to find that the mother church be not in the town at all but at least half a mile outside it upon the north leland as i have already say be tell when he be in southampton in 1546 that the first town do not occupy the site of that we see but be further to the north where st mary 's stand the fact that st mary 's be the mother church would see to confirm this moreover there be no mention in the domesday survey of any church at all within the borough of hantune and though we may think that the church of st john then exist st john 's be never the mother church this be st mary 's which possess all the tithe of the town in the time of henry ii we find the king grant to the priory of st deny found in 1124 by henry i a priory of austin canon he chapel of st michael the holy rood st laurence and all saint that be all the church save st john 's already grant to the abbey of st mary of lira in southampton but that these chapel have some relation to the mother church of st mary might seem certain indeed the rector of st mary 's be continually in controversy with the canon as to he rights and eventually in the thirteenth century he win the day in any case the mother church of southampton be st mary 's outside the wall of the town that a saxon church stand upon this site be certain and this be possibly represent in leland 's time by the chapel of st nichola a poor and small thing which then stand to the east of the great church of we lady which he see and which probably date from the time of henry i this church be alas destroy by the town only a few year later because its spire be say to guide the french cruiser into southampton water and the stone be use to mend the road it may be that the chancel escape or it may be that a new and much smaller church be erect in 1579 this whichever it be be much neglect till in 1711 a nave be build on to it then in 1723 the chancel be destroy and a new one build in 1833 this be rebuild and then in 1878 a new church be build in place of the old which be pull down by street thus in st mary 's church the mother church of southampton to-day we have only a lifeless modern building much the same fate have befall the church within the wall of southampton the oldest that of st john be pull down in the seventeenth century that of holy rood in the high street be rebuild about fifty year ago so be st laurence while all saint be destroy in the eighteenth century the only ancient church remain be that of st michael which though not destroy be ruin in 1826 it remain however in part a norman building with a interesting font of the twelfth century a lectern of the fifteenth century and a fine tomb with the effigy of a priest in mass vestment the same fate which have so brutally overtake the church of southampton have with perhaps more excuse fall upon the old religious house the priory of st deny found by henry i upon which all these church within the wall be in a sense dependent have be totally destroy a piece of ruin wall alone remain the present church of st deny date from 1868 nor do much remain of the hospital of st julian or god 's house found for the poor in the town by gervase le riche in 1197 it be one of the most important hospital in the diocese of winchester and in 1343 the king its protector give it to queen 's college oxford just found by queen philippa as the possession of this college it survive the suppression and be still carry on its good work in 1560 about 1567 however certain walloon refugee from the low country settle in southampton and these be grant the use of st julian 's chapel by queen 's college the house should have remain to we but that in 1861 by as black a act of vandalism as be ever perpetrate this seat of learn sweep away all the old domestic building of the hospital which date from its foundation and in they place erect what we might expect at the same time restore the chapel of st julian of course out of all recognition may st julian forget queen 's college oxford for ever and ever -lrb- illustration : the tudor house opposite st michael 's church southampton -rrb- not far from this hospital for the poor the gray friar build they house in 1237 or rather the burgess of southampton build it for they include a cloister of stone but nothing remain at all of this house for the most part too the great house that of old fill southampton and help to glorify it be go the chiefest house write leland be the house that huttoft late customer of southampton build on the west side of the town the house that master lightster chief baron of the king 's exchequer dwelleth in be very fair the house that master mylle the recorder dwelleth in be fair and so be the house of niccotine and guidote italian of these what remain nothing the only noble dwelling be that call tudor house in st michael 's square a fine half-timbered building and of this nothing be know no the only thing to be enjoy in southampton to-day be the old wall with its gateway that upon the west still valiantly outface the modern world and recall for we all that noble great past out of which we be come and yet i suppose southampton be fulfil its purpose to-day more wonderfully than ever before it be once the port of england for those dominion oversea we hold in france they be go but other we have since acquire though less fair by far remain it be to these southampton look to-day south and east as of old over how many thousand mile of blue water chapter xviii beaulieu and christchurch while i be in southampton i make up my mind to visit a place which i have all my life desire to see but which i have never yet set eye upon i mean beaulieu abbey in the new forest to this end i set out early one morning by steamboat across southampton water and land at hythe whence i have only to cross the eastern part of beaulieu heath a walk of some five mile to find myself where i would be the day be fair the tide at the flood in the wood across the water i could see where netley abbey another cistercian house younger than beaulieu once lift up its voice in ceaseless praise of god the maker of all that beauty in which it stand scarcely spoil even now by the amazing energy of the modern world it be then with a light heart that i set out by a byway under furze down and so across the open heath come down at last through the wood to the ruin of the abbey and the river of beaulieu there can be no more delicious spot in the world st bernard love the valley as st benedict the hill and as st bernard be the refounder of the cistercian order to which beaulieu belong it like waverley tintern netley and a hundred other in england be set in one of those delicious vale in which i think england be richer than any other country and which here in england of my heart seem to demand rather we worship than we praise beaulieu abbey have always interested I in the first place it be one of the greatest though not the earliest house in england of the cistercian order that reform of the benedictine begin as william of malmesbury bear witness by a englishman stephen harding sometime a monk of sherborne and then it be the only religious house within the confines of the new forest it seem that in the year 1204 just a year after he have give the manor of faringdon in berkshire to st mary of citeaux and establish there a small house of cistercian monk king john found this great monastery of st mary of beaulieu for the same order make provision for not less than thirty brethren and give it faringdon for a cell john endowed the house with some six manor and several church give it a golden chalice and many cattle as well as corn and wine and money and besought the aid of the abbot of the order on behalf of the new house to such good purpose indeed do he support beaulieu that hugh the first abbot be alone he friend when innocent iii in the spring of 1208 place england under a interdict this hugh go as the king 's ambassador to rome and have receive promise of submission from the king who await he return in the mother house of the order in england at waverley be successful in reconcile he with the pope in return the king give he a palfrey among other present and the interdict be lift contribute nine hundred mark towards the building of beaulieu to be follow by other even more generous offering nor be henry iii neglectful of the place so that in 1227 upon the vigil of the assumption the monk be able to use they church though it be not till nineteen year later that the monastery be complete and dedicate in the presence of the king and queen prince edward and a vast concourse of bishop noble and common folk by the bishop of winchester upon that occasion prince edward be seize with illness and strange as it may seem we be tell that the queen remain in the abbey to nurse he for three week but the house be always under the royal protection edward i constantly stay there and the abbot be continually employ upon diplomatic business from 1260 to 1341 when he ask to be free from the duty the abbot of beaulieu sit in parliament and in 1368 edward iii grant the monk a weekly market within the precinct one other privilege unique in southern england beaulieu have the right to perpetual sanctuary grant by innocent iii and this seem to have be use to the full in the war of the rose at least we find richard iii inquire into the matter in 1463 there it seem perkin warbeck have find safety as have lady warwick after barnet and at the time of the suppression there be thirty man in sanctuary in the great close of beaulieu which seem to have include all the original grant of land make to the abbey by king john beaulieu evidently very greatly increase in honor for in 1509 its abbot be make bishop of bangor but continue to hold the abbey and when he die the abbot of waverley the oldest house of the order in england succeed he the post be greatly seek after the act of 1526 suppress the lesser monastery in which so many cistercian house perish do not touch beaulieu but netley fall early in the following year and the monk be send to beaulieu many then look for the spoil of the great abbey among they lord lisle who besought thoma cromwell for it but he be deny indeed there seem to have be no idea of suppress the house at that time but the abbot steven be a traitor in 1538 he eagerly sign the surrender demand by the infamous layton and petre and the site be grant to thoma wriothesley afterwards earl of southampton from whose family it come in the time of william iii to lord montagu and so to the duke of buccleuch who still hold it nothing can exceed the beauty of the remains of the house there by the river in perhaps the loveliest corner of southern england the great abbey church have go destroy at the suppression but not a little of the monastery remain the great gate house call the abbot 's lodging and now the palace house the seat of lord montagu of beaulieu a fine decorate building with a beautiful entrance hall may sometimes be see from this one pass across the grass to the old refectory now fit up as the parish church a noble work of the early english style of the thirteenth century as be the fine pulpit with its arcade in the thickness of the wall here of old the monk read aloud while he brethren take they meager repast from the refectory one come into the ruin cloister lovely with all manner of flower and so to the site of the old chapter house of the sacristy and the monastic building all that remain be in the early decorate style of the end of the thirteenth century here too upon the north stand the great abbey church three hundred and thirty-five foot long a cruciform building consist of nave with two aisle central tower transept with aisle chancel with circular apse and chapel now mark out in chalk upon the grass all about be the wood meadow fishpond and green of the monk who be go i do not know how this strike another who shall see it to-day in all its useless beauty in the midst of we restless and unhappy england but what i feel have already be express and by so good a englishman as william cobbett now i daresay he write that you be a very good protestant and i be a monstrous good protestant too we can not bear the pope nor they there priest that make man confess there sin and go down upon they marrow-bone before they but let we give the devil he due and let we not act worse by these roman catholic -lrb- who by the by be we forefather -rrb- than we be willing to act by the devil himself now then here be a set of monk none of they could marry of course none of they could have wife and family they could possess no private property they could bequeath nothing they could own nothing but that which they own in common with the rest of they body they could hoard no money they could save nothing whatever they receive as rent for they land they must necessarily spend upon the spot for they never could quit that spot they do spend it all upon the spot they keep all the poor beaulieu and all round about beaulieu see no misery and have never hear the damned name of pauper pronounce as long as those monk continue you and i be excellent protestant you and i have often assist on the 5th of November to burn guy fawke the pope and the devil but you and i would much rather be life holder under monk than rackrenter st thoma aquina have tell we that there be three thing for a sight of which he would have endure a year in purgatory not unwillingly : christ in the flesh rome in she flower and a apostle dispute christ in the flesh i would indeed i might have see and rome in she flower be worth even such a price but for I a apostle dispute would let I confess it have little attraction instead i would that i might see england before the fall england of the thirteenth fourteenth or fifteenth century england of my heart with all she great cathedral still alive with all she great monastery still in be those more than six hundred house destroy by henry and not least this house of the cistercian in beaulieu and if i might see that i should have see one of the fairest thing and the noblest that ever be in the world from beaulieu i set out in the afternoon across the forest and at first over the western part of beaulieu heath for brockenhurst the road across the heath be not in itself of much beauty but it afford some glorious view both of the forest and the sea as i draw nearer to brockenhurst however i come into the wood and the sylvan beauty of the vale through which the lymington river flow southward be delicious brockenhurst itself be charmingly embowered and be surround by some of the loveliest of the woodland the church stand high perhaps as a guide over a woodland churchyard and be the evident successor of a norman building as its south doorway and font of purbeck bear witness and the chancel arch too unless indeed this be earlier still the chancel however date from the fourteenth century a good example in its littleness of the decorate style but it be half spoil by the enormous pew which block the entrance the tower and spire and a good part of the nave be completely modern the great yew in the churchyard must date at least from edward i 's time and perhaps may have see the day on which red william fall from brockenhurst on the follow morning i set out again over the open heath for boldre southward many a fine view over the wood i have and once as i come down sandy down i catch sight of the isle of wight then the scene change and i come through meadow and past coppice into boldre in the midst of a wood as it be i suddenly find the church and this interested I more than i can well say for here again i find what at one time must have be a complete norman building surely if the history-book be right this be a astonishing thing but then as i have long since learn the history one be teach at school be a mere falsehood from start to finish there be probably no schoolboy in england who have not read of the awful cruelty and devastation that go with the formation of the new forest by the conqueror in 1079 it be generally speak of as only less appalling than the burning of northumberland it be say that more than fifty-two parish church within the new bound of the new forest be destroy and a fertile district of a hundred square mile lay waste and depopulate to provide william with a hunting-ground now if this be true how do it come that upon my first day in the forest i find a norman church at brockenhurst with something very like a saxon chancel arch and that upon my second day i walk right into another church in part norman too this be surely a astonishing thing it be also i find a fact that much of the new forest have be a royal hunting - ground in the saxon time and that the afforestation of william be not so much as mention in the saxon chronicle the whole story of the devastation of this great country would seem to rest upon the writings of william of jumièges or ordericus vitali neither of whom be alive at the time of the afforestation this must have be know surely to we modern historian but so be the history of england write we real grievance against william be not he afforestation but he cruel forest law which demand the limb of a man for the life of a beast a thing i think unknown in england before he advent it be this harsh law so bitterly resent which at last as we may think cost william rufus he life but the old tale remain and therefore i be greatly astonish in boldre church doubtless the original norman church consist of a nave chancel and north and south aisle the south aisle remain as do the arcade which separate it from the nave in the early english time the north aisle be rebuild or add perhaps for the first time and the chancel rebuilt later the church be lengthen westward and the tower build at the eastern end of the norman aisle in that aisle there be a tablet to william gilpin the author of forest scenery who be vicar of boldre for a generation die in 1804 aged eighty year he be bury in the churchyard boldre be certainly a place to linger in a place that one be sorry to leave but i could not stay be intent on lymington therefore i go down through the oak wood over boldre bridge to find the high road which presently bring I past st austin 's once belong to the priory of christchurch under buckland ring to the very ancient borough of lymington with its charming old ivy-clad church tower at the end of the high street the church in so far as it be old of the thirteenth and fourteenth century have little to boast of for it have be quite horribly restore in the long street of lymington i sleep there seem to be nothing to keep I in lymington and therefore early upon the follow morning i set out for milford five mile away by the sea and there i wonderfully see the needle and the great island and find another norman church norman that be to say in its foundation all saint milford consist to-day of chancel with north and south chapel west of it transept nave with north and south aisle and a western chapel on either side the western tower and a south porch it be a most beautiful and interesting building doubtless there originally stand here a twelfth-century norman church consist of nave with aisle and chancel of which two arch remain in the south arcade of the nave then in the thirteenth century the church be rebuild as we see it and very beautiful it be in its early english dress pass into decorate in the chancel and transept from milford through a whole spring day i go on by the coast as far i could westward to christchurch all the way the sea the sky and the view of the island and of christchurch bay close by hengistbury head in the west and the long bar on which hurst castle stand in the east be worth a king 's ransom they say all this coast have strong attraction for the geologist but what of the poet and painter surely here when the wind come over the sea and the island show he tooth to possess the lean coast one may see and understand why england be the england of my heart at least i think so and linger there so long that twilight have fall before i find myself under the darkness of the great priory of christchurch the goal of my desire it be not without due cause and reason that i wish to see instead of a apostle dispute england before the fall indeed i be sure that i should not have be unwise to exchange rome in she flower for such a sight as that christchurch prove it we march up and down england and count up we treasure of which this priory of christchurch be not the least but we never pause perhaps to remember what through the damnable act of thoma cromwell and henry tudor we have lose what we have lose hundred of church hundred of monastery as fine as christchurch and hundred far more solemn and reverent reading which now give a title to a isaac -lrb- god save we all -rrb- be before the fall just a great monastery a norman pile as grand as durham or ely what of glastonbury and amesbury older far and of those many hundred other which stand up strong before god for we soul -- without avail they be go christchurch in some sort remain christchurch stand in the angle where the river avon and stour meet and it be thus secure upon the north east and south its great and perhaps its only attraction be the great priory church in whose name that of the town twyneham have long be lose but there be beside a ruin norman house and a pretty mediaeval bridge over the avon from which a most noble view of the great church may be have this which date in its foundation from long before the conquest be to-day a great cruciform building consist roughly of norman nave and transept the nave buttress on the north in the thirteenth century fifteenth-century chancel and western tower and thirteenth-century north porch -- altogether one of the most glorious church leave to we in england its history as i say go back far beyond the conquest when it be serve by secular canon as it be at the time of the domesday survey when we find that twenty-four be in residence but in the time of william rufus ranulph flambard the bishop of durham he chief minister obtain a grant of the church and town of christchurch and soon have suppress all the canonry save five and would have suppress they all but for the timely death of the red king which involve the fall and imprisonment of he rascal minister after a interval in which the church be govern by gilbert de dousgunel who set out for rome to get the pope 's leave to refound the house but die upon the journey henry i give manor town and church to he cousin richard de redver who prove a great benefactor to the priory and establish a dean over the canon one peter who be succeed by dean ralph then in 1150 come dean hilary who as bishop of chichester petition richard de redver to establish christchurch as a priory of canon regular of st austin this be do a certain reginald be appoint first prior and he rule christchurch for thirty-six year till in 1186 he be succeed by ralph it be not however till the time of the third prior that the high altar of the new church begin by gilbert and continue by richard de redver and he prior be dedicate upon the feast of st thoma of canterbury 1195 this would seem to prove that the norman choir be not finish until then similar consecration of other altar would lead we to believe that perhaps the vault and the clerestory of the nave be complete in 1234 at the same time the beautiful north porch be build and the north aisle be buttress to the fourteenth century we owe the fine rood screen restore in 1848 but the next great period of building be the fifteenth century when the lady chapel with the chapel north and south of it be build and later in the same century the great choir be entirely re-erected thus christchurch priory grow until the reformation it escape the first raid of cromwell in 1536 but in spite of the petition of john draper the last prior in 1539 the house be demand of he and he surrender it the report of the vandal and sacrilegious person who receive it be worth copying if only to show they character we find they write the prior a very honest conformable person and the house well furnished with jewel and plate whereof some be meet for the king 's majesty in use as a little chalice of gold a goodly large cross double gilt with the foot garnish and with stone and pearl two goodly bason double gilt and there be other thing of silver in thy church we find a chapel and monument curiously make of caen stone prepare by the late mother of reginald pole for she burial which we have cause to be deface and all the arm and badge to be delete it be console to note that one of the rascal that sign that report dr london be shortly afterwards expose in he true color and openly put to penance for adultery before he die in prison where he lay for perjury the report state that the church be superfluous it be the only true word write there when a religion be destroy its temple be certainly superfluous however there be a considerable influence bring to bear by the people of the neighborhood and the church itself be grant they for they use the priory which stand to the south of the church be of course destroy one might stand a whole month in that glorious building with this only regret that it be in the hand of stranger the use to which it be put be not that for which it be intend and half the delight of the place be thus lose to we but no one can pass down that great avenue of elm to the glorious north porch a master-work of the thirteenth century without rejoice that when all be say the church be save to we the great norman nave with its thirteenth-century clerestory and alas modern stucco vault the norman aisle and north transept be too reverent for destruction the fifteenth-century choir and eastern chapel too lovely a certain amount of the old furniture remain to the church in the restore screen of the fourteenth century and the reredos over the communion table and another in the lady chapel here too be the old altar stone of purbeck the chantry of the poor countess of salisbury who be behead for high treason in 1541 so brutally deface by dr london and he infamous colleague stand there too upon the north and close by in the north chapel be the tomb with fine alabaster effigy of sir john and lady chydroke -lrb- d 1455 -rrb- remove from the nave and in the lady chapel lie its founder sir thoma and lady west of the modern restoration and addition i have nothing to say and more especially of the monument to shelley a parody of a pietà merely blasphemous beneath the tower now when i have see all this to say nothing of the old school-room over the lady chapel and the norman house and castle mound of the de redvers somewhat sorrowful for many thing i begin to think again of the forest and immediately set out where the road lead to lyndhurst and this just before midday chapter xix the new forest and romsey abbey all day i go through the forest sometimes by green ride enchant still such as those down which lancelot ride with guinevere talking of love sometimes over heath wild and desolate such as that which know the bitterness of lear sometimes through the greenwood ancient british woodland silent now where the hart be once at home in the shade and where at every turn one might expect to come upon rosalind in she boy 's dress and think to hear from some glade the word of amien ' song : under the greenwood tree who love to lie with I and turn he merry note unto the sweet bird 's throat come hither come hither come hither there be day in life of which it can only be say that they be bless golden day upon which look back the sun seem to shine they dazzle in the memory such be the day i spend in the byway of holmsley and burley in the upper valley of avon water ober water and black water forest stream in the silent wood where all day long the sun shower its gold sprinkle the deep shade with flower and blossom of light where there be no wind but only the sighing of the wood no sound but the whisper of the leaf or the rare flutter of a bird 's wing no thought but joyful thought fill the heart with innocence who doth ambition shun and love to live i ' the sun seek the food he eat and pleased with what he get come hither come hither come hither at evening i come to lyndhurst lyndhurst be the capital of the forest as its name imply it be establish in a wood of lime a tree say to have be introduce into england only in the sixteenth century it be already speak of in the tenth century anglo-saxon ballad of the battle of brunanburh athelstan king lord among earl bracelet bestower and baron of baron he with he brother edmund athele gain a lifelong glory in battle slew with the sword-edge there by brunanburh brake the shield wall _ hew would the lindenwood _ hack have the battleshield son of edward with hammer brand oak beech and holly which so largely make up the woodland of the new forest we have always have in england but the lime which name lyndhurst it be say we owe to someone else and if so it can only be to the roman what the forest be when the roman administer the land we know not but in anglo-saxon time it be doubtless a royal hunting ground _ terra regi _ and _ silva regi _ for spoil which by fire as for kill the game therein fine must be pay these royal hunting grounds of which the great forest in hampshire be certainly not the least only become legal forest with the conquest when they be place under a new forest law of extraordinary harshness which even in the conqueror 's time indeed demand a eye or a hand for the taking of game and in the day of the red king the life of a man for the life of a beast the conqueror as we know greatly enlarged the old royal hunting ground here in hampshire when he make the new forest and that act of he which bring a immensely larger area than of old under a new and incredibly harsher forest law gradually produce a legend of devastation and depopulation here which as i have already say can no longer be accept as true henry of huntingdon -lrb- 1084-1155 -rrb- assert that to form the hunting ground of the new forest he -lrb- william -rrb- cause church and village to be destroy and drive out the people make it a habitation for deer it be true that the conqueror forge a charter purport to date from canute in which the king 's sole right to take beast of chase be assert and to this he appeal as justify he harsh new law but it be untrue that he depopulate and destroy a thriving district to make a wilderness for the red deer we shall find say warner that the land comprise in this tract -lrb- the new forest -rrb- appear from they low valuation in the time of the confessor to have be always unproductive in comparison with other part of the kingdom and that notwithstanding this pretended devastation they sink -lrb- in many instance -rrb- but little in they value after they afforestment so that the fact seem to have be william finding this tract in a barren state and yielding but little profit and be strongly attach to the pleasure of the chase convert it into a royal forest without be guilty of those violence to the inhabitant of which henry of huntingdon malmesbury walter mape and other complain of this great new forest lyndhurst be make the capital and the administrative center and such it be still in domesday book we read : the king himself hold lyndhurst which appertain to amesbury which be of the king 's farm the king grant a small part namely one virgate to herbert the forester before 1086 and this herbert be generally suppose to have be the ancestor of those lyndhurst who for so long hold the wardenship of the forest the king 's house a fine building of queen anne 's time be the successor of the old royal lodge at least as old as the fourteenth century and be now occupy by the deputy surveyor of the forest in the verderer ' hall close by the forest court of the verderer be still hold there too may be see the old dock certain trophy of the chase and the stirrup-iron of william rufus really the seventeenth century gauge for the dog allow to be keep in the forest without expeditation the ` law ' be carry out on all ` great dog ' that could not pass through the stirrup lyndhurst itself as we see it to-day be devoid of interest even the church date but from 1863 and its greatest treasure be the wall - painting by lord leighton of the wise and foolish virgin in the chancel a church a chapelry of minstead certainly stand here in the thirteenth century but be destroy and a georgian building erect -- in its turn to give place to the church we see lyndhurst though almost without interest itself be undoubtedly the best center for explore the forest or at any rate perhaps the most beautiful and certainly the most interesting part of it so by many a byway i go northward to minstead in malwood where i find a most curious church rather indeed a house than a church with dormer window in the roof a enormous three-decker pulpit within gallery and two great pew one with a fireplace and i know not what other quaint rubbish of the eighteenth century all this i find enchanting and more especially because the nave and chancel seem to I to be originally of the thirteenth century and certainly the font be norman but the church with its eighteenth-century tower be perhaps the most amazing conglomeration of the work of all period since the twelfth century to be find in southern england from minstead i go on up the bartley water to stone cross nearly four hundred foot over the forest from which by good fortune i see the mighty abbey of romsey in the valley of the test where i intend to sleep then i go down past castle malwood to where stand rufus ' stone there i read : here stand the oak-tree on which a arrow shoot by sir walter tyrrell at a stag glance and strike king william ii surname rufus on the breast of which stroke he instantly die on the 2nd August 1100 king william ii surname rufus be slay as before related be lay in a cart belong to one purkess and draw from hence to winchester and bury in the cathedral church of that city that where a event so memorable have happen might not hereafter be unknown this stone be set up by john lord delaware who have see the tree grow in this place anno 1745 this stone have be much mutilate and the inscription on the three side deface this more durable memorial with the original inscription be erect in the year 1841 by he sturge bourne warden the memorial and inscription be of iron the most famous thing that ever befall in the new forest be this strange murder or misfortune which cost the red king he life it haunt the whole forest and rightly understand fill it with meaning and can never have be or be far from the thought of anyone who wander there even as i have do in the excellent day of spring -lrb- illustration : in the new forest -rrb- no less than three member of the conqueror 's family be kill in the new forest first richard one of he son then another richard bastard son of duke robert of normandy this in may 1100 and in August of the same year he son and successor william surnamed rufus all these death be say to have be cause by accident all be cause by arrow it be a strange thing all we really know about the death of william rufus may be find in the english chronicle on the morrow be the king william shoot off with a arrow from he own man in hunting whether the arrow as tradition have it be shoot by walter tyrrel or no whether it be aim at the king or no can never now be know the most graphic account of the affair be give to we by ordericus vitali who however be not only not present but at best can have be but a child at the time for he die in 1150 for all that he doubtless have access to source of which we now know nothing and the whole atmosphere of he story suggest that as we might expect the king be murder because of he general harshness and oppression perhaps especially exemplify in he forest law it be he and not the conqueror who demand the life of a man for that of a beast he father have be content with a eye or a limb it would seem accord to ordericus that the whole country be full of story of terrible vision concern the end of the king long before he sudden death henry of huntingdon for instance tell we that blood have be see to spring from the ground in berkshire and add that the king be rightly cut off in the midst of he injustice for england could not breathe under the burden lay upon it ordericus himself say that terrible vision respect he be see in the monastery and cathedral by the clergy of both class and become the talk of the vulgar in the market-place and churchyard could not escape the notice of the king he then give a particular instance : a certain monk of good repute and still better life who belong to the abbey of st peter at gloucester related that he have a dream in the vision of the night to this effect : ' i see ' he say ` the lord jesus seat on a lofty throne and the glorious host of heaven with the company of the saint stand round but while in my ecstasy i be lose in wonder and my attention deeply fix on such a extraordinary spectacle i beheld a virgin resplendent with light cast herself at the foot of the lord jesus and humbly address to he this petition o lord jesus christ the savior of mankind for which thou didst shed thy precious blood when hang on the cross look with a eye of compassion on thy people which now groan under the yoke of william thou avenger of wickedness and most just judge of all man take vengeance i beseech thee on my behalf of this william and deliver I out of he hand for as far as lie in he power he have polluted and grievously afflict I the lord reply be patient and wait awhile and soon thou wilt be fully avenge of he i tremble at hear this and doubt not that the divine anger presently threaten the king for i understand that the cry of the holy virgin we mother the church have reach the ear of the almighty by reason of the robbery the foul adultery and the heinous crime of all sort which the king and he courtier cease not daily of commit against the divine law ' on be inform of this the venerable abbot serle write letter which he despatch in a friendly spirit from gloucester inform the king very distinctly of all the monk have see in he vision william of malmesbury also record that the king himself the day before he die dream that he be let blood by a surgeon and that the stream reach to heaven cloud the light and intercept the day call on st mary for protection he suddenly awake command a light to be bring and forbid he attendant to leave he they then watch with he several hour until daylight shortly after just as the day begin to dawn a certain foreign monk tell robert fitz haman one of the principal nobility that he have that night dream a strange and fearful dream about the king : that he have come into a certain church with menacing and insolent gesture as be he custom look contemptuously on the stander by then violently seize the crucifix he gnaw the arm and almost tear away the leg that the image endure this for a long time but at length strike the king with its foot in such a manner that he fall backwards from he mouth as he lay prostrate issue so copious a flame that the volume of smoke touch the very star robert thinking that this dream ought not to be neglect as he be intimate with he immediately relate it to the king william repeatedly laugh exclaimed ` he be a monk and dream for money like a monk give he a hundred shilling ' nevertheless add william of malmesbury be greatly move the king hesitate a long while whether he should go out to hunt as he design he friend persuade he not to suffer the truth of the dream to be try at he personal risk in consequence he abstain from the chase before dinner dispel the uneasiness of he unregulated mind by serious business they relate that have plentifully regale that day he soothe he care with a more than usual quantity of wine all this i suppose befall in the castle of malwood after dinner the king prepare to hunt be in great spirit say ordericus he be joke with he attendant while he boot be be lace when a armourer come and present he six arrow the king immediately take they with great satisfaction praise the work and unconscious of what be to happen keep four of they himself and hold out the other two to walter tyrrel it be but right say he that the sharpest arrow should be give to he who know best how to inflict mortal wound with they this tyrrel be a french knight of good extraction the wealthy lord of the castle of poix and pontoise fill a high place among the noble and a gallant soldier he be therefore admit to familiar intimacy with the king and become he constant companion meanwhile as they be idly talk and the king 's household attendant be assemble about he a monk of gloucester present himself and deliver to the king a letter from he abbot have read it the king burst out laughing and say merrily to the knight just mention walter do what i tell you the knight reply i will my lord slighting then the warning of the elder and forget that the heart be lift up before a fall he say respect the letter he have receive i wonder what have induce my lord serlo to write I in this strain for i really believe he be a worthy abbot and respectable old man in the simplicity of he heart he transmit to I who have enough besides to attend to the dream of he snore monk and even take the trouble to commit they to write and send they a long distance do he think that i follow the example of the english who will defer they journey or they business on account of the dream of a parcel of wheeze old woman thus speak he hastily rise and mount he horse ride at full speed to the forest he brother count henry with william de bretanel and other distinguished person follow he and have penetrate into the wood the hunter disperse themselves in various direction accord to custom the king and walter tyrrel post themselves with a few other in one part of the forest and stand with they weapon in they hand eagerly watch for the come of the game when a stag suddenly run between they the king quit he station and walter shoot a arrow it graze the beast 's grizzly back but glance from it mortally wound the king who stand within its range he immediately fall to the ground and alas suddenly expire william of malmesbury give a somewhat different account of the king 's death the sun be decline when the king draw he bow and let fly a arrow slightly wound a stag which pass before he and keenly gaze follow it still run a long time with he eye hold up he hand to keep off the power of the sun 's ray at this instant walter conceive a noble exploit which be while the king 's attention be otherwise occupy to transfix another stag which by chance come near he unknowingly and without power to prevent it -- oh gracious god -- pierce he breast with a fatal arrow on receive the wound the king utter not a word but break off the shaft of the weapon where it project from he body fall upon the wound by which he accelerate he death walter immediately run up but as he find he senseless and speechless he leap swiftly upon he horse and escape by spur he to he utmost speed indeed there be none to pursue he some consent in he flight and other pity he and all be intent on other matter some begin to fortify they dwelling other to plunder and the rest to look out for a new king a few countryman convey the body place on a cart to the cathedral at winchester the blood drip from it all the way here it be commit to the ground within the tower attend by many of the nobility though lament by few next year -lrb- really in 1107 -rrb- the tower fall though i forbear to mention the different opinion on this subject lest i should seem to assent too readily to unsupported trifle more especially as the building might have fall through imperfect construction even though he have never be bury there he die in the year of we lord 's incarnation 1100 of he reign the thirteenth on the fourth before the none of August aged above forty year so die the red king whose arrow it be that slew he whether it come aforethought from a english bow or by chance from that of walter tyrrel we shall never know the red king fall in the new forest and there be no one in all broad england to mourn he william of malmesbury say that a few countryman carry he body to winchester we may well ask why not to malwood castle which be close by we may ask but we shall get no answer accord to a local legend it be a charcoal burner of minstead purkess by name who find the king 's body and bear it away and ever after he descendant have remain in minstead neither richer nor poorer than they ancestor as for sir walter he be say to have swear to the prior of st deny de poix a monastery of he foundation that he know nothing of the king 's death leland tell we that in he day not only do the tree still exist against which accord to he the arrow glance off and strike the king but a little chapel remain there then very old in which mass be wont to be offer for the repose of the king 's soul i wish that i might have see it for it would have please I now when i have well consider all this not without a orison for that misguided king i set off for cadnam and hold now only to the road march fast for it be late i come over the ridge beyond black water into the valley of the test and so enter romsey a little after it be dark -lrb- illustration : romsey abbey -rrb- romsey as i soon find on the follow morning have nothing at all to offer the traveller except one of the most solemn and noble norman church in all england monastic too for it be the church of the great benedictine nunnery of we lady of romsey it be impossible to exaggerate the impression this astonishing norman pile of vast size and unsurpassed age and reverence make upon the traveller one seem in look upon it to see before he eye the foundation of england i can not hope to describe it or to convey to another what it mean to I it be at once grandiose and reverent of enormous almost incredible size and weight and strength larger than many a cathedral heavy as a kingdom stronger than a thousand year it seem to have be hew bodily out of the cliff or the great hill it be enormously old the house be found or perhaps refound more than a millennium ago by edward the elder in 907 he daughter be abbess here and here be bury in 967 edgar he grandson give the house to the benedictine it remain english after the conquest for william seem not to have deal with it and in 1086 the sister of edgar atheling become abbess out of it henry i choose he bride that abbess 's niece maud a novice of we lady of romsey say i not well that it be as the foundation of england we know little of the abbey for near a hundred year after that and then in 1160 the daughter of king stephen mary whose uncle henry of bloi be bishop of winchester become abbess and it be decide to rebuild the place thus the great norman church we have arise in the new england of the twelfth century mary princess and abbess be however false to she vow how long she be abbess we do not know perhaps only a few month or even day at any rate in the very year she become abbess the year of she mother 's death -lrb- footnote : see supra under faversham -rrb- she forsake she trust and marry the son of the earl of flander and by he she have two daughter then come repentance she separate from she husband and return to romsey as a penitent the great religious house which have grow up thus with england continue its great career right through the middle age about forty nun serve there in the thirteenth and fourteenth century though this number have dwindle to twenty-three at the time of the surrender in 1539 how this surrender be make we do not know but whether with or without trouble the result be the same the great convent be utterly destroy many of the land pass to sir thoma seymor and the people of romsey who have always have a right to the north aisle of the church which indeed they enlarged at they own expense in 1403 buy the whole from the crown for one hundred pound in 1554 i have say that there be undoubtedly a great saxon church here where the norman abbey of romsey now stand and part of the foundation of this great building be discover in 1900 that building found by edward the elder rebuilt by edgar and restore by canute stand till the building of the present church in 1125 the older part of this building -lrb- 1125-1150 -rrb- be to the east of the nave and consist of sanctuary and transept : the nave be begin towards the end of the twelfth century the church be finish in the beginning of the thirteenth the church be cruciform two hundred and sixty-three foot long and one hundred and thirty-one wide it consist of a great sanctuary with aisle end in chapel square without apsidal within wide transept each have a eastern apsidal chapel nave with aisle and over the cross a low tower which be once higher have now a seventeenth century polygonal belfry to the east of the sanctuary stand two long chapel destroy since the suppression we have here as i have say one of the most glorious norman building in the world norman work which at the western end pass into the most delightful early english the cloister stand to the south of the nave to the north stand of old the parish church grow out of the north aisle as it be build so in 1403 this have be destroy and the north aisle wall have be rebuild as in 1150 the church possess more than one thing of great interest the old high-altar stone be still in existence and be now use as the communion table in the south transept be a fine thirteenth century effigy of a lady carve in purbeck at the end of the south aisle of the choir be a remarkable stone crucifix that evidently belong to the old saxon church about the cross stand we lady st john and the roman soldier above be angel a later rood be to be see in the eastern wall of the old cloister which abut on to the transept this date from the twelfth century in the north aisle of the choir be a very fine painting which use to stand above the high altar in catholic time there we see still the resurrection of we lord with two angel above be ten saint among they st benedict and st scholastica st gregory st augustine of canterbury st franci and st clare this fine work which of old show above christ in glory be of the end of the fourteenth century now when you have see romsey abbey thus as it be with the head then be the time to begin to get it by heart in all south england you may find no greater glory than this nor one more entirely we very own at least we own as we be but yesterday it may be that such a place as romsey abbey mean nothing to we and can never mean anything again but i 'll not believe it for to think so be to despair of england to realize that england of my heart have really pass away there be two way by which a man may go from romsey in the valley of the test to winchester in the valley of the itchen the more beautiful for it give you if you will not only otterbourne shawford and compton to the west of the stream but twyford to the east the queen of hampshire village be that which make for the roman road between winchester and southampton and follow up the valley of the itchen enter winchester at last by the south gate after pass st cross in the mead the shorter road though far less lovely be in some way the more interesting for it pass merdon castle and hursley where the son of oliver cromwell lie and for this cause i prefer it merdon castle of which some few scanty ruin remain be build by the bishop henry of bloi about 1138 and no doubt it serve its purpose in the anarchy of stephen 's time but thereafter it seem to have become rather a palace than a fortress the manor of merdon have always belong to the see of winchester it be say since 636 when it be grant to the bishop by king kinegil it remain with the bishopric until the reformation when it be grant to sir philip hoby to be restore to the church by queen mary and then again regrant to the hoby family about 1559 the manor have pass however by 1638 to richard major a miser and a tyrant who usurp authority over he tentant and more especially for he be a fanatic roundhead when king charle be put to death and oliver cromwell be protector of england and richard major of he privy council and noll 's eldest son richard be marry to mr major 's doll thus merdon come into the cromwell family another piece of church property upon which that very typical sixteenth-century family have already grow exceedingly wealthy richard cromwell -lrb- as he call himself -rrb- live at merdon a good deal till he succeed he father in the usurped governance of england but when he be turn out in 1660 he find it safer to return to merdon but only for a little while france offer he as he wisely think a more secure asylum not only from a charge of high treason but from he creditor while he be abroad we learn he go under another name not a new experience for one of he family which seem to have have no legitimate name of its own its member oliver amongst they sign in important personal matter such as get hold of the dowry of they wife william _ alias _ cromwell it would therefore be interesting to know under what alias this latest descendant of the infamous minister of henry viii correspond with the wife and family he have leave at merdon he do not return to merdon till 1705 upon the death of he son oliver he wife have die in 1676 and he time be soon to come he die at cheshunt in 1712 and be bury with considerable pomp in hursley church where we may still see he monument move from the old church and re-erect in that build by the effort of john keble vicar of this parish for thirty year from 1836 to 1866 and so consider all these strange thing i go on to winchester chapter xx winchester i do not know what it be that move I so deeply in the old city of southern england in canterbury rochester chichester most of all perhaps in winchester unless it be that they sum up in a way nothing else can do the england that be surely and irrevocably pass away how reverently we approach they with what hesitation and misgiving we try to express what we feel about they they be indeed the sanctuary of england sanctuary in which it be wiser to pray than to exult since they beauty and antiquity they repose and quietness fill we with a extraordinary uneasiness and amazement a kind of nostalgia which nothing really we own can satisfy for if winchester appeal to we as the symbol of england it be not the england of we day for which she stand let manchester or sheffield stand for that place so unquiet so meanly wretched and hopeless that no one have ever think of they without a kind of fear and misery alas they be the reality while winchester gradually fade year by year into a mere dream city as it be camelot indeed too good to be true establish if at all rather in the cloud or in we heart than upon the earth we tread and if in truth she stand for something that be once we own it be for something we be gradually leave behind we discard and forget something that after four century of disputation and anarchy no man any longer believe capable of realisation here and now yet winchester endure in she beauty she now so precarious loveliness and while she endure it be still possible to refuse to despair of england for she be co-eval with we before we know ourselves or be aware of we destiny she stand beside the itchen within the shadow of she hill east and west in the mead and the water meadow she see the advent of the roman she claim to be arthur 's chief city as later she be the throne of the saxon king in she council chamber england be first name england of what indeed she be before the roman come and draw we within they great administration we be largely ignorant but we know that they establish here a town of considerable importance which they call venta belgarum larger than silchester if we may believe that the mediaeval wall stand upon roman foundation and certainly a center of roman administrative life four roman road undoubtedly find in she they goal and terminus come into she forum from sorbiodunum -lrb- old sarum -rrb- upon the west from calleva -lrb- silchester -rrb- upon the north from porchester upon the south and from clausentum upon the south-west she chief temple in roman time before the advent of christianity be that of apollo which be say to have occupy the site of the cathedral close by be the temple of concord while it be impossible to believe that a town so plentifully supply by nature with water be without considerable bath legend have it indeed that winchester be the capital of the king lucius who be say in the second century to have introduce christianity into britain the first christian church which he erect traditionally stand upon the site of the cathedral but alas lucius be a myth he cathedral a church never build with hand we know nothing of any christian church in roman winchester and though we may be sure that such a building certainly exist no excavation have so far lay bare its foundation indeed we be almost as ignorant of roman as we be of celtic winchester even the line of its wall be conjectural we suppose they to be the same as those of the middle age yet such foundation of roman building as have be discover lie not only within a area much more restricted than that which the mediaeval wall enclose but in certain instance outside they no discovery of roman foundation have be make to the north of the high street this fact however formidable though it be do not of itself prove that the roman wall do not coincide with the mediaeval fortification it be even probable that they do except at the south-west corner where stand the mediaeval castle in any case the roman wall build we may think in the fourth century enclose a irregular quadrilateral and possess four gate out of which issue those four road to old sarum to silchester to clausentum and to porchester in the beginning of the fifth century the roman administration which have long be fail to which one may think the building of those wall bear witness collapse altogether and with the final departure of the legion full of we youth and strength britain be leave defenceless what happen to winchester in the appalling confusion which follow we shall never know it be say that in 495 three generation that be to say after the departure of the legion for the defense of rome cerdic and he son cymric land upon the southern coast and presently seize winchester within whose broken wall they establish themselves in the year 519 accord to the saxon chronicle cerdic and cymric obtain the kingdom of the west saxon and the same year they fight against the briton where it be now name cerdicsford and from that time forth the royal offspring of the west saxon reign that be all we know about it and it be not enough upon which to build a historical narrative or from which to draw any clear idea even of what befall all we can say with any sort of certainty be that the saxon through long year of probably spasmodic fight very gradually establish themselves in southern england and out of it carve a dominion the kingdom of wessex whose capital be winchester until the year 635 this kingdom such as it be be pagan in that year st birinus convert the west saxon and they king kynegil to christianity though kynegil seem immediately to have begin to build a church in winchester in which he establish monk and endow it with the whole of the land for a space of seven mile round the city winchester do not become a episcopal see until the year 662 till then dorchester in the thame valley have be the seat of the bishop of wessex but in that year kynewalch the son and successor of kynegil complete the church of winchester in which he have be crown and he father bury as for the most part be they successor and there he establish a bishop it be now that winchester begin she great career she rise with the fortune of the wessex kingdom until in the time of egbert she appear as the capital of the new kingdom of england which be so name and for the first time in she witan the com kyng egbryth ant wyth batyle ant fyht make al englond yhol falle to y oune dol ant sethe he reignede she ahte ant tuentus folle yer : at wynchestre lyggeth y bon bury in a marble-ston egbert triumph and establish england none too soon as early as the year 787 accord to the saxon chronicle ship of the northman have reach we southern coast and egbert have scarcely name he new kingdom when they imperil it he son ethelwulf who come to he throne in 836 be to see winchester itself storm before the invader be beat off but beat off they be and it be in winchester that alfr be to reign to give forth he law and to plan he campaign against the same enemy he be victorious as we know and at ethandune not only break he pagan foe but drag guthrum they leader to baptism and in he capital he make and keep the only record we have of the dark age in england the saxon chronicle begin in wolvesey palace found the famous nunnery of st mary to the north-east of the cathedral in the mead and provide for the foundation by edward he son of the great new minster close by where he bone at last be to be lay the three great church with they attendant building must have be the noblest group to be see in the england of that day thus winchester flourish more than ever secure in its position as capital so that athelstan we read establish there six mint and edgar reign there make winchester measure the standard for the whole kingdom : and let one money pass throughout the king 's dominion and let no man refuse and let one measure and one weight pass such as be observe at london and winchester such be winchester at the beginning of the ninth century before the end of that century she be to suffer violence from the dane and in the first year of the tenth century to fall with the rest of england into they absolute power and to see a danish king canute crown in she cathedral there too at last that danish king be bury he be a generous conqueror and a great benefactor to he capital and with he pass much of the splendor of winchester edward the confessor though hallowed at winchester look upon london as he capital and there build the great abbey which be thenceforth to see the crowning of england 's king for st edward be at heart a norman and winchester beside sum up in itself all the splendor of pre-norman england have be give by ethelr to the widow of canute emma the mother of st edward she ally herself with the great earl godwin to oppose the norman influence which st edward have bring into england and it be only when she die that the king come again into winchester for easter and to hold a solemn court during that easter week earl godwin die and be bury in the cathedral he be the last champion of saxon england to lie there nothing mark the change that england have pass through during the first half of the eleventh century more certainly than the fact that william duke of normandy be crown king of england not in the old minster of winchester but in that of st peter westminster which pope nichola ii in king edward 's time have constitute as the place of the inauguration of the king of england it be true that william be later crown again in winchester as be stephen and coeur de lion but the fact remain that from the time of william the conqueror down to we own day as the papal bull have order westminster and not winchester have be the coronation church of we king this bull mark as it be the beginning of the decline of winchester little by little in the follow century it be to cease to be the capital of england little by little london be to take its place a thing finally achieve by edward i when he remove the royal residence from winchester norman winchester be however by no means less splendid than have be the old capital of the saxon king there domesday book be compile and there it be keep in the treasury of the norman king and the only name which it give itself be that of the book of winchester there the great fair of st gile be establish by the conqueror which attract merchant from every part of europe and there in 1079 bishop walkelin begin from the foundation a new cathedral church complete in 1093 of which the mighty transept still remain in 1109 the monk of new minster which have suffer greatly from fire and mismanagement remove to a great new house without the wall upon the north and since this new site be call hyde mead new minster be thenceforth know as the abbey of hyde and certainly after the fire in 1141 if not before the great benedictine nunnery of st mary be rebuild as for the castle of wolvesey bishop henry of bloi rebuild it in 1138 it be indeed in he time that winchester suffer the most disastrous of all its siege as we may believe and this at the hand of the empress matilda in 1141 the greater part of the city be then say to have be destroy the new abbey of hyde be burn down not to be rebuild till 1182 the old nunnery of st mary be destroy also by fire and we be tell of more than forty church which then perish combustible be hurl from the bishop 's castle william of malmesbury tell we in the house of the townspeople who as i have say rather wish success to the empress than to the bishop which catch and burn the whole abbey of nun within the city and the monastery which be call hyde without the wall here be a image of we lord crucify work with a profusion of gold and silver and precious stone through the pious solicitude of canute who be formerly king and present it this be seize by the flame and throw to the ground be afterwards strip of its ornament at the command of the legate himself more than five hundred mark of silver and thirty of gold which be find in it serve for a largess to the soldier it would perhaps be untrue to say that winchester never really recover from the appalling sack and pillage which follow the flight of matilda but it be true to assert that time be fight against she and that the thirteenth century do not bring the splendid gift to she that it bring to so many of we city one great ceremony the last of its kind however take place in she cathedral in 1194 the second coronation of coeur de lion then king richard we read be clothe in he royal robe with the crown upon he head hold in he right hand a royal sceptre which terminate in a cross and in he left hand a golden wand with the figure of a dive at the top of it come forth from he apartment in the priory be conduct on the right hand by the bishop of ely he chancellor and on the leave by the bishop of london the silken canopy be hold on four lance over the king by four earl the king be thus conduct into the cathedral and up to the high altar there fall upon he knee and devoutly receive the archbishop 's solemn benediction he be then lead to the throne which be prepare for he on the south side of the choir when mass be finish the king be lead back to he apartment with the solemnity aforesaid he then lay aside he robe and crown put on other robe and a crown that be much lighter and so proceed to dinner which be serve in the monk ' refectory winchester 's next glory be the birth of henry iii know to the day of he death as henry of winchester -- this in 1207 in 1213 the city be the scene of the reconciliation of king john and archbishop stephen but in 1265 she be sack by the younger de montfort and this seem finally to have achieve she overthrow when edward i come to the throne in 1272 he abandon winchester the city never regain its place london be too strong for it both geographically and economically its trade which remain very considerable until the latter part of the fourteenth century chiefly owe to its wool and cloth be however slowly decline and politically the history of the city become a mere series of incident among the more splendid of which be the marriage of henry iv with joan of navarre in 1403 the reception of the french ambassador by henry v before agincourt in 1415 the rejoicing for the birth in winchester of arthur tudor the son of henry vii and elizabeth of york in 1457 the meeting of the emperor charle v and henry viii in 1522 and the marriage of mary tudor to philip of spain in 1554 at that great ceremony the last catholic rite the old cathedral be to witness there be present accord to the venetian envoy the ambassador from the emperor from the king of the roman and bohemia from you serenity from savoy florence and ferrara and many agent of sovereign prince the proclamation be entitle thus : philip and mary by the grace of god king and queen of england france naple jerusalem ireland defender of the faith prince of spain archduke of austrium etc but when queen elizabeth visit the city in 1560 -lrb- she be there four time during she reign -rrb- she say to the mayor yours mr mayor be a very ancient city and he answer it have abeen you majesty it have abeen and in spite of bad grammar he speak but the truth winchester 's great day be over yet it see the trial of sir walter raleigh in 1603 and the town have be take by waller in 1644 the castle be besiege by cromwell himself in 1645 i come to winchester he write on the lord 's day the 28th of September after some dispute with the governor we enter the town i summon the castle be deny whereupon we fall to prepare battery which we could not perfect until Friday follow we battery be six gun which be finish after firing one round i send in a second summons for a treaty which they refuse whereupon we go on with we work and make a breach in the wall near the black tower which after about two hundred shot we think stormable and purpose on Monday morning to attempt it on Sunday morning about ten of the clock the governor beat a parley desire to treat i agree unto it and send colonel hammond and major harrison in to he who agree upon these enclosed article cromwell presently depart and the city catch a glimpse of the royal martyr the victim of the great family as he pass from hurst castle to windsor and the scaffold in whitehall with the restoration which be most gallantly welcome in the old royal city charle ii come to winchester and have be burn out at newmarket be accord to evelyn all the more earnest to render winchester the seat of he autumnal diversion for the future design a palace there where the ancient castle stand the surveyor have already begin the foundation for a palace estimate to cost # 35000 but charle die too soon to finish this new house which it be say queen anne wish to complete liking winton well but again death intervene in spite of these royal fancy however winchester which have suffer badly in the plague of 1667 continue to decline in importance and in population and to depend more and more upon the two great establishment which remain to it the cathedral found by kynegil in 635 and re-establish under a new protestant administration in the sixteenth century and the college of st mary of winchester found by william of wykeham in connection with the college of st mary winton in oxford call new college for the education of youth and the advancement of learn winchester be of course as it ever have be the county-town of hampshire but it still maintain itself as it have do now these many year chiefly by reason of these two great establishment certainly to-day the traveller 's earliest step be turn towards these two building and first to that which be in its foundation near eight hundred year the older -- the cathedral church once of st swithin the bishop and confessor -lrb- 852-863 -rrb- and now since the reformation of the holy trinity to come out of the sloping high street past the ancient city cross through the narrow passage-way into the precinct and to pass down that great avenue of secular lime across the close to the great porch of the cathedral be to come by a incomparable approach to perhaps the most noble and most venerable church leave to we in england the most venerable -- not i think the most beautiful no one remember the abbey of westminster can claim that for it and then though it possess the noblest norman work in england and the utmost splendor of the perpendicular it lack almost entirely and certainly the best of the early english its wonder lie in its size and its antiquity it be now the longest mediaeval church not only in england but in europe though once it be surpass by old st paul 's it be five hundred and twenty - six foot long but it lack height and perhaps rightly at least i would not have it other than it be its greatness lie in its monotonous depressed length and weight a enormous primeval thing lie there in the mead beside the river winchester itself might seem indeed to know nothing of it the city do not rejoice in it as do lincoln and york in they great church here be nothing of the sheer joy of salisbury a magnificat by palestrina the church of winchester be without delight it have supremely the mystery and monotony of the plainsong the true chant of the monk the chorus of a army with all the appeal of just that its immense age and half plaintive glory which yet never really become music and winchester too have all and more than all the surprise of the plainsong the better you know it the more you be impressed no one certainly have ever come by the narrow way out of the high street down the avenue of lime to the west front without be disappointed but no one thus disappointed have ever enter into the church without astonishment wonder and complete satisfaction it be not always so that long nave be once forty foot longer and be flank upon either side by a norman tower as at ely must one regret they loss no the astonishment of the nave within make up for everything there be no grander interior in the world nor anywhere anything at all like it up that vast perpendicular nave one look far and far away into the height majesty and dominion of the glorious norman transept and beyond into the light of the sanctuary it have not the beauty of westminster abbey nor the exquisite charm of well but it have a majesty and venerable nobility all its own that i think no other church in england can match of the old saxon church so far as we really know the only predecessor of the present church nothing really remain this as i have say have be found by king kynegil upon he conversion by st birinus in 635 we know very little about it except that it be enlarged or rebuilt in the middle of the tenth century by st aethwold and if we may believe the poetical description of wolstan we shall be incline to believe the church be enlarged for it appear to have be a very complex building with a lofty central tower have a spire and weathercock in accordance with the bull of pope urban and a crypt both the work of st elphege this church which like its successor until the reformation be serve by monk stand till the year 1093 when it be destroy as useless for the new norman church of bishop walkelin begin in 1079 be then far enough advance to be use it be thus practically certain that the two church do not stand on the same site the newer it would seem rise to the south of the older building but the sacred spot which it would seem every church that may ever have stand in this place must have cover be the holy well immediately beneath the present high altar in the crypt of the norman building this surely be within the saxon building as it must have be within any church that may have stand here in roman time the two great shrine of the saxon church be however those of st birinus the apostle of wessex and of st swithin bishop of winchester in the ninth century the day of whose translation July 15th be till the reformation a universal festival throughout england in he honor the saxon church till then know as the church of ss peter and paul be rededicate in 964 the great norman church which bishop walkelin build to take the place of the saxon minster can not fundamentally have differ very much from the church we see at any rate so far as its nave and transept be concern the eastern arm be however different it consist of four bay with north and south aisle at the end of which be rectangular chapel a apse about which the aisle run as a ambulatory and beyond the apse a eastern apsidal chapel of this church all that really remain to we be the crypt and the transept in the crypt we divine the old eastern limb of the church and be doubtless in the presence of the earliest work in the cathedral it be however in the double aisled transept that we can best appreciate how very glorious that first norman church must have be there be nothing in england more wonderful and so far as i know there be nothing in europe quite to put beside they if only the whole mighty church could have remain to we the first disaster that befall bishop walkelin 's building be the fall of the central tower in 1107 which all england at the time attribute to the burial beneath it of william rufus the tower be rebuild though not to its original height but in the reconstruction the part of the transept nearest to the tower be also rebuild and thus we have here two period of norman work the main building of 1107 and the reconstruction after that date of the transitional work of the second half of the twelfth century very little be to be see at winchester it be for the most part the period of that great bishop henry of bloi and he be probably too much immerse in the brutal politics of he time too busy building and hold he castle to give much thought to the cathedral the font however date from he time and perhaps a door in the north-western bay of the south transept the earliest gothic work in the cathedral be the chapel of st sepulchre which be build upon the northern wall of the choir before the north transept there we may still see wall painting of the passion of we lord not much later be the retro-choir this consist of three bay and be the largest in england it be begin in 1189 by bishop godfrey de lucy and we must admit at once that it be wholly without delight and yet to build it the norman apse be sacrifice accord to mr bond this be probably a very popular destruction the reversion say he to the favorite square east end of english church architecture be popular in itself almost every norman cathedral end in a apse and in the apse high raise behind the high altar sit the norman bishop face the congregation the hateful symbol of norman domination this may have be so but consider that the monastic choir of winchester occupy not one as the choir do to-day but three bay of the nave from which it be separate by a vast rood screen though the bishop have be as high as haman he would have be scarcely visible to the populace in the western part of the nave popular or no however the apse be sacrifice and the low retro-choir build with the lady chapel in the early english style the next thing undertake be to place in the old norman choir the magically lovely choir stall -lrb- 1245-1315 -rrb- which happily still remain to we perhaps it be they enthusiastic loveliness which lead about 1320 to the rebuilding of the presbytery and the lovely tabernacle in the back of the wall of the feretory when all this be do there remain of the old norman church only the transept and the nave the transept remain to we still but the nave be transform in the very beginning of the perpendicular time it be transform not rebuild bishop william of wykeham have obliterate bishop walkelin but fundamentally the nave of winchester remain norman still the perpendicular work be only a lovely mask or rather just the sunlight of the fourteenth century which have come into the dark old norman build the most notable change be the roof in norman time a flat ceiling now a magnificent vault but that century be not content with transform the nave it litter it with the first of its various delight those chantry which be among the greatest splendor of this cathedral and which still in some sort commemorate bishop edingdon -lrb- 1366 -rrb- bishop wykeham -lrb- 1404 -rrb- bishop beaufort -lrb- 1447 -rrb- bishop waynflete -lrb- 1416 -rrb- bishop fox -lrb- 1528 -rrb- and bishop gardiner -lrb- 1555 -rrb- the last catholic bishop to fill the see -lrb- illustration : north transept winchester cathedral -rrb- the transformation of the nave which occupy full a hundred year be not however the last work undertake in the cathedral before the change of religion bishop courtenay in the last year of the fifteenth century lengthen the lady chapel and finally bishop fox in the very beginning of the sixteenth century begin the transformation of the early fourteenth century presbytery but get little further than the insertion of the perpendicular window he do however transform the norman aisle there and screen they and upon the screen in six fine renaissance chest he gather the dust of the old saxon saint and king but apart from its architecture the church be full of interest where can we find anything to match the exquisite iron screen of the eleventh century which use to guard st swithin 's shrine but which now that be go cover the north-west doorway of the nave be there another font in england more wonderful than that square black marble basin sculpture in the twelfth century with the story of st nichola be there any series of chantry in england more complete or more lovely than these at winchester or anywhere a finer fourteenth century monument than that of bishop wykeham nowhere in england certainly can the glorious choir stall be match nor shall we easily find a pulpit to surpass that in the choir here date from 1520 if the restore retablo over the high altar be disappointing in its sophistication we have only to pass into the feretory to discover certain marvellous fragment of the original reredos which be so beautiful that they take away we breath -- that broken statue of the madonna and child for instance perhaps the loveliest piece of fourteenth century sculpture to be find in england no however we consider the great church of winchester it stand alone as a mere building it be more tremendous and more venerable than anything now leave to we upon english soil as a burial place it possess the dust not only of the apostle of the heart of england but of the greatest of the saxon king while beneath its mighty vault william rufus sleep the only norman king that lie in england and as a shrine of art it still possess incomparable thing it stand there as the pyramid stand in the desert a relic of a lose civilisation but by it we may measure the modern world it be too when you consider it utterly lonely the revolution we call the reformation upon which the modern world turn and turn as upon a pivot while it spare winchester cathedral though reluctantly sweep away all the building which surround it the great monastery be go scarcely a sign of it remain nothing at all be leave of the famous nunnery of st mary of wolvesey castle there be a few beautiful ruin of hyde abbey all have be sweep away even the stone even the bone of alfr nor have the other and later religious house with which winchester be full fare better it be difficult to find even the site of the house of the franciscan the dominican the austin friar the carmelite and what remain of the college of st elizabeth and but for a norman doorway now in catholic hand of the hospital of st mary magdalen only the hospital of st john remain at the east end of the high street still in possession of its fine hall and chapel and the great school found by william of wykeham in 1382 for seventy poor and needy scholar and clerk live college-wise in the same study and become proficient in grammatical or the art and science of grammar it remain without compare the oldest and the greatest school in england whose daughter be eton and whose late descendant be harrow to say that the cathedral the college and the hospital of st john be all that remain of mediaeval winchester would not perhaps be strictly true but it be so near the truth that one might say it without fear of contradiction most of the old church even have perish there remain st john baptist which can boast of transitional arcade and fifteenth century screen and pulpit st maurice with a norman doorway st peter with its twelfth and thirteenth century work st bartholomew with some norman remain near the site of hyde abbey and in the high street there be more than one fine old house the fact that so little remains can not altogether be place to the discredit of the reformation and the puritan fanatic until the eighteenth century something remain of hyde abbey much of the hospital of st mary magdalen the city wall be then practically perfect have all they five gate north south east and west and king 's gate now of all these only the westgate of the thirteenth century remain to we with the king 's gate over which be the little church of st swithin but in spite of vandalism forgetfulness and barbarism often of the worst description as in the mere indifference and ignorance that scatter alfred 's bone no one have ever come to winchester without love it no one have ever be glad to get away its innumerable visitor be all its lover and the most opposite temperament find here common ground at last walpole praise it and so do keat we remove here write the latter in 1819 to bailey for the convenience of a library and find it a exceedingly pleasant town enrich with a beautiful cathedral and surround by fresh-looking country within these two month i have write fifteen hundred line most of which besides many more of prior composition you will probably see next winter i have write two tale one from boccaccio call the ` pot of basil ' and another call ` st agne eve ' on a popular superstition and a third call ` lamium ' -lrb- half-finished -rrb- i have also be write part of my ` hyperion ' and complete four act of a tragedy this winchester he write again be a place tolerably well suit to I there be a fine cathedral a college a roman catholic chapel and there be not one loom or anything like manufacture beyond bread and butter in the whole city there be a number of rich catholic in the place it be a respectable ancient aristocratic place and moreover it contain a nunnery i take a walk he write to he family every day for a hour before dinner and this be generally my walk i go out the back gate across one street into the cathedral yard which be always interesting there i pass under the tree along a paved path pass the beautiful front of the cathedral turn to the leave under a stone doorway -- then i be on the other side of the building -- which leave behind I i pass on through two college - like square seemingly build for the dwelling-place of dean and prebendary garnish with grass and shaded with tree then i pass through one of the old city gate and then you be in college street through which i pass and at the end thereof cross some meadow and at last a country of alley garden i arrive that be my worship arrive at the foundation of st cross which be a very interesting old place then i pass across st cross meadow till i come to the most beautiful clear river that walk or rather that over the mead to st cross be for every lover of winchester that which he take most often i think that which come to he first in every memory of the city its beauty make it sacred and its reward be a hour or more in what when all be say be one of the loveliest relic of the middle age anywhere leave to we in england i mean the hospital and church of st cross in the mead of the itchen doubtless we be the heir of the age into we heart and mind the empire the middle age and the renaissance have pour they riches doubtless we be the flower of time and we age the rose of all the age that be why in we wisdom we have supersede such place as st cross by we modern workhouse st cross be found by the great henry of bloi in 1133 for the reception the clothing and the entertainment of thirteen poor man decay or past they strength and the relief of a hundred other it be a mediaeval workhouse call a hospital in those day and in its beauty and its humanity and its success it can not of course compare with the institution which since we have not be able to abolish poverty altogether we have everywhere establish for the reception of we unfortunate brethren it would be odd indeed if eight hundred year of christian government four hundred of they enjoy the infinite blessing bestow by the reformation and the protestant religion have not vastly improve these institution for the reception of the very poor it be in fact in such establishment as we workhouse that we progress be to be see most clearly -lrb- illustration : st cross winchester -rrb- well it be something to be assure of that and yet let I confess it st cross have a curious fascination for I i feel there it be true that i be in a world different from that in which we do so well to rejoice but such be my perversity i can not help prefer the old to the new this be a mere prejudice quite personal to myself and come perhaps of be a christian when i look at st cross i be vividly remind that this be once a christian country with a christian civilisation when i look at one of we great workhouse i know that all that have pass away and that we have progress so fast and so far that christianity have be leave some four hundred year behind we st cross be as it be a rock of the old christian time still emerge from the gray sea of the modern world bishop henry de blois intend as i have say to provide by the foundation of the hospital of st cross for the maintenance of thirteen poor man and the relief of a hundred other he design be pervert in the thirteenth century but gloriously restore by the founder of winchester college and he successor in the bishopric cardinal beaufort who add to the original foundation the almshouse of noble poverty in which he hope to support thirty-five brethren with two priest and three nun to minister to the inmate the hospital by the merest good fortune escape suppression at the reformation but during most of the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth century and through many year of the nineteenth its revenue be enjoy by man who as often as not have never see the place and so the poor be rob perhaps the most insolent abuse of the kind occur between 1808 and 1815 in the former year bishop brownlow north of winchester appoint he son franci later earl of guildford to be master this man appropriate the revenue of the place to the tune of fourteen hundred pound a year and when at last the scandal be expose it be discover that between 1818 and 1838 he have take not less than fifty-three thousand pound in fine on renew lease a manifest and probably wilful breach of trust that ought one may think to have bring he to the old bailey the exposure of this rascal lead to a reformation of the administration which be now in the hand of trustee who elect thirteen brethren provide for by bishop henry of blois these wear a black gown with a silver cross st cross also still maintain certain brethren of noble poverty and these wear a red gown and not less than fifty poor folk who do not live within its wall while a very meager wayfarer 's dole be still distribute to all who pass by so far as a horn of beer and two loaf of bread will go each of the brethren of st cross beside a little house and maintenance receive five shilling a week all this sound if you be poor too good to be true it be too good to owe its origin to the modern world but not extraordinary for the middle age which be eagerly and even violently christian and just as the institution seem in itself wonderful to we in we day so do the building which if one would really understand how gloriously strange they be should be carefully compare with the county workhouse one enter the hospital by a gate and pass through a small court come to the great gatehouse of cardinal beaufort consist of gateway porter 's lodge and great square tower here and there we still see cardinal beaufort 's arm and device while over the gate itself be three niche in one of which a kneel figure of the cardinal remain within this gatehouse be a large quadrangle about three side of which the hospital be set with the church upon the south between which and the gatehouse run a sixteenth century cloister the whole be wonderfully quiet and peaceful a corner of that old england england of my heart which be so fast vanish away the noblest building of this most noble place and the only one now leave to we which date from its foundation by bishop henry of bloi be the church this be a great transitional building one of the finest example of that style in england and date from about 1160 to 1292 it be a cruciform building with central tower the nave and chancel be aisle the transept aisle and all vault in stone in the fourteenth century the earliest part of the church be the chancel which have a square eastern end and the lower part of the transept probably date from the same time these transept be finish a little later when the nave be begin and finish and the north porch build in the thirteenth century the clerestory of the nave date from the first half of the fourteenth century and so do the great western window much of the furniture of the church be interesting such as the fourteenth century tile the curious norman bowl that do duty as a font the fourteenth century glass in the clerestory window of the nave and that little though it be of the fifteenth century in the north transept the fine fifteenth century screen between the north - choir aisle and the chancel the foreign sixteenth century woodwork in the south-choir aisle the curious wall painting of the martyrdom of st thoma in the south transept and the old purbeck altar stone that now serve as the communion table here before the altar lie john de campeden appoint master of st cross by bishop william of wykeham in 1383 he grave mark by a good brass much too within the hospital be interesting and the old man who eagerly show one all these strange and beautiful thing be most human and delightful nevertheless though the church would anywhere else claim all we attention for a whole morning and a afternoon be easily spend poke about the hospital it be not of the mere architecture beautiful though it be that one think on the way back into winchester across the mead beside the river which have see and know both the middle age and this sorrowful time of to-day but of that wondrous institution where poverty be consider honorable and destitution not a offence or even perhaps a misfortune where it be still remember that we be all brethren and that christ too have not where to lay he head all of which seem nothing less than marvellous to-day chapter xxi selborne i set out from winchester early one June morning by jewry street as it be out of the old north gate to follow perhaps the oldest road in old england towards alton intend to reach selborne more than twenty mile away eastward on the tumble of hill where the north downs meet the south before night i say the road by which i go out of winchester and follow for so many mile through king 's worthy and martyr worthy itchen abba new alresford and bishop sutton be perhaps the oldest in england in fact it be the old british trackway from the port of the straight and canterbury to winchester and old sarum the western end indeed of the way i have already follow from canterbury to boughton aluph up the valley of the great stour know to we all as the pilgrim 's way for though it be older than any written history it be preserve from neglect and death when the twelfth and thirteenth century be make all new here as elsewhere by the pilgrim who come from western england from brittany and spain to visit st thoma ' shrine use it as they road across southern england from winchester to canterbury now though for any man who follow that road to-day it be fill with these great company of pilgrim there be older memory too which it evoke and which if the history of england be precious to he he can not ignore to begin with the exit from winchester : there in jewry street a roman road overlie the older british way not indeed exactly but roughly certainly as far as king 's worthy whence it still shoot forth straight as a arrow 's flight over hill over dale to silchester the very street by which he leave the city as it be by the now destroy north gate be roman one of the four road which meet in the forum of venta belgarum and divide roman winchester into four quarter though perhaps because of the marsh of the itchen not into four equal part as in chichester the present name of this road jewry street indicate its character all through the middle age when here by the north gate upon the road to london the jew have they booth and the quarter of winchester which this road serve be doubtless they ghetto the richest quarter of the city it be not however of the middle age but of the dark age i think as i issue out of winchester where not much more than a hundred year ago the old north gate still hold the way in the year 1001 after the battle of alton in which the man of hampshire be utterly break by sweyn and he dane this road be fill with the route saxon in flight pour into the city of winchester the record of that appalling business be very brief in the anglo-saxon chronicle a few line under the date 1001 a 1001 in this year be much fighting in the land of the english and well nigh everywhere they -lrb- the dane -rrb- ravage and burn so that they advance on one course until they come to the town of alton and then there come against they the man of hampshire and fight against they and there be ethelward the king 's high-steward slay and leofric at whitchurch and leofwin the king 's high-steward and wulfhere the bishop 's thane and godwin at worthy bishop elfry 's son and of all man one hundred and eighty and there be of the danish man many more slay though they have possession of the place of slaughter a mere plunder expedition we may think but it foretell with certainty the rule of the dane in england which as we know come to pass and be not the catastrophe it might have be because of the victory of alfr at ethandune a century and a half before when he have make guthrum and he host christian till the year 1788 alfred 's bone lay beside this very gate through which the beaten saxon pour into he city in 1001 for though hyde abbey be destroy at the reformation he bone seem to have be forget to be discover in the end of the eighteenth century in they great leaden coffin and sell i know not to whom for the sum of two pound i consider these unfortunate and shameful thing as i go on along this british roman saxon and english way the way of army and of pilgrim into headbourne worthy whose church stand by the roadside on the north this little church dedicate in honor of st swithin be all of a piece with the road and illustrate it very well its beauty alone would recommend it to the wayfarer but it also possess a antiquity so great that nothing leave to we in winchester itself can match it for in plan and largely in masonry too it be a saxon sanctuary though a late one date as it would seem from the early part of the eleventh century what we see be a beautiful little building consist of nave with curious western chamber chancel south-western tower and modern south porch the original church probably do not differ very much in plan from that we have but only the north and west wall of the nave of the original building remain to we the latter have the original doorway of binstead stone the south wall of the nave and the tower be rebuild in the thirteenth century as be the chancel which be now a modern building so far as its north and eastern wall be concern in the late fifteenth century the western chamber be add to the nave as in we own day the south porch the best treasure of the church be however the great spoilt rood with figure of we lady and st john upon the outside of the west wall of the saxon nave to preserve which in the fifteenth century the western chamber be build the western chamber be originally in two stage the lower acting as a porch to the church the upper as a chapel with a altar under the saxon rood it be needless to say that the reformer bishop horne of winchester it be say the accursed miscreant who order the destruction of all crucifix in he diocese deface this glorious work of art and religion cut the relief away to the face of the wall so that only the outline remain nevertheless it be still one of the most impose and notable thing leave to we in southern england headbourne worthy grant to mortimer after the conquest be the most important of the three little place group here in a bunch which bear that name king 's worthy where the road first turn eastward and where the church curiously enough stand to the south of the way -lrb- footnote : accord to mr belloc -lrb- _ the old road _ -rrb- this modern road do not exactly represent the route of the pilgrim 's way which run to the south of king 's worthy church -rrb- be but a hamlet and of martyr worthy domesday know nothing little that be notable remain to we in either place only the charming fifteenth century tower of king 's worthy church and a fourteenth century font therein much the same must be say of itchen abba itchen a bas where the road fall to the river the small norman church there have be both rebuilt and enlarged in or about 1863 while a even worse fate have befall the church of itchen stoke two mile further on for it have disappear altogether nor i fear can much be say for the church of new alresford or the town either for apparently owe to a series of fire it have nothing to show we but a seventeenth century tower a poor example of the building of that time the base of which may be saxon while the window seem to be of the thirteenth century new alresford would seem only to have come into existence as a town in the end of the twelfth century when it be re-establish by bishop godfrey de lucy -lrb- 1189-1204 -rrb- the old road do not pass through it as the modern road do for as mr belloc seem to have prove the pilgrim 's way which descend to the river at itchen a ba as we have see cross the ford at itchen stoke itchen stake that be and proceed east by south where the workhouse now stand come into the modern road again at bishop sutton but though the pilgrim 's way know it not new alresford be of high antiquity local tradition have it that it owe its existence as distinct from old alresford to a defeat inflict by the saxon on a party of dane near the village of west tist about five mile -lrb- south -rrb- east of alresford the saxon grant quarter to the defeat enemy on condition that they go to the ford over the river alre -lrb- footnote : it be curious that guthrum be baptise at aller and then he dane in the alre -rrb- to be baptise in commemoration of the victory a statue of the virgin be then erect in the churchyard of old alresford -lrb- footnote : vch hampshire vol 3 p 350 -rrb- local tradition can not at any time be put lightly aside and when as here it preserve for we one of the great truth of the early history of modern europe we should rejoice indeed for here we have the obvious reality of the eighth century when europe slowly recover itself and begin to realize itself as christendom be everywhere attack by horde of pagan the work of charlemagne of offa and of alfr be not merely the conquest of the barbarian but really since they could not be wholly destroy they conversion and thus alone could christendom be certainly preserve so after ethandune guthrum must be christen at aller and after the fight here on the alre the defeat heathen must be christen at the ford since new alresford have preserve for we a memory of this fundamental act we can easily forgive she lack of material antiquity the little village thus found certainly still exist in the time of the conquest and such it would always have remain but for godfrey de lucy bishop of winchester who among he many achievement number this chiefly that he make the itchen navigable not only from southampton to winchester but here also in its headwater and this by means of the great reservoir know as alresford pond into which he gather the water of many stream to supply he navigation in return king john not only give he the royalty of the river but a weekly market here for which he rebuild the place and call it new market a name which be soon lose the people prefer they old name new alresford so the market town of new alresford come into existence and but for the unfortunate fire of the seventeenth and eighteenth century would bear upon its face the mark it now lack of antiquity bishop godfrey de lucy be constantly in residence at bishop sutton in the palace there the road pass through this delightful village a mile or more to the east of new alresford and something remain the ruin of the kennel it be say of the palace this be doubtless the manour-house a verie olde house somtyme wall round aboutte with stone now decai well waterid with a olde ponde or moote adjoyning to it of which we hear in the time of edward vi it seem to have be destroy in the civil war but even in 1839 much remain of it within the memory of many person now live write mr duthy in 1839 considerable vestige of a strong and extensive building stand in the meadow to the north of the church which be the dilapidated remains of a ancient palace of the bishop of winchester the wall be of great thickness and compose of flint and mortar but it be impossible to trace the disposition of the apartment or the form of the edifice bishop sutton have belong to the church of winchester since king ine 's day but in the early part of the eleventh century it be hold by harold and after the conquest by eustace of boulogne bishop henry de blois regain it for the church by exchange in whose possession it have remain but for a few brief interval in the sixteenth and seventeenth century in one of which john evelyn buy it until to-day it be probably to this fact we owe the beauty and preservation of the church here with its fine twelfth century nave not fundamentally altered and its chancel still largely of the thirteenth century especially notable be the two norman doorway in the nave and curious support of the belfry there four naked and massive post -lrb- illustration : selborne from the hanger -rrb- bishop sutton be the last place i be to see upon the old road for a mile beyond that village i leave it where it turn northward to go east into ripley and so by the byway to climb into the hill and cross they to descend steeply at evening into the village of selborne by the oakhanger stream just before it enter that narrow brief pass into the weald there in the twilight i stay for awhile under the yew tree in the churchyard to think of the writer for love of whom i have make this journey all the way from winchester in the churchyard of this village write gilbert white in the antiquity of selborne be a yew-tree whose aspect bespeak it to be of great age it seem to have see several century and be probably co-eval with the church and therefore may be deem a antiquity the body be squat short and thick and measure twenty-three foot in the girth support a head of suitable extent to its bulk this be a male tree which in the spring shed cloud of dust and fill the atmosphere around with its farina antiquary seem much at a loss to determine at what period this tree first obtain a place in churchyard a statute be pass ad 1307 and 35 edward i the title of which be ne rector arbore in cemeterio prosternat now if it be recollect that we seldom see any other very large or ancient tree in a churchyard but yew this statute must have principally related to this species of tree and consequently they be plant in churchyard be of much more ancient date than the year 1307 as to the use of these tree possibly the more respectable parishioner be bury under they shade before the improper custom be introduce of bury within the body of the church where the living be to assemble deborah rebekah 's nurse be bury under a oak -- the most honorable place of interment -- probably next to the cave of machpelah which seem to have be appropriate to the remains of the patriarchal family alone the further use of yew tree might be as a screen to church by they thick foliage from the violence of wind perhaps also for the purpose of archery the best long bow be make of that material and we do not hear that they be plant in the churchyard of other part of europe where long bow be not so much in use they might also be place as a shelter to the congregation assemble before the church door be open and as a emblem of mortality by they funeral appearance in the south of england every churchyard almost have its tree and some two but in the north we understand few be to be find even in that passage full as it be of all the quietness of the english countryside something of the secret of gilbert white he ever live incommunicable charm may be find : he extraordinary and gentle gift of become as it be one with the thing of which he write he wonderfully sympathetic approach to we he so simple and so consummate manner the man might stand in he writings for the countryside of england incarnate and articulate he not only lead you ever out of door but he be just that the very spirit of the open air the out - of-door of a country where alone in europe one can be in the lane in the meadow on the hill under the low soft sky with delight every day of the year he teach as nature herself teach we seem to move in he book as though they be the field and the wood and there the flower blow and the bird sing it be not so much that he observation be extraordinarily wide and accurate but that we see with he eye hear with he ear and the phenomenon beautiful or wonderful which he describe we experience too and because of he with something of he love he interest and carefulness what other book ever write upon natural history can we read who be not naturalist over and over and over again and for its own sake not for the myriad fact he gather through a long lifetime the acute observation and record of which have win he the homage of he fellow scientist but for the pure human and literary pleasure we find there a pleasure the like of which be to be find nowhere else in such book in the same satisfying quantity and at all only because of he and so on the next morning the first place i go to see be the wake the house where this great and dear lover of england of my heart live die there in 1793 to lie in he own churchyard he grave mark by a simple headstone bear he initial gw and the date in the church be a tablet to he and he brother benjamin who have also place there in memory of he the seventeenth century german triptych over the altar but he need no memorial from we hand all he love selborne itself in all its beauty the exquisite country round it the hill the valley the wood and the stream be he monument the very bird in they song remind we of he and there be not a walk that be not the lovelier because he have pass by do you climb up through the hanger and admire the beech there it be he who have tell we what to expect love the beech like a father the most lovely of all forest tree whether we consider its smooth rind or bark its glossy foliage or graceful pendulous bough do you linger in the plestor it be he who tell you of the old oak that stand there and be blow down in 1703 to the infinite regret of the inhabitant and the vicar who bestow several pound in set it in its place again but all this care could not avail the tree sprout for a time then wither and die or who can pass by long lythe without remember that it be a favorite with he too for he love this place so well that as jacob wait for rachel so he for selborne he have be bear there where he grandfather be then vicar aged seventy-two year and eleven month he be to die in 1720 he go to school at farnham and basingstoke and then in 1739 to oriel college oxford where in 1744 he be elect to a fellowship presently benefice after benefice be offer he but he refuse they all have make up he mind to live and die at selborne selborne must then have be a very secluded place the nearest town alton often inaccessible in winter one may think judge from the description gilbert white give of the rocky hollow lane that lead thither but it be perhaps to this very fact that we owe more than a few of those immortal page ever live and ever new since he be cut off from man he be able to give himself wholly to nature he be less a part of the mere england of he day than any man of that time he belong only to england of my heart yet the event of he time though they touch he so little be neither few nor unimportant the year of he birth be the year of the south sea bubble when he be a year old the great duke of marlborough die he eighth birthday fall in the year which close the eye of sir isaac newton he be twenty-five in the forty-five when prince charle edward hold edinburgh after preston pan he see the change in the calendar the conquest of indium by clive the victory and death of wolfe at quebec the annexation of canada the death of chatham the loss of the american colony the french revolution and how little all this mean to he but anything connect with selborne interested he and he write of and study its antiquity as well as its natural history nor be these antiquity so negligible as one might think in he day the church be still a interesting building and he have leave we a interesting account of it but he do not forget to tell we too of the augustinian priory of selborne that be found in 1233 and stand to the east of the village the way to it lie through he beloved long lythe and the site of which be now occupy by priory farm a few ruin remain nothing indeed that concerned he beloved village be to he ungrateful it be without doubt this careful love of he for the thing that be he own at he door common thing if you will common only in england of my heart that have endear he to innumerable reader many of whom have never set foot upon we shore and would only not be utter stranger here if they do because of he such at least be the only explanation i can give of he immortality he constant appeal to all sort and condition of man day by day as i wandered through the lane and the wood that he have love with so wonderful and unconscious a affection in a repose that we have lose and a quietness we can only envy he i try to discover i try to make clear to myself what it really be that on a dull evening at home in a sleepless night in london or in the long winter evening anywhere draw I back again and again to that curious book but even there in selborne the secret be hide from I in truth one might as well inquire of the bird why they delight we or of the flower why we love they so for in some way i can not understand gilbert white be gently at one with these and speak of they sweetly like a lover and a friend have a gift from god by which he make we partaker of he pleasure and so spring draw to a close as i lingered in selborne for i could not drag myself away and when at last i determine to set out the feast of st john be already at hand so that i make haste once more across the hill for winchester on my way to old sarum and stonehenge where i would see the sunrise on midsummer morning end of project gutenberg 's england of my heart -- spring by edward hutton
