the great and tragic history of europe there be a turning-point that mark the defeat of the ideal of a world-order and the definite acceptance of international anarchy that turning-point be the emergence of the sovereign state at the end of the fifteenth century and it be symbolical of all that be to follow that at that point stand look down the vista of the century the brilliant and sinister figure of machiavellus from that date onward international policy have mean machiavellianism sometimes the master of the craft like catherine de medicus or napoleon have avow it sometimes like frederick the great they have disclaim it but always they have practice it they could not indeed practice anything else for it be as true of a aggregation of state as of a aggregation of individual that whatever moral sentiment may prevail if there be no common law and no common force the best intention will be defeat by lack of confidence and security mutual fear and mutual suspicion aggression masquerade as defense and defense masquerade as aggression will be the protagonist in the bloody drama and there will be what hobbe truly assert to be the essence of such a situation a chronic state of war open or veil for peace itself will be a latent war and the more the state arm to prevent a conflict the more certainly will it be provoke since to one or another it will always seem a better chance to have it now than to have it on worse condition later some one state at any moment may be the immediate offender but the main and permanent offence be common to all state it be the anarchy which they be all responsible for perpetuate while this anarchy continue the struggle between state will tend to assume a certain stereotyped form one will endeavor to acquire supremacy over the other for motive at once of security and of domination the other will combine to defeat it and history will turn upon the two pole of empire and the balance of power so it have be in europe and so it will continue to be until either empire be achieve as once it be achieve by rome or a common law and a common authority be establish by agreement in the past empire over europe have be seek by spain by austrium and by france and soldier politician and professor in germany have seek and seek to secure it now for germany on the other hand great britain have long stand as she stand now for the balance of power as ambitious as quarrelsome and as aggressive as other state she geographical position have direct she aim overseas rather than toward the continent of europe since the fifteenth century she power have never menace the continent on the contrary she own interest have dictate that she should resist there the enterprise of empire and join in the defensive effort of the threaten state to any state of europe that have conceive the ambition to dominate the continent this policy of england have seem as contrary to the interest of civilization as the policy of the papacy appear in italy to a italian patriot like machiavellus he want italy enslave in order that it might be unite and so do some german now want europe enslave that it may have peace under germany they accuse england of perpetuate for egotistic end the state of anarchy but it be not thus that german view british policy when the power that be to give peace to europe be not germany but france in this long and bloody game the partner be always change and as partner change so do view one thing only do not change the fundamental anarchy international relation it be agree can only turn upon force it be the disposition and grouping of the force alone that can or do vary but europe be not the only scene of the conflict between empire and the balance since the sixteenth century the european state have be contend for mastery not only over one another but over the world colonial empire have rise and fall portugal spain holland in turn have win and lose england and france have win lose and regain in the twentieth century great britain reap the reward of she european conflict in the empire -lrb- wrongly so-called -rrb- on which the sun never set next to she come france in africa and the east while germany look out with discontented eye on a world already occupy and cherish the same ambition all great state have cherish before she find the time too mature for they accomplishment by the method that avail in the past thus not only in europe but on the larger stage of the world the international rivalry be pursue but it be the same rivalry and it proceed from the same cause : the mutual aggression and defense of being live in a state of nature without this historical background no special study of the event that lead up to the present war can be either just or intelligible the feeling of every nation about itself and its neighbor be determine by the history of the past and by the way in which that history be regard the picture look different from every point of view indeed a comprehension of the cause of the war could only be fully attain by one who should know not only the most secret thought of the few man who directly bring it about but also the prejudice and preconception of the public opinion in each nation there be nobody who possess these qualification but in the absence of such a historian these imperfect note be set down in the hope that they may offer a counterpoise to some of the wilder passion that sweep over all people in time of war and threaten to prepare for europe a future even worse than its past have be 2 _ the triple alliance and the entente _ first let we remind ourselves in general of the situation that prevail in europe during the ten year precede the war it be in that period that the entente between france russium and england be form and consolidate over against the exist triple alliance between germany austrium and italy neither of these combination be in its origin and purpose aggressive -lrb- 1 -rrb- and so far as great britain be concern the relation she enter into with france and with russium be direct in each case to the settlement of long outstanding difference without special reference to the german power but it be impossible in the european anarchy that any arrangement should be make between any state which do not arouse suspicion in other and the draw together of the power of the entente do in fact appear to germany as a menace she believe that she be be threaten by a aggressive combination just as on the other hand she herself seem to the power of the entente a danger to be guard against this apprehension on the part of germany be sometimes think to have be mere pretence but there be every reason to suppose it to have be genuine the policy of the entente do in fact on a number of occasion come into collision with that of germany the arm and counter-arm be continuous and the very fact that from the side of the entente it seem that germany be always the aggressor should suggest to we that from the other side the opposite impression would prevail that in fact it do prevail be clear not only from the constant assertion of german statesman and of the german press but from contemporary observation make by the representative of a state not itself involve in either of the oppose combination the dispatch of the belgian ambassador at berlin pari and london during the year 1905 to 1914 -lrb- 2 -rrb- show a constant impression that the entente be a hostile combination direct against germany and engineer in the earlier year for that purpose by king edward vii this impression of the belgian representative be no proof it be true of the real intention of the entente but it be proof of how they do in fact appear to outsider and it be irrelevant whether or no it be true to urge that the belgian be indoctrinate with the german view since precisely the fact that they could be so indoctrinate would show that the view be on the face of it plausible we see then in these dispatch the way in which the policy of the entente could appear to observer outside it i give illustration from berlin pari and london on may 30 1908 baron greindl belgian ambassador at berlin write as follow : -- call it a alliance _ entente _ or what you will the grouping of the power arrange by the personal intervention of the king of england exist and if it be not a direct and immediate threat of war against germany -lrb- it would be too much to say that it be that -rrb- it constitute none the less a diminution of she security the necessary pacifist declaration which no doubt will be repeat at reval signify very little emanate as they do from three power which like russium and england have just carry through successfully without any motive except the desire for aggrandizement and without even a plausible pretext war of conquest in manchurium and the transvaal or which like france be proceed at this moment to the conquest of morocco in contempt of solemn promise and without any title except the cession of british rights which never exist on may 24 1907 the comte de lalaing belgian ambassador at london write : -- a certain section of the press call here the yellow press bear to a great extent the responsibility for the hostile feeling between the two nation it be plain enough that official england be quietly pursue a policy oppose to germany and aim at she isolation and that king edward have not hesitate to use he personal influence in the service of this scheme but it be certainly exceedingly dangerous to poison public opinion in the open manner adopt by these irresponsible journal again on July 28 1911 in the midst of the morocco crisis baron guillaume belgian ambassador at paris write : -- i have great confidence in the pacific sentiment of the emperor william in spite of the too frequent exaggeration of some of he gesture he will not allow himself to be draw on farther than he choose by the exuberant temperament and clumsy manners of he very intelligent minister of foreign affair -lrb- kiderlen-waechter -rrb- i feel in general less faith in the desire of great britain for peace she would not be sorry to see the other eat one another up as i think from the begin it be in london that the key to the situation lie it be there only that it can become grave the french will yield on all the point for the sake of peace it be not the same with the english who will not compromise on certain principle and certain claim -lrb- footnote 1 : the alliance between germany and austrium which date from 1879 be form to guarantee the two state against a attack by russium its term be : -- 1 if contrary to what be to be expect and contrary to the sincere desire of the two high contracting party one of the two empire should be attack by russium the two high contracting party be bind reciprocally to assist one another with the whole military force of they empire and further not to make peace except conjointly and by common consent 2 if one of the high contracting power should be attack by another power the other high contracting party engage itself by the present act not only not to support the aggressor against its ally but at least to observe a benevolent neutrality with regard to the other contract party if however in the case suppose the attack power should be support by russium whether by active co-operation or by military measure which should menace the power attack then the obligation of mutual assistance with all military force as stipulate in the precede article would immediately come into force and the military operation of the high contracting party would be in that case conduct jointly until the conclusion of peace italy accede to the alliance in 1882 the engagement be defensive each of the three party be to come to the assistance of the other if attack by a third party the treaty of germany with austrium be supplement in 1884 by a treaty with russium know as the reinsurance treaty whereby germany bind herself not to join austrium in a attack upon russium this treaty lapse in the year 1890 and the lapse it be presume prepare the way for the _ rapprochement _ between russium and france the text of the treaty of 1894 between france and russium have never be publish it be suppose to be a treaty of mutual defense in case of a aggressive attack the power from whom attack be expect be probably name as in the treaty between germany and austria it be probably for that reason that the treaty be not publish the accession of great britain to what then become know as the triple entente be determine by the treaty of 1904 with france whereby france abandon she opposition to the british occupation of egypt in return for a free hand in morocco and by the treaty of 1907 with russium whereby the two power regulate they relation in persium afghanistan and thibet there be no mention in either case of a attack or a defense against attack by any other power -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : these be publish by the _ norddeutsche allgemeine zeitung _ and be reprint under the title belgische aktenstücke 1905-14 -lrb- ernst siegfry mittler and son berlin -rrb- they authenticity as far as i know have not be dispute on the other hand it be to be assume that they have be very carefully edit by the german to make a particular impression my view of the policy of germany or of the entente be in no sense base upon they i adduce they as evidence of contemporary feeling and opinion -rrb- 3 _ great britain _ have establish this general fact that a state of mutual suspicion and fear prevail between germany and the power of the triple entente let we next consider the position and purpose of the various state involve first let we take great britain of which we ought to know most great britain be the head of a empire and of one in point of territory and population the greatest the world have ever see this empire have be acquire by trade and settlement back or precede by military force and to acquire and hold it it have be necessary to wage war after war not only overseas but on the continent of europe it be however as we have already notice a fact and a cardinal fact that since the fifteenth century british ambition have not be direct to extend empire over the continent of europe on the contrary we have resist by arm every attempt make by other power in that direction that be what we have mean by maintain the balance of power we have act no doubt in we own interest or in what we think to be such but in do so we have make ourselves the champion of those european nation that have be threaten by the excessive power of they neighbor british imperialism have thus for four century not endanger but guarantee the independence of the european state further we empire be so large that we can hardly extend it without danger of be unable to administer and protect it we claim therefore that we have neither the need nor the desire to wage war of conquest but we ought not to be surprise if this attitude be not accept without reserve by other nation for during the last half-century we have in fact wage war to annex egypt the soudan the south african republic and burmah to say nothing of the succession of minor war which have give we zululand rhodesia nigerium and uganda odd as it do i believe genuinely seem to most englishman we be regard on the continent as the most aggressive power in the world although we aggression be not upon europe we can not expect therefore that we profession of peaceableness should be take very seriously by outsider nevertheless it be i believe true that at any rate during the last fifteen-year those profession have be genuine we statesman of both party have honestly desire and intend to keep the peace of the world and they have be assist in this by a genuine and increase desire for peace in the nation the liberal government in particular have encourage project of arbitration and of disarmament and sir edward gray be probably the most pacific minister that ever hold office in a great nation but we past inevitably discredit in this respect we future and when we profess peace it be not unnatural that other nation should suspect a snare moreover this desire for peace on we part be conditional upon the maintenance of the _ status quo _ and of we naval supremacy we vast interest in every part of the world make we a factor everywhere to be reckon with east west north and south no other power can take a step without find we in the path those state therefore which unlike ourselves be desirous farther to extend they power and influence beyond the sea must always reckon with we particularly if with that end in view by increase they naval strength they seem to threaten we supremacy at sea this attitude of ours be not to be blame but it must always make difficult the maintenance of friendly relation with ambitious power in the past we difficulty have be mainly with russium and france in recent year they have be with germany for germany since 1898 for the first time in she history have be in a position and have make the choice to become a world-power for that reason as well as to protect she commerce she have build a navy and for that reason we pursue we traditional policy of oppose the strongest continental power have draw away from she and towards russium and france we do not indeed enter upon we arrangement with these latter power because of aggressive intention towards germany but the growth of german sea-power drive we more and more to rely upon the entente in case it should be necessary for we to defend ourselves all this follow inevitably from the logic of the position give the european anarchy i state it for the sake of exposition not of criticism and i do not imagine any reader will quarrel with my statement 4 _ france _ let we turn now to france since 1870 we find contend there with vary fortune and strength two opposite current of sentiment and policy one be that of _ revanche _ against germany inspire by the old tradition of glory and hegemony associate with hope of a monarchist or imperialistic revolution and direct in the first place to a recovery of alsace-lorraine the other policy be that of peace abroad and socialistic transformation at home inspire by the modern ideal of justice and fraternity and support by the best of the younger generation of philosopher poet and artist as well as by the bulk of the work class nowhere have these two current of contemporary aspiration meet and contend as fiercely as in france the dreyfus case be the most striking act in the great drama but it be not the conclude one french militarism in that affair be scotch but not kill and the contest be never fiercer than in the year immediately precede the war the fighter for peace be the socialist under they leader jaurès the one great man in the public life of europe while recognize the urgent need for adequate national defense jaurès labor so to organize it that it could not be mistake for nor convert into aggression he labor at the same time to remove the cause of the danger in the year 1913 under swiss auspices a meeting of french and german pacifist be arrange at berne to this meeting there proceed 167 french deputy and 48 senator the baron d'estournelle de constant be president of the french bureau and jaurès one of the vice-president the result be disappointing the german participation be small and less influential than the french and no agreement could be reach on the burning question of alsace-lorraine but the french socialist continue up to the eve of the war to fight for peace with a energy a intelligence and a determination show in no other country the assassination of jaurès be a symbol of the assassination of peace but the assassin be a frenchman for if in france the current for peace run strong in these latter year so do the current for war french chauvinism have wax and wane but it be never extinguish after 1870 it centre not only about alsace-lorraine but also about the colonial expansion which take from that date a new lease of life in france as it have do in england after the loss of the american colony directly encourage by bismarck france annex tunis in 1881 the annexation of tuni lead up at last to that of morocco other territory have be seize in the far east and france become next to ourselves the greatest colonial power this policy could not be pursue without friction and the principal friction at the beginning be with ourselves once at least in the fashoda crisis the two country be on the verge of war and it be not till the entente of 1904 that they relation be adjust on a basis of give-and-take but by that time germany have come into the colonial field and the entente with england mean new friction with germany turn upon french design in morocco in this matter great britain support she ally and the incident of agadir in 1911 show the solidity of the entente this demonstration no doubt strengthen the hand of the aggressive element in france and later on the influence of m delcassé and m poincaré be believe in certain quarter to have give new energy to this direction of french policy this tendency to chauvinism be recognize as a menace to peace and we find reflection of that feeling in the belgian dispatch thus for instance baron guillaume belgian minister at paris write on February 21 1913 of m poincaré : -- it be under he ministry that the military and slightly chauvinistic instinct of the french people have awaken he hand can be see in this modification it be to be hope that he political intelligence practical and cool will save he from all exaggeration in this course the notable increase of german armament which supervene at the moment of m poincaré 's entrance at the elysée will increase the danger of a too nationalistic orientation of the policy of france again on march 3 1913 : -- the german ambassador say to I on Saturday : the political situation be much improve in the last forty-eight hour the tension be generally relax one may hope for a return to peace in the near future but what do not improve be the state of public opinion in france and germany with regard to the relation between the two country we be persuade in germany that a spirit of chauvinism have revive we have to fear a attack by the republic in france they express the same fear with regard to we the consequence of these misunderstanding be to ruin we both i do not know where we be go on this perilous route will not a man appear of sufficient goodwill and prestige to recall every one to reason all this be the more ridiculous because during the crisis we be traverse the two government have give proof of the most pacific sentiment and have continually rely upon one another to avoid conflict on this baron guillaume comment : -- baron schoen be perfectly right i be not in a position to examine german opinion but i note every day how public opinion in france become more suspicious and chauvinistic one meet people who assure one that a war with germany in the near future be certain and inevitable people regret it but make up they mind to it they demand almost by acclamation a immediate vote for every means of increase the defensive power of france the most reasonable man assert that it be necessary to arm to the tooth to frighten the enemy and prevent war on April 16th he report a conversation with m pichon in which the latter say : -- among we too there be a spirit of chauvinism which be increase which i deplore and against which we ought to react half the theater in paris now play chauvinistic and nationalistic piece the note of alarm become more urgent as the day go on on January 16 1914 the baron write : -- i have already have the honor to tell you that it be mm poincaré delcassé millerand and they friend who have invent and pursue the nationalistic and chauvinistic policy which menace to-day the peace of europe and of which we have note the renaissance it be a danger for europe and for belgium i see in it the greatest peril which menace the peace of europe to-day not that i have the right to suppose that the government of the republic be disposed deliberately to trouble the peace rather i believe the contrary but the attitude that the barthou cabinet have take up be in my judgment the determine cause of a excess of militaristic tendency in germany it be clear from these quotation and it be for this reason alone that i give they that france support by the other member of the triple entente could appear and do appear as much a menace to germany as germany appear a menace to france that in france as in other country there be jingoism as well as pacifism and that the inability of french public opinion to acquiesce in the loss of alsace-lorraine be a active factor in the unrest of europe once more i state these fact i do not criticize they they be essential to the comprehension of the international situation 5 _ russium _ we have speak so far of the west but the entente between france and russium date from 1894 bring the latter into direct contact with eastern policy the motive and even the term of the dual alliance be imperfectly know consideration of high finance be suppose to have be a important factor in it but the main intention no doubt be to strengthen both power in the case of a possible conflict with germany the chance of war between germany and france be thus definitely increase for now there could hardly be a eastern war without a western one germany must therefore regard herself as compel to wage war if war should come on both front and in all she fear or she ambition this consideration must play a principal part friction in the east must involve friction in the west and vice versa what be the cause of friction in the west we have see let we now consider the cause of friction in the east the relation of russium to germany have be and be of a confused and complicated character change as circumstance and personality change but one permanent factor have be the sympathy between the govern element in the two country the govern class in russium indeed have not only be inspire by german idea it have be largely recruit from man of german stock and it have manifest all the contempt and hatred which be characteristic of the german bureaucracy for the ideal of democracy liberty and free think the two government have always be ready to combine against popular insurrection and in particular against every attempt of the pole to recover they liberty they have be draw and hold together by a common interest in tyranny and the renewal of that co-operation be one of the danger of the future on the other hand apart from and in opposition to this common political interest there exist between the two nation a strong racial antagonism the russian temperament be radically oppose to the german the one express itself in panslavism the other in pangermanism and this opposition of temperament be likely to be deeper and more enduring than the sympathy of the one autocracy with the other but apart from this racial factor there be in the south-east a opposition of political ambition primarily the balkan question be a austro-russian rather than a russo-german one bismarck profess himself indifferent to the fate of the balkan people and even avow a willingness to see russium at constantinople but recent year have see in this respect a great change the alliance between germany and austrium date from 1879 have become closer and closer as the power of the entente have draw together in what appear to be a menacing combination it have be for some time past a cardinal principle of german policy to support she ally in the balkan and this determination have be increase by german ambition in the east the ancient dream of russium to possess constantinople have be counter by the new german dream of a hegemony over the near east base upon the through route from berlin via vienna and constantinople to bagdad and this political opposition have be of late year the determining factor in the relationship of the two power the danger of a russo-german conflict have thus be very great and since the russo-french entente germany as we have already point out have see herself menace on either front by a war which would immediately endanger both turn once more to the belgian dispatch we find such hint as the follow on October 24 1912 the comte de lalaing belgian ambassador to london write as follow : -- the french ambassador who must have special reason for speak thus have repeat to I several time that the greatest danger for the maintenance of the peace of europe consist in the indiscipline and the personal policy of the russian agent they be almost all ardent panslavist and it be to they that must be imputed the responsibility for the event that be occur beyond a doubt they will make themselves the secret instigator for a intervention of they country in the balkan conflict on November 30 1912 baron de beyen write from berlin : -- at the end of last week a report be spread in the chancellery of europe that m sazonov have abandon the struggle against the court party which wish to drag russium into war on June 9 1914 baron guillaume write from paris : -- be it true that the cabinet of st petersburg have impose upon this country -lrb- france -rrb- the adoption of the law of three year and would now bring to bear the whole weight of its influence to ensure its maintenance i have not be able to obtain light upon this delicate point but it would be all the more serious inasmuch as the man who direct the empire of the tsar can not be unaware that the effort thus demand of the french nation be excessive and can not be long sustained be then the attitude of the cabinet of st petersburg base upon the conviction that event be so imminent that it will be possible to use the tool it intend to put into the hand of its ally what a sinister vista be open up by this passage i have no wish to insinuate that the suspicion here express be justified it be the suspicion itself that be the point dimly we see as through a mist the figure of the architect of war we see that the force they wield be ambition and pride jealousy and fear that these be all-pervasive that they affect all government and all nation and be foster by condition for which all alike be responsible it will be understand of course that in bring out the fact that there be national chauvinism in russium and that this find its excuse in the unstable equilibrium of europe i be make no attack on russian policy i do not pretend to know whether these element of opinion actually influence the policy of the government but they certainly influence german fear and without a knowledge of they it be impossible to understand german policy the reader must bear in mind this source of friction along with the other when we come to consider that policy in detail 6 _ austria-hungary _ turn now to austria-hungary we find in she the power to whom the immediate occasion of the war be due the power moreover who contribute in large measure to its remoter cause austria-hungary be a state but not a nation it have no natural bond to hold its population together and it continue its political existence by force and fraud by the connivance and the self-interest of other state rather than by any inherent principle of vitality it be in relation to the balkan state that this instability have be most marked and most dangerous since the kingdom of serbium acquire its independent existence it have be a center draw to itself the discontent and the ambition of the slav population under the dual monarchy the realization of those ambition imply the disruption of the austro-hungarian state but behind the southern slav stand russium and any attempt to change the political status in the balkan have thus mean for year past acute risk of war between the two empire that border they this political rivalry have accentuate the racial antagonism between german and slav and be the immediate origin of the war which present itself to englishmen as one primarily between germany and the western power on the position of italy it be not necessary to dwell it have long be suspect that she be a doubtful factor in the triple alliance and the event have prove that this suspicion be correct but though italy have participate in the war she action have no part in produce it and we need not here indicate the course and the motive of she policy 7 _ germany _ have thus indicate briefly the position the peril and the ambition of the other great power of europe let we turn to consider the proper subject of this essay the policy of germany and first let we dwell on the all-important fact that germany as a great power be a creation of the last fifty year before 1866 there be a loose confederation of german state after 1870 there be a empire of the german the transformation be the work of bismarck and it be accomplish by blood and iron whether it could have be accomplish otherwise be matter of speculation that it be accomplish so be a fact and a fact of tragic significance for it establish among german the prestige of force and fraud and give they as they national hero the man whose most characteristic act be the falsification of the em telegram if the unification could have be achieve in 1848 instead of in 1870 if the free and generous idealism of that epoch could have triumph as it deserve to if german have not barter away they soul for the sake of the kingdom of this world we might have be spare this last and most terrible act in the bloody drama of european history if even after 1866 1870 have not be provoke the catastrophe that be destroy europe before we eye might never have overwhelm we in the crisis of 1870 the french minister who fight so long and with such tenacity for peace saw and express with the lucidity of he nation what the real issue be for germany and for europe : -- there exist it be true a barbarous germany greedy of battle and conquest the germany of the country squire there exist a germany pharisaic and iniquitous the germany of all the unintelligible pedant whose empty lucubration and microscopic research have be so unduly vaunted but these two germany be not the great germany that of the artist the poet the thinker that of bach mozart beethoven goethe schiller heine leibnitz kant hegel liebig this latter germany be good generous humane pacific it find expression in the touching phrase of goethe who when ask to write against we reply that he could not find it in he heart to hate the french if we do not oppose the natural movement of german unity if we allow it to complete itself quietly by successive stage it will not give supremacy to the barbarous and sophistical germany it will assure it to the germany of intellect and culture war on the other hand would establish during a time impossible to calculate the domination of the germany of the squire and the pedant -lrb- 1 -rrb- the generous dream be not to be realize french chauvinism fall into the trap bismarck have prepare for it yet even at the last moment he war would have escape he have he not recapture it by fraud the publication of the em telegram make the conflict inevitable and one of the most hideous and sinister scene in all history be that in which the three conspirator bismarck moltke and roon suddenly recover they pleasure in eating and drinking because by publish a lie they have secure the certain death in battle of hundred and thousand of young man the spirit of bismarck have infect the whole public life of germany and of europe it have give a new lease to the political philosophy of machiavellus and make of every bud statesman and historian a solemn or a cynical defender of the gospel of force but though this be true we have no right therefore to assume that there be some peculiar wickedness which mark off german policy from that of all other nation machiavellianism be the common heritage of europe it be the translation into idea of the fact of international anarchy german have be more candid and brutal than other in they expression and application of it but statesman politician publicist and historian in every nation accept it under a thicker or thinner veil of plausible sophism it be everywhere the iron hand within the silken glove it be the great european tradition although moreover it be by these method that bismarck accomplish the unification of germany he later policy be by common consent a policy of peace war have do its part and the new germany require all its energy to build up its internal prosperity and strength in 1875 it be true bismarck be credit with the intention to fall once more upon france the fact do not seem to be clearly establish at any rate if such be he intention it be frustrate by the intervention of russium and of great britain during the thirty-nine year that follow germany keep the peace while france england and russium wage war on a great scale and while the former power acquire enormous extension of territory the only military operation undertake by germany be against african native in she dependency and against china in 1900 the conduct of the german troops appear it be true to have be distinguish in this latter expedition by a brutality which stand out in relief even in that orgy of slaughter and loot but we must remember that they be specially order by they imperial master in the name of jesus christ to show no mercy and give no quarter apart from this it will not be dispute by any one who know the fact that during the first twenty year or so after 1875 germany be the power whose diplomacy be the least disturbing to europe the chief friction during that period be between russium and france and great britain and it be one or other of these power accord to the angle of vision which be regard as offer the menace of aggression if there have be a german plot against the peace of the world it do not date from before the decade 1890-1900 the close of that decade mark in fact a new epoch in german policy the year of peace have be distinguish by the development of industry and trade and internal organization the population increase from forty million in 1870 to over sixty-five million at the present date foreign trade increase more than ten-fold national pride and ambition grow with the growth of prosperity and force and sentiment as well as need impel german policy to claim a share of influence outside europe in that greater world for the control of which the other nation be struggle already bismarck though with reluctance and scepticism have acquire for he country by negotiation large area in africa but that do not satisfy the ambition of the colonial party the new kaiser put himself at the head of the new movement and announce that henceforth nothing must be do in any part of the world without the cognizance and acquiescence of germany thus there enter a new competitor upon the stage of the world and he advent of necessity be disconcerting and annoying to the earlier comer but be there reason to suppose that from that moment german policy be definitely aim at empire and be prepare to provoke war to achieve it strictly no answer can be give to this question the remoter intention of statesman be rarely avow to other and perhaps rarely to themselves they policy be indeed less continuous less definite and more at the mercy of event than observer or critic be apt to suppose it be not probable that germany any more than any other country in europe be pursue during those year a definite plan think out and predetermine in every point in germany as elsewhere both in home and foreign affair there be a intense and unceasing conflict of compete force and idea in germany as elsewhere policy must have adapt itself to circumstance different personality must have give it different direction at different time we have not the information at we disposal which would enable we to trace in detail the devious course of diplomacy in any of the country of europe what we know something about be the general situation and the action in fact take at certain moment the rest must be for the present mainly matter of conjecture with this word of caution let we now proceed to examine the policy of germany the general situation we have already indicate we have show how the armed peace which be the chronic malady of europe have assume during the ten year from 1904 to 1914 that specially dangerous form which group the great power in two opposite camp -- the triple alliance and the triple entente we have see in the case of great britain france russium and austria-hungary how they come to take they place in that constellation we have now to put germany in its setting in the picture germany then in the first place like the other power have occasion to anticipate war it might be make from the west on the question of alsace-lorraine it might be make from the east on the question of the balkan in either case the system of alliance be likely to bring into play other state than those immediately involve and the german power might find themselves attack on all front while they know in the latter year that they could not count upon the support of italy a reasonable prudence if nothing else must keep germany armed and apprehensive but besides the maintenance of what she have germany be now ambitious to secure she share of world-power let we examine in what spirit and by what act she endeavor to make she claim good first what be the tone of public opinion in germany during these critical year -lrb- footnote 1 : emile ollivier l'empire libéral -rrb- 8 _ opinion in germany _ since the outbreak of the war the pamphlet literature in the country of the entente have be full of citation from german political writer in england in particular the name and work of bernhardus and of treitschke have become more familiar than they appear to have be in germany prior to the war this method of select for polemical purpose certain tendency of sentiment and theory and ignore all other be one which could be apply with damaging result to any country in the world mr angell have show in he prussianism in england how it might be apply to ourselves and a german no doubt into whose hand that book might fall would draw conclusion about public opinion here similar to those which we have draw about public opinion in germany there be jingoism in all country as there be pacifism in all country nevertheless i think it be true to say that the jingoism of germany have be peculiar both in its intensity and in its character this special quality appear to be due both to the temperament and to the recent history of the german nation the german be romantic as the french be impulsive the english sentimental and the russian religious there be some real meaning in these generalisation they be easily to be feel when one come into contact with a nation though they may be hard to establish or define when i say that the german be romantic i mean that they do not easily or willingly see thing as they be they temperament be like a medium of color glass it magnify distort conceal transmute and this be as true when they intellectual attitude be realistic as when it be idealistic in the germany of the past the germany of small state to which all non-german look back with such sympathy and such regret they thinker and poet be inspire by grandiose intellectual abstraction they see idea like god move the world and actual man and woman actual event and thing be but the pass symbol of these supernatural power 1866 and 1870 end all that the unification of germany in the way we have discuss divert all they interest from speculation about the universe life and mankind to the material interest of they new country germany become the preoccupation of all german from abstraction they turn with a new intoxication to what they conceive to be the concrete enter thus late upon the stage of national politics they devote themselves with they accustomed thoroughness to learn and better what they conceive to be the principle and the practice which have give success to other nation in this quest no scruple should deter they no sentimentality hamper no universal ideal distract yet this after all be but german romanticism assume another form the object it be true be different actuality have take the place of ideal germany of humanity but by the german vision the new object be no less distorted than the old in deal with real-politik -lrb- which be the german translation of machiavellianism -rrb- with expansion with survival of the fittest and all the other shibboleth of world-policy they outlook remain as absolute and abstract as before as contemptuous of temperament and measure as blind to those compromise and qualification those decency so to speak of nature by which reality be constitute the german now see man instead of god but they see they as tree walk german imperialism then while it involve the same intellectual presupposition the same confusion the same erroneous argument the same short-sighted ambition as the imperialism of other country exhibit they all in a extreme degree all people admire themselves but the self-adoration of german be so naive so frank so unqualified as to seem sheerly ridiculous to more experienced nation -lrb- 1 -rrb- the english and the french too believe they civilization to be the best in the world but english common-sense and french sanity would prevent they from announce to other people that they propose to conquer they morally or materially for they good all jingo admire and desire war but nowhere else in the modern world be to be find such a debauch of romantic enthusiasm such a wilful blindness to all the reality of war as germany have manifest both before and since the outbreak of this world-catastrophe a reader of german newspaper and tract get at last a feeling of nausea at the very word _ wir deutsche _ follow by the eternal _ helden heldenthum heldenthat _ and be incline to thank god if he indeed belong to a nation sane enough to be compose of _ händler _ the very antithesis between _ helden _ -lrb- hero -rrb- and _ händler _ -lrb- huckster -rrb- with which all germany be ring be a illustration of the romantic quality that vitiate they intelligence in spite of the fact that they be one of the greatest trading and manufacture nation of the world and that precisely the fear of lose they trade and market have be as they constantly assert a chief cause that have drive they to war they speak as though germany be a kind of knight-errant innocent of all material ambition wander through the world in the pure disinterested service of god and man on the other hand because england be a great commercial power they suppose that no englishman live for anything but profit because they themselves have conscription and have to fight or be shoot they infer that every german be a noble warrior because the english volunteer they assume that they only volunteer for they pay germany to they be a hero clothe in white armor magnanimous long-suffering and invincible other nation be little seedy figure in black coat inspire exclusively by hatred and jealousy of the noble german incapable of a generous emotion or a honorable act and destine by the judgment of history to be save if they can be save at all by the great soul and dominate intellect of the teuton it be in this intoxicating atmosphere of temperament and mood that the idea and ambition of german imperialist work and move they be essentially the same as those of imperialist in other country they philosophy of history assume a endless series of war due to the inevitable expansion of rival state they ethic mean a belief in force and a disbelief in everything else they science be a crude misapplication of darwinism combine with invincible ignorance of the true bearing of science upon life and especially of those fact and deduction about biological heredity which once they be understand will make it plain that war degrade the stock of all nation victorious and vanquished alike and that the decline of civilization be far more plausibly to be attribute to this cause than to the moral decadence of which history be always ready after the event to accuse the defeat power one peculiarity perhaps there be in the outlook of german imperialism and that be its emphasis on a unintelligible and unreal abstraction of race german it be think be by biological quality the salt of the earth every really great man in europe since the break-up of the roman empire have be a german even though it might appear at first sight to a uninstructed observer that he be a italian or a frenchman or a spaniard not all german however be they hold as yet include in the german empire or even in the german-austrian combination the flemish be german the dutch be german the english even be german or be before the war have make they in germany 's eye the offscouring of mankind thus a great task lie before the german empire : on the one hand to bring within its fold the german stock that have stray from it in the wanderings of history on the other to reduce under german authority those other stock that be not worthy to share directly in the citizenship of the fatherland the dream of conquest which be the real essence of all imperialism be thus support in germany by argument peculiar to german but the argument put forward be not the real determinant of the attitude the attitude in any country whatever it may be call rest at bottom on sheer national vanity it be the belief in the inherent superiority of one 's own civilization and the desire to extend it by force if need be throughout the world it matter little what argument in its support this passion to dominate may garner from that twilight region in which the advanced guard of science be labor patiently to comprehend nature and mankind man take from the treasury of truth what they be able to take and what imperialist take be a mirror to they own ambition and pride now as to the ambition of this german jingoism there be no manner of doubt german be nothing if not frank and this kind of german do want to conquer and annex not only outside europe but within it we must not however infer that the whole of germany have be infect with this virus the summary i have set down in the last few page represent the impression make on a unsympathetic mind by the literature of pangermanism emerge from such reading -- and it be the principal reading of german origin which have be offer to the british public since the war -- there be a momentary illusion that be germany of course it be not any more than the _ morning post _ or the _ national review _ be england german in fact during recent year have take a prominent place in pacifism as well as in imperialism man like schücking and quidde and fry be at least as well know as man like treitschke and bernhardus opinion in germany as in every other country have be various and conflicting and the pacific tendency have be better organize if not more active there than elsewhere for they have be associate with the huge and disciplined force of the social-democrat indeed the mass of the people leave alone be everywhere pacific i do not forget the very important fact that german education elementary and higher have be deliberately direct to inculcate patriotic feeling that the doctrine of armed force as the highest manifestation of the state have be industriously propagate by the authority and that the unification of germany by force have give to the cult of force a meaning and a popularity probably unknown in any other country but in most man for good or for evil the lesson of education can be quickly obliterate by the experience of life in particular the mass of the people everywhere face to face with the necessity of existence know what it be to work and to struggle to co-operate and to compete to suffer and to relieve suffer though they may be less well-informed than the instruct class be also less liable to obsession by abstraction they see little but they see it straight and though be man with the long animal inheritance of man behind they they passion may be rouse by any cry of battle though they be the fore-ordained dupe of those who direct the policy of nation yet it be not they initiative that originate war they do not desire conquest they do not trouble about race or chatter about the survival of the fittest it be they own need which be also the vital need of society that preoccupy they thought and it be real goods that direct and inspire they genuine idealism we must then disabuse ourselves of the notion so naturally produce by reading and especially by read in time of war that the german jingo be typical of germany they be there they be a force they have to be reckon with but exactly how great a force exactly how influential on policy that be a question which i imagine can only be answer by guess would the reader for instance undertake to estimate the influence during the last fifteen year on british policy and opinion of the imperialist minority in this country no two man i think would agree about it and few man would agree with themselves from one day or one week to another we be reduce to conjecture but the conjecture of some people be of more value than those of other for they be base on a wider converse i think it therefore not without importance to recall to the reader the account of the state of opinion in germany give by well-qualified foreign observer in the year immediately precede the war -lrb- footnote 1 : as i write i come across the follow cite from a book of song compose for german combatant under the title der deutsche zorn : -- wir sind die meister aller welt in allen ernsten dingen \* \* \* \* \* be man al fremd euch höchlichst preist um eurer einfalt willen ist deutschen ursprung allermeist und trägt nur fremde hüllen -rrb- 9 _ opinion about germany _ after the crisis of agadir m george bourdon visit germany to make a inquiry for the _ figaro _ newspaper into the state of opinion there he mission belong to the period between agadir and the outbreak of the first balkan war he interview a large number of people statesman publicist professor politician he do not sum up he impression and such summary as i can give here be no doubt affect by the emphasis of my own mind he book -lrb- 1 -rrb- however be now translate into english and the reader have the opportunity of correct the impression i give he let we begin with pangermanism on which m bourdon have a very interesting chapter he feel for the propaganda of that sect the repulsion that must be feel by every sane and liberal-minded man : -- wretched choleric pangerman exasperated and unbalanced brother of all the exasperated wretched windbag whose tirade in all country answer to yours and whom you be wrong to count you enemy pangerman of the spree and the main who on the other side of the frontier receive the fraternal effusion of russian pan-slavism italian irredentism english imperialism french nationalism what be it that you want they want he reply part of austrium switzerland flander luxemburg denmark holland for all these be germanic country they want colony they want a bigger army and a bigger navy a execrable race these pangerman they have the yellow skin the dry mouth the green complexion of the bilious they do not live under the sky they avoid the light hide in they cellar they pore over treaty cite newspaper article grow pale over map measure angle quibble over text or trace of frontier the pangerman be a propagandist and a revivalist but m bourdon add when he shout we must not think we hear in he tone the reverberation of the german soul the organ of the party seem few and unimportant the party itself be speak of with contempt they talk loud m bourdon be tell but have no real follow it be only in france that people attend to they nevertheless m bourdon conclude they be not negligible for in the first place they have power to evoke the jingoism of the german public -- a jingoism which the violent patriotism of the people they tradition of victorious force they education they dogma of race continually keep alive and secondly the government when it think it useful turn to the pangerman for assistance and let loose they propaganda in the press they influence thus wax and wane as it be favor or not by authority like the giant antaeus a correspondent write to m bourdon pangermanism lose its force when it quit the soil of government it be interesting to note however that the pangerman propaganda purport to be base upon fear if they urge increase armament it be with a view to defense i consider it a patriotic duty write general keim in my quality of president of the german league for defense to demand a increase of effective such that france should find it out of the question to dream of a victorious war against we even with the help of other nation to the awakening of the national sentiment in france there be only one reply -- the increase of the german force i have the impression say count reventlow that a warlike spirit which be new be develop in france there be the danger thus in germany as elsewhere even jingoism take the mask of necessary precaution and so it must be and will be everywhere as long as the european anarchy continue for what nation have ever admit a intention or desire to make aggressive war m bourdon then take full account of pangermanism nor do he neglect the general militaristic tendency of german opinion he find pride in the army a determination to be strong and that belief that it be in war that the state express itself at the highest and the best which be part of the tradition of german education since the day of treitschke yet in spite of all this to which m bourdon do full justice the general impression make by the conversation he record be that the bulk of opinion in germany be strongly pacific there be apprehension indeed apprehension of france and apprehension of england england certainly preoccupy opinion more than france people be alarm by she movement and she armament the constant intervention of england have undoubtedly irritated the public germany therefore must arm and arm again a great war may be delay but not prevent unless german armament be such as to put fear into the heart of every possible adversary germany fear that war might come but she do not want it -- that in sum be m bourdon 's impression from soldier statesman professor business man again and again the same assurance the sentiment you will find most generally hold be undoubtedly that of peace few think about war we need peace too much war war between we what a idea why it would mean a european war something monstrous something which would surpass in horror anything the world have ever see my dear sir only madman could desire or conceive such a calamity it must be avoid at all cost what count above all here be commercial interest all who live by it be here as elsewhere almost too pacific under the economic condition prevail in germany the most glorious victory she can aspire to -- it be a soldier who say it -- be peace the impression thus gather from m bourdon 's observation be confirm at every point by those of baron beyen who go to berlin as belgian minister after the crisis of agadir -lrb- 2 -rrb- of the world of business he say : -- all these gentleman appear to be convinced partisan of peace accord to they the tranquillity of europe have not be for a moment seriously menace during the crisis of agadir industrial germany require to live on good term with france peace be necessary to business and german finance in particular have every interest in the maintenance of its profitable relation with french finance -lrb- 3 -rrb- at the end of a few month i have the impression that these pacifist personify then -- in 1912 -- the most common the most widely spread though the least noisy opinion the opinion of the majority understanding by the majority not that of the govern class but that of the nation as a whole -lrb- p 172 -rrb- the mass of the people beyen hold loved peace and dreaded war that be the case not only with all the common people but also with the manager and owner of business and the wholesale and retail merchant even in berlin society and among the ancient german nobility there be to be find sincere pacifist on the other hand there be certainly a bellicose minority it be compose largely of soldier both active and retire the latter especially look with envy and disgust on the increase prosperity of the commercial class and hold that a blood-letting would be wholesome to purge and regenerate the social body -- a view not confine to germany and one which have receive classical expression in tennyson 's maud to this movement belong also the high official the conservative party patriot and journalist and of course the armament firm deliberate fomenter of war in germany as everywhere else in order to put money into they pocket to these must be add the intellectual flower of the university and the school the professor at the university take _ en bloc _ be one of the most violent element in the nation almost all the young people from one end of the empire to the other have have bring before they in the course of they study the dilemma which bernhardus sum up to he reader in the three word ` world-power or decadence ' yet with all this the resolute partisan of war form as i think a very small minority in the nation that be the impression i obstinately retain of my sojourn in berlin and my excursion into the province of the empire rich or poor when i recall the image of this peaceful population journey to business every week-day with a movement so regular or seat at table on sunday in the cafés in the open air before a glass of beer i can find in my memory nothing but placid face where there be no trace of violent passion no thought hostile to foreigner not even that feverish concern with the struggle for existence which the spectacle of the human crowd have sometimes show I elsewhere a similar impression be give by the dispatch from m cambon french ambassador to berlin write on July 30 1913 -lrb- 4 -rrb- he too find element work for war and analysis they much as baron beyen do there be first the junker or country squire naturally military by all they tradition but also afraid of the death-duty which be bind to come if peace continue secondly the higher bourgeoisie -- that be the great manufacturer and financier and of course in particular the armament firm both these social class be influence not only by direct pecuniary motive but by the fear of the rise democracy which be begin to swamp they representative in the reichstag thirdly the official the party of the pensioned fourthly the university the historian philosopher political pamphleteer and other apologist of german kultur fifthly rancorous diplomatist with a sense that they have be dupe on the other hand there be as m cambon insist other force in the country make for peace what be these in number the great bulk in germany as in all country the mass of the workman artisan and peasant who be peace-loving by instinct such of the great noble as be intelligent enough to recognize the disastrous political and social consequence of war numerous manufacturer merchant and financier in a moderate way of business the non-german element of the empire finally the government and the govern class in the large southern state a goodly array of peace force accord to m cambon however all these latter element be only a sort of make-weight in political matter with limited influence on public opinion or they be silent social force passive and defenceless against the infection of a wave of warlike feeling this last sentence be pregnant it describe the state of affair exist more or less in all country a few individual a few group or clique make for war more or less deliberately the mass of the people ignorant and unconcerned but also defenceless against suggestion and ready to respond to the call to war with submission or with enthusiasm as soon as the call be make by they government on the testimony then of these witness all shrewd and competent observer it may be permit to sum up somewhat as follow : -- in the year immediately precede the war the mass of the people in germany rich and poor be attach to peace and dreaded war but there be there also a powerful minority either desire war or expect it and in either case prepare it by they agitation and this minority could appeal to the peculiarly aggressive form of patriotism inculcate by the public school and university the war party base its appeal for ever fresh armament on the hostile preparation of the power of the entente its aggressive ambition masquerade perhaps even to itself as a patriotism apprehensively concern with defense it be support by powerful moneyed interest and the mass of the people passive ill-informed preoccupy be defenceless against its agitation the german government find the pangerman embarrassing or convenient accord as the direction of its policy and the european situation change from crisis to crisis they be thus at one moment negligible at another powerful for long they agitate vainly and they might long have continue to do so but if the moment should come at which the government should make the fatal plunge they effort would have contribute to the result they warning would seem to have be justified and they would triumph as the party of patriot that have foretell in vain the come crash to a unbelieving nation

atmosphere of opinion in which the german government move let we proceed to consider the actual course of they policy during the critical year fifteen or so that precede the war the policy admittedly and openly be one of expansion but expansion where it seem to be rather widely suppose that germany be prepare war in order to annex territory in europe the contempt of german imperialist from treitschke onward for the rights of small state the racial theory which include in german territory holland belgium switzerland and the scandinavian country may seem to give color to this idea but it would be hazardous to assume that german statesman be seriously influence for year by the lucubration of mr houston stewart chamberlain and he follower nor can a long-prepared policy of annexation in europe be infer from the fact that belgium and france be invade after the war break out or even from the present demand among german party that the territory occupy should be retain if it could be maintain that the seizure of territory during war or even its retention after it be evidence that the territory be the object of the war it would be legitimate also to infer that the british empire have go to war to annex german colony a conclusion which englishman would probably reject with indignation in truth before the war the view that it be the object of german policy to annex european territory would have find i think few if any supporter among well-informed and unprejudiced observer i note for instance that mr dawson whose opinion on such a point be probably better worth have than that of any other englishman in he book the evolution of modern germany -lrb- 1 -rrb- when discuss the aim of german policy do not even refer to the idea that annexation in europe be contemplate so far as the evidence at present go i do not think a case can be make out for the view that german policy be aim during these year at secure the hegemony of europe by annex european territory the expansion germany be seek be that of trade and market and she statesman and people like those of other country be under the belief that to secure this it be necessary to acquire colony this ambition up to a point she be able in fact to fulfil not by force but by agreement with the other power the berlin act of 1885 be one of the wisest and most far-seeing achievement of european policy by it the partition of a great part of the african continent between the power be peaceably accomplish and germany emerge with possession to the extent of 377000 square mile and a estimate population of 1700000 by 1906 she colonial domain have be increase to over two and a half million square mile and its population to over twelve million and all of this have be acquire without war with any civilized nation in spite of she late arrival on the scene as a colonial power germany have thus secure without war a empire overseas not comparable indeed to that of great britain or of france but still considerable in extent and -lrb- as german believe -rrb- in economic promise and sufficient to give they the opportunity they desire to show they capacity as pioneer of civilization how they have succeed or fail in this we need not here consider but when german demand a place in the sun the considerable place they have in fact acquire with the acquiescence of the other colonial power should in fairness to those power be remember but notoriously they be not satisfied and the extent of they dissatisfaction be show by they determination to create a navy this new departure date from the close of the decade 1890-1900 mark the beginning of that friction between great britain and germany which be a main cause of the war it be therefore important to form some just idea of the motive that inspire german policy to take this momentous step the reason give by prince bülow the founder of the policy and often repeat by german statesman and publicist -lrb- 2 -rrb- be first the need of a strong navy to protect german commerce secondly the need as well as the ambition of germany to play a part proportional to she real strength in the determination of policy beyond the sea these reason accord to the idea that govern european statesmanship be valid and sufficient they be the same that have influence all great power and if germany be influence by they we need not infer any specially sinister intention on she part the fact that during the present war german trade have be sweep from the sea and that she be in the position of a blockaded power will certainly convince any german patriot not that she do not need a navy but that she need a much stronger one and the retort that there need have be no war if germany have not provoke it by build a fleet be not one that can be expect to appeal to any nation so long as the european anarchy endure for of course every nation regard itself as menaced perpetually by aggression from some other power defense be certainly a legitimate motive for the building of the fleet even if there have be no other there be however in fact another reason avowed germany as we have say desire to have a voice in policy beyond the sea here too the reason be good as reason go in a world of compete state a great manufacturing and trading power can not be indifferent to the parcel out of the world among its rival wherever in country economically undeveloped there be project of protectorate or annexation or of any kind of monopoly to be establish in the interest of any power there german interest be directly affect she have to speak and to speak with a loud voice if she be to be attend to and a loud voice mean a navy so at least the matter naturally present itself to german imperialist as indeed it would to imperialist of any other country the reason give by german statesman for build they fleet be in this sense valid but be they the only reason in the begin most probably they be but the formation and strengthening of the entente and germany 's consequent fear that war might be make upon she jointly by france and great britain give a new stimulus to she naval ambition she could not now be content with a navy only as big as that of france for she might have to meet those of france and england conjoin this defensive reason be good but no doubt as always there must have lurk behind it idea of aggression ambition in the philosophy of state go hand in hand with fear the war may come say one party yes say the other and secretly mutter may the war come to ask whether armament be for offence or for defense must always be a idle inquiry they will be for either or both accord to circumstance accord to the personality that be in power accord to the mood that politician and journalist and the interest that suborn they have be able to infuse into a nation but what may be say with clear conviction be that to attempt to account for the clash of war by the ambition and armament of a single power be to think far too simply of how these catastrophe originate the truth in this case be that german ambition develop in relation to the whole european situation and that just as on land they policy be condition by they relation to france and russium so at sea it be condition by they relation to great britain they know that they determination to become a great power at sea would arouse the suspicion and alarm of the english prince bülow be perfectly frank about that he say that the difficulty be to get on with the shipbuilding program without give great britain a opportunity to intervene by force and nip the enterprise in the bud he attribute here to the british government a policy which be all in the bismarckian tradition it be in fact a policy urge by some voice here voice which as be always the case be carry to germany and magnify by the mega-phone of the press -lrb- 3 -rrb- that no british government in fact contemplated pick a quarrel with germany in order to prevent she become a naval power i be myself as much convinced as any other englishman and i count the fact as righteousness to we statesman on the other hand i think it a unfounded conjecture that prince bülow be deliberately build with a view to attack the british empire i see no reason to doubt he sincerity when he say that he look forward to a peaceful solution of the rivalry between germany and ourselves and that france in he view not great britain be the irreconcilable enemy -lrb- 4 -rrb- in build she navy no doubt germany deliberately take the risk of incur a quarrel with england in the pursuit of a policy which she regard as essential to she development it be quite another thing and would require much evidence to prove that she be work up to a war with the object of destroy the british empire what we have to bear in mind in estimate the meaning of the german naval policy be a complex series of motive and condition : the genuine need of a navy and a strong one to protect trade in the event of war and to secure a voice in overseas policy the genuine fear of a attack by the power of the entente a attack to be provoke by british jealousy and also that indeterminate ambition of any great power which may be influence the policy of statesman even while they have not avow it to themselves and which express by man less responsible and less discreet become part of that public opinion of which policy take account -lrb-

footnote 4 : see imperial germany pp 48 71 english translation -rrb- 11 _ vain attempt at harmony _ it may however be reasonably urge that unless the german have have aggressive ambition they would have agree to some of the many proposal make by great britain to arrest on both side the constantly expand program of naval construction it be true that germany have always oppose the policy of limit armament whether on land or sea this be consonant with that whole militarist view of international politics which as i have already indicate be hold in a more extreme and violent form in germany than in any other country but which be the creed of jingo and imperialist everywhere if the british government have succeed in come to a agreement with germany on this question they would have be bitterly assail by that party at home still the government do make the attempt it be comparatively easy for they for any basis to which they could have agree must have leave intact legitimately and necessarily as we all agree the british supremacy at sea the german would not assent to this they do not choose to limit beforehand they effort to rival we at sea probably they do not think it possible to equal still less to outstrip we but they want to do all they could and that of course could have only one mean they think a war with england possible and they want to be as well prepare as they could be it be part of the irony that attach to the whole system of the armed peace that the preparation make against war be themselves the principal cause of war for if there have be no rival shipbuilding there need have be no friction between the two country but why do germany fear war it must have be because she mean to make it so the english argue but imagine the german say to we why do you fear war there will be no war unless you provoke it we be quite pacific you need not be alarm about we would such a promise have induce we to relax we preparation for a moment no under the armed peace there can be no confidence and that alone be sufficient to account for the breakdown of the anglo-german negotiation without suppose on either side a wish or a intention to make war each suspect and be bind to suspect the purpose of the other let we take for example the negotiation of 1912 and put they back in they set the triple alliance be confront the triple entente on both side be fear and suspicion each believe in the possibility of the other spring a war upon they each suspect the other of want to lull they into a false security and then take they unprepared in that atmosphere what hope be there of successful negotiation the essential condition -- mutual confidence -- be lack what accordingly do we find the german offer to reduce they naval program first if england will promise a unconditional neutrality secondly when that be reject if england will promise neutrality in a war which should be force upon germany thereupon the british foreign office scent a snare germany will get austrium to provoke a war while make it appear that the war be provoke by russium and she will then come in under the term of she alliance with austrium smash france and claim that england must look on passively under the neutrality agreement no thank you sir edward gray accordingly make a counter-proposal england will neither make nor participate in a unprovoked attack upon germany this time it be the german chancellor 's turn to hang back unprovoked hm what do that mean russium let we suppose make war upon austrium while make it appear that austrium be the aggressor france come in on the side of russium and england will she admit that the war be ` unprovoked ' and remain neutral hardly we think the chancellor thereupon propose the addition : england of course will remain neutral if war be force upon germany that follow i presume no from the british foreign office reason as before and the negotiation fall through how should they not under the condition there could be no understanding because there be no confidence there could be no confidence because there be mutual fear there be mutual fear because the triple alliance stand in arm against the triple entente what be wrong germany england no the european tradition and system the fact then that those negotiation break down be no more evidence of sinister intention on the part of germany than it be on the part of great britain baron beyen to my mind the most competent and the most impartial as well as one of the best-informed of those who have write on the event lead up to the war say explicitly of the policy of the german chancellor : -- a practicable _ rapprochement _ between he country and great britain be the dream with which m de bethmann-hollweg most willingly soothe himself without the treacherous _ arrière-pensèe _ which the prince von bülow perhaps would have have of finish later on at a opportune moment with the british navy nothing authorize we to believe that there be not a basis of sincerity in the language of m de jagow when he express to sir e goschen in the course of they last painful interview he poignant regret at the crumble of he entire policy and that of the chancellor which have be to make friend with great britain and then through great britain to get closer to france -lrb- 1 -rrb- meantime the consideration i have here lay before the reader in relation to this general question of anglo-german rivalry be i submit all relevant and must be take into fair consideration in form a judgment the fact show clearly that germany be challenge as well as she could the british supremacy at sea that she be determine to become a naval as well as a military power and that she policy be on the face of it a menace to this country just as the creation on we part of a great conscript army would have be take by germany as a menace to she the british government be bind to make counter-preparation i for my own part have never dispute it i have never think and do not now think that while the european anarchy continue a single power can disarm in the face of the other all this be beyond dispute what be disputable and a matter of speculative inference be the further assumption that in pursue this policy germany be make a bid to destroy the british empire the fact can certainly be account for without that assumption i myself think the assumption highly improbable so much i may say but i can not say more possibly some day we may be able to check conjecture by fact until then argument must be inconclusive this question of the naval rivalry between germany and great britain be however part of the general question of militarism and it may be urge that while during the last fifteen year the british government have show itself favourable to project of arbitration and of limitation of armament the german government have consistently oppose they there be much truth in this and it be a good illustration of what i hold to be indisputable that the militaristic view of international politics be much more deeply root in germany than in great britain it be worth while however to remind ourselves a little in detail what the fact be since they be often misrepresent or exaggerate the question of international arbitration be bring forward at the first hague conference in 1899 -lrb- 2 -rrb- from the begin it be recognize on all side that it would be idle to propose general compulsory arbitration for all subject no power would have agree to it not great britain or america any more than germany on the other hand project for create a arbitration tribunal to which nation willing to use it should have recourse be bring forward by both the british and the american representative from the begin however it become clear that count münster the head of the german delegation be oppose to any scheme for encouraging arbitration he do not say that he would oppose a moderate plan of voluntary arbitration but he insist that arbitration must be injurious to germany that germany be prepare for war as no other country be or can be that she can mobilize she army in ten day and that neither france russium nor any other power can do this arbitration he say would simply give rival power time to put themselves in readiness and would therefore be a great disadvantage to germany here be what i should call the militarist view in all its simplicity and purity the obstinate unquestioning belief that war be inevitable and the determination to be ready for it at all cost even at the cost of reject machinery which if adopt might obviate war the passage have often be cite as evidence of the german determination to have war but i have not so often see quote the exactly parallel declaration make by sir john -lrb- now lord -rrb- fisher he say that the navy of great britain be and would remain in a state of complete preparation for war that a vast deal depend on prompt action by the navy and that the truce afford by arbitration proceedings would give other power time which they would not otherwise have to put themselves into complete readiness -lrb- 3 -rrb- so far the militarist and the marinist adopt exactly the same view and we may be sure that if proposal be make after the war to strengthen the machinery for international arbitration there will be opposition in this country of the same kind and base on the same grounds as the opposition in germany we can not on this point condemn count münster without also condemn lord fisher münster 's opposition however be only the beginning as the day go on it become clear that the kaiser himself have become actively oppose to the whole idea of arbitration and be influence austrium and italy and turkey in that sense the delegate of all the other country be in favor of the very mild application of it which be under consideration so however be it note be all the delegate from germany except count münster and even he be by now so far convert that when order be receive from germany definitely to refuse co-operation he postpone the critical sit of the committee and dispatch professor zorn to berlin to lay the whole matter before the chancellor professor zorn be accompany by the american dr holl bear a urgent private letter to prince hohenlohe from mr white the result be that the german attitude be change and the arbitration tribunal be finally establish with the consent and co-operation of the german government i have think it worth while to dwell thus fully upon this episode because it illustrate how misleading it really be to talk of germany and the german attitude there be every kind of german attitude the kaiser be a unstable and changeable character he minister do not necessarily agree with he and he do not always get he way as a consequence of discussion and persuasion the german opposition on this occasion be overcome there be nothing in fact fix and final about it it be the militarist prejudice and the prejudice this time yield to humanity and reason the subject be take up again in the conference of 1907 and once more germany be in opposition the german delegate baron marschall von bieberstein while he be not against compulsory arbitration for certain select topic be oppose to any general treaty it seem clear that it be this attitude of germany that prevent any advance be make beyond the convention of 1899 good reason of course could be give for this attitude but they be the kind of reason that goodwill could have surmount it seem clear that there be goodwill in other government but not in that of germany and the latter lie legitimately under the prejudice result from the position she then take german critic have recognize this as freely as critic of other country i myself feel no desire to minimize the blame that attach to germany but englishman who criticize she policy must always ask themselves whether they would support a british government that should stand for a general treaty of compulsory arbitration on the question of limitation of armament the german government have be equally intransigeant at the conference of 1899 indeed no serious effort be make by any power to achieve the avowed purpose of the meeting and clearly if anything be intend to be do the wrong direction be take from the beginning when the second conference be to meet it be understand that the german government refuse participation if the question of armament be to be discuss and the subject do not appear on the official program nevertheless the british french and american delegate take occasion to express a strong sense of the burden of armament and the urgent need of lessen it the record of the hague conference do then clearly show that the german government be more obstinately sceptical of any advance in the direction of international arbitration or disarmament than that of any other great power and especially of great britain or the united state whether in fact much could or would have be do even in the absence of german opposition may be doubt there would certainly have be in every country very strong opposition to any effective measure and it be only those who would be willing to see they own government make a radical advance in the direction in question who can honestly attack the german government as one of those who believe that peaceable procedure may and can and if civilization be to be preserve must be substitute for war i have a right to express my own condemnation of the german government and i unhesitatingly do so but i do not infer that therefore germany be all the time work up to a aggressive war it be interesting in this connection to note the testimony give by sir edwin pear to the desire for good relation between great britain and germany feel and express later by the same baron marschall von bieberstein who be so unyielding in 1907 on the question of arbitration when he come to take up the post of german ambassador to great britain sir edwin report he as say : -- i have long want to be ambassador to england because as you know for year i have consider it a misfortune to the world that we two country be not really in harmony i consider that i be here as a man with a mission my mission be to bring about a real understanding between we two nation on this sir edwin comment -lrb- 1915 -rrb- : -- i unhesitatingly add that i be convinced he be sincere in what he say of that i have no doubt -lrb- 4 -rrb- it must in fact be recognize that in the present state of international relation the general suspicion and the imminent danger it require more imagination and faith than most public man possess and more idealism than most nation have show themselves to be capable of to take any radical step towards reorganization the armed peace as we have so often have to insist perpetuate itself by the mistrust which it establish every move by one power be take to be a menace to another and be counter by a similar move which in turn produce a reply and it be not easy to say who begin it since the rivalry go so far back into the past what for instance be the real truth about the german french and russian military law of 1913 be any or all of they aggressive or be they all defensive i do not believe it be possible to answer that question look back from the point of view of 1914 it be natural to suppose that germany be already intend war but that do not seem evident at the time to a neutral observer nor even it would seem to the british foreign office thus the count de lalaing belgian minister in london write as follow on February 24 1913 : -- the english press naturally want to throw upon germany the responsibility for the new tension which result from its proposal and which may bring to europe fresh occasion of unrest many journal consider that the french government in declare itself ready to impose three year ' service and in nominating m delcassé to st petersburg have adopt the only attitude worthy of the great republic in presence of a german provocation at the foreign office i find a more just and calm appreciation of the position they see in the reinforcement of the german army less a provocation than the admission of a military situation weaken by event and which it be necessary to strengthen the government of berlin see itself oblige to recognize that it can not count as before on the support of all the force of its austrian ally since the appearance in south-east europe of a new power that of the balkan ally establish on the very flank of the dual empire far from be able to count in case of need on the full support of the government of vienna it be probable that germany will have to support vienna herself in the case of a european war she would have to make head against she enemy on two frontier the russian and the french and diminish perhaps she own force to aid the austrian army in these condition they do not find it surprising that the german empire should have feel it necessary to increase the number of its army corps they add at the foreign office that the government of berlin have frankly explain to the cabinet of paris the precise motive of its action whether this be a complete account of the motive of the german government in introduce the law of 1913 can not be definitely establish but the motive suggest be adequate by themselves to account for the fact on the other hand a part of the cost of the new law be to be defray by a tax on capital and those who believe that by this year germany be definitely wait a occasion to make war have a right to dwell upon that fact i find myself nothing conclusive in these speculation but what be certain and to my mind much more important be the fact that military preparation evoke counter-preparation until at last the strain become unbearable by 1913 it be already terrific the german know well that by January 1917 the french and russian preparation would have reach they culminate point but those preparation be themselves almost unendurable to the french i may recall here the passage already cite from a dispatch of baron guillaume belgian ambassador at pari write in June 1914 -lrb- p 34 -rrb- he suspect as we see that the hand of russium have impose the three year ' service upon france what baron guillaume think plausible must not the german have think plausible must it not have confirm they belief in the inevitability of a war -- that belief which by itself have be enough to produce war after war and in particular the war of 1870 must there not have be strengthen in they mind that particular current among the many that be make for war and must not similar suspicion have be active with similar result on the side of france and russium the armament engender fear the fear in turn engender armament and in that vicious circle turn the policy of europe till this or that power precipitate the conflict much as a man hanging in terror over the edge of a cliff end by lose he nerve and throw himself over that be the real lesson of the rivalry in armament that be certain the rest remain conjecture -lrb- footnote 1 : l'allemagne avant la guerre p 75 and british white paper no 160 -rrb- -lrb-

bismarck 's resignation for the reason already give -lrb- p 42 -rrb- it be not until then that it would have occur to any competent observer to accuse germany of a aggressive policy calculate to disturb the peace of europe a closer _ rapprochement _ with england be indeed the first idea of the kaiser when he take over the rein of power in 1888 and during the ten year that follow british sympathy be actually draw towards germany and alienate from france -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be well know that mr chamberlain favor a alliance with germany -lrb- 2 -rrb- and that when the anglo-japanese treaty be be negotiate the inclusion of germany be seriously consider by lord lansdowne the telegram of the kaiser to kruger in 1895 no doubt leave a unpleasant impression in england and german feeling of course at the time of the boer war run strongly against england but so do feeling in france and america and indeed throughout the civilized world it be certainly the determination of germany to build a great navy that lead to the tension between she and england and finally to the formation of the triple entente as a counterpoise to the triple alliance it be 1900 not 1888 still less 1870 that mark the period at which german policy begin to be a disturbing element in europe during the year that follow the principal storm-centre in international policy be the far and near east the balkan and morocco event in the far east important though they be need not detain we here for they contribution to the present war be remote and indirect except so far as concern the participation of japan of the situation in the other area the tension and its cause and effect we must try to form some clear general idea this can be do even in the absence of that detailed information of what be go on behind the scene for which a historian will have to wait -lrb- footnote 1 : the column of _ the time _ for 1899 be full of attack upon france once more we may cite from the dispatch of the comte de lalaing belgian minister in london date may 24 1907 comment on current or recall earlier event : a certain section of the press know here under the name of the yellow press be in great part responsible for the hostility that exist between the two nation -lrb- england and germany -rrb- what in fact can one expect from a journalist like mr harmsworth now lord northcliffe proprietor of the _ daily mail _ _ daily mirror _ _ daily graphic _ _ daily express _ _ evening news _ and _ weekly dispatch _ who in a interview give to the _ matin _ say ` yes we detest the german cordially they make themselves odious to all europe i will never allow the least thing to be print in my journal which might wind france but i would not let anything be print which might be agreeable to germany ' yet in 1899 this same man be attack the french with the same violence want to boycott the pari exhibition and write : ` the french have succeed in persuade john bull that they be he deadly enemy england long hesitate between france and germany but she have always respect the german character while she have come to despise france a cordial understanding can not exist between england and she nearest neighbor we have have enough of france who have neither courage nor political sense ' lalaing do not give he reference and i can not therefore verify he quotation but they hardly require it the _ volte-face _ of _ the time _ sufficiently well know and only too well know be the way in which the british nation allow its sentiment for other nation to be dictate to it by a handful of cantankerous journalist -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : i may point out to you that at bottom the character the main character of the teuton race differ very slightly indeed from the character of the anglo-saxon -lrb- _ cheer _ -rrb- and the same sentiment which bring we into a close sympathy with the united state of america may be invoke to bring we into closer sympathy with the empire of germany he go on to advocate a new triple alliance between the teutonic race and the two great branch of the anglo-saxon race -lrb- see _ the time _ December 1 1899 -rrb- this be at the beginning of the boer war two year later in October 1901 mr chamberlain be attack germany at edinburgh this date be clearly about the turning-point in british sentiment and policy towards germany -rrb- 13 _ germany and turkey _ let we begin with the near east the situation there when germany begin she enterprise be thus sum up by a french writer -lrb- 1 -rrb- : -- astride across europe and asia the ottoman empire represent for all the nation of the old continent the cosmopolitan center where each have erect by dint of patience and ingenuity a fortress of interest influence and special rights each fortress watch jealously to maintain its particular advantage in face of the rival enemy if one of they obtain a concession or a new favor immediately the commander of the other be see issue from they wall to claim from the grand turk concession or favor which should maintain the exist balance of power or prestige france act as protector of the christian england the vigilant guardian of the route to indium maintain a privileged political and economic position austria-hungary mount guard over the route to salonica russium protect the armenian and slav of the south of europe watch over the fate of the orthodox there be a general understanding among they all tacit or express that none should better its situation at the expense of the other when into this precariously balanced system of conflict interest germany begin to throw she weight the necessary result be a disturbance of equilibrium as early as 1839 german ambition have be direct towards this region by von moltke but it be not till 1873 that the process of penetration begin in that year the enterprise of the anatolian railway be launch by german financier in the succeed year it extend itself as far as konium and in 1899 and 1902 concession be obtain for a extension to bagdad and the persian gulf it be at this point that the question become one of international politics nothing could better illustrate the lamentable character of the european anarchy than the treatment of this matter by the interest and the power affect here have be launch on a grandiose scale a great enterprise of civilization the mesopotamian plain the cradle of civilization and for century the granary of the world be to be redeem by irrigation from the encroachment of the desert order and security be to be restore labor to be set at work and science and power to be devote on a great scale to they only proper purpose the increase of life here be a idea fit to inspire the most generous imagination here for all the idealism of youth and the ambition of maturity for diplomatist engineer administrator agriculturist educationist a opportunity for the work of a lifetime a task to appeal at once to the imagination the intellect and the organize capacity of practical man a scheme in which all nation might be proud to participate and by which europe might show to the backward population that the power she have win over nature be to be use for the benefit of man and that the science and the arm of the west be destine to recreate the life of the east what happen in fact no sooner do the german approach the other nation for financial and political support to they scheme than there be a outcry of jealousy suspicion and rage all the vested interest of the other state be up in arm the propose railway it be say would compete with the trans-siberian with the french railway with the ocean route to indium with the steamboat on the tigris corn in mesopotamium would bring down the price of corn in russium german trade would oust british and french and russian trade nor be that all under cover of a economic enterprise germany be nurse political ambition she be aim at egypt and the suez canal at the control of the persian gulf at the domination of persium at the route to indium be these fear and suspicion justify in the european anarchy who can say certainly the entry of a new economic competitor the exploitation of new area the opening out of new trade route must interfere with interest already establish that must always be so in a change world but no one would seriously maintain that that be a reason for abandon new enterprise but it be urge in fact germany will take the opportunity to squeeze out the trade of other nation and to constitute a german monopoly germany it be true be ready to give guarantee of the open door but then what be the value of these guarantee she assert that she enterprise be economic and have no ulterior political gain but who would believe she be not german jingo already rejoice at the near approach of german army to the egyptian frontier in the european anarchy all these fear suspicion and rivalry be inevitable but the british government at least be not carry away by they they be willing that british capital should co-operate on condition that the enterprise should be under international control they negotiate for term which would give equal control to germany england and france they fail to get these term why have not be make public but lord cranborne then under-secretary of state say in the house of common that the outcry which be make in this matter -- i think it a very ill-informed outcry -- make it exceedingly difficult for we to get the term we require -lrb- 2 -rrb- and sir clinton dawkin write in a letter to herr gwinner the chief of the deutsche bank : the fact be that the business have become involve in politics here and have be sacrifice to the very violent and bitter feeling against germany exhibit by the majority of newspaper and share in by a large number of people -lrb- 3 -rrb- british co-operation therefore fail as french and russian have fail the german however persevere with they enterprise now a purely german one and ultimately with success they difference with russium be arrange by a agreement about the turko-persian railway sign in 1911 a agreement with france with regard to the railway of asiatic turkey be sign in February 1914 and one with england -lrb- secure we interest on the persian gulf -rrb- in June of the same year thus just before the war break out this thorny question have in fact be settle to the satisfaction of all the power concern and on this two comment may be make first that the long friction the press campaign the rivalry of economic and political interest have contribute largely to the european tension secondly that in spite of that the question do get settle and by diplomatic means on this subject at any rate war be not inevitable further it seem clear that the british government so far from hemming-in germany in this matter be ready from the first to accept if not to welcome she enterprise subject to they quite legitimate and necessary preoccupation with they position on the persian gulf it be the british press and what lay behind it that prevent the co-operation of british capital meantime the economic penetration of asia minor by germany have be accompany by a political penetration at constantinople already as early as 1898 the kaiser have announce at damascus that the three hundred million of mussulman who live scatter over the globe may be assure that the german emperor will be at all time they friend this speech make immediately after the armenian massacre have be very properly reprobate by all who be revolt at such atrocity but the indignation of englishman must be temper by shame when they remember that it be they own minister still the idol of half the nation who reinstate turkey after the earlier massacre in bulgarium and put back the inhabitant of macedonium for another generation under the murderous oppression of the turk the importance of the speech in the history of europe be that it signal the advent of german influence in the near east that influence be strengthen on the bosphorus after the turkish revolution of 1908 in spite of the original anglophil bias of the young turk and as some critic maintain in consequence of the blundering of the british representative the mission of von der goltz in 1908 and that of liman von sander in 1914 put the turkish army under german command and by the outbreak of the war german influence be predominant in constantinople this political influence be no doubt use and intend to be use to further german economic scheme germany in fact have come in to play the same game as the other power and have play it with more skill and determination she be of course here as elsewhere a new and disturbing force in a system of force which already have difficulty in maintain a precarious equilibrium but to be a new and disturbing force be not to commit a crime once more the real culprit be not germany nor any other power the real culprit be the european anarchy -lrb- footnote 1 : pierre albin d'agadir à serajevo

question this be too ancient and too complicate to be even summarize here but we must remind ourselves of the main situation primarily the balkan question be or rather be one between subject christian population and the turk but it have be complicate not only by the quarrel of the subject population among themselves but by the rival ambition and claim of russium and austria the interest of russium in the balkan be partly one of racial sympathy partly one of territorial ambition for the road to constantinople lie through rumanium and bulgarium it be this territorial ambition of russium that have give occasion in the past to the intervention of the western power for until recently it be a fix principle both of french and british policy to keep russium out of the mediterranean hence the crimean war and hence the disastrous intervention of disraelus after the treaty of san stefano in 1878 -- a intervention which perpetuate for year the balkan hell the interest of austrium in the peninsula depend primarily on the fact that the austrian empire contain a large slav population desire its independence and that this national ambition of the austrian slav find in the independent kingdom of serbium its natural center of attraction the determination of austrium to retain she slav as unwilling citizen of she empire bring she also into conflict with russium so far as russium be the protector of the slav the situation and the danger with which it be pregnant may be realize by a englishman if he will suppose st george 's channel and the atlantic to be annihilate and ireland to touch by a land frontier on the one side great britain on the other the united state the friction and even the warfare which might have arise between these two great power from the plot of american fenian may readily be imagine something of that kind be the situation of austrium in relation to serbium and she protector russium further austrium fear the occupation by any slav state of any port on the coast line of the adriatic and herself desire a port on the aegean add to this the recent german dream of the route from berlin to bagdad and the european importance of what would otherwise be local dispute among the balkan state become apparent during the period we be now consider the balkan factor first come into prominence with the annexation by austrium of bosnium and herzegovina in 1908 those province it will be remember be hand over to austrian protection at the congress of berlin in 1878 austrium go in and police the country much as england go in and police egypt and from the material point of view with similarly successful result but like england in egypt austrium be not sovereign there formal sovereignty still rest with the turk in 1909 during the turkish revolution austrium take the opportunity to throw off that nominal suzerainty russium protest austrium mobilize against serbium and montenegro and war seem imminent but the dramatic intervention of germany in shine armor on the side of she ally result in a diplomatic victory for the central power austria gain she point and war for the moment be avoid but such diplomatic victory be dangerous russium do not forget and the event of 1909 be a operative cause in the catastrophe of 1914 in act as she do in this matter austria-hungary defy the public law of europe and germany support she in do so the motive of germany in take this action be thus describe and probably with truth by baron beyen : she could not allow the solidity of the triple alliance to be shake : she have a debt of gratitude to pay to she ally who have support she at the congress of algecira finally she believe herself to be the object of a attempt at encirclement by france england and russium and be anxious to show that the gesture of put she hand to the sword be enough to dispel the illusion of she adversary -lrb- 1 -rrb- these be the kind of reason that all power consider adequate where what they conceive to be they interest be involve from any higher more international point of view they be no reason at all but in such a matter no power be in a position to throw the first stone the whole episode be a classical example for the normal working of the european anarchy austria-hungary be primarily to blame but germany who support she must take she share the other power of europe acquiesce for the sake of peace and they could probably do no better there will never be any guarantee for the public law of europe until there be a public tribunal and a public force to see that its decision be carry out the next event of importance in this region be the two balkan war we need not here go into the cause and result of these except so far as to note that once more the rivalry of russium and austrium play a disastrous part it be the determination of austrium not to give serbium access to the adriatic that lead serbium to retain territory assign by treaty to bulgarium and so precipitate the second balkan war for that war be due to the indignation cause in bulgarium by the breach of faith and be say to have be directly prompt by austrium the bad part play by austrium throughout this crisis be indisputable but it must be observe that by general admission germany throughout work hand in hand with sir edward gray to keep the peace of europe which indeed otherwise could not have be keep and nothing illustrate this better than that episode of 1913 which be sometimes take to throw discredit upon germany the episode be thus describe by the italian minister giolittus : on the 9th of August 1913 about a year before the war break out i be then absent from rome receive from my colleague san giuliano the follow telegram : ` austrium have communicate to we and to germany she intention to act against serbium and define such action as defensive hope to apply the _ casus foederi _ of the triple alliance which i consider inapplicable i intend to join force with germany to prevent any such action by austrium but it will be necessary to say clearly that we do not consider such eventual action as defensive and therefore do not believe that the _ casus foederi _ exist please telegraph to rome if you approve ' i reply that ` if austrium intervene against serbium it be evident that the _ casus foederi _ do not arise it be a action that she undertake on she own account since there be no question of defense as no one think of attack she it be necessary to make a declaration in this sense to austria in the most formal way and it be to be wish that german action may dissuade austrium from she most perilous adventure ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- now this statement show upon the face of it two thing one that austrium be prepare by attack serbium to unchain a european war the other that the italian minister join with germany to dissuade she they be successful austrium abandon she project and war be avoid the episode be as discreditable as you like to austrium but on the face of it how do it discredit germany more of course may lie behind but no evidence have be produce so far as i be aware to show that the austrian project be approve or support by she ally the treaty of bucharest which conclude the second balkan war leave all the party concerned dissatisfied but in particular it leave the situation between austrium and serbium and between austrium and russium more strained than ever it be this situation that be the proximate cause of the present war for as we have see a quarrel between austrium and russium over the balkan must give the system of alliance unchain a european war for produce that situation austria-hungary be mainly responsible the part play by germany be secondary and throughout the balkan war german diplomacy be certainly work with england for peace the diplomacy of the wilhelmstrasse say baron beyen apply itself above all to calm the exasperation and the desire for intervention at the ballplatz the cabinet of berlin do not follow that of vienna in its tortuous policy of intrigue at sofium and bucharest as m zimmermann say to I at the time the imperial government contented itself with maintain its neutrality in relation to the balkan abstain from any intervention beyond advice in the fury of they quarrel there be no reason to doubt the sincerity of this statement -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : l'allemagne avant la guerre p 240 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it be characteristic of the way history be write in time of war that m yve guyot cite giolittus 's statement omit the reference to germany _ see _ les cause et les consequence de la guerre p 101 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : l'allemagne avant la guerre pp 248 262 -rrb- 15 _ morocco _ let we turn now to the other storm-centre morocco the salient feature here be first the treaty of 1880 to which all the great power include of course germany be party and which guarantee to the signatory most-favoured-nation treatment secondly the interest of great britain to prevent a strong power from establish itself opposite gibraltar and threatening british control over the strait thirdly the interest of france to annex morocco and knit it up with the north african empire fourthly the new colonial and trading interest of germany which as she have formally announce could not leave she indifferent to any new disposition of influence or territory in undeveloped country for many year french ambition in morocco have be hold in check by the british desire to maintain the _ status quo _ but the anglo-french entente of 1904 give france a free hand there in return for the abandonment of french opposition to the british position in egypt the anglo-french treaty of 1904 affirm in the clause make public the independence and integrity of morocco but there be secret clause look to its partition by these the british interest in the strait be guarantee by a arrangement which give to spain the reversion of the coast opposite gibraltar and a strip on the north-west coast while leave the rest of the country to fall to france germany be not consult while these arrangement be be make and the secret clause of the treaty be of course not communicate to she but it seem reasonable to suppose that they become know to or at least be suspect by the german government shortly after they be adopt -lrb- 1 -rrb- and probably it be this that lead to the dramatic intervention of the kaiser at tangier -lrb- 2 -rrb- when he announce that the independence of morocco be under german protection the result be the conference of algecira at which the independence and integrity of morocco be once more affirm -lrb- the clause look to its partition be still keep secret by the three power privy to they -rrb- and equal commercial facility be guarantee to all the power germany thereby obtain what she most want what she have a right to by the treaty of 1880 and what otherwise might have be threaten by french occupation -- the maintenance of the open door but the french enterprise be not abandon dispute with the native such as always occur or be manufacture in these case lead to fresh military intervention at the same time it be difficult to secure the practical application of the principle of equal commercial opportunity a agreement of 1909 between france and germany whereby both power be to share equally in contract for public work be find in practice not to work the german press for its application to the new railway project in morocco the french delay temporize and postpone decision -lrb- 3 -rrb- meantime they be strengthen they position in morocco the matter be bring to a head by the expedition to fez initiate on the plea of danger to the european resident at the capital -lrb- a plea which be dispute by the german and by many frenchman -rrb- it clearly herald a definite final occupation of the country the patience of the german be exhaust and the kaiser make the coup of agadir there follow the mansion house speech of mr lloyd george and the franco-german agreement of November 1911 whereby germany recognize a french protectorate in morocco in return for concession of territory in the french congo these be the bare fact of the moroccan episode much of course be still unrevealed particularly as to the motive and intention of the power concern do germany for instance intend to seize a share of morocco when she send the _ panther _ to agadir and be that the reason of the vigor of the british intervention possibly but by no means certainly the evidence accessible be conflict if germany have that intention she be frustrate by the solidarity show between france and england and the result be the final and definite absorption of morocco in the french empire with the approval and active support of great britain germany be compensate by the cession of part of the french congo once more a difficult question have be settle by diplomacy but only after it have twice bring europe to the verge of war and in such a way as to leave behind the bitterest feeling of anger and mistrust in all the party concern the fact thus briefly summarize here may be study more at length with the relevant document in mr morel 's book morocco in diplomacy the reader will form he own opinion on the part play by the various power but i do not believe that any instruct and impartial student will accept what appear to be the current english view that the action of germany in this episode be a piece of sheer aggression without excuse and that the other power be act throughout justly honestly and straightforwardly the morocco crisis as we have already see produce in germany a painful impression and strengthen there the element make for war thus baron beyen write : -- the moroccan conflict make many german hitherto pacific regard another war as a necessary evil -lrb- 4 -rrb- and again : -- the pacific settlement of the conflict of 1911 give a violent impulse to the war party in germany to the propaganda of the league of defense and the navy league and a greater force to they demand to they dream of hegemony and domination the desire for revenge against france now mingle its bitterness a diplomatic success secure in a underground struggle signify nothing war war in the open that alone in the eye of this rancorous tribe could settle definitely the moroccan question by incorporate morocco and all french africa in the colonial empire they hope to create on the shore of the mediterranean and in the heart of the black continent -lrb- 5 -rrb- this we may take to be a correct description of the attitude of the pangerman but there be no evidence that it be that of the nation we have see also that baron beyen ' impression of the attitude of the german people even after the moroccan affair be of a general desire for peace -lrb- 6 -rrb- the crisis have be severe but it have be tide over and the government seem to have make renew effort to come into friendly relation in this connection the follow dispatch of baron beyen -lrb- June 1912 -rrb- be worth quote : -- after the death of edward vii the kaiser as well as the crown prince when they return from england where they have be courteously receive be persuade that the coldness in the relation of the precede year be go to yield to a cordial intimacy between the two court and that the cause of the misunderstanding between the two people would vanish with the past he disillusionment therefore be cruel when he see the cabinet of london range itself last year on the side of france but the kaiser be obstinate and have not abandon the hope of reconquere the confidence of the english -lrb- 7 -rrb- this dispatch be so far bear out by the fact that in the year succeed the moroccan crisis a serious attempt be make to improve anglo-german relation and there be no reason to doubt that on both side there be a genuine desire for a understanding how that understanding fail have already be indicate -lrb- 8 -rrb- but even that failure do not ruin the relation between the two power in the balkan crisis as we have see and as be admit on both side england and germany work together for peace and the fact that a european conflagration be then avoid in spite of the tension between russium and austrium be a strong proof that the effort of sir edward gray be sincerely and effectively second by germany -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see morocco in diplomacy chap xvi a dispatch write by m leghait the belgian minister in pari on may 7 1905 show that rumor be busy on the subject the secret clause of the franco-spanish treaty be know to he and these provide for a eventual partition of morocco between france and spain he doubt whether there be secret clause in the anglo-french treaty -- but it be suppose that there be a certain tacit understanding by which england would leave france sufficient liberty of action in morocco under the reserve of the secret clause of the franco-spanish arrangement clause if not impose yet at least strongly support by the london cabinet we know of course now that the arrangement for the partition be actually embody in secret clause in the anglo-french treaty -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : accord to m yve guyot when the kaiser be actually on he way to tangier he telegraph from lisbon to prince bülow abandon the project prince bülow telegraph back insist and the kaiser yield -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : see bourdon l'enigme allemande chap ii this account by a frenchman will not be suspect of anti-french or pro-german bias and it be base on french official record -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : l'allemagne avant la guerre p 216 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : l'allemagne avant la guerre p 235 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : see above p 63 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : this view be reaffirm by baron beyen in l'allemagne avant la guerre p 29 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : see above p 79 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : above p 111 -rrb- 16 _ the last year _ we have reach then the year 1913 and the end of the balkan war without discover in german policy any clear sign of a determination to produce a european war we have find all the power germany include contend for territory and trade at the risk of the peace of europe we have find germany successfully develop she interest in turkey we have find england annex the south african republic france morocco italy tripoli we have find all the power steal in china and in all these transaction we have find they continually on the point of be at one another 's throat nevertheless some last instinct of self-preservation have enable they so far to pull up in time the crisis have be overcome without a war yet they have of course produce they effect some statesman probably like sir edward gray have have they passion for peace confirm by the danger encounter in other no doubt a opposite effect have be produce and very likely by 1913 there be prominent man in europe convinced that war must come and manoeuvre only that it should come at the time and occasion most favourable to they country that accord to m cambon be now the attitude of the german emperor m cambon basis this view on a alleged conversation between the kaiser and the king of the belgian -lrb- 1 -rrb- the conversation have be deny by the german official organ but that of course be no proof that it do not take place and there be nothing improbable in what m cambon narrate the conversation be suppose to have occur in November 1913 at a time when as we have see -lrb- 2 -rrb- there be a distinct outburst in france of anti-german chauvinism and when the arm and counter-arming of that year have exasperate opinion to a extreme degree the kaiser be report to have say that war between germany and france be inevitable if he do it be clear from the context that he say it in the belief that french chauvinism would produce war for the king of the belgian in reply be state to have say that it be a travesty of the french government to interpret it in that sense and to let oneself be mislead as to the sentiment of the french nation by the ebullition of a few irresponsible spirit or the intrigue of unscrupulous agitator it should be observe also that this suppose attitude on the part of the kaiser be note as a change and that he be credit with have previously stand for peace against the design of the german jingo he personal influence say the dispatch have be exert on many critical occasion in support of peace the fact of a change of mind in the kaiser be accept also by baron beyen whatever may be the truth in this matter neither the german nor the french nor we own government can then have abandon the effort at peaceable settlement for in fact by the summer of 1914 agreement have be make between the great power which settle for the time be the question immediately outstanding it be understand that a new partition of african territory have be arrange to meet the claim and interest of germany france and england alike the question of the bagdad railway have be settle and everything seem to favor the maintenance of peace when suddenly the murder of the archduke spring upon a dismayed europe the crisis that be at last to prove fatal the event that follow so far as they can be ascertain from publish document have be so fully discuss that it would be superfluous for I to go over the ground again in all its detail but i will indicate briefly what appear to I to be the main point of importance in fix the responsibility for what occur first the german view that england be responsible for the war because she do not prevent russium from enter upon it i regard as childish if it be not simply sophistical the german power deliberately take a action which the whole past history of europe show must almost certainly lead to a european war and they then turn round upon sir edward gray and put the blame on he because he do not succeed in prevent the consequence of they own action he might have keep russium out who know whether he might what we do know be that it be austrium and germany who bring she in the german view be really only intelligible upon the assumption that germany have a right to do what she please and that the power that stand in she way be by definition peacebreaker it be this extraordinary attitude that have be one of the factor for make war in europe secondly i be not and have not be one of the critic of sir edward gray it be indeed possible as it be always possible after the event to suggest that some other course might have be more successful in avoid war but that be conjecture i at any rate be convince as i believe every one outside germany be convince that sir edward gray throughout the negotiation have one object only -- to avoid if he could the catastrophe of war thirdly the part of austria-hungary be perfectly clear she be determine now as in 1913 to have out she quarrel with serbium at the risk of a european war she guilt be clear and definite and it be only the fact that we be not directly fight she with british troops that have prevent british opinion from fasten upon it as the main occasion of the war but this time quite clearly austrium be back by germany why this change in german policy so far as the kaiser himself be concern there can be little doubt that a main cause be the horror he feel at the assassination of the archduke the absurd system of autocracy give to the emotional reaction of a individual a preposterous weight in determine world-policy and the almost insane feeling of the kaiser about the sanctity of crown head be no doubt a main reason why germany back austrium in send she ultimatum to serbium accord to baron beyen on hear the news of the murder of the archduke the kaiser change color and exclaim : all the effort of my life for twenty-five year must be begin over again -lrb- 3 -rrb- a tragic cry which indicate what i personally believe to be the case that it have be the constant effort of the kaiser to keep the peace in europe and that he foresee now that he would no longer be able to resist war so far however it would only be the war between austrium and serbium that the kaiser would be prepare to sanction he might hope to avoid the european war and in fact there be good reason to suppose that both he and the german foreign office do cherish that hope or delusion they have bluff russium off in 1908 they have the dangerous idea that they might bluff she off again in this connection baron beyen record a conversation with he colleague m bollatus the italian ambassador at berlin in which the latter take the view that at vienna as at berlin they be persuade that russium in spite of the official assurance exchange quite recently between the tsar and m poincaré as to the complete preparation of the army of the two ally be not in a position to sustain a european war and would not dare to plunge into so perilous a adventure baron beyen continue : -- at berlin the opinion that russium be unable to face a european war prevail not only in the official world and in society but among all the manufacturer who specialize in the construction of armament m krupp the best qualify among they to express a opinion announce on the 28th July at a table next mine at the hotel bristol that the russian artillery be neither good nor complete while that of the german army have never be of such superior quality it would be folly on the part of russium the great maker of gun conclude to dare to make war on germany and austrium in these condition -lrb- 4 -rrb- but while the attitude of the german foreign office and -lrb- as i be incline to suppose -rrb- of the kaiser may have be that which i have just suggest there be other and more important factor to be consider it appear almost certain that at some point in the crisis the control of the situation be take out of the hand of the civilian by the military the position of the military be not difficult to understand they believe as professional soldier usually do in the inevitability of war and they have of course a professional interest in make war they attitude may be illustrate from a statement attribute by m bourdon to prince lichnowsky in 1912 -lrb- 5 -rrb- : the soldier think about war it be they business and they duty they tell we that the german army be in good order that the russian army have not complete its organization that it would be a good moment but for twenty year they have be say the same thing the passage be significant it show we exactly what it be we have to dread in militarism the danger in a military state be always that when a crisis come the soldier will get control as they seem to have do on this occasion from they point of view there be good reason they know that france and russium on a common understanding be make enormous military preparation they know that these preparation would mature by the beginning of 1917 they know that germany would fight then at a less advantage they believe she would then have to fight and they say better fight now the follow dispatch of baron beyen date July 26th may probably be take as fairly represent they attitude : -- to justify these conclusion i must remind you of the opinion which prevail in the german general staff that war with france and russium be unavoidable and near a _ opinion which the emperor have be induce to share _ such a war ardently desire by the military and pangerman party might be undertake to-day as this party think in circumstance which be extremely favourable to germany and which probably will not again present themselves for some time germany have finish the strengthening of she army which be decree by the law of 1912 and on the other hand she feel that she can not carry on indefinitely a race in armament with russium and france which would end by she ruin the wehrbeitrag have be a disappointment for the imperial government to whom it have demonstrate the limit of the national wealth russium have make the mistake of make a display of she strength before have finish she military reorganization that strength will not be formidable for several year : at the present moment it lack the railway line necessary for its deployment as to france m charle humbert have reveal she deficiency in gun of large calibre but apparently it be this arm that will decide the fate of battle for the rest england which during the last two year germany have be try not without some success to detach from france and russium be paralyse by internal dissension and she irish quarrel -lrb- 6 -rrb- it will be notice that baron beyen suppose the kaiser to have be in the hand of the soldier as early as July 26th on the other hand as late as August 5th beyen believe that the german foreign office have be work throughout for peace describe a interview he have have on that day with herr zimmermann he write : -- from this interview i bring away the impression that herr zimmermann speak to I with he customary sincerity and that the department for foreign affair since the opening of the austro-serbian conflict have be on the side of a peaceful solution and that it be not due to it that its view and counsel have not prevail a superior power intervene to precipitate the march of event it be the ultimatum from germany to russium send to st petersburg at the very moment when the vienna cabinet be show itself more disposed to conciliation which let loose the war -lrb- 7 -rrb- why be that ultimatum send accord to the german apologist it be send because russium have mobilize on the german frontier at the critical moment and so make war inevitable there be indeed no doubt that the tension be enormously increase throughout the critical day by mobilization and rumor of mobilization the danger be clearly point out as early as July 26th in a dispatch of the austrian ambassador at petrograd to he government : -- as the result of report about measure take for mobilization of russian troops count pourtalès -lrb- german ambassador at petrograd -rrb- have call the russian minister 's attention in the most serious manner to the fact that nowadays measure of mobilization would be a highly dangerous form of diplomatic pressure for in that event the purely military consideration of the question by the general staff would find expression and if that button be once touch in germany the situation would get out of control -lrb- 8 -rrb- on the other hand it must be remember that in 1909 austrium have mobilize against serbium and montenegro -lrb- 9 -rrb- and in 1912-13 russium and austrium have mobilize against one another without war ensue in either case moreover in view of the slowness of russian mobilization it be difficult to believe that a day or two would make the difference between security and ruin to germany however it be possible that the kaiser be so advise by he soldier and genuinely believe the country to be in danger we do not definitely know what we do know be that it be the german ultimatum that precipitate the war we be inform however by baron beyen that even at the last moment the german foreign office make one more effort for peace : -- as no reply have be receive from st petersburg by noon the next day -lrb- after the dispatch of the german ultimatum -rrb- mm de jagow and zimmermann -lrb- i have it from the latter -rrb- hurry to the chancellor and the kaiser to prevent the issue of the order for general mobilization and to persuade he majesty to wait till the follow day it be the last effort of they die pacifism or the last awakening of they conscience they effort be break against the irreducible obstinacy of the minister of war and the army chief who represent to the kaiser the disastrous consequence of a delay of twenty-four hour -lrb- 10 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : french yellow book no 6 in l'allemagne avant la guerre -lrb- p 24 -rrb- baron beyen state that this conversation be hold at potsdam on November 5th or 6th the kaiser say that war between germany and france be inevitable and

the moral _ it will be see from this brief account that so far as the publish evidence go i agree with the general view outside germany that the responsibility for the war at the last moment rest with the power of central europe the austrian ultimatum to serbium which there can be no reasonable doubt be know to and approve by the german government be the first crime and it be hardly palliate by the hope which no well-informed man ought to have entertain that russium could be keep out and the war limit to austria and serbia the second crime be the german ultimatum to russium and to france i have no desire whatever to explain away or palliate these clear fact but it be not my object in write this pamphlet to reiterate a judgment which must already be that of all my reader what i have want to do be to set the tragic event of those few day of diplomacy in they proper place in the whole complex of international politics and what i do dispute with full conviction be the view which seem to be almost universally hold in england that germany have be pursue for year past a policy of war while all the other power have be pursue a policy of peace the war finally provoke by germany be i be convinced conceive as a preventive war and that mean that it be due to the belief that if germany do not fight then she would be compel to fight at a great disadvantage later i have write in vain if i have not convince the reader that the european anarchy inevitably provoke that state of mind in the power and that they all live constantly under the threat of war to understand the action of those who have power in germany during the critical day it be necessary to bear in mind all that i have bring into relief in the precede page : the general situation which group the power of the entente against those of the triple alliance the armament and counter-armament the colonial and economic rivalry the racial and national problem in south-east europe and the long series of previous crisis in each case tide over but leave behind every one of they a legacy of fresh mistrust and fear which make every new crisis worse than the one before i do not palliate the responsibility of germany for the outbreak of war but that responsibility be embed in and condition by a responsibility deeper and more general -- the responsibility of all the power alike for the european anarchy if i have convince the reader of this he will i think feel no difficulty in follow I to a further conclusion since the cause of this war and of all war lie so deep in the whole international system they can not be permanently remove by the punishment or the crush or any other drastic treatment of any power let that power be as guilty as you please whatever be the issue of this war one thing be certain : it will bring no lasting peace to europe unless it bring a radical change both in the spirit and in the organization of international politics what that change must be may be deduce from the foregoing discussion of the cause of the war the war arise from the rivalry of state in the pursuit of power and wealth this be universally admit whatever be the diversity of opinion that prevail in the different country concerned nobody pretend that the war arise out of any need of civilization out of any generous impulse or noble ambition it arise accord to the popular view in england solely and exclusively out of the ambition of germany to seize territory and power it arise accord to the popular german view out of the ambition of england to attack and destroy the rise power and wealth of germany thus to each set of belligerent the war appear as one force upon they by sheer wickedness and from neither point of view have it any kind of moral justification these view it be true be both too simple for the fact but the account give in the precede page imperfect as it be show clearly what further knowledge will only make more explicit that the war proceed out of rivalry for empire between all the great power in every part of the world the contention between france and germany for the control of morocco the contention between russium and austrium for the control of the balkan the contention between germany and the other power for the control of turkey -- these be the cause of the war and this contention for control be prompt at once by the desire for power and the desire for wealth in practice the two motive be find conjoin but to different mind they appeal in different proportion there be such a thing as the love of power for its own sake it be know in individual and it be know in state and it be the most disastrous if not the most evil of the human passion the modern german philosophy of the state turn almost exclusively upon this idea and here as elsewhere by give to a passion a intellectual form the german have magnify its force and enhance its monstrosity but the passion itself be not peculiar to german nor be it only they to whom it be and have be a motive of state power have be the fetish of king and emperor from the beginning of political history and it remain to be see whether it will not continue to inspire democracy the passion for empire ruin the athenian democracy no less than the spartan or the venetian oligarchy or the spain of philip ii or the france of the monarchy and the empire but it still make its appeal to the romantic imagination its intoxication have lie behind this war and it will prompt many other if it survive when the war be over either in the defeat or the conquer nation it be not only the jingoism of germany that europe have to fear it be the jingoism that success may make supreme in any country that may be victorious but while power may be seek for its own sake it be commonly seek by modern state as a means to wealth it be the pursuit of market and concession and outlet for capital that lie behind the colonial policy that lead to war state compete for the right to exploit the weak and in this competition government be prompt or control by financial interest the british go to egypt for the sake of the bondholder the french to morocco for the sake of its mineral and wealth in the near east and the far it be commerce concession loan that have lead to the rivalry of the power to war after war to punitive expedition and -- irony of irony -- to indemnity exact as a new and special form of robbery from people who rise in the endeavor to defend themselves against robbery the power combine for a moment to suppress the common victim the next they be at one another 's throat over the spoil that really be the simple fact about the quarrel of state over colonial and commercial policy so long as the exploitation of undeveloped country be direct by company have no object in view except dividend so long as financier prompt the policy of government so long as military expedition lead up to annexation be undertake behind the back of the public for reason that can not be avow so long will the nation end with war where they have begin by theft and so long will thousand and million of innocent and generous life the best of europe be throw away to no purpose because in the dark sinister interest have be risk the peace of the world for the sake of money in they pocket it be these tremendous underlying fact and tendency that suggest the true moral of this war it be these that have to be alter if we be to avoid future war on a scale as great 18 _ the settlement _ and now with all this in we mind let we turn to consider the vexed question of the settlement after the war there lie before the western world the greatest of all choice the choice between destruction and salvation but that choice do not depend merely on the issue of the war it depend upon what be do or leave undo by the co-operation of all when the war do at last stop two conception of the future be contend in all nation one be the old bad one that which have preside hitherto at every peace and prepared every new war it assume that the object of war be solely to win victory and the object of victory solely to acquire more power and territory on this view if the german win they be to annex territory east and west : belgium and half france say the more violent the baltic province of russium strategic point of advantage say the more moderate on the other hand if the ally win the ally be to divide the german colony the french be to regain alsace-lorraine and as the jingo add they be to take the whole of the german province on the left bank of the rhine and even territory beyond it the italian be to have not only italia irredenta but hundred of thousand of reluctant slav in dalmatium the russian constantinople and perhaps posen and galicium further such money indemnity be to be take as it may prove possible to exact from a already ruin foe trade and commerce with the enemy be to be discourage or prohibit and above all a bitter and unforgiving hatred be to reign for ever between the victor and the vanquish this be the kind of view of the settlement of europe that be constantly appear in the article and correspondence of the press of all country minister be not as careful as they should be to repudiate it the nationalist and imperialist clique of all nation endorse it it be one could almost fear for something like this that the people be be keep at war and the very existence of civilization jeopardize now whether anything of this kind really can be achieve by the war whether there be the least probability that either group of power can win such a victory as would make the program on either side a reality i will not here discuss the reader will have he own opinion what i be concern with be the effect any such solution would have upon the future of europe those who desire such a close may be divide into two class the one frankly believe in war in domination and in power it accept as inevitable and welcome as desirable the perpetual armed conflict of nation for territory and trade it do not believe in and it do not want a durable peace it hold that all peace be must be and ought to be a precarious and regrettable interval between war i do not discuss this view those who hold it be not accessible to argument and can only be meet by action there be other however who do think war a evil who do want a durable peace but who genuinely believe that the way indicate be the best way to achieve it with they it be permit to discuss and it should be possible to do so without bitterness or rage on either side for as to the end there be agreement the difference of opinion be as to the mean the position take be this : the enemy deliberately make this war of aggression against we without provocation in order to destroy we if it have not be for this wickedness there would have be no war the enemy therefore must be punish and he punishment must make he permanently impotent to repeat the offence that have be do europe will have durable peace for there will be no one leave able to break it who will also want to break it now i believe all this to be demonstrably a miscalculation it be contradict both by we knowledge of the way human nature work and by the evidence of history in the first place war do not arise because only one nation or group of nation be wicked the other be good for the actual outbreak of this war i believe as i have already say that a few powerful individual in austrium and in germany be responsible but the ultimate cause of war lie much deeper in they all state be implicate and the punishment or even the annihilation of any one nation would leave those cause still subsist wipe out germany from the map and if you do nothing else the other nation will be at one another 's throat in the old way for the old cause they would be quarrel if about nothing else about the division of the spoil while nation continue to contend for power while they refuse to substitute law for force there will continue to be war and while they devote the best of they brain and the chief of they resource to armament and military and naval organization each war will become more terrible more destructive and more ruthless than the last this be irrefutable truth i do not believe there be a man or woman able to understand the statement who will deny it in the second place the enemy nation can not in fact be annihilate nor even so far weaken relatively to the rest as to be incapable of recover and put up another fight the notion of divide up germany among the ally or of add france and the british empire to germany be sheerly fantastic there will remain when all be do the defeat nation -- if indeed any nation be defeat they territory can not be permanently occupy by enemy troops they themselves can not be permanently prevent by physical force from build up new armament so long as they want they revenge they will be able sooner or later to take it if evidence of this be want the often-quoted case of prussium after jena will suffice and in the third place the defeat nation so treat will in fact want they revenge there seem to be a curious illusion abroad among the english and they ally that not only be germany guilty of the war but that all german know it in they heart that be guilty they will fully accept punishment bow patiently beneath the yoke and become in future good harmonious member of the european family the illusion be grotesque there be hardly a german who do not believe that the war be make by russium and by england that germany be the innocent victim that all right be on she side and all wrong on that of the ally if indeed she be beat and treat as she punisher desire this belief would be strengthen not weaken in every german heart would abide deep and strong the sense of a iniquitous triumph of what they believe to be wrong over right and of a duty to redress that iniquity outraged national pride would be reinforce by the sense of injustice and the next war the war of revenge would be prepare for not only by every consideration of interest and of passion but by every cogency of righteousness the fact that the german be mistake in they view of the origin of the war have really nothing to do with the case it be not the truth it be what man believe to be the truth that influence they action and i do not think any study of dispatch be go to alter the german view of the fact but it be sometimes urge that the war be make by the german militarist that it be unpopular with the mass of the people and that if germany be utterly defeat the people will rise and depose they ruler become a true democracy and join fraternal hand with the other nation of europe that germany should become a true democracy might indeed be as great a guarantee of peace as it might be that other nation call democratic should really become so in they foreign policy as well as in they domestic affair but what proud nation will accept democracy as a gift from insolent conqueror one thing that the war have do and one of the worst be to make of the kaiser to every german a symbol of they national unity and national force just because we abuse they militarism they affirm and acclaim it just because we attack they govern class they rally round it nothing could be better calculate than this war to strengthen the hold of militarism in germany unless it be the attempt of she enemy to destroy she militarism by force for consider -- in the view we be examine it be propose first to kill the greater part of she combatant next to invade she territory destroy she town and village and exact -lrb- for there be those who demand it -rrb- penalty in kind actual tit for tat for what german have do in belgium it be propose to enter the capital in triumph it be propose to shear away huge piece of german territory and then when all this have be do the conqueror be to turn to the german nation and say : now all this we have do for you good depose you wicked ruler become a democracy shake hand and be a good fellow do it not sound grotesque but really that be what be propose i have speak about british and french proposal for the treatment of germany but all that i have say apply of course equally to german proposal of the same kind for the treatment of the conquer ally that way be no way towards a durable peace if it be reply that a durable peace be not intend or desire i have no more to say if it be reply that punishment for its own sake be more important than civilization and must be perform at all cost -- _ fiat justitium ruat coelum _ -- then once more i have nothing to say i speak to those and to those only who do desire a durable peace and who have the courage and the imagination to believe it to be possible and the determination to work for it and to they i urge that the course i have be discuss can not lead to they goal what can 19 _ the change need _ first a change of outlook we must give up in all nation this habit of dwelling on the unique and peculiar wickedness of the enemy we must recognize that behind the act that lead up to the immediate outbreak of war behind the crime and atrocity to which the war have lead as war always have lead and always will lead -- behind all that lie a great complex of feeling prejudice tradition false theory in which all nation and all individual of all nation be involve most man believe feel or passively accept that power and wealth be the object state ought to pursue that in pursue these object they be bind by no code of right in they relation to one another that law between they be and must be as fragile as a cobweb stretch before the mouth of a cannon that force be the only rule and the only determinant of they difference and that the only real question be when and how the appeal to force may most advantageously be make this philosophy have be express with peculiar frankness and brutality by german but most honest and candid man i believe will agree that that be the way they too have be accustom to think of international affair and if illustration be wanted let they remember the kind of triumphant satisfaction with which the failure of the hague conference to achieve any radical result be generally greet and the contemptuous and almost abhor pity mete out to the people call pacifist well the war have come we see now not only guess what it mean if that experience have not make a deep impression on every man and woman if something like a conversion be not be generally operate then indeed nothing can save mankind from the hell of they own passion and imbecility but if otherwise if that change be go on then the way to deliverance be neither difficult nor obscure it do not lie in the direction of crush anybody it lie in the taking of certain determination and the embodying of they in certain institution first the nation must submit to law and to right in the settlement of they dispute secondly they must reserve force for the coercion of the law-breaker and that imply that they should construct rule to determine who the law-breaker be let he be define as the one who appeal to force instead of appeal to law and right by machinery duly provide for that purpose and the aggressor be immediately under the ban of the civilized world and meet by a overwhelming force to coerce he into order in construct machinery of this kind there be no intellectual difficulty greater than that which have confront every attempt everywhere to substitute order for force the difficulty be moral and lie in the habit passion and will of man but it should not be conclude that if such a moral change could be operate there would be no need for the machinery it would be as reasonable to say that government law-court and police be superfluous since if man be good they would not require they and if they be bad they will not tolerate they whatever new need desire and conviction come up in mankind need embodiment in form before it can become operative and as the separate colony of america could not effectively unite until they have form a constitution so will the state of europe and the world be unable to maintain the peace even though all of they should wish to maintain it unless they will construct some kind of machinery for settle they dispute and organize they common purpose and will back that machinery by force if they will do that they may construct a real and effective counterpoise to aggression from any power in the future if they will not do it they precaution against any one power will be idle for it will be from some other power that the danger will come i put it to the reader at the end of this study which i have make with all the candor and all the honesty at my disposal and which i believe to represent essentially the truth whether or no he agree that the european anarchy be the real cause of european war and if he do whether he be ready for he part to support a serious effort to end it end of project gutenberg 's the european
