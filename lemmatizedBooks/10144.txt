embrace of the plaid gingham which encircle he neck and in whose nose be embody that rare vermilion tint which artist so love to dwell upon -- this be the hon michael ladle brother of the late timothy

choose you partner mildewed age before infantile beauty mother-in-law go in the extremely respectable and highly dignified female last allude to shake she fist at belinda on the sly and say : i 'll take ann brummet the lady who step forward at this summons be greet with a wide stare and every eye-glass be focus she be a remarkable-looking female she be not exactly handsome but there be a sort of a something about she you understand that -- ah -- rivet the gaze of folk generally you see and a fellow -- ah -- catch himself look the second time as you may say -- and ah -- it be not style either for one shoulder be higher than the other and she hair be do up in a bob and she take awful long step and swing she arm as far as they would go each way and she collar look as though she would sleep in it and she wear rubber like a school-ma ` be and you could not say 'twa regularity of feature exactly either for she eye be too limit in circumference and she nose too numerous in diameter and she mouth monopolize too much latitude and she have a hair-mole on one cheek and faint dawning of a moustache on she upper lip but in spite of these trivial eccentricity you feel when you look at she as i say before -- ah -- a sort of -- as it be -- a -- by jove i can not describe it the general impression be that she be a heiress and the comment be numerous how graceful look at that swan-like neck what a perfect form what a dove-like expression do introduce I who be she she be a poor relation of mr ladle 's there i think so what a object force herself into genteel society too the audacity of

by all present and the lady especially regard he as simply a hero for he be one of the great master in the noble art of muscle let I explain at the time of which i write there have be a contest in the university of america between brain and muscle and the latter have conquer brain be account a very good thing in they way but what we want sir be muscle if a man can master he greek and he latin and he theology and he law and such frothy trifle between time well and good but he mus not neglect he muscle and so base-ball club be organize and the long heel challenge the short heel and the lead journal publish card of defiance from the knocker to the hitter together with labor editorial on the same and boat-race and sculling match be set on foot and once a year the student repair with they friend to a city afflict with a lake where pend the contest they organize a reign of terror during which the harmless inhabitant lock themselves in they house and clasp they offspring to they bosom or gaze terror-stricken from a attic-window upon the classical marauder below as they indulge in a _ post-mortem _ examination of a private dwelling or the rare pleasantry of roast a policeman but dare complain for public excitement wax high on the subject of muscle and when the day arrive which be to decide the momentous question the bank of the lake be deck with the beauty and culture of the land and fair hand stake they odds and fair lip become familiar with home-stretch spurt and foul a body of student cross the ocean to win a boat-race and the public press tell we in very large capital what they eat and drink and the exact condition of a boil belong to one of the party but the heart of the nation beat high with hope until the appalling intelligence be flash across the wire that they be defeat it be a cruel blow strong man look at one another in mute agony or speak as if there be a corpse in the next room the press send up a wail that resound through the land a eminent divine pronounce it a national misfortune and the pictorial contain wood-cut of the lament hero be put away as we put away the plaything of a child that have die no wonder that mr jeffry maulboy be look up to and court for he have a medal bestow upon he as a champion paddler and have lose a bet of fifty dollar on the great international contest but he towering ambition remain unsated he realize that he

idiot -- trochu encounter a conundrum pari seventh week of the republic 1870 dear punchinello : -- if america have any bowels of compassion it be fit that they should yearn now this frothy and frenzied republic be at that ebb where national extreme unction must be administer speedily else the sufferer will pass away from the theater of sublunary thing without the benefit of clergy i feel as if i would like to get the whole nation on a toasting-fork before a slow fire and roast it into a realize sense of what the devil be do for it to see bismarck feeding on shrimp with anchovy sauce and drinking champagne while trochu and jule favre fight domestic treason within the wall and the prussian without upon stomach that feebly digest parisian hard tack and gritty _ vin ordinaire _ be enough to make the spirit of liberty lay over the mourner 's bench and perpetrate a perfect niagara of tear when flouren bag the whole government at the hotel de ville the other day my feeling get the better of I and i go for he idiotic frenchman i exclaimed in a voice that must have sound like a echo work its way through a thick upper crust of doughy apple-dumpling idiotic frenchman do you know what you be do have you the feeling of a man or of a mad dog which be it that it be that you should be worry the life out of this croupy infant of liberty as be hardly able to waggle its head bar all hope that it will ever get upon its pin and take its ` constitutional ' like other mortal in distress where be the ghost of mirabeau that it do not come upon you all of a sudden to confiscate the very marrow in you bone and set up a candle factory in spite of the tax on tallow where be lafayette where be reginald de lyle where be robespierre and george francis train where be the duke de montebello or the count of monte christo that they do not hang round you like aggravate wasp and sting you into that appreciation of the fitness of thing whereby some razor may be slip across you wizzen and pari follow you corse to the _ pére la chaise _ with joy and gladness why in the name of all the torment -- i stop for want of breath in time to see that the crowd pay no attention and that to say the least of it i have be make a ass of myself not that there be no wisdom in my word but these frenchman be the most dog gorn insensible people to right up and down plain everyday gospel truth that providence ever permit to play checkers with destiny i have no hankering for a closer interview with flouren he and i could never have get at a basis peace there be no harmony in the method of we mental jointing i would have give stamp to have get he head under a quiet village pump but i would not have undertake to reason with he for all the gold of the credit mobilier there be another creamy idiot try he level best to smash thing here look at he jule valle a patriot by name and a pat-rioter by nature with enough hair on he head to stuff a gabion and not sense enough beneath it to accommodate a well-informed parrot these fellow call favre a milk-sop and the trouble of it be that fayre occasionally give they reason for do so stroll through the _ passage des princes _ this morning i see trochu and accost he general i say probably with some trifling vindictiveness in my heart be not there a grease vat in paris sufficiently large to boil down monsieur flouren and he friend he might have think that i be a little overheate or that some of the _ grand cafe _ tangle-foot have get into my head but he look undeniably indicate that he do not regard this as a unusually _ cool _ proposal he simply say oh my in tolerably good english and then i continue : you mistake I general i be not bear in new zealand there be nothing of the cannibal about I and i trust the supply of provision in paris will not compel we to eat each other just yet but if there be no satisfaction for the stomach in put a tun or two of boil fat around gustave flouren can you think of anything better calculate to produce serenity in the public mind he do not answer I then it could not be expect perhaps but i be still of the impression that this conundrum be gradually work towards a solution in the brain of the commander-in-chief i hope it do not lay heavily there i would not do anything to distress he if goldwin smith be expound political economy to he in one ear and horace greeley talk agriculture in the other the poor man could not be more bother than he be no no far be it from I to add one harrowing burden to he already heavy load but when a man see the porter-house steak of liberty a burn up on the grid-iron of war why should not he put forth he flipper and save it if he can and there be another conundrum : but it be for punchinello and he hemisphere of adorer dick tinto \* \* \* \* \* a good bar-gain suggest the suggestion for purify the new york bar by classify its tender be a good one and should be act upon as it be now the justice there dispense be so mixed and doctor that it satisfy only the vitiate taste of the rough the proceedings in the mcfarland and jackson case show that swagger not study -- bully not brain be in a fair way to become the important qualification of a counsel the lawyer should organize in they own defense and classify themselves mr punchinello suggest the follow method as the simplest and probably the most effective in its application to matter of legal digestion let there be two class make the one to embrace the well-bred and the other the graham breed practitioner \* \* \* \* \* the sport at washington -- fight cox \* \* \* \* \* the play and show o what a wretched smell of orange-peel and sawdust say margaret to I as we enter the gateway of the circus wretched why of all perfume next to that of the clover and the new-mown hay it be the most delicious for it bring back to we the day of we innocent childhood when we steal unlawful penny to pay for admission to the charm circle of equestrian delight and in youthful purity of soul and general dirtiness of face and hand listen to the ingenious witticism of the clown while we crack the peaceful peanut and share the social gingerbread childlike innocence be a phrase that must originally have be apply exclusively to girl obviously it be sheer nonsense as apply to boy who ever see a innocent boy especially in a place of amusement be they not one and all give to untimely hunger and addict to undesirable method of assuage its pang be they not prone to perpetual cold in the head accompany by loud and labor breathing and rarely mitigate by the judicious use of pocket-handkerchief do they not indulge in a vicious and wholly unpardonable wealth of muddy boot wherewith to trample upon they unoffending neighbor be they not as prone to bad language as the _ tribune _ and as noisy and noisome as the _ sun _ itself in short be they not always and altogether the most oppressive nuisance that can annoy the peaceful pleasure-seeker echo answer that there be not the smallest possible doubt of it why then do we foolishly speak of innocent boyhood girl on the other hand may be innocent -- that be to say when they be extremely young of course they outgrow it when they arrive at year of flirtation but up to -- say -- they tenth or eleventh year they rarely go in for muddy boot and inappropriate peanut -- at least not to the same extent as boy the average little girl be moreover seldom find at the circus she prefer wallack 's or booth 's theater -- whereas you usual boy despise the legitimate drama and prefer to have he dissipation serve up with a great deal of horse and plentifully spice with the presence of the cheerful clown for my part i frankly confess that i do not like boy and heartily approve of the noble sentiment express the other day by my landlady who on read that the parisian have destroy the bois de boulogne remark that even if the french could not spell ` boy ' properly she be glad to see that they know how to treat they pardon the error of she pronunciation she learn french at a young lady ' seminary but i digress it be a reprehensible habit it be much better as a rule to die game than it be to digress though on the present occasion there be no reason why i should do either by the way if a man have to choose between have either he leg or he arm amputate which ought he to choose obviously he should choose ether -- that be much safer than chloroform as i be say the circus always have a strong flavor of orange peel will some one explain why orange-peel have such a close affinity for horse and sawdust i have attempt to account for it by a elaborate stretch of the theory of chemical affinity people crack peanut at the circus because the crack of peanut in its prosaic dreariness be in harmony with the crack of joke by the dreary clown the clown himself be always hoarse obviously because of he intimate association with the feat of horsemanship here be two case in which the theory of affinity clearly apply now can we not go further and find some connection between the ring of the circus and the peel of the orange or again may not the presence of unwholesome animal in the arena have something to do with the presence of orange-rind in the seat the latter be clearly a rind-pest of the very worst variety at this rate we shall never get inside the _ circus _ building so say margaret and i therefore cease my philosophical remark which have so strongly impressed the doorkeeper that he have finally beckon to a policeman to come and listen to they up the steep stair we hasten and be put into a reserved pen where we watch the glory of motley and the glitter of spangle in the ring below a terrific feat of horsemanship be in progress a daring rider mount on a broad platform which be bear on the back of a placid horse be carry on a slow canter around the ring he evidently impersonate a member of the horse marine for he execute elaborate imitation of pull rope reef and furl sail probably the horse marine reef topsail on horseback in the absence of oppose testimony we accept he theory and be greatly pleased to find that the equestrian sailor finally escape be wreck on the lower row of bench and so meet a watery grave among the sawdust while he horse slowly founder beneath he i remark to margaret while this daring act of marine horsemanship in progress that i hope the horse will not founder -- mean to pun on the latter word but i be overhear by a horsey person in the neighborhood who reply that horse haus not get a symptom of founder lend keep he horse in too good condition for that and i to he in a light and jocose manner -- lend keep they so well feed that they never keep lend themselves i suppose but the horsey person do not see my joke -- thus prove that he share a dulness of perception that i have too often notice even among my friend so i mercifully give he one more chance and say : i suppose mr lend keep all the fast horse so that they never have to keep fast themselves but he gruffly answer you think yourself smart do not you you be not though and you would better keep yourself mighty quiet i agree with he in the latter opinion and relapse into a dignified silence presently the antipodal brother begin they fraternal gymnastics i again feel the spirit of speculation strong within I and say to margaret why be gymnast always bear in couple why could not the antipodal cousin or the antipodal relation by marriage break they neck together with as much effect as though they be brother do the fraternal supply of brotherly gymnastics exist in consequence of a presumed demand for the article by the public if so why do the public make such demand and she answer it be a mystery seek not to penetrate it that way madness lie here a conundrum obtrude itself upon I and i ask suppose gen terry have a daughter why would she necessarily be a delightful puzzle obviously because she would be a miss terry but the horsey person turn round and say if you want a head put on you just keep on talk so that folk can not hear the brother turn a somersault you 'll be accommodate do you understand i accept he general hint and watch the somersaulting pair what a editor the elder brother would make he could turn as sudden and perfect a somersault as do mr dana when he transform the _ sun _ in a single night from a decent daily to what it now be or what a politician the younger brother might become be he to exhibit in the arena of public life the agility in turn flip-flap and reverse himself by unexpectedly stand on he head which he display in the circus ring then the famous equestrienne -- or rideress as webster would probably call she -- career around the circle on she thoroughbred alaskian steed : she be evidently a great favorite and the small boy behind I exclaim with a ecstatic kick at the back of my neck : be not this bully i venture to correct he by remark : my son you should say ` horsey ' you would thereby avoid confound the noble animal before you with the no less useful but undeniably less attractive -- in a aesthetic point of view -- animal which belong to the bovine race he be evidently overcome by my flow of language and he ask

upon a daily newspaper the reader be particularly request to bear in mind that spiffkin 's paper be a _ daily _ not a nightly one mr spiffkin have never write a line which die he would wish to blot in fact he copy be always clean and he use to say since it be so easy to write a line over again where be the use in blot it the specific department that mr spiffkin attend to be interview mr spiffkin choose this department on account of have be bear a gentleman and of have always move in the very best society interview bring he into contact with all sort of distinguished people with whom he immediately make himself at home on one occasion he make himself so completely at home that the gentleman whom he be visit considerately point out the mistake and then spiffkin suddenly remember the distinction mr spiffkin be a man of great delicacy of feeling and keen sense of honor one day a man cut he throat from ear to ear because he boarding-house-keeper would put ham into the hash the brother of the man call upon spiffkin and request he as a favor to keep the thing out of he newspaper as all the other journal have promise to do so spiffkin give the require promise and the next day spiffkin 's paper be the only one that have mention of the suicide but then spiffkin have no intention of hurt the suicide 's family 's feeling not by any mean he only aim be to beat the other newspaper and to serve he employer spiffkin write pure english he style -- like that of other reporter -- be noticeable for its elegance and perspicuity thus whenever spiffkin have occasion to use the word memory he invariably say memory of the past and by this mean make it plain that he mean no reference whatever to the memory of the future the force originality and beauty of he epithet be remarkable in he local report suicide be always determine suicide and they act be always rash act among purist in the use of word the employment of these adjective have always be consider a delightful and legitimate mode of discriminate between people who kill themselves precipitately and those who use a considerable amount of caution and -lrb- so to speak -rrb- apply strychnine with one hand and the stomach-pump with the other spiffkin use to report fire murder and police doings generally in a quiet and genteel manner and by the superintendent of police he be as much beloved for the goodness of he heart as he be by the city editor for the goodness of he grammar once upon a time spiffkin have the opportunity of try he hand at dramatic criticism and adopt a startlingly new system which consist simply in tell the truth the consequence be that he newspaper obtain a great reputation for high moral tone and lose all its theatrical advertisement even when spiffkin write a original american comedy of contemporaneous human interest -lrb- and which have have a previous run in pari of five thousand night -rrb- and that comedy be brilliantly reject by a manager spiffkin never go back on he system of tell the truth weaker critic would have let up on that manager lest it should be think that they abuse he because he refuse they play but not so with spiffkin _ he _ moral courage be too heroic to resort to so mean a subterfuge as that and to this day that manager believe that the reason spiffkin abuse he be because he refuse he play sometimes spiffkin throw a little light on subject that be generally misunderstand for instance he say that nilsson be a charming mezzo-soprano and declare that rip van winkle be a more delightful translation from the french than have be see for many a day occasionally spiffkin eke out he salary by write letter to the provincial press in this respect he be invaluable because he letter contain about thing in new york information which never appear in the new york papers so that when a philadelphium family take the newspaper which spiffkin correspond with that family be fully post upon everything which might just as well have happen

put you hand under a trip-hammer once but not twice you might take a trip on a mississippus steamer or a erie train once you might go to the legislature or congress and be honest once you might get a seat in a horse-car once you might be civilly treat by a public official once you might lend a umbrella or indulge in the luxury of a lawsuit or persuade you better half that you be only tire when you be really beery once but i assure you that you chance of do any of those thing twice be decidedly slim if you do any of they once and do not find yourself in greenwood the alms-house or matrimonial hot water retire on you laurel and let out the job chapter ii _ upon a time _ -- this be not a fairy tale though it open in a very suspicious manner it be a sad recital of fact upon a time do not mean that any one sit down on a watch or make himself familiar with the town clock it be not very specific i admit it may refer to any time but i think the design be to call attention to benedict 's time you know how it be yourself you remember how often you have stand on a dock and see the steamboat ten foot out in the stream or have strike a depot just as the train be roll around a curve in the distance simply because you be not upon a time then as you walk on the dock or platform you would strew you pathway with -- curse but i do not mean anything of that sort no i refer to something

through the medium of you valuable journal i propose to give to the world to which we all owe so much a few hint in regard to the deficiency of science and thus place these my carefully nurture idea at the service of my race it be to be presume that there be but few person who have not observe the great benefit of _ pruning _ in the vegetable kingdom he who sit under the shade of he own vine and fig-tree -lrb- or even those which be lease or rent -rrb- will find the shade and the fruit of he vine and he tree greatly increase by judicious and seasonable pruning the theory of science and the practice of horticulturist have make this fact so potent that it be needless to enlarge upon it now but science stop here what she have give the world in respect to this important subject be of far less value than that of which she have deprive it by she failure to carry she investigation into the animal kingdom with the exception of the docking of horse ' tail and the clipping of the ear of dog she have do little or nothing in this respect and it be much to be fear that the great benefit of pruning as apply to the human race be deny to the present generation for we all know how difficult it be in the face of the dogged opposition of the mass to inaugurate a truly valuable reform but it be my belief and i have carefully study the subject in all its bearing that the crowning gift of science to man will be the system of pruning for consumption when we consider how the strength of a weak and spindling tree be augment by the excision of some of its useless branch we can well understand that weak and spindling man may be strengthen and invigorate by the amputation of one or more of he limb the sap or blood which be before apply to the support and nourishment of this excise limb will now assist in the nourishment of the whole body and the man like the tree will become vigorous stout and healthy in proof of this it be only necessary to consider the condition of those soldier sailor or civilian who have suffer the amputation of a leg or arm how plump and rosy they all appear be it not certain then that instead of waste they time and substance in cod-liver oil and trip to minnesota and florida it would be far better for those person who may fancy themselves consumptive to repair to they physician 's abode and request he to trim off a arm a foot or a leg accord to the urgency of they symptom and if this first pruning be find to be insufficient the individual might be further trim until he form be of a size and extent no greater than he natural force be capable of nourish when this result be attain the patient might expect to grow as vigorous and wholesome as a properly prune grape-vine or a dwarf pear-tree hope respected sir that i have make myself
