trilogy : with fire and sword the deluge and pan michael precede by short story lillian morri yanko the musician after bread hanium let we follow he follow by two problem novel without dogma and child of the soil and crown by a masterpiece of a incomparable artistic beauty quo vadi eleven good book adopt from the polish language and set into circulation be of great importance for the english-reading people -- just now i be emphasize only this -- because these book be write in the most beautiful language ever write by any polish author eleven book of masterly personal and simple prose eleven good book give to the circulation and receive not only with admiration but with gratitude -- book where there be more or less good or sincere page but where there be not one on which original humor nobleness charm some comforting thought some elevated sentiment do not shine some other author would perhaps have stop after produce quo vadi without any doubt the best of sienkiewicz 's book but sienkiewicz look into the future and care more about work which he be go to write than about those which we have already in we library and he renew he talent search perhaps unknowingly for new theme and tendency when one know how to read a book then from its page the author 's face look out on he a face not material but just the same full of life sienkiewicz 's face look on we from he book be not always the same it change and in he last book -lrb- quo vadi -rrb- it be quite different almost new there be some people who throw down a book after have read it as one leave a bottle after have drink the wine from it there be other who read book with a pencil in they hand and they mark the most striking passage afterward in the hour of rest in the moment when one need a stimulant from within and one search for harmony sympathy of a thing apparently so dead and strange as a book be they come back to the marked passage to they own thought more comprehensible since a author express they to they own sentiment stronger and more natural since they find they in somebody else 's word because ofttime it seem to we -- the common reader -- that there be no difference between we interior world and the horizon of great author and we flatter ourselves by believe that we be ` only less daring less brave than be thinker and poet that some interior lack of courage stop we from have formulate we impression and in this sentiment there be a great deal of truth but while this expression of we thought seem to we to be a daring to the other it be a need they even do not suspect how much they be daring and new they must accord to the word of a poet spin out the love as the silkworm spin its web that be they capital distinction from common mortal we recognize they by it at once and that be the reason we put they above the common level on the page of they book we find not the trace of the accidental deeper penetrate into the life or more refine feeling but the whole harvest of thought impression disposition write skilfully because study deeply we also leave something on these page some people dry flower on they the other preserve reminiscence in every one of sienkiewicz 's volume people will deposit a great many personal impression part of they soul in every one they will find they again after many year there be three period in sienkiewicz 's literary life in the first he write short story which be masterpiece of grace and ingenuity -- at least some of they in those story the reader will meet frequent thought about general problem deep observation of life -- and notwithstanding he idealism very truthful about spiritual mood express with a easy and sincere hand speak about sienkiewicz 's work no matter how small it may be one have always the feeling that one speak about a known living in general memory work almost every one of he story be like a stone throw in the midst of a flock of sparrow gather in the winter time around barn : one throw arouse at once a flock of winged reminiscence the other characteristic of he story be uncommonness of he conception masterly composition ofttime artificial it happen also that a story have no plot -lrb- from the diary of a tutor in pozman bartek the victor -rrb- no action almost no matter -lrb- yamyol -rrb- but the reader be reward by simplicity rural theme humoristic picture -lrb- comedy of error : a sketch of american life -rrb- pity for the little and poor -lrb- yanko the musician -rrb- and those quality make the reader remember he story well it be almost impossible to forget -- under the general impression -- about he striking and standing-out figure -lrb- the lighthouse keeper of aspinwall -rrb- about the individual impression they leave on we mind apparently they be commonplace every-day people but the author 's talent put on they a original individuality a particular stamp which make one remember they forever and afterward apply they to the individual which one meet in life no matter how insignificant socially be the figure choose by sienkiewicz for he story the great talent of the author magnify its striking feature not see by common people and make of it a masterpiece of literary art although we have a popular saying : _ comparaison n'est pas raison _ one can not refrain from state here that this love for the poor the little and the oppressed bring out so powerfully in sienkiewicz 's short story constitute a link between he and françois coppée who be so great a friend of the friendless and the oppress those who without noise bear the heaviest chain the pariah of we happy and smile society the only difference between the short story of these two writer be this that notwithstanding all the mastercraft of coppée 's work one forget the impression produce by the reading of he work -- while it be almost impossible to forget the lighthouse keeper look on any lighthouse or yanko the musician listen to a poor wander boy playing on the street or bartek the victor see soldier of which military discipline have make machine rather than think being or the diary of a tutor contemplate the pale face of child overload with study another difference between those two writer -- the comparison be always between they short story -- be this that while sienkiewicz 's figure and character be universal international -- if one can use this adjective here -- and can be apply to the student of any country to the soldier of any nation to any wander musician and to the light-keeper on any sea the figure of françois coppée be mostly parisian and could be hardly displace from they parisian surroundings and condition sometimes the whole short story be write for the sake of that which the french call _ pointe _ when one have finish the reading of zeus 's sentence for a moment the charming description of the evening and athenian night be lose and what a beautiful description it be if the art of reading be cultivate in america as it be in france and germany i would not be surprise if some american legouvé or strakosch be to add to he répertoire such production of prose as this humorously poetic zeus 's sentence or that mystic madrigal be bless but the dusk do not last long write sienkiewicz soon from the archipelago appear the pale selene and begin to sail like a silvery boat in the heavenly space and the wall of the acropoli light again but they beam now with a pale green light and look more than ever like the vision of a dream but all these and other equally charming picture disappear for a moment from the memory of the reader there remain only the final joke -- only zeus 's sentence a virtuous woman -- especially when she love another man -- can resist apollo but surely and always a stupid woman will resist he only when one think of the story do one see that the end -- that immoral conclusion i should say if i be not able to understand the joke -- do not constitute the essence of the story only then we find a delight in the description of the city for which the wagon cater the divine barley and the water be carry by the girl with amphora poise on they shoulder and lift hand go home light and graceful like immortal nymph and then follow such paragraph as the follow which determine the real value of the work : the voice of the god of poetry sound so beautiful that it perform a miracle behold in the ambrosian night the gold spear standing on the acropoli of athen tremble and the marble head of the gigantic statue turn toward the acropoli in order to hear better heaven and earth listen to it the sea stop roar and lay peacefully near the shore even pale selene stop she night wander in the sky and stand motionless over athen and when apollo have finish a light wind arise and carry the song through the whole of greece and wherever a child in the cradle hear only a tone of it that child grow into a poet what poet fame by what song will he not perhaps be a lyric poet the same happen with lux in tenebri one read again and again the description of the fall of the mist and the splashing of the rain drop in the gutter the cawing of the crow migrate to the city for they winter quarter and with flap of wing roost in the tree one feel that the whole misery of the first ten page be necessary in order to form a background for the two page of heavenly light to bring out the brightness of that light those who have lose they best beloved write sienkiewicz must hang they life on something otherwise they could not exist in such sentence -- and it be not the prettiest but the shortest that i have quote -- resound however the quiet wisdom the noble love of that art which poor kamionka respect deeply and be always sincere toward during the long year of he profession he never cheat nor wrong it neither for the sake of fame nor money nor for praise nor for criticism he always write as he feel be i not like ruth of the bible doom to pick the ear of corn instead of be myself a sower -- if god have not make I critic and worshipper but artist and creator -- i could not wish for another necrology than those word of sienkiewicz regard the statuary kamionka quite another thing be the story at the source none of the story except let we follow he possess for I so many transcendent beauty although we be right to be angry with the author for have wish during the reading of several page to make we believe a impossible thing -- that he be deceive we it be true that he have do it in a masterly manner -- it be true that he could not have do otherwise but at the same time there be a fault in the conception and although sienkiewicz have cover the precipice with flower nevertheless the precipice exist on the other hand it be true that one read the novel will forget the trick of the author and will see in it only the picture of a immense happiness and a hymn in the worship of love perhaps the poor student be right when he say : among all the source of happiness that from which i drink during the fever be the clearest and best a life which love have not visit even in a dream be still worse love and faith in woman and art be two constantly recur theme in lux in tenebri at the source be bless and organist of ponikilum when sienkiewicz write let we follow he some critic cry angrily that he lessen he talent and moral worth of the literature they regret that he turn people into the false road of mysticism long since leave have find christ on he page the least religious people have recollect how gigantic he be in the writings of heine walk over land and sea carry a red burning sun instead of a heart they all understand that to introduce christ not only worthily or beautifully but simply and in such a manner that we would not be oblige to turn away from the picture would be a great art -- almost a triumph in later time we have make many such attempt the mysticism become to-day a article of commerce the religious tenderness and simplicity be spread among parisian newspaper man playwright and novelist such as armand sylvèstre such as theodore de wyzewa be play at write up christian dogma and legend and a strange thing while the painter try to bring the christ nearer to the crowd while fritz von uhde or lhermitte put the christ in a country school in a workingman 's house the weakling writer imitate poet dress he in old fade traditional clothes and surround he with a theatrical light which they dare to call mysticism they be crowd the portico of the temple but they be merely merchant anatole france alone can not be place in the same crowd in let we follow he the situation and character be know and be already to be find in literature but never be they paint so simply so modestly without romantic complaint and exclamation in the first chapter of that story there appear a epic writer with whom we have for a long time be familiar we be accustom to that uncommon simplicity but in order to appreciate the narrative regard antea one must listen attentively to this slow prose and then one will notice the rhythmic sentence follow one after the other then one feel that the author be build a great foundation for the action sometimes there occur a brief sharp sentence end in a strong short word and the result be that sienkiewicz have give we a masterpiece which justify the enthusiasm of a critic who call he a prince of polish prose in the second period of he literary activity sienkiewicz have produce he remarkable historical trilogy the deluge with fire and sword and pan michael in which he talent shine forth powerfully and which possess absolutely distinctive character from he short story the admirer of romanticism can not find any better book in historical fiction some critic have say righteously about sienkiewicz speaking of he deluge that he be the first of polish novelist past or present and second to none now live in england france or germany sienkiewicz be himself a nobleman therefore naturally in he historical novel he describe the glorious deed of the polish nobility who be locate on the frontier of such barbarous nation as turk kozak tartar and woloch -lrb- to-day roumanium -rrb- have defend europe for century from the invasion of barbarism and give the time to germany france and england to outstrip poland in the development of material welfare and general civilization among the mass -- the nobility be always very refine -- though in the fifteenth century the literature of poland and she sister bohemia -lrb- chechy -rrb- be richer than any other european country except italy one should at least always remember that nicolaus kopernicus -lrb- kopernik -rrb- be a pole and john huss be a chech historical novel begin in england or rather in scotland by the genius of walter scott follow in france by alexandre duma _ père _ these two great writer have numerous follower and imitator in all country and every nation can point out some more or less successful writer in that field but who never attain the great success of sienkiewicz whose work be translate into many language even into russian where the antipathy for the polish superior degree of civilization be still very eager the superiority of sienkiewicz 's talent be then affirm by this fact of translation and i would dare say that he be superior to the father of this kind of novel on account of he historical coloring so much emphasize in walter scott this important quality in the historical novel be truer and more lively in the polish writer and then he possess that psychological depth about which walter scott never dream walter scott never have create such a original and typical figure as zagloba be who be a worthy rival to shakespeare 's falstaff as for the description of dueling fight battle sienkiewicz 's fantastically heroic pen be without rival alexandre duma notwithstanding the bite criticism of brunetière will always remain a great favorite with the reading mass who be search in he book for pleasure amusement and distraction sienkiewicz 's historical novel possess all the interesting quality of duma and besides that they be full of wholesome food for think mind he color be more shine he brush be broader he composition more artful chisel finish better build and execute with more vigor while duma amuse please distract sienkiewicz astonish surprise bewitch all uneasy preoccupation the dolorous echo of eternal problem which philosophical doubt impose with the everlasting anguish of the human mind the mystery of the origin the enigma of destiny the inexplicable necessity of suffer the short tragical and sublime vision of the future of the soul and the future not less difficult to be guess of by the human race in this material world the torment of human conscience and responsibility for the deed be say by sienkiewicz without any pedanticism without any dryness if we say that the great hungarian author maurice jokay who also write historical novel pale when compare with that fascinating pole who leave far behind he the late lion in the field of romanticism stanley j weyman and anthony hope we be through with that part of sienkiewicz 's literary achievement in the third period sienkiewicz be represent by two problem novel without dogma and child of the soil the charm of sienkiewicz 's psychological novel be the synthesis so seldom realize and as i have already say the plastic beauty and abstract thought he possess also a admirable assurance of psychological analysis a mastery in the painting of custom and character and the rarest and most precious faculty of animate he hero with intense personal life which though it be only a illusionary life appear less deceitful than the real life in that field of novel sienkiewicz differ greatly from balzac for instance who force himself to paint the man in he perversity or in he stupidity accord to he view life be the racing after riches the whole of balzac 's philosophy can be resume in the deification of the force all he hero be strong man who disdain humanity and take advantage of it sienkiewicz 's psychological novel be not lack in the ideal in he conception of life they be active power form human soul the reader find there in a well-balanced proportion good and bad idea of life and he represent this life as a good thing worthy of live he differ also from paul bourget who as a german savant count how many microbe be in a drop of spoil blood who be please with any ferment who do not care for healthy soul as a doctor do not care for healthy people -- and who be fond of corruption sienkiewicz 's analysis of life be not exclusively pathological and we find in he novel healthy as well as sick people as in the real life he take color from twilight and aurora to paint with and by do so he strengthen we energy he stimulate we ability for think about those eternal problem difficult to be decide but which exist and will exist as long as humanity will exist he prefer green field the perfume of flower health virtue to zolum 's liking for crime sickness cadaverous putridness and manure he prefer _ l'âme humaine _ to _ la bête humaine _ he be never vulgar even when he hero do not wear any glove and he have these common point with shakespeare and molière that he do not paint only certain type of humanity take from one certain part of the country as it be with the majority of french writer who do not go out of they dear pari in sienkiewicz 's novel one can find every kind of people begin with humble peasant and modest nobleman create by god and end with proud lord make by the king in the novel without dogma there be many keen and sharp observation say masterly and briefly there be many state of the soul if not always very deep at least write with art and he merit in that respect be greater than of any other writer if we take in consideration that in poland heroic lyricism and poetical picturesqueness prevail in the literature the one who wish to find in the modern literature some aphorism to classify the characteristic of the people in order to be able afterward to apply they to they fellow-men must read child of the soil but the one who be less selfish and wicked and wish to collect for he own use such a library as to be able at any moment to take a book from a shelf and find in it something which would make he thoughtful or would make he forget the ordinary life -- he must get quo vadis because there he will find page which will recomfort he by they beauty and dignity it will enable he to go out from he surroundings and enter into himself _ ie _ in that better man whom we sometimes feel in we interior and while read this book he ought to leave on its page the trace of he reading some mark make with a lead pencil or with he whole memory it seem that in that book a new man be arouse in sienkiewicz and any praise say about this unrivaled masterpiece will be as pale as any powerful lamp be pale comparatively with the glory of the sun for instance if i say that sienkiewicz have make a thorough study of nero 's epoch and that he great talent and he plastic imagination create the most powerful picture in the historical background will it not be a very tame praise compare with he book -- which while read it one shiver and the blood freeze in one 's vein in quo vadi the whole _ alta roma _ begin with slave carry mosaic for they refine master and end with patrician who be so fond of beautiful thing that one of they for instance use to kiss at every moment a superb vase stand before we eye as if it be reconstruct by a magical power from ruin and death there be no better description of the burning of rome in any literature while read it everything turn red in one 's eye and immense noise fill one 's ear and the moment when christ appear on the hill to the frightened peter who be go to leave rome not feel strong enough to fight with mighty caesar will remain one of the strongest passage of the literature of the whole world after have read again and again this great -- shall i say the greatest historical novel -- and have wonder at its deep conception masterly execution beautiful language powerful painting of the epoch plastic description of custom and habit enthusiasm of the first follower of christ refinement of roman civilization corruption of the old world the question rise : what be the dominate idea of the author spread out all over the whole book it be the cry of christian murder in circus : _ pro christo _ sienkiewicz search always and continually for a tranquil harbor from the storm of conscience and investigation of the tormented mind find such a harbor in the religious sentiment in lively christian faith this idea be weave as golden thread in a silk brocade not only in quo vadi but also in all he novel in fire and sword he principal hero be a outlaw but all he crime not only against society but also against nature be redeem by faith and as a consequence of it afterward by good deed in the child of the soul he take one of he principal character upon one of seven roman hill and have display before he in the most eloquent way the might of the old rome the might as it never exist before and perhaps never will exist again he say : and from all that nothing be leave only cross cross cross it seem to we that in quo vadi sienkiewicz strain all he force to reproduce from one side all the power all riches all refinement all corruption of the roman civilization in order to get a better contrast with the great advantage of the cry of the living faith : _ pro christo _ in that cry the asphyxiate not only in old time but in we day also find refreshment the torment by doubt peace from that cry flow hope and naturally people prefer those from whom the blessing come to those who curse and doom they sienkiewicz consider the christian faith as the principal and even the only help which humanity need to bear cheerfully the burden and struggle of every-day life equally he personal experience as well as he study make he worship christ he be not one of those who say that religion be good for the people at large he do not admit such a shade of contempt in a question touch so near the human heart he know that every one be a man in the presence of sorrow and the conundrum of fate contradiction of justice tear of death and uneasiness of hope he believe that the only way to cross the precipice be the flight with the wing of faith the precipice make between the submission to general and absolute law and the confidence in the infinite goodness of the father the time pass and carry with it people and doctrine and system many author leave as the heritage to civilization row of book and in those book scepticism indifference doubt lack of precision and decision but the last symptom in the literature show we that the stoicism be not sufficient for we generation not satisfy with marcus aurelius 's gospel which be not sufficient even to that brilliant sienkiewicz 's roman _ arbiter elegantiarum _ the over-refined patrician petronius a nation which desire to live and do not wish either to perish in the desert or be drown in the mud need such a great help which only religion give the history be not only _ magister vita _ but also it be the master of conscience literature have in sienkiewicz a great poet -- epical as well as lyrical i shall not mourn although i appreciate the justified complaint about objectivity in _ belle lettre _ but now there be no question what poetry will be there be the question whether it will be and i believe that society be tire with zolum 's realism and its caricature not with the picturesqueness of lotus but with catalogue of painter 's color not with the depth of ibsen but the oddness of he imitator -- it seem to I that society will hate the poetry which discuss and philosophize wish to paint but do not feel make archeology but do not give impression and that people will turn to the poetry as it be in the begin what be in its deepest essence to the flight of single word to the interior melody to the song -- the art of sound be the greatest art i believe that if in the future the poetry will find listener they will repeat to the poet the word of paul verlaine whom by too summary judgment they count among incomprehensible original : _ de la musique encore et toujors _ and nobody need be afraid from a social point of view for sienkiewicz 's objectivity it be a manly lyricism as well as epic make deep by the knowledge of the life sustain by think until now perhaps unconscious of itself the poetry of a writer who walk many road study many thing know much bitterness ridicule many trifling and then he perceive that a man like himself have only one aim : above human affair to spin the love as the silkworm spin its web sc de soisson the university cambridge mass part second so run the world zolum i have a great respect for every accomplished work every time i put on the end of any of my work _ fini _ i feel satisfied not because the work be do not on account of future success but on account of a accomplished deed every book be a deed -- bad or good but at any rate accomplish -- and a series of they write with a special aim be a accomplished purpose of life it be a feast during which the worker have the right to receive a wreath and to sing : we bring the crop the crop evidently the merit depend on the result of the work the profession of the writer have its thorn about which the reader do not dream a farmer bring the crop to he barn have this absolute surety that he bring wheat rye barley or oats which will be useful to the people a author write even with the best of faith may have moment of doubt whether instead of bread he do not give poison whether he work be not a great mistake or a great misdeed whether it have bring profit to humanity or whether be it not better for the people and himself have he not write anything nothing accomplish such doubt be foe to human peace but at the same time they be a filter which do not pass any dirt it be bad when there be too many of they it be bad when too few in the first case the ability for deed disappear in the second the conscience hence the eternal as humanity need of exterior regulator but the french writer always have more originality and independence than other and that regulator which elsewhere be religion long since cease to exist for they there be some exception however balzac use to affirm that he aim be to serve religion and monarchy but even the work of those who confess such principle be not in harmony with themselves one can say that it please the author to understand they activity in that way but the reading mass could understand it and often understand it as a negation of religious and ethical principle in the last epoch however such misunderstanding become impossible because the author begin to write either in the name of they personal conviction directly opposite to social principle and tie or with objective analysis which in its action of life mark the good and the evil as manifestation equally necessary and equally justified france -- and through france the rest of europe -- be overflow with a deluge of book write with such lightheartedness so absolute and with such daring not count on any responsibility toward people that even those who receive they without any scruple begin to be overcome with astonishment it seem that every author force himself to go further than they expect he to in that way they succeed in be call daring thinker and original artist the boldness in touch certain subject and the way of interpret they seem to be the best quality of the writer to that be join bad faith or unconscious deceiving of himself and other analysis they analyze in the name of truth which apparently must and have the right to be say everything but especially the evil dirt human corruption they do not notice that this pseudo-analysis cease to be a objective analysis and become a sickish liking for rotten thing come from two cause : in the first place from the corruption of the taste then from greater facility of produce striking effect they utilize the philological faculty of the sens on the strength of which repulsive impression appear to we stronger and more real than agreeable and they abuse that property beyond measure there be create a certain kind of travel in putridness because the subject be exhaust very quickly there be a necessity to find something new which could attract the truth itself in the name of which it be do be put in a corner in the presence of such exigency be you familiar with zolum 's la terre this novel be to represent a picture of a french village try and think of a french village or of any other village how do it look altogether it be a gathering of house tree field pasture wild flower people herd light sky singing small country business and work in all that without any doubt the manure play a important part but there be something more behind it and besides it but zolum 's village look as if it be compose exclusively of manure and crime therefore the picture be false the truth twist because in nature the true relation of thing be different if any one would like to take the trouble of make a list of the woman represent in french novel he would persuade himself that at least ninety-five per cent of they be fall woman but in society it be not and can not be so probably even in the country where they worship astarte there be less bad woman notwithstanding this the author try to persuade we that they be give a true picture of society and that they analysis of custom be a objective one the lie exaggeration liking for rotten thing -- such be the exact picture in contemporary novel i do not know what profit there be in literature like that but i do know that the devil have not lose anything because through this channel flow a river of mud and poison and the moral sense become so dull that finally they tolerate such book which a few decade ago would have bring the author to court to-day we do not wish to believe that the author of madame bovary have two criminal suit have this book be write twenty year later they would have find it too modest but the human spirit which do not slumber and the organism that wish to live do not suffer excess of poison finally there come a moment for hiccough of disgust some voice begin to rise ask for other spiritual bread a instinctive sentiment awake and cry that it can not continue any longer in this way that one must arise shake off the mud clean change the people ask for a fresh breeze the mass can not say what they want but they know what they do not want they know they be breathe bad air and that they be suffocate a uneasiness take hold of they mind even in france they be seek and cry for something different they begin to protest against the actual state of affair many writer feel that uneasiness they have some moment of doubt about which i have speak already and those doubt be stronger on account of the uncertainty of the new road look at the last book of bourget rod barrès desjardin the poetry of rimbaud verlaine heredium mallarmé and even maeterlinck and he school what do you find there the search for new essence and new form feverish seek for some issue uncertainty where to go and where to look for help -- in religion or mysticism in duty outside of faith or in patriotism or in humanity above all however one see in they a immense uneasiness they do not find any issue because for it one need two thing : a great idea and a great talent and they do not have either of they hence the uneasiness increase and the same author who arouse against rough pessimism of naturalistic direction fall into pessimism themselves and by this the principal importance and aim of a reform become weaker what remain then the bizarre form and in this bizarre form whether it be call symbolism or impressionism they go in deeper and become more entangled lose artistic equilibrium common sense and serenity of the soul often they fall into the former corruption as far as the essence be concerned and almost always into dissonance with one 's self because they have a honest sentiment that they must give to the world something new and they know not what such be the present time among those search in darkness wander and weary one one remain quiet sure of himself and he doctrine immovable and almost serious in he pessimism it be emile zolum a great talent slow but powerful and a potent force surprising objectivism if the question be about a sentiment because it be equal to almost complete indifference such a exceptional gift of see the entire soul of humanity and thing that it approach this naturalistic writer to mystic -- all that give he a very great and unusual originality the physical figure do not always reproduce the spiritual individuality in zolum this relation come out very strikingly a square face low forehead cover with wrinkle rough feature high shoulder and short neck give to he person a rough appearance look at he face and those wrinkle around the eye you can guess that he be a man who can stand much that he be persevere and stubborn not only in he project but in the realization of they but what be mere important he be so in he thinking also there be no keenness in he at the first glance of the eye one can see that he be a doctrinarian shut up in himself who do not embrace large horizon -- see everything at a certain angle narrow-mindedly yet see distinctly he mind like a dark lantern throw a narrow light in only one direction and he go in that direction with immovable surety in that way the history of a series of he book call les rougon-macquart become clear zolum be determine to write the history of a certain family at the time of the empire on the ground of condition produce by it in consideration of the law of heredity there be a question even about something more than this consideration because this heredity have to become the physiological foundation of the work there be a certain contradiction in the premise speak historically rougon-macquart have to be a picture of french society during its last time accord to they moral manifestation of life therefore they ought to be of themselves more or less a normal family but in such a case what shall one do with heredity to be sure moral family be such on the strength of the law of heredity -- but it be impossible to show it in such condition -- one can do it only in exceptional case of the normal type therefore the rougon be in fact a sick family they be child of nervousness it be contract by the first mother of the family and since that time the come generation one after another follow with the same stigma on they forehead this be the way the author wish to have it and one must agree with he in what way however can a history of one family exceptionally attainted with a mental disorder be at the same time a picture of french society the author do not explain to we have he say that during the empire all society be sick it would be a trick a society can walk in the perilous road of politics or custom and be sick as a community and at the same time have healthy individual and family these be two different thing therefore one of the two : either the rougon be sick and in that case the cycle of novel about they be not a picture of french society during the empire -- it be only a psychological study -- or the whole physiological foundation all this heredity on which the cycle be base in a word zolum 's whole doctrine be nonsense i do not know whether any one have pay attention to zolum at this _ aut aut _ it be sure that he never think of it himself probably it would not have have any influence as the criticism have no influence on he theory of heredity critic and physiologist attack he ofttime with a arsenal of irrefutable argument it do not do any good they affirm in vain that the theory of heredity be not prove by any science and above all it be difficult to grasp it and show it by fact they point in vain that physiology can not be fantastical and its law can not depend on the free conception of a author zolum listen continue to write and in the last volume he give a genealogical tree of the family of rougon-macquart with such a serenity as if no one ever doubt he theory at any rate this tree have one advantage it be so pretentious so ridiculous that it take away from the theory the seriousness which it would have give to less individual mind we learn from it that from a nervously sick great-grandmother grow a sick family but the one who would think that she nervousness be see in descendant as it be in the physical field in a certain similar way in some inclination or passion for something will be greatly mistake on the contrary the marvellous tree produce different kind of fruit you can find on it red apple pear plum cherry and everything you might desire and all that on account of great-grandmother 's nervousness be it the same way in nature we do not know zolum himself do not have any other proof than clipping from newspaper describe different crime he preserve these clipping carefully as human document and which he use accord to he fancy it can be grant to he but he must not sell we such fancy for the eternal and immutable law of nature grandmother do have nervousness she nearest friend be in the habit of search for remedy against ill not in a drug-store therefore she male and female descendant be such as they must be -- namely criminal thief fast woman honest people saint politician good mother banker farmer murderer priest soldier minister -- in a word everything which in the sphere of the mind in the sphere of health in the sphere of wealth and position in the sphere of profession can be and be man as well as woman in the whole world one be stupefy voluntarily what then and all that on account of grandmother 's nervousness yes answer the author but if adelaïde fouqué have not have it she descendant would be good or bad just the same and have the same occupation man and woman usually have in this world certainly zola answer but adelaïde fouqué have nervousness and further discussion be impossible because one have to do with a man who he own voluntary fancy take for a law of nature and he brain can not be open with a key furnish by logic he build a genealogical tree this tree could have be different -- but if it be different he would sustain that it can be only such as it be -- and he would prefer to be kill rather than be convince that he theory be worthless at any rate it be such a theory that it be not worth while to quarrel about it a long time ago it be say that zolum have one good thing -- he talent and one bad -- he doctrine if as a consequence of a inherit nervousness one can become a rascal as well as a good man a sister of charity as well as nana a farmer boy as well as achille -- in that case there be a heredity which do not exist a man can be that which he wish to be the field for good will and responsibility be open and all those moral foundation on which human life be base come out of the fire safely we could say to the author that there be too much ado about nothing and finish with he as one finish with a doctrinarian and count only he talent but he care for something else no matter if he doctrine be empty he make from it other deduction the entire cycle of he book speak precisely no matter what you be saint or criminal you be such on the strength of the law of heredity you be such as you must be and in that case you have neither merit nor be you guilty here be the question of responsibility but we be not go to discuss it the philosophy have not yet find the proof of the existence of man and when _ cogito ergo sum _ of cartesius be not sufficient for it the question be still open even if all century of philosophy affirm it or not the man be intrinsically persuade that he exist and no less persuade that he be responsible for he whole life which without any regard to he theory be base on such persuasion and then even the science do not decide the question of the whole responsibility against authority one can quote other authority against opinion one can bring other opinion against deduction other deduction but for zolum such opinion be decide there be only one grandmother adelaïde or grandfather jacque on whom everything depend from that point begin accord to my opinion the bad influence of the writer because he not only decide difficult question to be decide once and forever but he popularize they and facilitate the corruption of society no matter if every thief or every murderer can appeal to a grandmother with nervousness court notwithstanding the cycle of rougon-macquart will place they behind bar the evil be not in single case but in this that into the human soul a bad pessimism and depression flow that the charm of life be destroy the hope the energy the liking for life and therefore all effort in the direction of good be shatter _ a quous bon _ such be the question come by itself a book be also a activity form human soul if at least the reader would find in zolum 's book the bad and good side of human life in a equal proportion or at least in such as one can find it in reality vain hope one must climb high in order to get color from a rainbow or sunset -- but everybody have saliva in he mouth and it be easy to paint with it this naturalist prefer cheap effect more than other do he prefer mildew to perfume _ la bête humaine _ to _ l'âme humaine _ if we could bring a inhabitant of venus or mar to the earth and ask he to judge of life on the earth from zolum 's novel he would say most assuredly : this life be sometimes quite pure like ` le rève ' but in general it be a thing which smell bad be slippery moist dreadful and even if the theory on which zolum have base he work be as they be not acknowledged truth what a lack of pity to represent life in such a way to the people who must live just the same do he do it in order to ruin to disgust to poison every action to paralyze every energy to discourage all think in the presence of that we be even sorry that he have a talent it would have be better for he for france that he have not have it and one wonder that he be not frighten that when a fear seize even those who do not lead to corruption he alone with such a tranquillity finish he rougon-macquart as if he have strengthen the capacity for life of the french people instead of have destroy it how be it possible that he can not understand that people bring up on such corrupted bread and drinking such bad water not only will be unable to resist the storm but even they will not have a inclination to do so musset have write in he time this famous verse : we have already you german rhine zolum bring up he society in such a way that if everything that he plant would take root the second of musset 's verse would be : but to-day we will give you even the seine but it be not as bad as that la débâcle be a remarkable book notwithstanding all its fault but the soldier who will read it will be defeat by those who in the night sing : glory glory halleluium i consider zolum 's talent as a national misfortune and i be glad that he time be pass away that even the most zealous pupil abandon the master who stand alone more and more will humanity remember he in literature will he fame pass we can not affirm but we can doubt in the cycle of rougon-macquart there be powerful volume as germinal or la débâcle but in general that which zolum 's natural talent make for he immortality be spoil by a liking for dirty realism and he filthy language literature can not use such expression of which even peasant be ashamed the real truth if the question be about vicious people can be attain by other means by probable reproduction of the state of they soul thought deed finally by the run of they conversation but not by verbal quotation of they swearing and most horrid word as in the choice of picture so in the choice of expression exist certain measure point at by reason and good taste zolum overstep it to such a degree -lrb- la terre -rrb- to which nobody yet dare to approach monster be kill because they be monster a book which be the cause of disgust must be abandon it be the natural order of thing from old production as of universal literature survive the forgetfulness of the rough production destine to excite laughter -lrb- aristophane rabelai etc -rrb- or lascivious thing but write with a elegance -lrb- boccaccio -rrb- not one book write in order to excite nausea outlive zolum for the sake of the renown cause by he work for the sake of the scandal produce by every one of he volume kill he future on account of that happen a strange thing : it happen that he a man write accord to a conceive plan write with deliberation cold and possess he subject as very few writer be create good thing only when he have the least opportunity to realize he plan doctrine mean -- in a word when he dominate the subject the least and be dominate by the subject most such be the case in germinal and la débâcle the immensity of socialism and the immensity of the war simply crushed zolum with all he mental apparatus he doctrine become very small in the presence of such dimension and hardly any one hear of they in the noise of the deluge overflow the mine and in the thundering of prussian cannon only talent remain therefore in both those book there be page worthy of dante quite a different thing happen with docteur pascal be the last volume of the cycle it be bind to be the last deduction from the whole work the synthesis of the doctrine the belfry of the whole building consequently in this volume zolum speak more about doctrine than in any other previous volume as the doctrine be bad wicked and false therefore docteur pascal be the worst and most tedious book of all the cycle of rougon-macquart it be a series of empty leaf on which tediousness be hand in hand with lack of moral sense it be a pale picture full of falsehood -- such be le docteur pascal zolum wish to have he a honest man he be the outcast of the family rougon-macquart in heredity there happen such lucky degeneration the doctor know about it he consider himself as a happy exception and it be for he a source of continuous inward pleasure in the mean while he love people serve they and sell they he medicine which cure all possible disease he be a sweet sage who study life therefore he gather human document build laboriously the genealogical tree of the family of rougon-macquart whose descendant he be himself and on the strength of he observation he come to the same conclusion as zolum to which it be difficult to answer the question but here it be more or less : if any one be not well usually he be sick and that heredity exist but mother and father who come from other family can bring into the blood of child new element in that way heredity can be modify to such a degree that strictly speak it do not exist to all that doctor pascal be a positivist he do not wish to affirm anything but he do affirm that actual state of science do not permit of any further deduction than those which on the strength of the observation of known fact can be deduct therefore one must hold they and neglect the other in that respect he prejudice do not tell we anything more than newspaper article write by young positivist for the people who be rush forward for those spiritual need as strong as thirst and hunger by which the man feel such idea as god faith immortality the doctor have only a smile of commiseration and one might wonder at he a little bit one could understand he better if he do not acknowledge the possibility of the disentangling of different abstract question but he affirm that the necessity do not exist -- by which he sin against evidence because such a necessity exist not further than under he own roof in the person of he niece this young person bring up in he principle at once lose the ground under she foot in she soul arise more question than the doctor be able to answer and from this moment begin a drama for both of they i can not be satisfy with that cry the niece i be choke i must know something and if you science can not satisfy my necessity i be go there where they will not only tranquillize I not only explain everything to I but also will make I happy -- i be go to church and she go the road of master and pupil diverge more and more the pupil come to the conclusion that the science which be only a slipknot on the human neck be positively bad and that it would be a great merit before god to burn those old papers in which the doctor write he observation and the drama become stronger because notwithstanding the doctor be sixty year old and clotilde be only twenty year old these two people be in love not only as relation be in love but as a man and woman love each other this love add more bitterness to the fight and prompt the catastrophe on a certain night the doctor detect the niece in a criminal deed she open he desk take out he papers and she be ready to burn they up they begin to fight beautiful picture both be in nightgown -- they pull each other 's hair they scratch each other he be stronger than she although he have bite she she feel a certain pleasure in that experiment on she maiden skin of the strength of a man in that be the whole of zolum but let we listen because the decisive moment approach the doctor himself after have rest a while announce it solemnly the reader shiver will the doctor by the strength of he genius tear the sky and show to she emptiness beyond the star or will he by the strength of he eloquence ruin she church she creed she ecstasy she hope in the quietness the doctor 's low voice be hear : i do not wish to show you that but it can not last any longer -- the time have come give I the genealogical tree of rougon-macquart yes the genealogical tree of rougon-macquart the reading of it begin : there be one adelaïde fouqué who marry rougon-macquart 's friend rougon have eugene rougon also pascal rougon also aristide also sidonie also martha aristide have maxyme clotilde victor and maxyme have charle and so on to the end but sidonie have a daughter angelle and martha who marry mouret who be from macquart 's family have three child etc the night pass pale but the reading continue after rougon come macquart then the generation of both family one name follow another they appear bad good indifferent all class from minister banker great merchant to simple soldier or rascal without any profession -- finally the doctor stop reading -- and look with he eye of savant at he niece ask : well what now and beautiful clotilde throw herself into he arm cry : _ vicistus vicistus _ and she god she church she flight toward ideal she spiritual need disappear turn into ash why on the ground of what final conclusion for what good reason what could there be in the tree that convince she how could it produce any other impression than that of tediousness why do she not ask the question which surely must have come to the lip of the reader : and what then -- it be unknown i never notice that any other author could deduct from such a trifling and insignificant cause such great and immediate consequence it be as much of a astonishment as if zolum should order clotilde 's faith and principle to be turn into ash after the doctor have read to she a almanac time-table bill of fare or catalogue of some museum the freedom surpass here all possible limit and become absolutely incomprehensible the reader ask whether the author deceive himself or if he wish to throw some dust into the eye of the public and this climax of the novel be at the same time the downfall of all doctrine clotilde ought to have answer as follow : you theory have no connection with my faith in god and the church you heredity be so _ loose _ and on the strength of it one can be so much _ everything _ that it become _ nothing _ -- therefore the consequence which you deduct from it also be base upon nothing nana accord to you be a street-walker and angelle be a saint the priest mouret be a ascetic jacque lantier a murderer and all that on account of great-grandmother adelaïde but i tell you with more real probability that the good be good because they have my faith because they believe in responsibility and immortality of the soul and the bad be bad because they do not believe in anything how can you prove that the cause of good and bad be in great-grandmother adelaïde fouqué perhaps you will tell I that it be so because it be so but i can tell you that the faith and responsibility be for century a stopper for evil and you can not deny it if you wish to be a positivist because those be material fact in a word i have objective proof where you have you personal view and if it be so then leave my faith and throw you fancy into the fire but clotilde do not answer anything like this on the contrary she eat at once the apple from this tree -- pass soul and body into the doctor 's camp and she do it because zolum wish to have it that way there be no other reason for it and can not be have she do that on account of love for the doctor have this reason which in a woman can play such a important part act on she everything would be easy to understand but there be no such thing in that case what would become of all of zolum 's doctrine it act exclusively upon clotilde the author wish to have only such a reason and it happen as he wish but at the cost of logic and common sense since that time everything would be permit : one will be allow to persuade the reader that the man who be not love make a woman fall in love with he by means of show she a price list of butter or candy to such result a great and true talent be conduct by a doctrine this doctrine conduct also to perfect atrophy of moral sense this heredity be a wall in which one can make as many window as one please the doctor be such a window he consider himself as be degenerate from the nervousness of the family it mean that he be a normal man and as such he would transmit he health to he descendant clotilde think also that it would be quite a good idea and as they be in love consequently they take possession of each other and they do it as do people in the epoch of cavern zola consider it a perfectly natural thing doctor pascal think the same and as clotilde pass into he camp she do not make any opposition this appear a little strange clotilde be religious only a little while ago she youth and lack of experience do not justify she either even at eight year girl have some sentiment of modesty at twenty year a young girl always know what she be do and she can not be call a sacrifice and if she depart from the sentiment of modesty she do it either by love which make noble the rapture or because she do it by the act of duty but at the same time she wish to be herself a legitimate duty even if a woman be a irreligious being and she refuse to be bless by religion she can desire that she sentiment be legitimate the priest or _ monsieur le maire _ clotilde who love doctor pascal do not ask for anything marriage accomplish by a _ maire _ seem to she to be a secondary thing here also one can not understand she because a true love would wish to make the knot last that which really happen be quite different in the novel that first separation be the end of the relation between they be they marry at least by a _ maire _ they would have remain even in the separation husband and wife they would not cease to belong to each other but as they be not marry therefore at the moment of she departure he become unmarried as formerly doctor pascal she -- seduce clotilde even during they life in common there happen a thousand disagreeable incident for both of they one time for instance clotilde rush cry and red and when the frightened doctor ask she what be the matter she answer : ah those woman walk in the shade i close my parasol and i hurt a child in that moment all of the woman fall on I and begin to shout such thing ah it be so dreadful that i shall never have any child that such thing be not for such a dishcloth as i and many other thing which i can not repeat i do not wish to repeat they i do not even understand they she breast be move by sobbing he become pale and seize she by the shoulder commence to cover she face with kiss say : it be my fault you suffer through I listen we will go very far from here where no one know we where everybody will greet you and you shall be happy only one thing do not come to they mind : to be marry when pascal 's mother speak to he about it they do not listen to it it be not dictate to she by woman 's modesty to he by the care for she and the desire to shelter she from insult why because zolum like it that way but perhaps he care to show what tragical result be produce by illegitimate marriage not at all he share the doctor 's and clotilde 's opinion be they marry there would be no drama and the author wish to have it that be the reason then come the doctor 's insolvency one must separate this separation become the misfortune of they life : the doctor will die of it both feel that it will not be the end they do not wish it -- and they do not think of any means which would forever affirm they mutual dependence and change the departure for only a momentary separation but not for eternal farewell : and they do not marry they do not have any religion therefore they do not wish for any priest it be logical but why do they not wish for a _ maire _ the question remain without a answer here besides lack of moral sense there be something more the lack of common sense the novel be not only immoral but at the same time it be a bad shanty build of rotten piece of wood not hold together unable to suffer any contact with logic and common sense in such mud of nonsense even the talent be drown one thing remain : the poison flow as usual in the soul of the reader the mind become familiar with the evil and cease to despise it the poison lick spoil the simplicity of the soul moral impression and that sense of conscience which distinguish the bad from the good the doctor die from languish after clotilde she come back under the old roof and take care of the child nothing of that which the doctor sow in she soul have perish on the contrary everything grow very well she love the life she also love it now she be resign to it entirely not through resignation but because she acknowledge it -- and the more she think of it rock in she lap the child without a name she acknowledge more such be the end of rougon-macquart but such a end be a new surprise here we have before we nineteen volume and in those volume as zolum himself say _ tant de boue tant de larmes c ' était à se demander si d'un coup de foudre il n'aurait pas mieux valu balayer cette fourmilière gatée et miserable _ and it be true any one who will read those volume come to the conclusion that life be a blindly mechanical and exasperating process in which one must take part because one can not avoid it there be more mud in it than green grass more corruption than wholesomeness more odor of corpse than perfume of flower more illness more madness and more crime than health and virtue it be a gehenna not only dreadful but also abominable the hair rise on the head and in the mean while the mouth be wet and the question come will it not be better that a thunderbolt destroy _ cette fourmilière gatée et miserable _ there can not be any other conclusion because any other would be a madman 's mental aberration the breaking of the rule of sense and logic and now do you know how the cycle of these novel really end by a hymn in the worship of life here one 's hand drop it will be useless work to show again that the author come to a conclusion which be illogical with he whole work god bless he but he must not be astonish if he be abandon by he pupil the people must think accord to rule of logic and as in the mean while they must live consequently they wish to get some consolation in this life master of zolum 's kind give they only corruption chaos disgust for life and despair they rationalism can not prove anything else and if it do it would be with too much zeal it would overstep the limit to-day the suffocate need some pure air the doubt one some hope tormented by uneasiness some quietude therefore they be do well when they turn therefrom where the hope and peace flow there where they bless they and where they say to they as to lazarus : _ tolle grabatum tuum et ambula _ by this one can explain to-day 's evolution whose wave flow to all part of the world accord to my opinion poetry as well as novel must pass through it -- even more : they must quicken it and make it more powerful one can not continue any longer that way on a exhaust field only weed grow the novel must strengthen the life not shake it make it nobler not soil it carry good news and not bad it do not matter whether this which i say here please any one or not because i believe that i feel the great and urgent need of the human soul which cry for a change part third whose fault _ a dramatic picture in one act _ character : jadwiga karlowiecka leon -- a painter a servant in the house of jadwiga karlowiecka scene i servant -- the lady will be here in a minute leon -lrb- alone -rrb- -- i can not overcome my emotion nor can i tranquillize the throbbing of my heart three time have i touch the bell and three time have i wish to retreat i be troubled why do she wish to see I -lrb- take out a letter -rrb- be so kind as to come to see I on a very important matter in spite of all that have happen i hope you will not refuse to grant the request of -- a woman jadwiga karlowiecka perhaps it would have be better and more honest to have leave this letter without a answer but i see that i have cheat myself in think that nothing will happen and that it would be brutal of I not to come the soul -- poor moth -- fly toward the light which may burn but can neither warm nor light it what have attract I here be it love can i answer the question as to whether i still love this woman -- so unlike my pure sweetheart of former year -- this half lioness whose reputation have be tear to shred by human tongue no it be rather some painful curiosity which have attract I here it be the unmeasurable grief which in two year i have be unable to appease that desire for a full explanation : why have be repeat over and over during my sleepless night and then let she see this emaciated face -- let she look from nearby on that broken life i could not resist such vengeance be my right i shall be proud enough to set my tooth to stifle all groan what be do can not be undo and i swear to myself that it shall never be do again scene ii jadwiga -lrb- enter -rrb- -- you must excuse I for keep you wait leon -- it be my fault i come too early although i try to be exact jadwiga -- no i must be frank and tell you how it happen in former time we be such dear friend and then we have not see each other for two year i ask you to come but i be not sure that you would grant my request therefore -- when the bell ring -- after two year -- -lrb- smile -rrb- i need a few moment to overcome the emotion i think it be necessary for both of we leon -- i be calm madam and i listen to you jadwiga -- i wish also that we should greet each other like people who have forget about the past who know that it will not return and to be at once on the footing of good friend i do not dare say like brother and sister therefore sir here be my hand and now be seat and tell I if you accept my proposition leon -- i leave that to you jadwiga -- if that be so then i must tell you that such a agreement base on mutual well-wishing exclude excessive solemnity we must be natural sincere and frank leon -- frankly speak it will be a little difficult still jadwiga -- it would be difficult if there be no condition : not a word about the past if we both keep to this a good understanding will return of itself and in time we may become good friend what have you be do during the past two year leon -- i have be push the wheelbarrow of life as all mortal do every Monday i have think that in a week there would be another Monday i assure you that there be some distraction in see the day spin out like a thread from a ball and how everything that have happen go away and gradually disappear like a migratory bird jadwiga -- such distraction be good for those to whom another bird come with a song of the future but otherwise -- leon -- otherwise it be perhaps better to think that when all thread will be spin out from the ball there will remain nothing sometimes the reminiscence be very painful happily time dull they edge or they would prick like thorn jadwiga -- or would burn like fire leon -- all-wise nature give we some remedy for it a fire which be not replenish must die and the ash do not burn jadwiga -- we be unwillingly chase a bird which have fly away enough of it have you paint much lately leon -- i do nothing else i think and i paint it be true that until now my thought have produce nothing and i have paint a very little but it be not my fault better be good enough to tell I what have cause you to call I here jadwiga -- it will come by itself in the first place i should be justify in so do by a desire to see a great man you be now a artist whose fame be world-wide leon -- i would appear to be guilty of conceit but i honestly think that i be not the last pawn on the chessboard in the drawing-room and that be perhaps the reason why i have be think during the past two year and could not understand why i be throw aside like a common pawn jadwiga -- and where be we agreement leon -- it be a story tell in a subjective way by a third person accord to the second clause in we agreement -- sincerity -- i must add that i be already accustom to my wheelbarrow jadwiga -- we must not speak about it leon -- i warn you -- it will be difficult jadwiga -- it should be more easy for you you the elect of art and the pride of the whole nation and in the mean while its spoil child -- you can live with you whole soul in the present and in the future from the flower strew under one 's foot one can always choose the most beautiful or not choose at all but always tread upon they leon -- if one do not stumble jadwiga -- no to advance toward immortality leon -- longing for death while on the road jadwiga -- it be a excess of pessimism for a man who say that he be accustom to he wheelbarrow leon -- i wish only to show the other side of the medal and then you must remember madam that to-day pessimism be the mode you must not take my word too seriously in a drawing-room one string the word of a conversation like bead on a thread -- it be only play jadwiga -- let we play then -lrb- after a while -rrb- ah how many change i can not comprehend if two year ago some one have tell I that to-day we would sit far apart from each other and chat as we do and look at each other with watchful curiosity like two people perfectly strange to each other i could not have believe truly it be utterly amusing leon -- it would not be proper for I to remind you of we agreement jadwiga -- but nevertheless you do remind I thank you my nerve be guilty for this melancholy turn of the conversation but i feel it be not become to I but pray be assure that i shall not again enter that thorny path if for no other reason than that of self-love i too amuse myself as best i can and i return to my reminiscence only when weary for several day i have be greatly wearied leon -- be that the reason why you ask I to come here i be afraid that i will not be a abundant source of distraction my disposition be not very gay and i be too proud too honest and -- too costly to become a plaything permit I to leave you jadwiga -- you must forgive I i do not mean to offend you without go back to the past i can tell you that pride be you greatest fault and if it be not for that pride many sad thing would not have happen leon -- without go back to the past i must answer you that it be the only sail which remain on my boat the other be tear by the wind of life if it be not for this last sail i should have sink long ago jadwiga -- and i think that it be a rock on which have be wreck not only you boat -- but no matter so much the worse for those who believe in fair weather and a smooth sea we must at least prevent ourselves from now be carry where we do not wish to sail leon -- and where the sandy bank be sure -- jadwiga -- what strange conversation it seem to I that it be a net in which the truth lie at the bottom struggle in vain to break the mesh but perhaps it be better so leon -- much better madam you have write I that you wish to see I on a important matter i be listen jadwiga -- yes -lrb- smile -rrb- it be permit a society woman to have she fancy and desire -- sometimes inexplicable fancy and it be not permit a gentleman to refuse they well then i wish to see my portrait paint by the great painter leon would you be willing to paint it leon -- madam -- jadwiga -- ah the lion 's forehead frown as if my wish be a insult leon -- i think that the fancy of a society woman be indeed inexplicable and do not look like joke at all jadwiga -- this question have two side the first be the formal side and it show itself thus : mme jadwiga karlowiecka most earnestly ask the great painter leon to make she portrait that be all the painter leon who it be know paint lot of portrait have no good reason for refuse the painter can not refuse to make a portrait any more than a physician can refuse he assistance there remain the other side -- the past but we agree that it be a forbid subject leon -- permit I madam -- jadwiga -lrb- interrupt -rrb- -- pray not a word about the past -lrb- she laugh -rrb- ah my woman 's diplomacy know how to tie a knot and draw tight the end of it how you embarrassment please I but there be something quite different let we suppose that i be a vain person full of womanly self-love full of petty jealousy and envy well you have paint the portrait of mme zofium and of helena i wish to have mine also one do not refuse the woman such thing report of you fame come to I from all side i hear all around I the word : we great painter -- we master society lionize you god know how many breast sigh for you every one can have you work every one can approach you see you be proud of you i alone you playmate you old friend i alone be as though excommunicate leon -- but mme jadwiga -- jadwiga -- ah you have call I by my name i thank you and beg you pardon it be the self-love of a woman nothing more it be my nerve do not be frighten you see how dangerous it be to irritate I after one of my mood i be unbearable i will give you three day to think the matter over if you do not wish to come write I then -lrb- she laugh sadly -rrb- only i warn you that if you will neither come nor write I i will tell every one that you be afraid of I and so i will satisfy my self-love in the mean time for the sake of my nerve you must not tell I that you refuse my request i be a little bit ill -- consequently capricious leon -- in three day you shall have my answer -lrb- rise -rrb- and now i will say good-bye jadwiga -- wait a moment this be not so easy as you think truly i would think you be afraid of I it be true that they say i be a coquette a flirt i know they talk very badly about I besides we be good acquaintance who have not see each other for two year let we then talk a little let I take you hat yes that be it now let we talk i be sure we may become friend again as for I at least -- what do you intend to do in the future besides paint my portrait leon -- the conversation about I would not last long let we take another more interesting subject you have better talk about yourself -- about you life you family jadwiga -- as for my husband he be as usual in chantilly my mother be dead poor mama she be so fond of you -- she love you very much -lrb- after a pause -rrb- in fact as you see i have grow old and change greatly leon -- at you age the word i have grow old be only a daring challenge throw by a woman who be not afraid that she would be believe jadwiga -- i be twenty-three year old so i be not talk about age in year but age in moral i feel that to-day i be not like that jadwiga of kalinowice whom you use to know so well good gracious when i think to-day of that confidence and faith in life -- those girlish illusion -- the illusion of a young person who wish to be happy and make other happy that enthusiasm for everything good and noble where have all that go -- where have it disappear and to think that i be -- well a honest wild-flower -- and to-day -- leon -- and to-day a society woman jadwiga -- to-day when i see such a sceptical smile as i see a few moment ago on you lip it seem to I that i be ridiculous -- very often so -- even always when i sit at some ideal embroidery and when i begin to work at some withered flower on the forget despise canvas of the past it be a curious and old fashion from time when faithfulness be not look seriously on and people sing of filon leon -- at that moment you be speak accord to the latest mode jadwiga -- shall i weep or try to tie the broken thread well the time change i can assure you that i have some better moment during which i laugh heartily at everything -lrb- hand he a cigarette -rrb- do you

would not be as frank with any one else as i be with you and then i do not complain i try to surround myself with youth who pretend they be in love with I there be not a penny-worth of truth in all of it -- they all lie but the form of the lie be beautiful because they be all well-bred people the count skorzewskus visit I also -- you must have hear of he i be sure i recommend he to you as a model for adonis ha ha you do not recognize the wild-flower of kalinowice leon -- no i do not recognize it jadwiga -- no but the life flower leon -- as a joke -- jadwiga -- at which one can not laugh always if we century be not sceptical i should think myself wild romantic try to drown despair but the romantic time have pass away therefore frankly speak i only try to fill up a great nothing i also spin

a boat without a helm without oar and without light toward which to sail and the heart long for happiness you must understand that a woman must be love and must love some one in the world and if she lack true love she seize the first pretext of it -- the first shadow leon -lrb- with animation -rrb- -- poor thing jadwiga -- do not smile in that ironical way be better be less severe with I i do not even have any one to complain and that be why i do not drive away count skorzewskus i detest he beauty i despise he perverse mind but i do not drive he away because he be a skilful actor and because

pour over they and the evening twilight be in the sky in its light the whole acropoli be drown the white wall of propyleo parthenon and erechtheum seem pink and as light as though the marble have lose all its weight or as if they be apparition of a dream the point of the spear of the gigantic athena promatho shine in the twilight like a light torch over attica in the space hawk be fly toward they nest in the rock to pass the night the people return in crowd from work in the field on the road to piraeus mule and donkey carry basket full of olive and wine-grape behind they in the red cloud of

singing kiss apollo in whose eye nothing under the sun be fairer than a woman turn to herme and say : o maya 's son how beautiful be the athenian woman and virtuous too my radiant answer herme they be under palla ' tutelage the silver-arrowed god become silent and listen look into space in the mean while the twilight be slowly quench movement gradually stop scythian slave shut the gate and finally all become quiet the ambrosian night throw on the acropoli city and environs a dark veil embroider with star but the dusk do not last long soon from the archipelago appear the pale selene and begin to sail like a silvery boat in the heavenly space and then the wall of the acropoli light again only they beam now with a pale-green light and look even more like a vision in a dream one must agree say apollo that athena have choose for herself a charming home oh she be very clever who could choose better answer herme then zeus have a fancy for she if she wish for anything she have only to caress he beard and immediately he call she tritogenia dear daughter he promise she everything and permit everything tritogenia bore I sometimes grumble latona 's son yes i have notice that she become very tedious answer herme like a old peripatetic and then she be virtuous to the ridiculous like my sister artemi or as she servant the athenian woman the radiant turn to the argo-robber mercury : it be the second time you mention as though purposely the virtue of the athenian woman be they really so virtuous fabulously so o son of latona be it possible say apollo do you think that there be in town one woman who could resist I i do think so I apollo you my radiant i who should bewitch she with poetry and charm she with song and music you my radiant if you be a honest god i would be willing to

all condition be understand and i can show you eryfile both god be immediately carry through the air from pnyx and in a few moment they be over a house situate not far from stoa the argo-robber raise the whole roof with he powerful hand as easily as a woman cooking a dinner raise a cover from a saucepan and point to a woman sit in a store close from the street by a copper gate say : look apollo look and be astonished never attica -- never the whole of greece produce a lovelier flower than be this woman she sit by a table on which be a light lamp and be write something on marble table she long droop eyelash throw a shadow on she cheek but from time to time she raise she head and she eye as though she be try to remember what she have to write and then one could see she beautiful eye so blue that compare with they the turquoise depths of the archipelago would look pale and fade she face be white as the sea-foam pink as the dawn with purplish syrian lip and wave of golden hair she be beautiful the most beautiful be on earth -- beautiful as the dawn as a flower as light as song this be eryfile when she drop she eye she appear quiet and sweet when she lift they inspire the radiant 's divine knee begin to tremble suddenly he lean he head on herme ' shoulder and whisper : herme i love she this one or none herme smile ironically and would have rub he hand for joy under cover of he robe if he have not hold in he right hand the caduceus in the mean while the golden-haired woman take a new tablet and begin to write on it she divine lip be disclose and she voice whisper it be like the sound of apollo 's lyre the member of the areopagus melanocle for the bread for two month forty drachma and four obol let we write in round number forty-six drachma by athena let we write fifty my husband will be satisfied ah that melanocle if you be not in a position to bother we about false weight i never would give you credit but we must keep peace with that locust apollo do not listen to the word he be intoxicate with the woman 's voice the charm of she figure and whisper : this one or none the golden-haired woman speak again write further : alcibiade for cake on honey from hymettus for hetera chrysali three mina he never verify bill and then he once give I in stoa a slap on the shoulder -- we will write four mina he be stupid let he pay for it and then that chrysali she must feed with cake she carp in the pond or perhaps alcibiade make she fat purposely in order to sell she afterwards to a phoenician merchant for a ivory ring for he harness again apollo pay no attention to the word -- he be enchant with the voice alone and whisper to herme : this one or none but maya 's son suddenly cover the house the apparition disappear and it seem to the radiant apollo that with it disappear the star that the moon become black and the whole world be cover with the darkness of chimera when shall we decide the wager ask herme immediately to-day during she husband 's absence she sleep in the store you can stand in the street before the door if she raise the curtain and open the gate i have lose my wager you have lose it already exclaim the far-darting apollo the summer lightning do not pass from the east to the west as quickly as he rush over the salt wave of the archipelago there he ask amphitrite for a empty turtle-shell put around it the ray of the sun and return to athen with a ready formiga in the city everything be already quiet the light be out and only the house and temple shine white in the light of the moon which have rise high in the sky the store be dark and in it behind a gate and a curtain the beautiful eryfile be asleep apollo the radiant begin to touch the string of he lyre wish to awake softly he beloved he play at first as gently as swarm of mosquito singing on a summer evening on illi but the song become gradually stronger like a brook in the mountain after a rain then more powerful sweeter more intoxicating and it fill the air voluptuously the secret athena 's bird fly softly from the acropoli and sit motionless on the nearest column suddenly a bare arm worthy of phidia or praxitele whiter than pantelican marble draw aside the curtain the radiant 's heart stop beat with emotion and then eryfile 's voice resound : ha you booby why do you wander about and make a noise during the night i have be work all day and now they will not let I sleep eryfile eryfile exclaim silver-arrowed and he begin to sing : from lofty peak of parna -- where there ring in all the glory of light 's brilliant ray the grand sweet song which inspire muse sing to I by turn in rapture and praise -- i worshiped god -- i fly fly to thee eryfile and on thy bosom white i shall rest and the eternity will be a moment to I -- the god of light by

much light from he person that all the earth be light but eryfile see this exclaim : that scurrilous fellow have hide a lantern under he robe and he try to make I believe that he be a god o daughter of mighty dio they press we with tax but there be no scythian guard to protect we from such stupid fellow apollo who do not wish yet to acknowledge defeat sing further : ah open thine arm -- round gleaming white -- to thee eternal glory i will give over goddess of earth fair and bright thy name above immortal shall live i kiss the dainty bloom of thy cheek to thy lustrous eye the love-light i bring from the mass of thy silken hair i speak to thy beauty peerless one i sing white pearl be thy ruby lip between -- with might of godly word i thee endow a eloquence for which a grecian queen would gladly give the crown from she brow ah open open thine arm the azure from the sea i will take twilight its wealth of purple shall give too twinkling star shall add the spark which they make and flower shall yield they perfume and dew by fairy touch light as a caress make from all this material so bright my beloved rainbow in chipryd 's rich dress thou shalt be clothe by the god of light and

stand motionless over athen and when apollo have finish a light wind arise and carry the song throughout the whole of greece and wherever a child in the cradle hear only a tone of it that child become a poet but before latona 's son have finish he divine singing the angry eryfile begin to scream : what a ass he try to bribe I with flower and dew do you think that you be privileged because my husband be not at home what a pity that we servant be not at hand i would give you a good lesson but wait i will teach you to wander during the night with song so say she seize a pot of dough and

laugh turn somersault and twirl he caduceus but when the sorrowful son of latona approach he the foxy patron of merchant simulated compassion and say : i be sorry you have lose o puissant archer go away you rascal answer the angry apollo i shall go when you give I lampecja may cerberus bite you calf i shall not give you lampecja and i tell you to go away or i will twist you neck the argo-robber

that you can harm I but happily there be some one who be stronger than you and he will judge we radiant i call you to the judgment of chronid come with I apollo fear the name of chronid he do not care

of god and of people i be right he be think but if zeus be arouse in a bad humor and if before hear we he should take we each by a leg and throw we some three hundred athenian stadium it would be very bad he have some consideration for apollo but he would treat I without ceremony although i be he son too but maya 's son fear in vain chronid wait joyfully on the earth for he have pass a pleasant
