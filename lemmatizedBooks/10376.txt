i be with she she seldom weep before I ii the legend during the summer day my mother build she fire in the shadow of we wigwam in the early morning we simple breakfast be spread upon the grass west of we tepee at the farthest point of the shade my mother sit beside she fire toast a savory piece of dry meat near she i sit upon my foot eat my dry meat with unleavened bread and drinking strong black coffee the morning meal be we quiet hour when we two be entirely alone at noon several who chance to be pass by stop to rest and to share we luncheon with we for they be sure of we hospitality my uncle whose death my mother ever lament be one of we nation 's bravest warrior he name be on the lip of old man when talk of the proud feat of valor and it be mention by younger man too in connection with deed of gallantry old woman praise he for he kindness toward they young woman hold he up as a ideal to they sweetheart every one love he and my mother worship he memory thus it happen that even stranger be sure of welcome in we lodge if they but ask a favor in my uncle 's name though i hear many strange experience relate by these wayfarer i love best the evening meal for that be the time old legend be tell i be always glad when the sun hang low in the west for then my mother send I to invite the neighbor old man and woman to eat supper with we run all the way to the wigwam i halt shyly at the entrance sometimes i stand long moment without say a word it be not any fear that make I so dumb when out upon such a happy errand nor be it that i wish to withhold the invitation for it be all i could do to observe this very proper silence but it be a sense of the atmosphere to assure myself that i should not hinder other plan my mother use to say to I as i be almost bound away for the old people : wait a moment before you invite any one if other plan be be discuss do not interfere but go elsewhere the old folk know the meaning of my pause and often they coax my confidence by ask what do you seek little granddaughter my mother say you be to come to we tepee this evening i instantly explode and breathe the freer afterwards yes yes gladly gladly i shall come each reply rise at once and carry they blanket across one shoulder they flock leisurely from they various wigwam toward we dwelling my mission do i run back skip and jump with delight all out of breath i tell my mother almost the exact word of the answer to my invitation frequently she ask what be they do when you enter they tepee this teach I to remember all i see at a single glance often i tell my mother my impression without be question while in the neighbor wigwam sometimes a old indian woman ask I what be you mother do unless my mother have caution I not to tell i generally answer she question without reserve at the arrival of we guest i sit close to my mother and do not leave she side without first ask she consent i eat my supper in quiet listen patiently to the talk of the old people wish all the time that they would begin the story i love best at last when i could not wait any longer i whisper in my mother 's ear ask they to tell a iktomus story mother soothing my impatience my mother say aloud my little daughter be anxious to hear you legend by this time all be through eating and the evening be fast deepen into twilight as each in turn begin to tell a legend i pillowed my head in my mother 's lap and lie flat upon my back i watch the star as they peep down upon I one by one the increase interest of the tale arouse I and i sit up eagerly listen to every word the old woman make funny remark and laugh so heartily that i could not help join they the distant howling of a pack of wolf or the hooting of a owl in the river bottom frighten I and i nestled into my mother 's lap she add some dry stick to the open fire and the bright flame leap up into the face of the old folk as they sit around in a great circle on such a evening i remember the glare of the fire shone on a tattooed star upon the brow of the old warrior who be tell a story i watch he curiously as he make he unconscious gesture the blue star upon he bronzed forehead be a puzzle to I look about i see two parallel line on the chin of one of the old woman the rest have none i examine my mother 's face but find no sign there after the warrior 's story be finish i ask the old woman the meaning of the blue line on she chin look all the while out of the corner of my eye at the warrior with the star on he forehead i be a little afraid that he would rebuke I for my boldness here the old woman begin : why my grandchild they be sign -- secret sign i dare not tell you i shall however tell you a wonderful story about a woman who have a cross tattoo upon each of she cheek it be a long story of a woman whose magic power lay hide behind the mark upon she face i fall asleep before the story be complete ever after that night i feel suspicious of tattooed people wherever i see one i glance furtively at the mark and round about it wonder what terrible magic power be cover there it be rarely that such a fearful story as this one be tell by the camp fire its impression be so acute that the picture still remain vividly clear and pronounced iii the beadwork soon after breakfast mother sometimes begin she beadwork on a bright clear day she pull out the wooden peg that pin the skirt of we wigwam to the ground and roll the canvas part way up on its frame of slender pole then the cool morning breeze sweep freely through we dwelling now and then waft the perfume of sweet grass from newly burnt prairie untie the long tasseled string that bind a small brown buckskin bag my mother spread upon a mat beside she bunch of color bead just as a artist arrange the paint upon he palette on a lapboard she smooth out a double sheet of soft white buckskin and draw from a beaded case that hang on the left of she wide belt a long narrow blade she trim the buckskin into shape often she work upon small moccasin for she small daughter then i become intensely interested in she design with a proud beam face i watch she work in imagination i see myself walk in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasin i feel the envious eye of my playmate upon the pretty red bead decorate my foot close beside my mother i sit on a rug with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and a awl in the other this be the beginning of my practical observation lesson in the art of beadwork from a skein of finely twisted thread of silvery sinew my mother pull out a single one with a awl she pierce the buckskin and skillfully thread it with the white sinew pick up the tiny bead one by one she string they with the point of she thread always twist it carefully after every stitch it take many trial before i learn how to knot my sinew thread on the point of my finger as i see she do then the next difficulty be in keep my thread stiffly twist so that i could easily string my bead upon it my mother require of I original design for my lesson in bead at first i frequently ensnare many a sunny hour into work a long design soon i learn from self-inflicted punishment to refrain from draw complex pattern for i have to finish whatever i begin after some experience i usually draw easy and simple cross and square these be some of the set form my original design be not always symmetrical nor sufficiently characteristic two fault with which my mother have little patience the quietness of she oversight make I feel strongly responsible and dependent upon my own judgment she treat I as a dignified little individual as long as i be on my good behavior and how humiliate i be when some boldness of mine draw forth a rebuke from she in the choice of color she leave I to my own taste i be please with a outline of yellow upon a background of dark blue or a combination of red and myrtle-green there be another of red with a bluish-gray that be more conventionally use when i become a little familiar with design and the various please combination of color a harder lesson be give I it be the sewing on instead of bead some tinted porcupine quill moisten and flatten between the nail of the thumb and forefinger my mother cut off the prickly end and burn they at once in the center fire these sharp point be poisonous and work into the flesh wherever they lodge for this reason my mother say i should not do much alone in quill until i be as tall as my cousin warca-ziwin always after these confine lesson i be wild with surplus spirit and find joyous relief in run loose in the open again many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmate roam over the hill with I we each carry a light sharpened rod about four foot long with which we pry up certain sweet root when we have eat all the choice root we chance upon we shoulder we rod and stray off into patch of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossom we find little crystal drop of gum drop by drop we gather this nature 's rock-candy until each of we could boast of a lump the size of a small bird 's egg soon satiated with its woody flavor we toss away we gum to return again to the sweet root i remember well how we use to exchange we necklace bead belt and sometimes even we moccasin we pretend to offer they as gift to one another we delight in impersonate we own mother we talk of thing we have hear they say in they conversation we imitate they various manners even to the inflection of they voice in the lap of the prairie we seat ourselves upon we foot and lean we paint cheek in the palm of we hand we rest we elbow on we knee and bent forward as old woman be most accustomed to do while one be tell of some heroic deed recently do by a near relative the rest of we listen attentively and exclaim in undertone han han -lrb- yes yes -rrb- whenever the speaker pause for breath or sometimes for we sympathy as the discourse become more thrilling accord to we idea we raise we voice in these interjection in these impersonation we parent be lead to say only those thing that be in common favor no matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearse the mere shift of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by be sufficient to change we impulse and soon we be all chase the great shadow that play among the hill we shout and whoop in the chase laughing and call to one another we be like little sportive nymph on that dakota sea of roll green on one occasion i forget the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow standing straight and still i begin to glide after it put out one foot cautiously when with the greatest care i set my foot in advance of myself my shadow creep onward too then again i try it this time with the other foot still again my shadow escape I i begin to run and away fly my shadow always just a step beyond I faster and faster i run set my tooth and clench my fist determine to overtake my own fleet shadow but ever swifter it glide before I while i be grow breathless and hot slacken my speed i be greatly vex that my shadow should check its pace also daring it to the utmost as i think i sit down upon a rock imbed in the hillside so my shadow have the impudence to sit down beside I now my comrade catch up with I and begin to ask why i be run away so fast oh i be chase my shadow do not you ever do that i inquire surprised that they should not understand they plant they moccasined foot firmly upon my shadow to stay it and i arise again my shadow slip away and move as often as i do then we give up try to catch my shadow before this peculiar experience i have no distinct memory of have recognize any vital bond between myself and my own shadow i never give it a afterthought return we borrow belt and trinket we ramble homeward that evening as on other evening i go to sleep over my legend iv the coffee-making one summer afternoon my mother leave I alone in we wigwam while she go across the way to my aunt 's dwelling i do not much like to stay alone in we tepee for i fear a tall broad-shouldered crazy man some forty year old who walk loose among the hill wiyaka-napbina -lrb- wearer of a feather necklace -rrb- be harmless and whenever he come into a wigwam he be drive there by extreme hunger he go nude except for the half of a red blanket he girdle around he waist in one tawny arm he use to carry a heavy bunch of wild sunflower that he gather in he aimless rambling he black hair be mat by the wind and scorch into a dry red by the constant summer sun as he take great stride place one brown bare foot directly in front of the other he swing he long lean arm to and fro frequently he pause in he walk and gaze far backward shade he eye with he hand he be under the belief that a evil spirit be haunt he step this be what my mother tell I once when i sneer at such a silly big man i be brave when my mother be near by and wiyaka-napbina walk farther and farther away pity the man my child i know he when he be a brave and handsome youth he be overtake by a malicious spirit among the hill one day when he go hither and thither after he pony since then he can not stay away from the hill she say i feel so sorry for the man in he misfortune that i prayed to the great spirit to restore he but though i pity he at a distance i be still afraid of he when he appear near we wigwam thus when my mother leave I by myself that afternoon i sit in a fearful mood within we tepee i recall all i have ever hear about wiyaka-napbina and i try to assure myself that though he might pass near by he would not come to we wigwam because there be no little girl around we grounds just then from without a hand lift the canvas covering of the entrance the shadow of a man fall within the wigwam and a large roughly moccasined foot be plant inside for a moment i do not dare to breathe or stir for i think that could be no other than wiyaka-napbina the next instant i sigh aloud in relief it be a old grandfather who have often tell I iktomi legend where be you mother my little grandchild be he first word my mother be soon come back from my aunt 's tepee i reply then i shall wait awhile for she return he say cross he foot and seat himself upon a mat at once i begin to play the part of a generous hostess i turn to my mother 's coffeepot lift the lid i find nothing but coffee grounds in the bottom i set the pot on a heap of cold ash in the center and fill it half full of warm missourus river water during this performance i feel conscious of be watch then break off a small piece of we unleavened bread i place it in a bowl turn soon to the coffeepot which would never have boil on a dead fire have i wait forever i pour out a cup of worse than muddy warm water carry the bowl in one hand and cup in the other i hand the light luncheon to the old warrior i offer they to he with the air of bestow generous hospitality how how he say and place the dish on the ground in front of he cross foot he nibble at the bread and sip from the cup i sit back against a pole watch he i be proud to have succeed so well in serve refreshment to a guest all by myself before the old warrior have finish eat my mother enter immediately she wonder where i have find coffee for she know i have never make any and that she have leave the coffeepot empty answer the question in my mother 's eye the warrior remark my granddaughter make coffee on a heap of dead ash and serve I the moment i come they both laugh and mother say wait a little longer and i shall build a fire she mean to make some real coffee but neither she nor the warrior whom the law of we custom have compel to partake of my insipid hospitality say anything to embarrass I they treat my best judgment poor as it be with the utmost respect it be not till long year afterward that i learn how ridiculous a thing i have do v the dead man 's plum bush one autumn afternoon many people come streaming toward the dwelling of we near neighbor with paint face and wear broad white bosom of elk 's tooth they hurry down the narrow footpath to haraka wambdus 's wigwam young mother hold they child by the hand and half pull they along in they haste they overtake and pass by the bent old grandmother who be trudge along with crooked cane toward the center of excitement most of the young brave gallop hither on they pony toothless warrior like the old woman come more slowly though mount on lively pony they sit proudly erect on they horse they wear they eagle plume and wave they various trophy of former war in front of the wigwam a great fire be build and several large black kettle of venison be suspend over it the crowd be seat about it on the grass in a great circle behind they some of the brave stand lean against the neck of they pony they tall figure drape in loose robe which be well draw over they eye young girl with they face glowing like bright red autumn leave they glossy braid fall over each ear sit coquettishly beside they chaperon it be a custom for young indian woman to invite some older relative to escort they to the public feast though it be not a iron law it be generally observe haraka wambdus be a strong young brave who have just return from he first battle a warrior he near relative to celebrate he new rank be spread a feast to which the whole of the indian village be invite hold my pretty striped blanket in readiness to throw over my shoulder i grow more and more restless as i watch the gay throng assemble my mother be busily broil a wild duck that my aunt have that morning bring over mother mother why do you stop to cook a small meal when we be invite to a feast i ask with a snarl in my voice my child learn to wait on we way to the celebration we be go to stop at chanyu 's wigwam he aged mother-in-law be lie very ill and i think she would like a taste of this small game have once see the suffering on the thin pinched feature of this die woman i feel a momentary shame that i have not remember she before on we way i run ahead of my mother and be reach out my hand to pick some purple plum that grow on a small bush when i be check by a low sh from my mother why mother i want to taste the plum i exclaimed as i drop my hand to my side in disappointment never pluck a single plum from this brush my child for its root be wrap around a indian 's skeleton a brave be bury here while he live he be so fond of play the game of striped plum seed that at he death he set of plum seed be bury in he hand from they spring up this little bush eye the forbid fruit i trod lightly on the sacred ground and dare to speak only in whisper until we have go many pace from it after that time i halt in my rambling whenever i come in sight of the plum bush i grow sober with awe and be alert to hear a long-drawn-out whistle rise from the root of it though i have never hear with my own ear this strange whistle of depart spirit yet i have listen so frequently to hear the old folk describe it that i know i should recognize it at once the lasting impression of that day as i recall it now be what my mother tell I about the dead man 's plum bush vi the ground squirrel in the busy autumn day my cousin warca-ziwin 's mother come to we wigwam to help my mother preserve food for we winter use i be very fond of my aunt because she be not so quiet as my mother though she be older she be more jovial and less reserved she be slender and remarkably erect while my mother 's hair be heavy and black my aunt have unusually thin lock ever since i know she she wear a string of large blue bead around she neck -- bead that be precious because my uncle have give they to she when she be a younger woman she have a peculiar swing in she gait cause by a long stride rarely natural to so slight a figure it be during my aunt 's visit with we that my mother forget she accustomed quietness often laugh heartily at some of my aunt 's witty remark i love my aunt threefold : for she hearty laughter for the cheerfulness she cause my mother and most of all for the time she dry my tear and hold I in she lap when my mother have reprove I early in the cool morning just as the yellow rim of the sun rise above the hill we be up and eat we breakfast we awake so early that we see the sacred hour when a misty smoke hang over a pit surround by a impassable sinking mire this strange smoke appear every morning both winter and summer but most visibly in midwinter it rise immediately above the marshy spot by the time the full face of the sun appear above the eastern horizon the smoke vanish even very old man who have know this country the longest say that the smoke from this pit have never fail a single day to rise heavenward as i frolic about we dwelling i use to stop suddenly and with a fearful awe watch the smoking of the unknown fire while the vapor be visible i be afraid to go very far from we wigwam unless i go with my mother from a field in the fertile river bottom my mother and aunt gather a abundant supply of corn near we tepee they spread a large canvas upon the grass and dry they sweet corn in it i be leave to watch the corn that nothing should disturb it i play around it with doll make of ear of corn i braided they soft fine silk for hair and give they blanket as various as the scrap i find in my mother 's workbag there be a little stranger with a black-and-yellow-striped coat that use to come to the dry corn it be a little ground squirrel who be so fearless of I that he come to one corner of the canvas and carry away as much of the sweet corn as he could hold i want very much to catch he and rub he pretty fur back but my mother say he would be so frightened if i catch he that he would bite my finger so i be as content as he to keep the corn between we every morning he come for more corn some evening i have see he creep about we grounds and when i give a sudden whoop of recognition he run quickly out of sight when mother have dry all the corn she wish then she slice great pumpkin into thin ring and these she double and link together into long chain she hang they on a pole that stretch between two fork post the wind and sun soon thoroughly dry the chain of pumpkin then she pack they away in a case of thick and stiff buckskin in the sun and wind she also dry many wild fruit -- cherry berry and plum but chiefest among my early recollection of autumn be that one of the corn dry and the ground squirrel i have few memory of winter day at this period of my life though many of the summer there be one only which i can recall some missionary give I a little bag of marble they be all size and color among they be some of color glass walk with my mother to the river on a late winter day we find great chunk of ice pile all along the bank the ice on the river be float in huge piece as i stand beside one large block i notice for the first time the color of the rainbow in the crystal ice immediately i thought of my glass marble at home with my bare finger i try to pick out some of the color for they seem so near the surface but my finger begin to sting with the intense cold and i have to bite they hard to keep from cry from that day on for many a moon i believe that glass marble have river ice inside of they vii the big red apple the first turn away from the easy natural flow of my life occur in a early spring it be in my eighth year in the month of march i afterward learn at this age i know but one language and that be my mother 's native tongue from some of my playmate i hear that two paleface missionary be in we village they be from that class of white man who wear big hat and carry large heart they say run direct to my mother i begin to question she why these two stranger be among we she tell I after i have tease much that they have come to take away indian boy and girl to the east my mother do not seem to want I to talk about they but in a day or two i glean many wonderful story from my playfellow concern the stranger mother my friend judéwin be go home with the missionary she be go to a more beautiful country than ours the paleface tell she so i say wistfully wish in my heart that i too might go mother sit in a chair and i be hang on she knee within the last two season my big brother dawée have return from a three year ' education in the east and he come back influence my mother to take a farther step from she native way of live first it be a change from the buffalo skin to the white man 's canvas that cover we wigwam now she have give up she wigwam of slender pole to live a foreigner in a home of clumsy log yes my child several other besides judéwin be go away with the paleface you brother say the missionary have inquire about he little sister she say watch my face very closely my heart thump so hard against my breast i wonder if she could hear it do he tell they to take I mother i ask fear lest dawée have forbid the paleface to see I and that my hope of go to the wonderland would be entirely blighted with a sad slow smile she answer : there i know you be wish to go because judéwin have fill you ear with the white man 's lie do not believe a word they say they word be sweet but my child they deed be bitter you will cry for I but they will not even soothe you stay with I my little one you brother dawée say that go east away from you mother be too hard a experience for he baby sister thus my mother discourage my curiosity about the land beyond we eastern horizon for it be not yet a ambition for letter that be stir I but on the follow day the missionary do come to we very house i spy they come up the footpath lead to we cottage a third man be with they but he be not my brother dawée it be another a young interpreter a paleface who have a smattering of the indian language i be ready to run out to meet they but i do not dare to displease my mother with great glee i jump up and down on we ground floor i begged my mother to open the door that they would be sure to come to we alas they come they see and they conquer judéwin have tell I of the great tree where grow red red apple and how we could reach out we hand and pick all the red apple we could eat i have never see apple tree i have never taste more than a dozen red apple in my life and when i hear of the orchard of the east i be eager to roam among they the missionary smile into my eye and pat my head i wonder how mother could say such hard word against he mother ask they if little girl may have all the red apple they want when they go east i whisper aloud in my excitement the interpreter hear I and answer : yes little girl the nice red apple be for those who pick they and you will have a ride on the iron horse if you go with these good people i have never see a train and he know it mother i be go east i like big red apple and i want to ride on the iron horse mother say yes i plead my mother say nothing the missionary wait in silence and my eye begin to blur with tear though i struggle to choke they back the corner of my mouth twitch and my mother see I i be not ready to give you any word she say to they tomorrow i shall send you my answer by my son with this they leave we alone with my mother i yield to my tear and cry aloud shake my head so as not to hear what she be say to I this be the first time i have ever be so unwilling to give up my own desire that i refuse to hearken to my mother 's voice there be a solemn silence in we home that night before i go to bed i begged the great spirit to make my mother willing i should go with the missionary the next morning come and my mother call I to she side my daughter do you still persist in wish to leave you mother she ask oh mother it be not that i wish to leave you but i want to see the wonderful eastern land i answer my dear old aunt come to we house that morning and i hear she say let she try it i hope that as usual my aunt be plead on my side my brother dawée come for mother 's decision i drop my play and creep close to my aunt yes dawée my daughter though she do not understand what it all means be anxious to go she will need a education when she be grow for then there will be fewer real dakota and many more paleface this tear she away so young from she mother be necessary if i would have she a educate woman the paleface who owe we a large debt for steal land have begin to pay a tardy justice in offer some education to we child but i know my daughter must suffer keenly in this experiment for she sake i dread to tell you my reply to the missionary go tell they that they may take my little daughter and that the great spirit shall not fail to reward they accord to they heart wrap in my heavy blanket i walk with my mother to the carriage that be soon to take we to the iron horse i be happy i meet my playmate who be also wear they best thick blanket we show one another we new beaded moccasin and the width of the belt that girdle we new dress soon we be be draw rapidly away by the white man 's horse when i see the lonely figure of my mother vanish in the distance a sense of regret settle heavily upon I i feel suddenly weak as if i might fall limp to the ground i be in the hand of stranger whom my mother do not fully trust i no longer feel free to be myself or to voice my own feeling the tear trickle down my cheek and i bury my face in the fold of my blanket now the first step parting I from my mother be take and all my belated tear avail nothing have drive thirty mile to the ferryboat we cross the missourus in the evening then ride again a few mile eastward we stop before a massive brick building i look at it in amazement and with a vague misgiving for in we village i have never see so large a house tremble with fear and distrust of the paleface my tooth chatter from the chilly ride i creep noiselessly in my soft moccasin along the narrow hall keep very close to the bare wall i be as frightened and bewildered as the capture young of a wild creature the school day of a indian girl i the land of red apple there be eight in we party of bronzed child who be go east with the missionary among we be three young brave two tall girl and we three little one judéwin thowin and i we have be very impatient to start on we journey to the red apple country which we be tell lay a little beyond the great circular horizon of the western prairie under a sky of rosy apple we dream of roaming as freely and happily as we have chase the cloud shadow on the dakota plain we have anticipate much pleasure from a ride on the iron horse but the throng of stare paleface disturbed and troubled we on the train fair woman with totter baby on each arm stop they haste and scrutinize the child of absent mother large man with heavy bundle in they hand halt near by and rivet they glassy blue eye upon we i sink deep into the corner of my seat for i resent be watch directly in front of I child who be no larger than i hang themselves upon the back of they seat with they bold white face toward I sometimes they take they forefinger out of they mouth and point at my moccasined foot they mother instead of reprove such rude curiosity look closely at I and attract they child 's further notice to my blanket this embarrassed I and keep I constantly on the verge of tear i sit perfectly still with my eye downcast daring only now and then to shoot long glance around I chance to turn to the window at my side i be quite breathless upon see one familiar object it be the telegraph pole which stride by at short pace very near my mother 's dwelling along the edge of a road thickly border with wild sunflower some pole like these have be plant by white man often i have stop on my way down the road to hold my ear against the pole and hear its low moaning i use to wonder what the paleface have do to hurt it now i sit watch for each pole that glide by to be the last one in this way i have forget my uncomfortable surroundings when i hear one of my comrade call out my name i see the missionary standing very near toss candy and gum into we midst this amuse we all and we try to see who could catch the most of the sweetmeat though we ride several day inside of the iron horse i do not recall a single thing about we luncheon it be night when we reach the school grounds the light from the window of the large building fall upon some of the icicled tree that stand beneath they we be lead toward a open door where the brightness of the light within flood out over the head of the excited paleface who block we way my body tremble more from fear than from the snow i trod upon enter the house i stand close against the wall the strong glaring light in the large whitewashed room dazzle my eye the noisy hurrying of hard shoe upon a bare wooden floor increase the whir in my ear my only safety seem to be in keep next to the wall as i

bitter-cold one for the snow still cover the ground and the tree be bare a large bell ring for breakfast its loud metallic voice crash through the belfry overhead and into we sensitive ear the annoying clatter of shoe on bare floor give we no peace the constant clash of harsh noise with a undercurrent of many voice murmur a unknown tongue make a bedlam within which i be securely tie and though my spirit tear itself in struggle for its lose freedom all be useless a paleface woman with white hair come up after we we be place in a line of girl who be march into the dining room these be

suppose this act mean they be to be seat i pull out mine and at once slip into it from one side but when i turn my head i see that i be the only one seat and all the rest at we table remain stand just as i begin to rise look shyly around to see how chair be to be use a second bell be sound all be seat at last and i have to crawl back into my chair again i hear a man 's voice at one end of the hall and i look around to see he but all the other hang they head over they plate as i glance at the long chain of table i catch the eye of a paleface woman upon I immediately i drop my eye wonder why i be so keenly watch by the strange woman the man cease he muttering and then a third bell be tap every one pick up he knife and fork and begin eat i begin cry instead for by this time i be afraid to

have overhear the paleface woman talk about cut we long heavy hair we mother have teach we that only unskilled warrior who be capture have they hair shingled by the enemy among we people short hair be worn by mourner and shingled hair by coward we discuss we fate some moment and when judéwin say we have to submit because they be strong i rebel no i will not submit i will struggle first i answer i watch my chance and when no one notice i disappear i creep up the stair as quietly as i could in my squeak shoe -- my moccasin have be exchange for shoe along the hall i pass without know whither i be go turn aside to a open door i find a large room with three white bed in it the window be cover with dark green curtain which make the room very dim thankful that no one be there i direct my step toward the corner farthest from the door on my hand and knee i crawl under the bed and cuddle myself in the dark corner from my hide place i peer out shudder with fear whenever i hear footstep near by though in the hall loud voice be call my name and i know that even judéwin be search for I i do not open my mouth to answer then the step be quicken and the voice become excite the sound come nearer and nearer woman and girl enter the room i hold my breath and watch they open closet door and peep behind large trunk some one throw up the curtain and the room be fill with sudden light what cause they to stoop and look under the bed i do not know i remember be drag out though i resist by kick and scratch wildly in spite of myself i be carry downstairs and tie fast in a chair i cry aloud shake my head all the while until i feel the cold blade of the scissors against my neck and hear they gnaw off one of my thick braid then i lose my spirit since the day i be take from my mother i have suffer extreme indignity people have stare at I i have be toss about in the air like a wooden puppet and now my long hair be shingled like a coward 's in my anguish i moaned for my mother but no one come to comfort I not a soul reason quietly with I as my own mother use to do for now i be only one of many little animal drive by a herder iii the snow episode a short time after we arrival we three dakota be play in the snowdrift we be all still deaf to the english language except judéwin who always hear such puzzling thing one morning we learn through she ear that we be forbid to fall lengthwise in the snow as we have be do to see we own impression however before many hour we have forget the order and be have great sport in the snow when a shrill voice call we look up we see a imperative hand beckon we into the house we shake the snow off ourselves and start toward the woman as slowly as we dare judéwin say : now the paleface be angry with we she be go to punish we for fall into the snow if she look straight into you eye and talk loudly you must wait until she stop then after a tiny pause say ` no ' the rest of the way we practice upon the little word no as it happen thowin be summon to judgment first the door shut behind she with a click judéwin and i stand silently listen at the keyhole the paleface woman talk in very severe tone she word fall from she lip like crackle ember and she inflection run up like the small end of a switch i understand she voice better than the thing she be say i be certain we have make she very impatient with we judéwin hear enough of the word to realize all too late that she have teach we the wrong reply oh poor thowin she gasp as she put both hand over she ear just then i hear thowin 's tremulous answer no with a angry exclamation the woman give she a hard spanking then she stop to say something judéwin say it be this : be you go to obey my word the next time thowin answer again with the only word at she command no this time the woman mean she blow to smart for the poor frightened girl shriek at the top of she voice in the midst of the whipping the blow cease abruptly and the woman ask another question : be you go to fall in the snow again thowin give she bad passwood another trial we hear she say feebly no no with this the woman hide away she half-worn slipper and lead the child out stroke she black shear head perhaps it occur to she that brute force be not the solution for such a problem she do nothing to judéwin nor to I she only return to we we unhappy comrade and leave we alone in the room during the first two or three season misunderstanding as ridiculous as this one of the snow episode frequently take place bring unjustifiable fright and punishment into we little life within a year i be able to express myself somewhat in broken english as soon as i comprehend a part of what be say and do a mischievous spirit of revenge possess I one day i be call in from my play for some misconduct i have disregard a rule which seem to I very needlessly bind i be send into the kitchen to mash the turnip for dinner it be noon and steam dish be hastily carry into the dining-room i hate turnip and they odor which come from the brown jar be offensive to I with fire in my heart i take the wooden tool that the paleface woman hold out to I i stand upon a step and grasp the handle with both hand i bent in hot rage over the turnip i work my vengeance upon they all be so busily occupy that no one notice I i see that the turnip be in a pulp and that further beating could not improve they but the order be mash these turnip and mash they i would i renew my energy and as i send the masher into the bottom of the jar i feel a satisfying sensation that the weight of my body have go into it just here a paleface woman come up to my table as she look into the jar she shove my hand roughly aside i stand fearless and angry she place she red hand upon the rim of the jar then she give one lift and stride away from the table but lo the pulpy contents fall through the crumble bottom to the floor i she spare I no scolding phrase that i have earn i do not heed they i feel triumphant in my revenge though deep within I i be a wee bit sorry to have break the jar as i sit eat my dinner and see that no turnip be serve i whoop in my heart for have once assert the rebellion within I iv the devil among the legend the old warrior use to tell I be many story of evil spirit but i be teach to fear they no more than those who stalk about in material guise i never know there be a insolent chieftain among the bad spirit who dare to array he force against the great spirit until i hear this white man 's legend from a paleface woman out of a large book she show I a picture of the white man 's devil i look in horror upon the strong claw that grow out of he fur-covered finger he foot be like he hand trail at he heel be a scaly tail tip with a serpent 's open jaw he face be a patchwork : he have beard cheek like some i have see paleface wear he nose be a eagle 's bill and he sharp-pointed ear be prick up like those of a sly fox above they a pair of cow 's horn curve upward i tremble with awe and my heart throb in my throat as i look at the king of evil spirit then i hear the paleface woman say that this terrible creature roam loose in the world and that little girl who disobey school regulation be to be tortured by he that night i dream about this evil divinity once again i seem to be in my mother 's cottage a indian woman have come to visit my mother on opposite side of the kitchen stove which stand in the center of the small house my mother and she guest be seat in straight-backed chair i play with a train of empty spool hitch together on a string it be night and the wick burn feebly suddenly i hear some one turn we door-knob from without my mother and the woman hush they talk and both look toward the door it open gradually i wait behind the stove the hinge squeak as the door be slowly very slowly push inward then in rush the devil he be tall he look exactly like the picture i have see of he in the white man 's papers he do not speak to my mother because he do not know the indian language but he glittering yellow eye be fasten upon I he take long stride around the stove pass behind the woman 's chair i throw down my spool and run to my mother he do not fear she but follow closely after I then i run round and round the stove cry aloud for help but my mother and the woman seem not to know my danger they sit still look quietly upon the devil 's chase after I at last i grow dizzy my head revolve as on a hidden pivot my knee become numb and double under my weight like a pair of knife blade without a spring beside my mother 's chair i fall in a heap just as the devil stoop over I with outstretched claw my mother awake from she quiet indifference and lift I on she lap whereupon the devil vanish and i be awake on the follow morning i take my revenge upon the devil steal into the room where a wall of shelf be fill with book i draw forth the story of the bible with a broken slate pencil i carry in my apron pocket i begin by scratch out he wicked eye a few moment later when i be ready to leave the room there be a ragged hole in the page where the picture of the devil have once be v iron routine a loud-clamoring bell awaken we at half-past six in the cold winter morning from happy dream of western rolling land and unlassoed freedom we tumble out upon chilly bare floor back again into a paleface day we have short time to jump into we shoe and clothes and wet we eye with icy water before a small hand bell be vigorously ring for roll call there be too many drowsy child and too numerous order for the day to waste a moment in any apology to nature for give she child such a shock in the early morning we rush downstairs bound over two high step at a time to land in the assembly room a paleface woman with a yellow-covered roll book open on she arm and a gnawed pencil in she hand appear at the door she small tired face be coldly light with a pair of large gray eye she stand still in a halo of authority while over the rim of she spectacles she eye pry nervously about the room have glance at she long list of name and call out the first one she toss up she chin and peer through the crystal of she spectacles to make sure of the answer here relentlessly she pencil black-marked we daily record if we be not present to respond to we name and no chum of ours have do it successfully for we no matter if a dull headache or the painful cough of slow consumption have delay the absentee there be only time enough to mark the tardiness it be next to impossible to leave the iron routine after the civilizing machine have once begin its day 's buzz and as it be inbred in I to suffer in silence rather than to appeal to the ear of one whose open eye could not see my pain i have many time trudge in the day 's harness heavy-footed like a dumb sick brute once i lose a dear classmate i remember well how she use to mope along at my side until one morning she could not raise she head from she pillow at she deathbed i stand weep as the paleface woman sit near she moisten the dry lip among the fold of the bedclothes i see the open page of the white man 's bible the die indian girl talk disconnectedly of jesus the christ and the paleface who be cool she swollen hand and foot i grow bitter and censure the woman for cruel neglect of we physical ill i despise the pencil that move automatically and the one teaspoon which deal out from a large bottle healing to a row of variously ail indian child i blame the hard-working well-meaning ignorant woman who be inculcate in we heart she superstitious idea though i be sullen in all my little trouble as soon as i feel better i be ready again to smile upon the cruel woman within a week i be again actively test the chain which tightly bind my individuality like a mummy for burial the melancholy of those black day have leave so long a shadow that it darken the path of year that have since go by these sad memory rise above those of smoothly grind school day perhaps my indian nature be the moan wind which stir they now for they present record but however tempestuous this be within I it come out as the low voice of a curiously color seashell which be only for those ear that be bent with compassion to hear it vi four strange summer after my first three year of school i roam again in the western country through four strange summer during this time i seem to hang in the heart of chaos beyond the touch or voice of human aid my brother be almost ten year my senior do not quite understand my feeling my mother have never go inside of a schoolhouse and so she be not capable of comforting she daughter who could read and write even nature seem to have no place for I i be neither a wee girl nor a tall one neither a wild indian nor a tame one this deplorable situation be the effect of my brief course in the east and the unsatisfactory teenth in a girl 's year it be under these try condition that one bright afternoon as i sit restless and unhappy in my mother 's cabin i catch the sound of the spirited step of my brother 's pony on the road which pass by we dwelling soon i hear the wheel of a light buckboard and dawée 's familiar ho to he pony he alight upon the bare ground in front of we house tie he pony to one of the project corner log of the low-roofed cottage he step upon the wooden doorstep i meet he there with a hurry greet and as i pass by he look a quiet what into my eye when he begin talk with my mother i slip the rope from the pony 's bridle seize the rein and brace my foot against the dashboard i wheel around in a instant the pony be ever ready to try he speed look backward i see dawée wave he hand to I i turn with the curve in the road and disappear i follow the wind road which crawl upward between the basis of little hillock deep water-worn ditch run parallel on either side a strong wind blow against my cheek and flutter my sleeve the pony reach the top of the highest hill and begin a even race on the level land there be nothing move within that great circular horizon of the dakota prairie save the tall grass over which the wind blow and roll off in long shadowy wave within this vast wigwam of blue and green i ride reckless and insignificant it satisfied my small consciousness to see the white foam fly from the pony 's mouth suddenly out of the earth a coyote come forth at a swing trot that be take the cunning thief toward the hill and the village beyond upon the moment 's impulse i give he a long chase and a wholesome fright as i turn away to go back to the village the wolf sink down upon he haunch for rest for it be a hot summer day and as i drive slowly homeward i see he sharp nose still point at I until i vanish below the margin of the hilltop in a little while i come in sight of my mother 's house dawée stand in the yard laughing at a old warrior who be point he forefinger and again wave he whole hand toward the hill with he blanket draw over one shoulder he talk and motion excitedly dawée turn the old man by the shoulder and point I out to he oh han -lrb- oh yes -rrb- the warrior mutter and go he way he have climb the top of he favorite barren hill to survey the surround prairie when he spy my chase after the coyote he keen eye recognize the pony and driver at once uneasy for my safety he have come run to my mother 's cabin to give she warning i do not appreciate he kindly interest for there be a unrest gnawing at my heart as soon as he go away i ask dawée about something else no my baby sister i can not take you with I to the party tonight he reply though i be not far from fifteen and i feel that before long i should enjoy all the privilege of my tall cousin dawée persist in call I he baby sister that moonlight night i cry in my mother 's presence when i hear the jolly young people pass by we cottage they be no more young brave in blanket and eagle plume nor indian maid with prettily paint cheek they have go three year to school in the east and have become civilized the young man wear the white man 's coat and trousers with bright necktie the girl wear tight muslin dress with ribbon at neck and waist at these gathering they talk

mother i do not read it but lay it unopen on the floor where i sit on my foot the dim yellow light of the braided muslin burning in a small vessel of oil flicker and sizzle in the awful silent storm which follow my rejection of the bible now my wrath against the fate consume my tear before they reach my eye i sit stony with a bow head my mother throw a shawl over she head and shoulder and step out into the night after a uncertain solitude i be suddenly arouse by a loud cry pierce the night it be my mother 's voice wail among the barren hill which hold the bone of bury warrior she call aloud for she brother ' spirit to support she in she helpless misery my finger gray icy cold as i realize that my unrestrained tear have betray my suffer to she and she be grieve for I before she return though i know she be on she way for she have cease she weep i extinguish the light and lean my head on the window sill many scheme of run away from my surroundings hover about in my mind a few more moon of such a turmoil drive I away to the eastern school i ride on the white man 's iron steed think it would bring I back to my mother in a few winter when i should be grow tall and there would be congenial friend await I vii incur my mother 's displeasure in the second journey to the east i have not come without some precaution i have a secret interview with one of we best medicine man and when i leave he wigwam i carry securely in my sleeve a tiny bunch of magic root this possession assure I of friend wherever i should go so absolutely do i believe in its charm that i wear it through all the school routine for more than a year then before i lose my faith in the dead root i lose the little buckskin bag contain all my good luck at the close of this second term of three year i be the proud owner of my first diploma the follow autumn i venture upon a college career against my mother 's will i have write for she approval but in she reply i find no encouragement she call my notice to

slow attempt to learn the white man 's way and be content to roam over the prairie and find my living upon wild root i silence she by deliberate disobedience thus homeless and heavy-hearted i begin anew my life among stranger as i hide myself in my little room in the college dormitory away from the scornful and yet curious eye of the student i pine for sympathy often i weep in secret wish i have go west to be nourish by my mother 's love instead of remain among a cold race whose heart be frozen hard with prejudice during the fall and winter season i scarcely have a real friend though by that time several of my classmate be courteous to I at a safe distance my mother have not yet forgive my rudeness to she and i have no moment for letter-writing by daylight and lamplight i spin with reed and thistle until my hand be tire from they weave the magic design which promise I the white man 's respect at length in the spring term i enter a oratorical contest among the various class as the day of competition approach it do not seem possible that the event be so near at hand but it come in the chapel the class assemble together with they invite guest the high platform be carpet and gaily festoon with college color a bright white light illumine the room and outline clearly the great polished beam that arch the domed ceiling the assemble crowd fill the air with pulsate murmur when the hour for speak arrive all be hushed but on the wall the old clock which point out the try moment tick calmly on one after another i saw and hear the orator still i could not realize that they long for the favorable decision of the judge as much as i do each contestant receive a loud burst of applause and some be cheer heartily too soon my turn come and i pause a moment behind the curtain for a deep breath after my conclude word i hear the same applause that the other have call out upon my retreat step i be astounded to receive from my fellow-student a large bouquet of rose tie with flow ribbon with the lovely flower i flee from the stage this friendly token be a rebuke to I for the hard feeling i have bear they later the decision of the judge award I the first place then there be a mad uproar in the hall where my classmate sing and shout my name at the top of they lung and the disappointed student howl and bray in fearfully dissonant tin trumpet in this excitement happy student rush forward to offer they congratulation and i could not conceal a smile when they wish to escort I in a procession to the student ' parlor where all be go to calm themselves thank they for the kind spirit which prompt they to make such a proposition i walk alone with the night to my own little room a few week afterward i appear as the college representative in another contest this time the competition be among orator from different college in we state it be hold at the state capital in one of the largest opera house here again be a strong prejudice against my people in the evening as the great audience fill the house the student body begin war among themselves fortunately i be spare witness any of the noisy wrangling before the contest begin the slur against the indian that stain the lip of we opponent be already burn like a dry fever within my breast but after the oration be deliver a deeper burn await I there before that vast ocean of eye some college rowdy throw out a large white flag with a drawing of a most forlorn indian girl on it under this they have print in bold black letter word that ridicule the college which be represent by a squaw such worse than barbarian rudeness embittered I while we wait for the verdict of the judge i gleam fiercely upon the throng of paleface my tooth be hard set as i see the white flag still float insolently in the air then anxiously we watch the man carry toward the stage the envelope contain the final decision there be two prize give that night and one of they be mine the evil spirit laugh within I when the white flag drop out of sight and the hand which hurl it hang limp in defeat leave the crowd as quickly as possible i be soon in my room the rest of the night i sit in a armchair and gaze into the crackling fire i laugh no more in triumph when thus alone the little taste of victory do not satisfy a hunger in my heart in my mind i see my mother far away on the western plain and she be hold a charge against I a indian teacher among indian i my first day though a illness leave I unable to continue my college course my pride keep I from return to my mother have she know of my worn condition she would have say the white man 's papers be not worth the freedom and health i have lose by they such a rebuke from my mother would have be unbearable and as i feel then it would be far too true to be comfortable since the winter when i have my first dream about red apple i have be travel slowly toward the morning horizon there have be no doubt about the direction in which i wish to go to spend my energy in a work for the indian race thus i have write my mother briefly say my plan for the year be to teach in a eastern indian school send this message to she in the west i start at once eastward thus i find myself tired and hot in a black veiling of car smoke as i stand wearily on a street corner of a old-fashioned town wait for a car in a few moment more i should be on the school grounds where a new work be ready for my inexperienced hand upon enter the school campus i be surprise at the thickly cluster building which make it a quaint little village much more interesting than the town itself the large tree among the house give the place a cool refreshing shade and the grass a deeper green within this large court of grass and tree stand a low green pump the queer boxlike case have a revolving handle on its side which clank and creak constantly i make myself known and be show to my room -- a small carpeted room with ghastly wall and ceiling the two window both on the same side be curtain with heavy muslin yellow with age a clean white bed be in one corner of the room and opposite it be a square pine table cover with a black woolen blanket without remove my hat from my head i seat myself in one of the two stiff-backed chair that be place beside the table for several heart throb i sit still look from ceiling to floor from wall to wall try hard to imagine year of contentment there even while i be wonder if my exhaust strength would sustain I through this undertaking i hear a heavy tread stop at my door open it i meet the impose figure of a stately gray-haired man with a light straw hat in one hand and the right hand extend for greet he smile kindly upon I for some reason i be awed by he wondrous height and he strong square shoulder which i feel be a finger 's length above my head i be always slight and my serious illness in the early spring have make I look rather frail and languid he quick eye measure my height and breadth then he look into my face i imagine that a visible shadow flit across he countenance as he let my hand fall i know he be no other than my employer ah ha so you be the little indian girl who create the excitement among the college orator he say more to himself than to I i think i hear a subtle note of disappointment in he voice look in from where he stand with one sweeping glance he ask if i lack anything for my room after he turn to go i listen to he step until it grow faint and be lose in the distance i be aware that my car-smoked appearance have not conceal the line of pain on my face for a short moment my spirit laugh at my ill fortune and i entertain the idea of exert myself to make a improvement but as i toss my hat off a leaden weakness come over I and i feel as if year of weariness lay like water-soaked log upon I i throw myself upon the bed and close my eye forget my good intention ii a trip westward one sultry month i sit at a desk heap up with work now as i recall it i wonder how i could have dare to disregard nature 's warning with such recklessness fortunately my inheritance of a marvelous endurance enable I to bend without break though i have go to and fro from my room to the office in a unhappy silence i be watch by those around I on a early morning i be summon to the superintendent 's office for a half-hour i listen to he word and when i return to my room i remember one sentence above the rest it be this : i be go to turn you loose to pasture he be send I west to gather indian pupil for the school and this be he way of express it i need nourishment but the midsummer 's travel across the continent to search the hot prairie for overconfident parent who would entrust they child to stranger be a lean pasturage however i dwelt on the hope of see my mother i try to reason that a change be a rest within a couple of day i start toward my mother 's home the intense heat and the sticky car smoke that follow my homeward trail do not noticeably restore my vitality hour after hour i gaze upon the country which be recede rapidly from I i notice the gradual expansion of the horizon as we emerge out of the forest into the plain the great high building whose tower overlook the dense woodland and whose gigantic cluster form large city diminish together with the grove until only little log cabin lay snugly in the bosom of the vast prairie the cloud shadow which drift about on the wave yellow of long-dried grass thrill I like the meeting of old friend at a small station consist of a single frame house with a rickety board walk around it i alight from the iron horse just thirty mile from my mother and my brother dawée a strong hot wind seem determine to blow my hat off and return I to olden day when i roam barehead over the hill after the puff engine of my train be go i stand on the platform in deep solitude in the distance i see the gently rolling land leap up into bare hill at they basis a broad gray road be wind itself round about they until it come by the station among these hill i ride in a light conveyance with a trusty driver whose unkempt flaxen hair hang shaggy about he ear and he leather neck of reddish tan from accident or decay he have lose one of he long front tooth though i call he a paleface he cheek be of a brick red he moist blue eye blur and bloodshot twitched involuntarily for a long time he have drive through grass and snow from this solitary station to the indian village he weather-stained clothes fit badly he warped shoulder he be stoop and he protrude chin with its tuft of dry flax nod as monotonously as do the head of he faithful beast all the morning i look about I recognize old familiar sky line of rugged bluff and round-topped hill by the roadside i catch glimpse of various plant whose sweet root be delicacy among my people when i see the first cone-shaped wigwam i could not help utter a exclamation which cause my driver a sudden jump out of he drowsy nodding at noon as we drive through the eastern edge of the reservation i grow very impatient and restless constantly i wonder what my mother would say upon see she little daughter grow tall i have not write she the day of my arrival think i would surprise she cross a ravine thicket with low shrub and plum bush we approach a large yellow acre of wild sunflower just beyond this nature 's garden we draw near to my mother 's cottage close by the log cabin stand a little canvas-covered wigwam the driver stop in front of the open door and in a long moment my mother appear at the threshold i have expect she to run out to greet I but she stand still all the while stare at the weather-beaten man at my side at length when she loftiness become unbearable i call to she mother why do you stop this seem to break the evil moment and she hasten out to hold my head against she cheek my daughter what madness possess you to bring home such a fellow she ask point at the driver who be fumble in he pocket for change while he hold the bill i give he between he jagged tooth bring he why no mother he have bring I he be a driver i exclaimed upon this revelation my mother throw she arm about I and apologize for she mistaken inference we laugh away the momentary hurt then she build a brisk fire on the ground in the tepee and hang a blacken coffeepot on one of the prong of a fork pole which lean over the flame place a pan on a heap of red ember she baked some unleavened bread this light luncheon she bring into the cabin and arrange on a table cover with a checkered oilcloth my mother have never go to school and though she mean always to give up she own

about dawée 's trouble but she only say : well my daughter this village have be these many winter a refuge for white robber the indian can not complain to the great father in washington without suffer

white settler who live in cave dig in the long ravine of the high hill across the river a whole tribe of broad-footed white beggar have rush hither to make claim on those wild land even as she be tell this i spy a small glimmering light in the bluff that be a white man 's lodge where you see the burning fire she say then a short distance from it only a little lower than the first be another light as i become accustomed to the night i see more and more twinkling light here and there scatter all along the wide black margin of the river still look toward the distant firelight my mother continue : my daughter beware of the paleface it be the cruel paleface who cause the death of you sister and you uncle my brave brother it be this same paleface who offer in one palm the holy papers and with the

finger toward the settler 's lodge as if a invisible power pass from they to the evil at which she aim iv retrospection leave my mother i return to the school in the east as month pass over I i slowly comprehend that the large army of white teacher in indian school have a larger missionary creed than i have suspect it be one which include self-preservation quite as much as indian education when i see a opium-eater hold a position as teacher of indian i do not understand what good be expect until a christian in power reply that this pumpkin-colored creature have a feeble mother to support a inebriate paleface sit stupid in a doctor 's chair while indian patient carry they ailment to untimely grave because he fair wife be dependent upon he for she daily food i find it hard to count that white man a teacher who tortured a ambitious indian youth by frequently remind the brave changele that he be nothing but a government pauper though i burn with indignation upon discover on every side instance no less shameful than those i have mention there be no present help even the few rare one who have work nobly for my race be powerless to choose workman like themselves to be sure a man be send from the great father to inspect indian school but what he see be usually the student ' sample work _ make _ for exhibition i be nettle by this sly cunning of the workman who hookwink the indian 's pale father at washington my illness which prevent the conclusion of my college course together with my mother 's story of the encroach frontier settler leave I in no mood to strain my eye in search for latent good in my white co-worker at this stage of my own evolution i be ready to curse man of small capacity for be the dwarf they god have make they in the process of my education i have lose all consciousness of the nature world about I thus when a hidden rage take I to the small white-walled prison which i then call my room i unknowingly turn away from my one salvation alone in my room i sit like the petrified indian woman of whom my mother use to tell I i wish my heart 's burden would turn I to unfeeling stone but alive in my tomb i be destitute for the white man 's papers i have give up my faith in the great spirit for these same papers i have forget the healing in tree and brook on account of my mother 's simple view of life and my lack of any i give she up also i make no friend among the race of people i loathe like a slender tree i have be uproot from my mother nature and god i be shear of my branch which have wave in sympathy and love for home and friend the natural coat of bark which have protect my oversensitive nature be scrape off to the very quick now a cold bare pole i seem to be plant in a strange earth still i seem to hope a day would come when my mute ache head rear upward to the sky would flash a zigzag lightning across the heaven with this dream of vent for a long-pent consciousness i walk again amid the crowd at last one weary day in the schoolroom a new idea present itself to I it be a new way of solve the problem of my inner self i like it thus i resign my position as teacher and now i be in a eastern city follow the long course of study i have set for myself now as i look back upon the recent past i see it from a distance as a whole i remember how from morning till evening many specimen of civilized people visit the indian school the city folk with cane and eyeglass the countryman with sunburnt cheek and clumsy foot forget they relative social rank in a ignorant curiosity both sort of these christian paleface be alike astounded at see the child of savage warrior so docile and industrious as answer to they shallow inquiry they receive the student ' sample work to look upon examine the neatly figure page and gaze upon the indian girl and boy bend over they book the white visitor walk out of the schoolhouse well satisfied : they be educate the child of the red man they be pay a liberal fee to the government employee in whose able hand lay the small forest of indian timber in this fashion many have pass idly through the indian school during the last decade afterward to boast of they charity to the north american indian but few there be who have pause to question whether real life or long-lasting death lie beneath this semblance of civilization the great spirit when the spirit swell my breast i love to roam leisurely among the green hill or sometimes sit on the brink of the murmur missourus i marvel at the great blue overhead with half-closed eye i watch the huge cloud shadow in they noiseless play upon the high bluff opposite I while into my ear ripple the sweet soft cadence of the river 's song fold hand lie in my lap for the time forget my heart and i lie small upon the earth like a grain of throbbing sand drift cloud and tinkle water together with the warmth of a genial summer day bespeak with eloquence the loving mystery round about we during the idle while i sit upon the sunny river brink i grow somewhat though my response be not so clearly manifest as in the green grass fringe the edge of the high bluff back of I at length retrace the uncertain footpath scale the precipitous embankment i seek the level land where grow the wild prairie flower and they the lovely little folk soothe my soul with they perfumed breath they quaint round face of varied hue convince the heart which leap with glad surprise that they too be live symbol of omnipotent think with a child 's eager eye i drink in the myriad star shape work in luxuriant color upon the green beautiful be the spiritual essence they embody i leave they nod in the breeze but take along with I they impress upon my heart i pause to rest I upon a rock embed on the side of a foothill face the low river bottom here the stone-boy of whom the american aborigine tell frolic about shoot he baby arrow and shout aloud with glee at the tiny shaft of lightning that flash from the fly arrow-beak what a ideal warrior he become baffle the siege of the pest of all the land till he triumph over they unite attack and here he lay -- inyan we great-great-grandfather older than the hill he rest on older than the race of man who love to tell of he wonderful career interweave with the thread of this indian legend of the rock i fain would trace a subtle knowledge of the native folk which enable they to recognize a kinship to any and all part of this vast universe by the lead of a ancient trail i move toward the indian village with the strong happy sense that both great and small be so surely enfold in he magnitude that without a miss each have he allotted individual ground of opportunity i be buoyant with good nature yellow breast sway upon the slender stem of a wild sunflower warble a sweet assurance of this as i pass near by break off the clear crystal song he turn he wee head from side to side eye I wisely as slowly i plod with moccasined foot then again he yield himself to he song of joy flit flit hither and yon he fill the summer sky with he swift sweet melody and truly do it seem he vigorous freedom lie more in he little spirit than in he wing with these thought i reach the log cabin whither i be strongly draw by the tie of a child to a aged mother out bound my four-footed friend to meet I frisk about my path with unmistakable delight chän be a black shaggy dog a thoroughbred little mongrel of whom i be very fond chän seem to understand many word in sioux and will go to she mat even when i whisper the word though generally i think she be guide by the tone of the voice often she try to imitate the slide inflection and long-drawn-out voice to the amusement of we guest but she articulation be quite beyond my ear in both my hand i hold she shaggy head and gaze into she large brown eye at once the dilated pupil contract into tiny black dot as if the roguish spirit within would evade my question finally resume the chair at my desk i feel in keen sympathy with my fellow-creature for i seem to see clearly again that all be akin the racial line which once be bitterly real now serve nothing more than mark out a living mosaic of human being and even here man of the same color be like the ivory key of one instrument where each resemble all the rest yet vary from they in pitch and quality of voice and those creature who be for a time mere echo of another 's note be not unlike the fable of the thin sick man whose distorted shadow dress like a real creature come to the old master to make he follow as a shadow thus with a compassion for all echo in human guise i greet the solemn-faced native preacher whom i find await I i listen with respect for god 's creature though he mouth most strangely the jangling phrase of a bigoted creed as we tribe be one large family where every person be relate to all the other he address I : -- cousin i come from the morning church service to talk with you yes i say interrogatively as he pause for some word from I shift uneasily about in the straight-backed chair he sit upon he begin : every holy day -lrb- Sunday -rrb- i look about we little god 's house and not see you there i be disappoint this be why i come today cousin as i watch you from afar i see no unbecoming behavior and hear only good report of you which all the more burn I with the wish that you be a church member cousin i be teach long year ago by kind missionary to read the holy book these godly man teach I also the folly of we old belief there be one god who give reward or punishment to the race of dead man in the upper region the christian dead be gather in unceasing song and prayer in the deep pit below the sinful one dance in torture flame think upon these thing my cousin and choose now to avoid the after-doom of hell fire then follow a long silence in which he clasp tighter and unclasped again he interlocked finger like instantaneous lightning flash come picture of my own mother 's make for she too be now a follower of the new superstition knock out the chinking of we log cabin some evil hand thrust in a burning taper of braided dry grass but fail of he intent for the fire die out and the half-burned brand fall inward to the floor directly above it on a shelf lay the holy book this be what we find after we return from a several day ' visit surely some great power be hide in the sacred book brushing away from my eye many like picture i offer midday meal to the convert indian sit wordless and with downcast face no sooner have he rise from the table with cousin i have relish it than the church bell ring thither he hurry forth with he afternoon sermon i watch he as he hasten along he eye bent fast upon the dusty road till he disappear at the end of a quarter of a mile the little incident recall to mind the copy of a missionary paper bring to my notice a few day ago in which a christian pugilist comment upon a recent article of mine grossly pervert the spirit of my pen still i would not forget that the pale-faced missionary and the hoodooed aborigine be both god 's creature though small indeed they own conception of infinite love a wee child toddle in a wonder world i prefer to they dogma my excursion into the natural garden where the voice of the great spirit be hear in the twittering of bird the ripple of mighty water and the sweet breathing of flower here in a fleeting quiet i be awaken by the flutter robe of the great spirit to my innermost consciousness the phenomenal universe be a royal mantle vibrate with he divine breath catch in its flow fringe be the spangle and oscillate brilliant of sun moon and star the soft-hearted sioux i beside the open fire i sit within we tepee with my red blanket wrap tightly about my cross leg i be think of the come season my

government we would like to see equitably settle by a constructive program we hope to do away with the piecemeal legislation affect indian here and there which have prove a exceedingly expensive and disappointing method do you know what _ you _ bureau of indian affair in washington dc really be how it be organize and how it deal with ward of the nation this be we first study let we be inform of fact and then we may formulate we opinion in the remain space allow I i shall quote from the report of the bureau of municipal research in they investigation of the indian bureau publish by they in the September issue 1915 no 65 municipal research 261 broadway new york city this report be just as good for we use today as when it be first make for very little if any change have be make in the administration of indian affair since then prefatory note while this report be print for the information of member of congress it be not make a part of the report of the joint commission of congress at whose request it be prepare and be not available for distribution unpublished digest of statutory and treaty provision govern indian fund when in 1913 inquiry be make into the accounting and report method of the indian office by the president 's commission on economy and efficiency it be find there be no digest of the provision of statute and treaty with indian tribe govern indian fund and the trust obligation of the government such a digest be therefore prepare it be not complete however until after congress adjourn march 4 1913 then instead of be publish it find its way into the pigeon-hole in the interior department and the civil service commission where the work papers and unpublished report of the commission be order store the digest itself would make a document of about three hundred page unpublished outline of organization by order of the president the commission in cooperation with various person assign to this work also prepare at great pain a complete analysis of the organization of every department office and commission of the federal government as of July 1 1912 this represent a complete picture of the government as a whole in summary outline it also represent a accurate picture of every administrative bureau office and of every operative or field station and show in he work relation each of the 500000 officer and employe in the public service the report in typewritten form be one of the work document use in the preparation of the ` budget ' submit by president taft to congress in February 1913 the ` budget ' be order print by congress but the cost thereof be to be charge against the president 's appropriation there be not enough money remain in this appropriation to warrant the printing of the report on organization it therefore also find repose in a dark closet too voluminous to be make part of this series congress alone could make the necessary provision for the publication of these material the document be too voluminous to be print as a part of this series even if official permission be grant it be again suggest however that the datum might be make readily accessible and available to student by place in manuscript division of the library of congress one copy of the unpublished report and work papers of the president 's commission on economy and efficiency this action be recommend by the commission but the only official action take be to order that the material be place under lock and key in the civil service commission need for special care in management the need for special care in the management of indian affair lie in the fact that in theory of law the indian have not the rights of a citizen he have not even the rights of a foreign resident the indian individually do not have access to the court he can not individually appeal to the administrative and judicial branch of the public service for the enforcement of he rights he himself be consider as a ward of the united state he property and fund be hold in trust \* \* \* the indian office be the agency of the government for administer both the guardianship of the indian and the trusteeship of he property condition adverse to good administration the legal status of the indian and he property be the condition which make it incumbent on the government to assume the obligation of protector what be of special interest in this inquiry be to note the condition under which the indian office have be require to conduct its business in no other relation be the agent of the government under condition more adverse to efficient administration the influence which make for the infidelity to trusteeship for subversion of property and fund for the violation of physical and moral welfare have be powerful the opportunity and inducement be much greater than those which have operate with ruinous effect on other branch of public service and on the trustee and officer of we great private corporation in many instance the integrity of these have be break down government machinery inadequate \* \* \* behind the sham protection which operate largely as a blind to publicity have be at all time great wealth in the form of indian fund to be subvert valuable land mine oil field and other natural resource to be despoil or appropriate to the use of the trader and large profit to be make by those deal with trustee who be animated by motive of gain this have be the situation in which the indian service have be for more than a century -- the indian during all this time have he rights and property to greater or less extent neglect the guardian the government in many instance passive to condition which have contribute to he undoing opportunity still present and still due to the increase value of he remain estate there be leave a inducement to fraud corruption and institutional incompetence almost beyond the possibility of comprehension the property and fund of the indian today be estimate at not less than one thousand million of dollar there be still a great obligation to be discharge which must run through many year the government itself owe many million of dollar for indian money which it have convert to its own use and it be of interest to note that it do not know and the officer do not know what be the present condition of the indian fund in they keep primary defect \* \* \* the story of the mismanagement of indian affair be only a chapter in the history of the mismanagement of corporate trust the indian have be the victim of the same kind of neglect the same abortive process the same malpractice as have the life insurance policyholder the bank depositor the industrial and transportation shareholder the form of organization of the trusteeship have be one which do not provide for independent audit and supervision the institutional method and practice have be such that they do not provide either a fact basis for official judgment or publicity of fact which if make available would supply evidence of infidelity in the operation of this machinery there have not be the mean provide for effective official scrutiny and the public conscience could not be reach ample precedent to be follow precedent to be follow be ample in private corporate trust that have be mismanage a basis of appeal have be find only when some favorable circumstance have bring to light condition so shocking as to cause those people who have possess political power as a matter of self-protection to demand a thorough reorganization and revision of method the same motive have lie back of legislation for the indian but the motive to political action have be less effective for the reason that in the past the indian who have act in self-protection have either be kill or place in confinement all the machinery of government have be set to work to repress rather than to provide adequate means for justly deal with a large population which have no political rights -- edict magazine \* \* \* \* \* _ this book should be in
