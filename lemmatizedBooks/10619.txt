the gold of ophir the englishman in america chapter i adieu adieu my native shore fade o'er the water blue the night-winds sigh the breaker roar and shriek the wild sea-mew yon sun that set upon the sea we follow in he flight farewell awhile to he and thee my native land -- good night -- byron late in the fall of the year 18 -- i embark on board the ship _ cosmo _ bind from the port of bristol to that of new york the season be unpropitious the linger effect of the autumnal equinox render it more than probable that the passage would be tempestuous the result soon prove the correctness of this surmise for soon after the vessel depart from kingroad and before she get clear of the english coast we experience boisterous weather which be follow by a succession of gale that render we situation perilous but a partial destruction of the rig the loss of some sheep on the deck of the vessel and a slight indication of leakage which be soon remedy by the carpenter of the ship and he assistant be happily the only detrimental consequence arise from the weather we progress on the whole be satisfactory although when we arrive between 48 and 52 degree north latitude we narrowly escape come in contact with a enormous iceberg two of which be descry at daybreak by the look-out flounder majestically a little on the ship 's larboard quarter not far distant the alarm be raise by a uproar on deck that fill my mind with dire apprehension the lee bulwark of the vessel be in five minute throng with half-naked passenger who have be rouse unexpectedly from they slumber stare in terror at the frigid mass which we momentarily fear would overwhelm the ship the helm be put up we be soon out of the threaten danger of a collision which would have consign we to a grave in the wide wide water without the remotest chance of escape this consideration be to all on board a matter of deep thankfulness to the mighty author of such stupendous wonder who have so miraculously preserve we life have the adventure occur in the night we destruction must have be inevitable as the ship be sail under heavy canvas within a single point of the wake of one of the iceberg which be drift before a stiff breeze although this encounter prove harmless we shortly after have another to dread of a fearful nature the number of fishing-boat off the coast of newfoundland make the navigation perilous at almost any time to vessel approach too near the bank and after night-fall the vessel go at the rate of ten knot a hour with a smack breeze we pass many of these at anchor or rather i suppose ride on the wave they display light or serious consequence might have ensue some of the skiff be so near to we that as i lean over the ship 's quarter-rail dreading and every moment expect that we should run one down i could distinctly hear the crew hail we to shorten sail and keep off by adopt this course we vessel clear the danger and after slightly touch the bank which cause the vessel to heel and create a momentary panic on board amongst the passenger she be steer more out to sea and by the follow morning nothing be to be see but a boundless waste of water extend as far as the eye could reach after these temporary alarm with the exception of baffling wind which impede the progress of the ship and lengthen the duration of we confinement ten day or a fortnight we voyage be prosperous little occur to break the monotony of confinement on ship-board that be experience in sea-passage in general the only excitement be a fracas between the captain and cook owing to complaint make by the middle-cabin and steerage passenger which nearly end fatally to the former who would have be stab to a certainty but for a by-stander wrest the knife from the hand of the enraged subordinate who have be supply too liberally with spirit by the passenger a predominate evil on board all emigrant ship from the drawback of duty allow on spirit ship as store and which be retail on the voyage to the passenger the culprit be confine below during the remainder of the voyage and when we arrive at new york present a pitiable sight have be rigidly debar by the captain 's order of many of the commonest necessaries i believe the whole time here he be release and discharge from the ship glad enough to escape further punishment prosecution have be since the occurrence hold _ in terrorem _ over he it be late in the afternoon of a intensely cold day which cause the spray to congeal as it dash against the bulwark and cordage of the vessel that we descry with great pleasure loom indistinctly in the distance the shore of sandy hook a desolate-looking island near the coast of new jersey about seven mile south of long island sound this the captain inform I be formerly a peninsula but the isthmus be break through by the sea in 1767 the year after the declaration of american independence a occurrence which be at the time deem ominous of the severance of the colony from the mother country and which prove in reality to be the precursor of that event the sight of _ terra firma _ though at a distance and but gloomy in aspect put all on board in buoyant spirit but these be but transitory we enthusiasm be soon damp by a dense fog resemble those the londoner be so accustomed to see in the winter and which in a incredibly short space of time in this instance obscure everything around we proximity to the shore render the circumstance hazardous to we and it appear necessary that the vessel 's head should be again put seaward but this the captain be evidently anxious to avoid as it involve the risk of protract the voyage a general rummage for ammunition be therefore order and a supply of this necessary have be obtain the ship 's carronade be after considerable delay put in order and minute gun be fire after discharge some thirty round or more we be relieve from the state of anxiety we be in by a pilot hail the ship and in a minute after he be on deck issue order with great pertinacity it be impossible for any one unaccustomed to sea voyage to form a just conception of the relief afford by the presence of that important functionary a pilot perhaps a captain 's greatest anxiety be when he vessel have brave a thousand peril on the deep be about to enter on the termination of its voyage on the broad expanse of ocean or in nautical phrase with plenty of sea-room if he bark be in good condition he fear little or nothing but when he vessel approach its goal vision of disaster arise before he and he become anxious thoughtful and taciturn the pilot inform we that he have keep we vessel in chase for a considerable time and have burn a number of newspaper on the deck of he cutter to attract attention but all he effort prove unavailing when just as he be about to abandon the pursuit he descry and hail the ship this be the first specimen of a american whom many of the passenger have see in he native climate they curiosity be arouse and they crowd round he regard every word and movement with the greatest attention and interest the pilot be evidently displeased with be make a lion of and give vent to he feeling rather freely while there be a curl of hauteur on he lip that indicate a species of contempt for the company he be in this disposition do not convey a very favourable idea of he countryman and be to say the least of it a ill-judged display before stranger come however as it do from a illiterate man belong as i know from previous inquiry to rather a exceptional class of individual in america i do not suffer my mind to be biass although i could see that many of the passenger be not dispose to view the matter in the same light he be a brusque and uncouth man of swaggering gait about forty year of age above the middle stature and soon let the captain and crew know by he authoritative manner and volubility of tongue that he be chief in command on the occasion no one seem however to dispute this for the passenger look on he as a sort of divinity send to they rescue the ship 's hand be implicitly obedient and the captain very soon after he arrival retire into the cabin glad to be relieve from a heavy responsibility the follow morning the haze have clear off we could again see the jersey shore the sea in every direction be now darken with million of black gull wild duck and other aquatic bird we shoot many of these from the ship 's deck but be much to we mortification oblige to see they drift away the pilot second by we austere captain strenuously object to a boat be lower this be very discouraging as such a change in we diet would after a rather prolonged voyage have be acceptable a favourable breeze soon carry we good ship to the quarantine ground where we drop anchor in no little anxiety lest we should be detain the medical officer from the college or rather sanatory establishment on shore almost immediately come on board all hand be muster on deck and range like soldier on parade ground by these important functionary who i may remark by the way appear like we pilot to be possess of considerable notion of power and authority after take a rather cursory inspection they leave the vessel and we to we great joy -lrb- a case of small pox have occur during the passage -rrb- be allow to proceed towards new york which we do under easy sail the breeze render a steam-tug unnecessary the scenery as we pass up the river be calculate to give a good impression of the country the zest be however without doubt greatly heighten by the monotonous dreariness of a tempestuous voyage the highland and valley as we sail up have a verdant woody appearance and be intersperse with rural and chateau scenery herd of cattle remarkable for length of horn and snow-white sheep be grazing placidly in the lowland the country as far as i could judge seem in a high state of culture and the farm to use a expression of the celebrated washington irving 's when describe i think a farm-yard view in england appear redolent of pig poultry and sundry other good thing appertain to rural life on arrive at the approach to the entrance or mouth of the river hudson which be form by a arm of the estuary we turn the promontory leave jersey on the leave the battery as we enter the harbor be in the foreground the guns-bristled from this fortress with menacing aspect and the sentinel in light blue uniform and kosciusko cap silently pace the rampart with automatic regularity this fortification though formidable in appearance and certainly in a commanding position i be subsequently inform be little more than a mimic fort this arise from the want of attention pay to defence of the kind in america the little exist chance of invasion perhaps cause the indifference to the subject if however the spirit of aggressive conquest show by the federal government of late year of which the invasion of mexico be a fair specimen should continue to develop itself it be not difficult to foresee that it will be necessary policy to pay greater attention to the subject and to keep in a more effective state the seaboard defence of the country as well as they army which be at present miserably deficient this have heretofore be so far neglect as regard the marine that not long before i arrive the commander of a french ship of war be much chagrin on firing a salute as he pass the battery at new york to find that he courtesy be not return in the customary way he complain of the omission as either a mark of disrespect to himself or a insult to he nation when it come out in explanation that the garrison be in such a defective state that there be not the appliance at hand to observe this national etiquette the city of new york be build almost close to the water 's edge with a broad levee or wharf run round a great portion of it its general appearance give to a stranger a impression of its extent and importance it have be aptly and accurately describe as a dense pack of building comprise every imaginable variety and of all known order of modernized architecture the tide flow close up to the wharf which run outside of the city and differ so little in height at ebb or flow that vessel of the largest class ride i believe at all time as safely as in the west indium dock in london or the imperial dock of liverpool here be assemble a incalculable number of vessel of all size and all nation form a beautiful and picturesque view of commercial enterprise and grandeur perhaps outvy every other port in the world not except liverpool itself as we vessel could not at once be accommodate with a berth owe to the crowded state of the harbor she be moor in the middle of the stream and be anxious to go on shore i availed myself of the captain 's offer to take I to the landing-place in he gig we go on shore in a alcove at the foot of wall-street and i experience the most delightful sensation on once more setting foot on _ terra firma _ after we dreary voyage the day notwithstanding it be now October be intensely hot -lrb- although a severe frost for two or three day before give indication of approach winter -rrb- and the street be unmacadamized have that arid look we read of in account of the plain of arabium the dust be quite deep and exceed in quantity anything of the kind i have ever see in european city : cloud of it impregnate the air and render respiration and sight difficult hundred of rudely-constructed dray be pass to and fro heavily laden with merchandize many of they draw by mule and the remainder by very light horse of arabian build the heavy english dray horse be nowhere to be see the breed as i afterwards learn not be cultivate from a dislike to its ponderousness the lower part of wall-street present a busy mart-like appearance every description of goods be pile heterogeneously before the warehouse-door of they respective owner in the open thoroughfare which be at this part very wide auctioneer be here busily engage in the disposal of they merchandise which comprise every variety of produce and manufacture home and foreign from a yard of linsey-woolsey hum spin as they term it to a bale of manchester long cloth or they own sea-island cotton the auctioneer in america be a curious specimen of the biped creation he be usually a swaggering consequential sort of fellow and drive away at he call with wondrous impudence and pertinacity dispense all the while he be sell the most fulsome flattery or the grossest abuse on those who stand around one of these loquacious animal be hold forth to a crowd just below the _ courier and inquirer _ newspaper office where the street widen as a preliminary introduction to the sale of a quantity of linen goods that have be damage at a recent fire in the neighborhood i could not help admire the man 's tact fix he eye on a individual in a white dress with a enormous leghorn hat on he head who be apparently eagerly listen while smoke a cigar to the harangue he suddenly exclaim there now be senator huff from the state of missourus he heerd of this vendue a thousand mile up river and wall know i be about to offer somethin woth have look at he he could buy up the fust five hunderd folk hed cum across anywhar in this city and what be more he be a true patriot make o ' the right kinder stuff i guess he follow up the eulogium at great length and after liberally dispense soft soap on the listener declare the auction have commence i stand by for some minute gaze around and watch the operation and be not long in discover that senator huff keep run up the article by pretended bid and be evidently in league with he in fact a confederate this auctioneer be the very emblem of buffoonery and blackguardism the rapidity with which he repeat the sum suppose by the bystander to be bid the curt yet extravagant praise bestow on he wares and he insulting and unsparing remark if a comment be make on the goods he offer or if the company do not respond in bidding stamp he as one of the baser sort of vulgarian sale of this description be go on in every direction and the street ring with the stentorian voice of the seller many of these be mock auction as a observer of any intelligence would detect and as i ascertain beyond doubt almost directly after leave this man 's stand for step into a open store close at hand of which there be range on either side of the street a sale of jewellery and watch be go on a case of jewellery contain among other thing a gold watch and chain apparently of exquisite workmanship be put up just as i enter and be start at six cent per article bid after bid succeed until at last the lot be knock down to a southern gentleman present at fifty cent per item on make the purchase he naturally wish to know how many article the box contain this information on the plea that it would delay the sale be withhold the auctioneer however insist on the payment of a deposit of fifty dollar in compliance with the publish condition of the sale which sum after a demur on the part of the purchaser be pay i could see however that he be now sensible he have be dupe and i afterwards learn that some forty or fifty article of almost every fancy description many of they worthless such as pin knife tweezers and a variety of other knick-knack be artfully conceal from view by means of a false bottom to the case this be lift up reveal the truth the man be greatly enrage on finding he have be cheat but be treat with the most audacious coolness and after some altercation leave the store as he say to seek redress elsewhere but i have no doubt he go off with the intention of lose he deposit this occurrence put I on my guard and make I very wary of buy article at such auction during my stay in new york although the apparent beauty and cheapness of many of the article i see offer especially of french manufacture be sufficient to decoy the most wary and i do not wonder at people be victimize at such place emigrant be the chief sufferer i be tell by such transaction from they want of caution and ignorance of the art of the accomplished deceiver who conduct they proceed up wall-street in the direction of broadway i reach that portion of it frequent by stock and real-estate broker here crowd of gentlemanly-looking man dress mostly in black and of busy mien crowd the thoroughfare with scrip in hand each appear intensely absorb in business and as i gazed on the assemblage i could discover unmistakable symptom of great excitement and mental anxiety the proportion of rueful countenance be much greater than be usually see in similar place of resort in england a sudden depression in the market at the time might however account for much of this although it be well know that broker and speculator on the american continent engage in the pursuit with the avidity of profess gambler hundred of negro be hurry to and fro through the street these be chiefly labourer decently dress and employ either as drayman or porter they look happier than labourer in england and be bath in a profuse perspiration from the heat of the weather they face shine almost like black satin or patent leather after a few day ' rest at my boarding-house to which i be recommend by a touter and which be in canal-street and be keep by a cute down-easter or native of the new england state with whom i engage for bed and board for eight dollar per week i sallied forth to make my intended observation preparatory to leave for the west everything wear a novel aspect the number of foreigner see in the thoroughfare the tawdry flimsily-built carriage which strangely contrast with the more substantial one see in england and the dress of the people all seem strange to I the habiliment of one or two in particular rivetted my attention the first be a kentuckian who be dress in a suit of gray home-spun cloth and wear on he head a fantastical cap form of a racoon-skin beautifully strip the ear project just above he forehead on each side while the forefoot of the animal decorate with red cloth form the ear-laps and the tail depend over he back like a quieu produce a ludicrous effect he appearance as he pass along attract little notice such vagary be common in america my attention be also arrest by a person who be array in a hunting suit of buck-skin curiously work with strip of dye porcupine-quill and who wear a otter-skin cap and indian moccasin there be however little novelty in this costume which i frequently see afterwards cap of the description i have mention be commonly worn in the interior i subsequently don one myself and find it a admirable adjunct to easy travel during my stay at new york i find the heat almost overpower the indian summer -lrb- as the period between autumn and winter be there term -rrb- have set in a umbrella be quite a necessary appendage at time to avoid its effect which be often fatal to european at the time of the summer solstice in perambulate the city of new york its appearance be prepossess to a visitor the street be well lay out and be wide and regular the house be for the most part of the better class the white or red paint -lrb- the latter predominate -rrb- and the green and white jalousie venetian and siesta blind give a picturesqueness to the scene handsome mat lie outside the door of many of the better description of house broadway be the principal place of attraction in new york but it have so often be describe by visitor that it be a work of supererogation to comment much upon it here as however every tourist can see and describe differently the same object i must not pass it in silence especially as it rank in the view of the new yorker something as bond-street and regent-street do in the metropolis of england it be however far inferior to these it be not one but a continuous line of street and include canal-street extend about three mile in length the haarlem railway come down a considerable portion of the upper part the rail be lay in the center of the street the lower end of broadway merge into the battery park which be situate at the water 's edge in broadway be to be see magnificent hotel theater magazines-de-mode and all the etcetera of a fashionable mart not omit to mention crowd of elegantly dress lady and exquisitely attired gentleman include many of color the latter appear in the extreme of the fashion with a redundancy of jewellery which contrast with they sable color produce to the eye of a stranger a unseemly effect the shop and store be fit up in the parisian style appear well attend by customer and be crowd with the choicest description of goods astor 's hotel build by the so-called millionaire of that name be a large but rather heavy-looking pile of building and form a conspicuous object in the park here many of the élite from the province sojourn on visit the city the accommodation be state to be of the first order and from a cursory inspection i should imagine this to be true the only drawback be the enormous price charge exceed i be tell the ordinary run of first-class house of that description notice from the opposite side of the street that the entrance be much crowded curiosity lead I to cross over and ascend the step and listen to what be go on suppose it some political demonstration in this however i be mistake for i find that the cause of the commotion be the recent arrival and presence of the celebrated statesman and lawyer daniel webster _ en route _ to washington whither he be call by congressional duty i press forward to shake hand with this great expounder of american law as he be call by the citizen who seem by the way on the occasion i refer to to regard he as a sort of divinity i could not however succeed in get near enough to accomplish my object although i strove hard for it it be quite amusing to see the anxiety show by some of those present to effect the same purpose the senator keep shake hand with all around repeat over and over again glad to see you citizen glad to see you amongst other a gentlemanly-dressed negro with a gold-headed cane press forward and hold out he hand there be however no chance for he in the throng for he be rudely push back and i hear several angry exclamation of disapprobation from the crowd at the liberty he have take one individual in particular cry out kick that nigger off what have he to do here these exclamation catch the ear of the negro gentleman and he shrink back in a instant as if electrify mr webster be a yeoman-like look person of rather a muscular-build and at one time of life be no doubt as i have hear possess of great physical power he have a heavy and rather downcast turn of feature which be not improve by a pair of enormous black eyebrow there be however a expression in he physiognomy that indicate deep thought and a degree of intelligence above the mediocrity in addition to this there be also a please urbanity in he manner that be certainly contrary to what might have be expect from he personal appearance and known burly character in business he gradually retreat up the step towards the interior of the hotel the excessive attention pay by the crowd appear troublesome to he he be closely follow however by he admirer whose boisterous behavior savor much more of enthusiasm than deference or politeness i have hear that the american profess never to do thing by half and so set this instance down as a proof of they propensity to go the whole hog as they be wont to term they extreme and eccentricity the town-hall situate at the base of the park which be a triangular piece of land well lay out and neatly keep be a light edifice of some taste and architectural merit its chief attraction be the white marble of which it be construct and which be bring from the quarry at sing-sing some mile up the river hudson the effect however be not good its exposure to the element have give it a blur or chalky appearance it be surmount by a small but elevated cupola construct of wood which some time ago i be inform by a citizen catch fire at a pyrotechnic exhibition and endanger the whole edifice since which display of fire-works have be prohibit in the park by the civic authority at the entrance there be a spacious vestibule but this as well as the interior though elegant in its simplicity of style be meager of ornament proceeding to the interior i reach the criminal court where a squalid-looking prisoner be undergo trial for murder the judge and officer of the court be almost entirely without insignia of office and the counsel employ i think evince much tact in they proceedings especially in the cross-examination of witness although they manifest great acerbity of feeling towards each other and they acrimonious remark would not i imagine have be allow to pass without remonstrance in a english court of justice i be tell by a by-stander with whom i enter into conversation that if find guilty the prisoner would be conduct to a underground apartment use for the purpose and privately execute the law of the state of new york from motive that ought to be appreciate in england prohibit public execution it be also customary there to allow criminal more time than in england to prepare for the awful change they be doom to undergo i be inform by a friend that there be some very astute lawyer in america and i subsequently have opportunity to test the accuracy of the remark they code however differ materially from the english although profess to be base upon its principle and have the preeminent advantage of be pretty free from the intricacy and incongruity that so often tend to defeat justice in the mother-country and render proceedings at law so expensive and perplexing the slave law -lrb- call the _ codenoir _ -rrb- adapt for the southern state must however be except for it be notorious that to subserve the end of interested party they have be frame so as to present what may with propriety be term a concatenation of entanglement and injustice to the slave subject the very wording of many of these enactment carry unmistakable evidence of they be concoct for the almost sole protection of the slave-owner adjoining the town-hall or separate only by a avenue be a heavy monastic-looking building use as a bridewell and call the city penitentiary have remain a considerable time in the hall where the trial be go on the agonized state of the prisoner and sickening detail of the murder cause a disinclination for the present to continue my perambulation so i step into the café de l'independence in broadway and call for a port-wine sangaree endeavor while i sip it smoke a cigar and read the _ courier and inquirer _ to forget the scene i have just witness leave soon after i pursued my way down broadway pass peel 's museum and the astor house to the battery marine promenade this be a delightful spot the finest in point of situation -lrb- although not in extent -rrb- of the kind i ever see the esplanade at charleston in south carolina of which i shall have by-and-by to speak more particularly be except lady and gentleman be promenade up and down under the umbrageous foliage of the lofty tree which skirt the battery park and which be as yet unscathed by the recent frost form a delightful retreat from the scorching ray of a american sun the sea view from this point with the adjacent scenery be interesting and attractive the broad expanse of ocean in the distance the highland loom in the perspective the numerous aquatic bird skim the surface of the estuary and the picturesque fort and woody shore of new jersey all tend to diversify the scene and add to its natural beauty i afterwards visit this place over and over again and every succeed visit add to my admiration and enhance its attraction to the left lie in panoramic grandeur the harbor literally teem with ship of all size and all nation while on the right the entrance of the majestic hudson or north river with crowd of magnificent steamer trader to troy albany and the west form a prominent feature in that direction the passing and repassing of steamer and other vessel of home-traffic and the more exciting arrival of ship from foreign part give a zest to the scene which must be witness to be fully appreciate a day or two after have obtain through a friend leave of admission i cross over to brooklyn and visit the navy-yard the dock of this establishment contain at this time many specimen of american naval architecture of choice description amongst the rest a frigate and several other ship of war lie in ordinary everything appear to indicate good management and efficiency as far as a landsman could judge this be very discernible on board the vessel we be allow to inspect where the utmost order and cleanliness prevail the officer i think seem to exact great deference from the man and they martinet bear ill accord with a republican service be decidedly more marked than on board british ship of war which i have visit at deptford chatham and elsewhere in england probably a stricter discipline may be find necessary on account of the equality that exist in america which might operate to render those under command more difficult of control if such independence be allow to be manifest i find that the army and navy in america be chiefly man by english dutch and irish not a few pole be in the rank of the former : these be impel through lack of employment and the additional inducement of a tolerably liberal pay to join the service the american themselves be too sensible of the inconvenience attend public service as well as too acute to follow such occupation in time of peace though when danger have threaten they have always show themselves at the instant service of the state and as citizen soldier be not perhaps to be equal in any other country from the navy-yard i proceed to hoboken this be a place of great resort in fine weather and be situate nearly opposite the city of new york or rather the eastern part of it here i find assemble a large company of pleasure-seeker in holiday attire some lounge under the tree other in group at pic-nic and not a small proportion of the gentleman regale themselves at the refreshment stall or temporary cafés erect on the grounds on mint julep and iced sangaree the grounds be intersperse with park woodland and forest scenery and be keep in admirable order the manager study to maintain the appearance of original nature and to impress on the mind of the visitor that he be ruralize far from city life amongst primeval forest shade the contiguous scenery be not however calculate to carry out the idea it be quite the custom for american husband to leave they family for the day and enjoy relaxation in they own way a practice that i apprehend would not be sanction by we english lady any more than it would be resort to by english gentleman from motive of kindly and very proper feeling here in a retired spot be the duelling ground which have attain no little notoriety in that latitude as the spot where many a knotty point have be quietly solve by the aid of a pair of pistol or colt 's rifle although for the credit of the citizen of new york and its neighborhood it must be record that they be not so ready to fly to this disgraceful alternative as they ensanguined brethren in the southern or slave state my stay in new york be limit by previous arrangement i be anxious to get back to the city although a day might well be take up in ruralize and explore the arcadian beauty of hoboken the favorite resort of the citizen of new york so after a pretty general though cursory survey of its attraction i recross as i have come in a ferry propel by steam the construction of this boat a whole fleet of which description be busily ply to and fro be unique and unlike any i have see before i must not pass it over without remark in principle it consist of two barge-like vessel place side by side a platform be lay on the top for the engine passenger and steersman the latter as in all american steam-vessel of whatever size be perch in a elevated round-house on deck the stem and stern of this vessel be alike the necessity of turn be thus altogether obviate as in some of the steam-boat on the thame a practice prevail amongst newspaper publisher in america which be i believe only resort to in england in case of public emergency or unusual excitement and that but seldom i mean that of post on large placard the latest arrival of news home or foreign : thus whenever you return home after a sojourn in the city the eager inquiry be sure to be any news up town this custom keep up a lively interest in pass event and disseminate amongst the citizen at large the current news of the day and if it have no other beneficial effect prevent rumor that commonly circulate in time of public excitement to the detriment often of many individual in crowded community i notice the wall of new york thickly post with placard chiefly of a inflammatory political character many of these breathe agrarian principle that would in europe have be inadmissible and would without doubt have lead to the immediate arrest and imprisonment of the author here however they be but little notice by the populace and not at all i believe by the authority cheap newspaper be push into the face of the passer-by at the corner of every principal thoroughfare the price vary from two to six cent these as may be suppose contain together with the current news every description of scandal and trash imaginable they personality be highly offensive injurious and reprehensible thus the freedom of the press be abuse in every part of america and this powerful engine of good or ill convert from a benefit -lrb- as it be if manage with propriety -rrb- into a public nuisance one peculiarity exceedingly annoying to a englishman which be observable even in good society in new york and elsewhere in america be a prying curiosity as to the affair of those with whom they converse they habit at table also often fill one with disgust and the want of good-breeding i witness on more than one occasion would have be resent in england this be the more remarkable as the american entertain high notion of refinement and yet paradoxical as it may appear seem to glory in they contempt of good manners i do not however include the lady in this remark on the contrary i must unequivocally assert that i always observe in they not only in new york but in every other part of the north american continent which i visit the greatest disposition to cover the misdoing of the opposite sex and a great degree of cultivation and politeness although they be perfectly freezing in they manners before formal introduction i do not doubt that there be many among they of great refinement and power of intellect they personal appearance be also consonant with they known amiability the bustle and drive in the trading quarter of the city be very great the merchant and they assistant have a hurry manner of do business discernible in a moment to a stranger which be much to be deprecate and too often lead as i afterwards find to disastrous result business with these man be in general quite a go-a-head sort of affair and not be accompany with method in many case lead to a embarrassed state of circumstance thus it frequently happen that on investigation the asset of a merchant who have stop payment and be a suppose bankrupt realize more than enough to pay the creditor and the party find to he agreeable surprise that he position be not so bad after all the church and other place of public worship in new york have a temporary appearance the steeple of the former be when i visit the city chiefly of painted-wood this i believe be partly the reason why bell be not use although a friend in whose presence i notice this state that contempt for so english a custom have much to do with they disuse if so the prejudice be not confine to new york alone for i be not cheer by the inspiriting sound of a peal in any other part of the union i visit although i think i have hear they be in use in philadelphium and some of the eastern city the time i have allot to remain in new york have expire and be anxious to proceed on my route before the close of navigation i reluctantly bid adieu to my kind friend in that city and make preparation to pursue my way to the more western part of the union hope to reach the mississippus country before the season when the river and canal lead to it would be lock up in ice chapter ii see how yon flaming herald tread the ridged and rolling wave as crash o'er they crest head she bow she surly slave with foam before and fire behind she rend the clinging sea that fly before the roar wind beneath she hissing lea holme -- _ the steam boat _ my first stage in proceed to the interior of the country be to albany 160 mile north of new york to effect this i take passage on board a splendidly-equipped steamer call the _ narraganset _ and esteem at the time the swiftest boat on the hudson river i must confess i be rather timid when i do so for the reckless manner in which the crack boat be run in order to maintain they character for celerity be proverbial and as may be suppose be little consonant with safe travel the almost constant recurrence of steam-boat explosion and consequent sacrifice of life report of which be daily to be see in the newspaper weigh somewhat heavily on my mind and the latent fear be not lessen by see four barrel of pitch roll on board the very moment i set foot on the deck of the _ narraganset _ i have to console myself however as i best could under the circumstance and trust to providence but have it not be for the payment of my fare which have previously be arrange and its inevitable loss if i stop behind i believe i should have decline the passage from my horror of a race although before the boat get under weigh my lurk fear of explosion be great they be much enhance just after start in consequence of a opposition boat be loose from she mooring at the same minute that we vessel get clear of the levee this account for the barrel of pitch i have see on deck the head of which be knock out just as we enter the hudson and a portion of the contents throw with the fuel into the roar furnace this powerful generator of caloric of course give increase rapidity to the motion of the engine and in a couple of hour we leave we opponent far behind it be remarkable that although the american as a people travel more perhaps than any other nation so little attention be pay by they to safety in transit it be openly avow that nothing be more common than steam-boat explosion and steam disaster of various kind throughout this vast continent and where boat be construct to carry 1000 or 1200 passenger as be usual on the american river the loss of life in case of accident be fearful to contemplate i be aware that the subject have be discuss in congress and that the question of remedial measure have occupy the attention of the executive during several successive presidentship but still the evil remain and the public mind in america be almost daily agitate by disaster of this nature as long as the rampant spirit of competition and desire to outvie they fellow which prevail amongst a large class of american be tacitly if not openly encourage by the govern power such a state of thing must exist and will probably increase but it be a positive disgrace to a country possess great natural attraction and on this account visit by many foreigner that they should by this system be expose to daily peril of they life the act of congress lately promulgate although apparently stringent be virtually a dead letter in consequence of the facility for evasion and the ingenuity of the offender the effort to outrun a rival be attend by a insane excitement too often participate in by the passenger who forget for the time that they be in a similar situation to a man sit on a barrel of gunpowder within a few foot of a rage furnace i frequently find myself in such a position in consequence of this dangerous propensity and the remedy suggest to my mind and which i recommend to other be never to take a passage on american water in a first-class steam-boat as the principle act upon be to maintain the character of a first-rater at all hazard regardless of the life or limb of the helpless passenger the _ narraganset _ like most of the large river steamer be construct with three deck and fit up in sumptuous style one large saloon with a portion partition off for the lady serve as a cabin and dining apartment there be no profess distinction of class in the passenger on board steam-boat in america i find however that the higher grade doubtless from the same cause that operate in other part of the world keep aloof from those beneath they the scene from the upper or hurricane deck -lrb- as it be call -rrb- be very attractive flow as the river hudson do through a fine mountainous country the magnificent scenery on the bank strike the observer with feeling ally to awe the stream be broad and tortuous beetle crag high mountain and bluff and dense forest burst suddenly and unexpectedly into view fearful precipice abound here and there amidst luxuriant grove and uncouth pine barren form altogether a diversity that give the whole the character of a stupendous panorama before we be out of the tide which for mile flow up the river we vessel ground three time but after puff and strain for a considerable time she get off without damage and pursue she onward course most of my fellow-voyager be dispose to be distant and taciturn and so i enjoy the grandeur of the scene in solitary musing to which the steamer sloop under sail and other vessel proceed up and down the river give a pleasant enlivenment the promenade deck crowd with lady passenger and beautiful child under a gay awning add to the cheerfulness of the surround aspect and the fineness of the weather but for the fear of collapse boiler would have make the trip one of great enjoyment another drawback i have nearly forget and as it serve to illustrate steam-boat and indeed all other travel inconvenience in america i must not pass it over i refer to the vulgarity of the man passenger who in default of better occupation chew tobacco incessantly and to the great annoyance of those who do not practice the vandalism eject the impregnate saliva over everything under foot the deck of the vessel be much deface by the noxious stain and even in converse with lady the unmannerly fellow expectorate without sense of decency the lady however seem not to regard it and one bright-eyed houri i see look into the face of a long sallow-visaged young man who have the juice ooze out at each angle of he mouth with disgusting effect so that enunciation be difficult some mile up the hudson on a high piece of table-land amidst romantic scenery stand in prominent relief the military college of west point it command a extensive view and be i believe a important outpost during the late war the young graduate be exercise in party on the parade ground under officer and appear dress in dark jacket with silver-coloured button and light blue trowser we see the target use by the graduate in artillery who practice on the river bank at least it be so state by a fellow-passenger who either be or pretend to be acquaint with all the affair of that college beneath the summit of a high bluff cover with wood contiguous to the college i observe a monument or obelisk which i ascertain to have be erect to the memory of kosciusko a polish patriot who take a prominent part in the annihilation of british rule in america it have a very picturesque effect and be regard with feeling of veneration by many of the american passenger one of whom pay a tribute to the depart hero which he wind up by observe with nasal emphasis and lugubrious countenance if twarnt for that ere man wher would we be i waunt to know not here i guess this sentiment although i could scarcely see the point of it myself elicit half-a-dozen do tell and i waunt to know from those around expression which foolish as they sound to english ear be in common use in the northern and eastern state when a individual acquiesce in or be anxious to know more about what be state as the scenery on the hudson although picturesque and highly romantic savor somewhat of sameness i shall forbear any further description of it no one visit america should omit if possible a passage to albany in order to enjoy perhaps the finest natural scenery in the world the individual who deliver the eulogium i have note on kosciusko state that at the time of the war a immense chain cable be throw across the river at west point to prevent the british vessel proceed to the interior and this they in vain try to destroy by firing chain or bar shot after a favourable passage we at length reach albany which be a extensive city and the depôt for produce especially wheat bring _ viâ _ the erie canal from the interior be in fact the storehouse of the trade to and from the interior state of the union west as well as from canada and the lake it be finely situate on the west bank of the hudson many of its inhabitant be descend from the first colonist especially the adventurous and persevere dutch who like the scotch cling with tenacity to the spot they fix upon and quickly accumulate property this city be continually grow in importance from the vast number of small capitalist who flock there and settle and it will eventually no doubt vie with new york itself in wealth and importance as i determine to make no stay here but to proceed up the erie canal to buffalo i do not see much of this place and must therefore omit any lengthen description of it from what i do see it appear a densely-populated well-built city lay out with much regularity and boasting of many substantial building several of the edifice be construct of white marble have secure a passage on board a canal packet about to start i at once embark and in a few hour after be run up the erie canal at the rate of six mile a hour the boat be tow by four light horse of high mettle the trappings of these animal be of a novel description bell be append to various part of the harness and streamer or plume of white hair and gaudy ribbon float in the air from the bridle of each a postilion in a suit of gray with a otter-skin cap ride on the rearmost or saddle horse and he _ nonchalance _ and perfect command of he team be surprising this boat be some sixty yard in length and construct only for passenger and they luggage the interior form a long saloon in miniature fit up with lounge and tastefully decorate a promenade on the deck or top furnish a good place for exercise at night we saloon be convert into a general dormitory a portion be partition off for the lady by range of shelf be suspend from the side on which be lay the mattress & c owing to the number of lock and stoppage at the miserable town and village on the canal bank we passage to buffalo take several day and the country be flat and uninteresting although divide into farm which in general appear to be in a state of tolerable cultivation i be not a little relieved when we begin to approach the city the formation of the erie canal be one of those grand internal improvement frequently to be meet with in that country and which have contribute to its general prosperity in no small degree the projector of this vast undertaking de witt clinton be justly esteem by american citizen who regard he as a public benefactor and he name rank with the founder of they independence the canal run for a considerable distance before it reach buffalo parallel with the lake but separate from it by a sort of artificial sea-wall as we merge into the vicinity of this magnificent inland sea the sun be shine brightly and give it the appearance of molten silver as far as the eye could reach a wide expanse of water present itself and the distant shore of canada give beauty to the scene at black-rock we could distinguish the site of the british fortification from which in the last war red-hot cannon-ball be eject to the dismay of the terrify american and the destruction of many of they house buffalo be a flourishing city on the border of lake erie and about twenty mile south of the fall of niagara it be within the boundary of the state of new york and have of late year greatly increase in extent wealth and population the old town quite a inconsiderable place on the site of which the present city have rise phoenix-like be burn to the ground during the late war by some british officer who make a sortie from the canada shore which circumstance have be hand down from father to son still rankle in the bosom of many of the older inhabitant who do not fail to state they belief that retributive justice will eventually be administer by the entire subjugation of canada during my rather prolonged stay in buffalo i have frequent opportunity of discover that the most rancorous feeling exist on the subject and in proof of this it may be remember by the reader that the canadian insurgent be assist at the late insurrection by supplies of store from this city these be convey to navy island by the steamer _ caroline _ which be subsequently seize and send over the fall of niagara by the british troops a number of the crew be cruelly massacre from inquiry make of party well inform on the subject both in canada and the united state i be convince that the public act of sir john colborne before quit the governorship of the province in 1835 viz the allotment or appropriation of 346252 acre of the soil as a clergy reserve and the institution of the fifty-seven rectory be the chief predispose cause of the insurrection by this act a certain portion of land in every township be set apart for the maintenance of a protestant clergy under which ambiguous term the clergy of the church of england have always claim the sole enjoyment of the fund arise from the sale of such portion of land this be look upon by dissenter of all denomination as a direct infringement of the original intention of the act which they maintain be for the purpose of aid the protestant cause at large against the innovation of the roman catholic church much ill-will and sectarian prejudice be the natural consequence in fact the act be a perfect apple of discord throughout the canada and have engender more animosity and resentment than any one legislative act sanction by the home government since the acquisition -lrb- if so it can he call -rrb- of the country it be a indelible disgrace to england that such a manifestly bigoted and narrow-minded policy should have be allow to continue so long and i be fully persuade that this enactment which there be little doubt originate in sectarianism perpetuate a degree of rancorous feeling in the mind of people there that be sufficient to account for the disaffection and tendency to rebellion that ever and anon display itself and that to remove this blister and allow the application of these fund to all creed alike would be to restore peace and convert doubtfully-affected community to allegiance if there be one consideration that ought to weigh in the mind of the british as a people to endeavor to rivet the affection of the canadian more than another and prevent the ultimate cession of that country to the american it be that the dependency afford now the only asylum for those persecute outcast of humanity the slave of the united state canada the land of freedom be associate in they mind with paradisaical thought of happiness -- and many a heart-stricken creature in the southern state of america as i have many opportunity of ascertain toil on in content with canada in view as the ultimatum of he hope and the land of he redemption the population of buffalo be fluctuate owe to the vast number of emigrant who be constantly arrive _ en route _ to ohio michigan and the far west it average in population about ten thousand the city be not of great extent and consist in chief of one principal thoroughfare call maine-street which be wide the lower part terminate at the water 's edge along which spacious store be erect for the reception of wheat and goods in transit the harbor be form by a arm of lake erie unite with buffalo river here be always congregate a large fleet of steamer many of they of leviathan dimension which be employ in run to and from detroit in michigan and the intermediate port as well as in the upper lake trade be quite a depôt buffalo bid fair ere the lapse of many year to be the grand emporium of the west the public building do not deserve much notice the eagle theater a joint-stock concern be the only building of much interest there be however several spacious hotel and two or three bank that boast some architectural merit although much i believe can not be say as to they stability the lateral street be rather obscure and not be regularly build upon give the city a unfinished look these be however dot here and there with chateau have good garden well arrange the niagara railway station be situate to the left of maine-street about half-way up that premier thoroughfare at night the distant moan of the niagara fall be audible and this together with what i have hear and read make I very anxious to visit the spot accordingly one splendid morning i start by train for the purpose for some mile before we reach niagara we constantly hear the roar of the rush water and be thus prepare for the stupendous scene that burst upon the view as we alight at the door of that _ ne plus ultra _ of modern hostelry the pavilion hotel my power of description will fall short of convey to the mind of the reader the awful grandeur of this cataract so often comment upon by traveller the first impression feel by I be that the whole substratum on which i stand which seem to tremble be about to be sweep away by the vast inundation it be not the height of the fall but the immense body of water which comprehend with constant accumulation from the tributary on the way the overflowing of lake erie superior michigan and huron the astonishing effect of such a body of water dash abruptly over a precipice of 150 perpendicular foot may be conceive such be the momentum of this immense volume of fluid that when it strike the rocky bed at the base of the cataract it rebound in a thick cloud of vapor -- and when the sun 's ray intercept it as be the case when i arrive there a beautiful rainbow of vivid color encircle the area of the chasm and together with the natural curiosity and situation of the entire scene present to the amaze beholder the effect of a highly-executed picture in a frame of sun-light although far surpass the production of human skill which may well be say in comparison to sink into utter insignificance a large company of visitor be assemble at the time of my arrival probably from all part of the world -- so that i find it impossible to get a bed unless i penetrate into the interior with a view to obtain accommodation at some farm-house or cross to the canada side but feeling too tired after the day 's excitement to pursue either such course i take a evening train and return to buffalo the same day where i arrive at 9 pm about three mile from buffalo be a indian village call tonawanda i frequently see party of the inhabitant who resort to the city to dispose of they wares and produce some of the warrior be fine athletic fellow of great stature the lowest i see be over six foot in height they be clothe in tan buck-skin curiously fringed and ornamented with porcupine-quill richly dye they squaw -lrb- wife -rrb- be envelop in fine canadian blue broad cloth they favorite costume the crimson or other gaudy-coloured selvedge form a conspicuous ornament like all the aborigine of america they cling with tenacity to primeval habit and custom resist every attempt make by the white population to make or persuade they to conform to civilized life the ill-usage they have be subject to by the american may however account for this in a great measure they be describe to I by one of the resident as a dissipate set of fellow who squander all they get in fire-water as they term ardent spirit and when inebriate be so quarrelsome that it be dangerous in the highest degree to irritate they not very long after i arrive a circumstance occur that threaten most fearful consequence the indian whom i have before refer to be in the frequent habit when they come to the city to dispose of they produce -lrb- for many of they follow husbandry -rrb- of get so tipsy that there be continual danger of bloodshed they natural animosity on such occasion be rouse with fearful vehemence so that the authority be compel to adopt some step to remedy the evil it be no uncommon occurrence to see a indian waggon by the road-side with its pair of horse _ san _ driver who might have be find either drunk or quarrel at the other end of the city and although the horse be always impound and a fine inflict still the nuisance continue without abatement in fact be rather on the increase the new mayor be a man more alive than he predecessor to this evil cause a regulation to be pass by the civic council that any indian find so far the worse for liquor in the street of buffalo as to be incapable of take care of himself should be punish by be make to work on the high road for a short period with a iron ball and chain attach to he leg when this law be promulgate there be a strong impression that the indian would show resistance this be soon find to be a correct view of the case for not a week have elapse before two warrior be bring before the mayor and sentence to ten day ' probation at road-mending in pursuance of the decree they have however only be at work two day in the upper part of maine-street in charge of two constable when a large body of they fraternity armed _ cap-a-pié _ enter the city and with horrid yell and brandish tomahawk rescue the culprit knock off they chain and carry they in triumph to the indian village amidst fearful threat of fire and blood as this attack be unexpected no resistance be offer and although there be much discussion afterwards about the law be vindicate and a example be make the matter from motive no doubt of public safety be allow to drop and for the future the red man have it all they own way although there be certainly sign of amendment and the evil decrease to a very great extent the indian maxim be firm in friendship but ruthless in war there be little doubt that the course pursue on this occasion by the city authority be the best under such circumstance lake erie be a fine piece of water be 265 mile long from buffalo to detroit the two extreme end and average about 60 mile broad at its north-east end it communicate with lake ontario and the canadian shore by the gut or strait of niagara towards the west end be numerous island and bank which be furnish with light-house for the guidance of the mariner its water wash the foot of maine-street -lrb- buffalo -rrb- where they meet the river from which that city take its name it be frequently visit by furious gale which play havoc with the steamer many of which be annually wreck while i remain in buffalo i take several excursion to the town that skirt this beautiful inland sea on one of these occasion the steamer be drive by stress of weather to take shelter in the small harbor of huron some distance up the lake this we reach with much difficulty the violence of the sea threatening every moment the total destruction of the vessel as we enter the harbor the air ring with a shout of welcome from the inhabitant of the place who have be watch we perilous progress in great anxiety and be assemble at the end of the little pier here we remain for two day and night the wind blow all that time with the fury of a hurricane the lake during the storm present the appearance of the sea in a stiff north-wester the white-crested wave rise in violent commotion to a fearful height huron be but a small and uninteresting place situate in a most unwholesome locality lie opposite to a murky swamp whose poisonous vapor spread disease and death around it be the highway to sandusky city a inland border town render famous for the obstinacy with which the inhabitant and a body of we infantry defend a fort there against the attack of the british troops in 1812 have ascertain the captain 's intention not to sail until the day follow and it be describe as a very attractive spot i hire a horse and after a seven mile ' ride through a country dot with farm house which have a desolate look and the land appertain to which be subdivide by zigzag log fence -lrb- hedge be unknown in the back settlement -rrb- i reach the so-called city which be build in nearly the form of a parallelogram the area of greensward have a pretty effect here be some good hotel and a seminary or college for young lady which be much patronize by the better class of the northern and eastern state especially new york i look in vain for the fort which have since the war be demolish but the landlord of the hotel at which i afterwards dine take I to its site and related several incident that occur in connection with the fortress and the struggle between the belligerent party at the time as however i consider these somewhat apocryphal from several of he relation fail to hang together and he decide bias against the britisher as he call the english i shall not trouble the reader with the detail after view the place and its suburb to my satisfaction and after a excellent dinner of green maize and venison i ride back to the steamer it be towards evening when i arrive and as i approach huron by the bank of the creek that divide the swamp i have mention and which be unusually swollen i notice a canoe that have break loose from its mooring drift down the current a moment afterwards the owner arrive in breathless haste to endeavor to save it from destruction he exertion be however useless and finding there be no alternative he hail the bystander and offer the reward of a dollar to any one who would swim to and paddle the canoe on shore this offer be eagerly catch at by a tall man of great muscular power who be amongst the crowd and who at once throw off he coat and plunge into the stream this be very rapid and after a few moment battle with the turbid current he be overpower utter a loud cry for assistance which i shall never forget and which ring in my ear like a death knell he disappear from the view of the spectator and be probably entangled in the tree and debris that be float down the torrent he do not rise again a loud wail arise from the terrify assemblage who be unable to render the poor fellow any assistance and who run about in frantic excitement the canoe be lose be carry at a rapid rate into the open lake where it capsize and sink immediately after drag for the body for upward of a hour it be fish up from under some log of timber moor some distance below where the catastrophe occur the body be land and place on the bank a loud altercation ensue as to the means to be use to attempt resuscitation -- a vain hope -- but still persist in by those assemble some want to roll it on a barrel other to suspend it by the heel that the water might be void at length a doctor arrive and after some inquiry pronounce effort useless from the time the body have be under water this at once damp the ardor of the crowd although it do not discourage a female who have take a prominent part in the operation and who with that true womanly tenderness and solicitude which do honor to she sex and which be nowhere more conspicuous than in america insist upon the corpse be take to a neighbouring house where like a minister angel she persevere in she effort for a considerable time although of course without effect the bank of lake erie in the vicinity of huron be thickly stud with small tree and coppice wood this scenery be intersperse with open natural meadow-land give it a park-like aspect and several spot would grace with a mansion have form a estate any nobleman in europe might have be proud of the shore of canada loom in the hazy distance give a fine effect to the scene the noise and disagreeable odour arise from the bull-frog and other reptile that infest the swamp opposite the village at night fill the air and render it impossible for I to sleep as i lay restless on my bed i suddenly hear a gun fire and start up in some alarm i hastily put on my clothes and descend to the bar of the hotel here several of the inmate be assemble and be prepare to cross the creek with lantern to explore the swamp cry of distress have be distinctly hear as of some benighted traveller who have lose he way after listen intently and firing several rifle to guide the wanderer or apprize he that assistance be at hand the party cross the creek in a canoe and move along the skirt of the morass hallooing loudly all the time the cry however hear only at interval at the commencement become gradually indistinct and at last cease altogether after a ineffectual search for a hour or more the party again turn towards huron strongly impressed with the belief that the unfortunate being have sink with he horse in the soft bed of the swamp which be some mile in extent and have perish miserably the day follow i visit the nearest point from which the cry be hear but i could discern no sign of the sufferer nor could i even trace footmark this however be not remarkable as they would speedily be obliterate by the many reptile nurture in the morass it be afterwards question whether the suppose wanderer be only a catamount a species of jaguar that emit doleful cry at night the storm have abate i soon after return on board and in due course reach buffalo where i have the pleasure of meeting with a old acquaintance from whom i have long be separate and who have delay he intended voyage up the lake to await my return a large proportion of the population of buffalo be people of color and one quarter of the town be almost exclusively inhabit by they many of these i regret to add be live in a state of degradation pitiable to behold apparently without the least endeavor be make by they white fellow-citizen to improve they condition some of these color people keep eating-house for the accommodation of those of they own complexion but the greater number be employ as stoker and steam-boat hand a few of these man despite the prejudice that exist -lrb- and it be nowhere in the union more marked than in buffalo -rrb- rise above the common level and by that probity of character and untiring energy which i believe to be inherent in the race become man of substance one instance of this deserve especial notice as the subject of it have entirely by the good quality mention amass a fortune and have marry a woman of english birth i be introduce to this individual some time after my arrival in buffalo and he singularly correct view and uprightness of character make I partial to he company he wife be a notable well-informed good-looking woman about forty year of age irrespective of color i certainly admire she discrimination in the choice of a partner although she be look down upon by the wife of the white citizen and in common with she husband be almost entirely shun by they there may perhaps have be a higher consideration than that of a good settlement to cause a english woman in this instance to marry a dark mulatto but i be always of opinion and she confirm this by hint drop casually that the consideration of a fortune have more to do with the alliance than love this gentleman keep a good house and have many servant he wife be fond of amusement he hire a box for she use at the eagle theater which she always attend alone the etiquette of the white citizen not permit he attendance with she he appear almost always in a despond mood a tendency arise entirely from the insulting demeanor use towards he by the citizen and he frequently talk of remove to canada or the far west to avoid the treatment he be subject to at the hand of a pack of young scoundrel who take every opportunity to annoy and treat he with indignity for marry a white woman the consequence be that neither he nor he wife scarcely ever venture out if they do so it be never in company and usually after dark i be politely offer the use of they box at the theater during my stay and on one occasion avail myself of the offer but i never venture again -- the box be evidently marked and during the performance i be subject to the most disgusting remark and behavior from the audience indeed this be carry so far that i retire long before the curtain drop so intent be he fellow-citizen on annoying this inoffensive man that soon after he be mob in maine-street by the young desperado i have refer to who from they determine opposition to intermix marriage be know in the place as anti-amalgamist on this occasion poor p -- nearly lose he life and but for run would no doubt have do so as it be he be much burnt about the head and neck the ruffian in the scuffle have set fire to he frock-coat which be of linen it be rather remarkable that at st loui on the missourus some ten month afterwards i meet this very man he have purchase some government land in a remote part of that state we meeting be quite accidental for i cross the street and accost he as he be hurry along in the course of we interview he press I earnestly to go up the country with he but this i decline from motive of prudence the route lie through a slave-holding state where a white and colored man travel on term of equality would be sure to excite suspicion he have a small bundle of papers under he arm and on my remark he appear intent on business he state they be he free papers and that not ten minute before he have be challenge to produce they but this he say would not have prevent he arrest and detention in the city gaol until the authority of buffalo have be write to under suspicion of he be a fugitive have he not take the precaution before he leave that city to obtain from the mayor a certificate of he intention to proceed to the missourus country and the object of he visit he tell I that if he like he purchase he should build a house on it and cultivate the land as a farm as he continued residence in buffalo after the disposition to annoy he show by the citizen render he stay there out of the question i afterwards dine with he at he hotel which be a obscure tavern in a unfrequented part of the city in and about which i see several color people i afterwards ascertain that this be what be there derisively term a nigger boarding-house and that the keeper of superior hotel would not think of accommodate a color person even for a night from subsequent experience in such matter i have no doubt that this version be a true one the hotel and cafés in the slave state be all frequent by slave owner and dealer these would not think of put up at quarter where color folk be entertain this distinction be so marked that no negro would attempt to apply for refreshment at the bar of such place as the inevitable consequence of such a liberty would be refusal if not summary ejectment it be therefore the custom in all southern town and city for the negro population to resort to place keep expressly for the accommodation of color people these be not always keep by man of they own complexion but often by white man who have become friendly with they have lose caste with the whites and be in fact discard by they in the harbor of buffalo i see two brig that during the war in 1812 have be capture by the american and sink somewhere up the lake on the american side these have recently be raise by means of apparatus invent by a ingenious american they be strong substantially-built brig of about 250 ton burden each i be surprise to find what a preserving effect the lake water have upon the timber the wood be almost black in color and so hard that it be difficult to make a impression upon it even with a axe these vessel have be sell to a shipping company and be at the time employ i think in the chicago or upper lake trade i have frequently hear of the number of rattle and other snake to be meet with on the bank of the lake but these have be nearly exterminate by the settler during my stay in the suburb i only find a few water-snake bask in the sun amongst the wilderness of aquatic plant that cover the surface of the water in the creek the superstitious dread of inhale the east wind blow from the mouth of the lake be now explode and be consider in the light of a by-gone tale although for three-quarter of a century it be consider baneful even to the healthy consumptive patient be however soon carry off the bite blast from the canadian shore prove very fatal in pulmonary complaint and the winter be very severe a plentiful supply of excellent fish of various sort be procure from the lake these be salt in barrel and find a ready market in the northern and eastern state my abode in the city of buffalo extend over the greater part of a year and during this period i have frequent opportunity of witness that tendency to overreach that have perhaps with some justice be call a disposition in the generality of american to defraud i do not mean to stygmatize any particular class of man in this imputation but i must record my decide conviction arise from transaction with they that business with the mass of citizen there be not that upright system that obtain with such successful result in the mother country amongst those engage in commercial relation perhaps it would be but fair to make some excuse for man of this class in a country whose heterogeneous population and consequent exposure to competition render it a struggle to obtain a livelihood it be notorious that thousand of man in america be oblige as it be to succumb to this influence or become pauper and be thus drive out of the path of strict rectitude and honesty of purpose and compel to resort to all sort of chicanery to enable they to make two end meet in no instance be this more observable than in the selling propensity of the american for sale seem to be the national motto and would form a admirable addendum to the inscription display on the coin _ e pluribus unum _ everything a man possess be voluntarily subject to the law of interchange the farmer the land speculator and the keeper of the meanest grocery or barber 's stall be alike open to a trade that be a exchange of commodity in the hope or prospect of some profit honestly or dishonestly be attach to the transaction this induce a loose gambling propensity which indulge in to excess often lead to ruin and involvement and if absolute beggary be defer cause numerous victim to be perpetually flounder in debt difficulty and disgrace chapter iii then blame mo not that i should seek although i know not thee to waken in thy heart its chord of holiest sympathy it be for woman 's bleeding heart for woman 's humble form o'er which the reek lash be swing with life 's red current warm e m chandler on a fine morning in June i take my departure from buffalo in the lake steamer _ governor porter _ for the port of cleveland in the state of ohio the sun be shine on the silvery bosom of the lake which in a dead calm give it a refulgent glassy appearance we have not however be two hour at sea before the cloud begin to collect and a heavy gale come on with rapidity this continue to increase until the day follow during which the vessel have pass cleveland the place of my destination and be drive before a furious north-wester towards detroit at the head of the lake the captain state that all he endeavor to make the landing-place at cleveland have be unavailing but if those passenger whom he have engage to land there would proceed with he on the voyage to he destination he would land they on he return which he say would probably be in three or four day as this offer necessarily include board the three passenger who be in the same predicament as myself after a short consultation agree to accept it and as time be not a object to I i do not demur for i much wish to have a view of the country in that direction have either of we dissent the captain would probably have land we at the next port a result that would have involve the expense and inconvenience of a thirty mile ' ride or thereabout to cleveland in a rough stage over rougher road the weather moderate towards sunset and we have a very favourable passage to the head of the lake and enter detroit harbor which lie at the foot of the town i soon after land and take a stroll into it it be not a very populous place the inhabitant be i should say under 4000 the house be in general heavy dirty-looking building though the street be tolerably wide and build with regularity it be i believe peopled principally by french and dutch who appear to be in low circumstance and who follow the usual town occupation this town which be essentially gaelic in appearance be situate on the west side of the strait between lake st clare and erie and be within sight of malden in canada with the shore of which province a constant trade or communication be keep up by steam here be situate a extensive government agency for the sale of land in michigan whither at the time vast number of new settler be daily proceeding in search of home and happiness i see many of these on they way and as they toil to they new home they look haggard forlorn and abject and i think i could distinguish in almost all especially the woman a aspect of grief that indicate they be exile who have leave behind all that tend to make life joyous and happy to seek a precarious existence in a unknown wilderness as the town afford few attraction the only place of amusement be a temporary theatrical exhibition i be not a little rejoice when the vessel again start down the lake which she do with every advantage of favourable weather in due course we reach cleveland and as i be anxious to proceed onward i take but a cursory view of the place which be like detroit situate on a somewhat rise ground it appear a thriving town and the hotel be in general superbly fit up as i be stroll towards the canal to take my passage to the ohio river a little incident occur which as it illustrate a very old adage i will not omit pass some low-built house near the canal my attention be arrest by the scream of a female who utter loud cry for assistance hasten to the door of the house from which the alarm proceed i lift the latch in great trepidation when i see a man just about to strike a woman -lrb- who prove to be he wife -rrb- with a uplifted chair the fellow be vociferate loudly and appear in a towering passion my first impulse be to cry out drop it when lo as if i have like katerfelto the by-gone professor of legerdemain cry presto the scene change and both man and woman who be american of the lower class commence bully I in right earnest i make my retreat with some difficulty as they seem both of they inclined to serve I roughly for my well-intentioned though perhaps mistime interference as i make my escape however i intimate pretty loudly that i should at once apply to a magistrate on the subject a threat by-the-bye that be little regarded and only increase the shower of abuse level at I as my appeal to a magistrate would be of little avail in the case of a family jar and would certainly have entail inconvenience and delay i do not carry my threat into execution wonder at the same time at my temerity in interfere in a quarrel between man and wife which i now practically learn for the first time in my life be to incur the unmitigated anger of both and to learn how true it be that those who in quarrel interpose must oft expect a bloody nose i visit the portion of the town appropriate by the mormon as a residence here in the midst of they dwelling they have erect a temple for worship which on they emigrate west they arch-leader smith prophesy would by the interposition of heaven be destroy by fire the prophecy be verify as to the fact but heaven have it appear little to do with it for it be ascertain to be the work of a incendiary of they sect who be detect and bring to condign punishment i be afterwards inform by a american gentleman to whom i have a letter of introduction and who have be a great sufferer by these impostor that some time before the great body of mormon migrate to the interior they start a bank have manage to put a vast number of they note in circulation for which they receive produce they close the door and leave the public to be loser by they nefarious scheme i have the misfortune myself in my ignorance to take from a dishonest store-keeper a ten-dollar bill of this spurious currency and do not detect the imposture until i offer it to the captain of the boat i have engage a passage in to _ la belle rivière _ as the ohio be call i must mention however that i take it previously to the interview with the gentleman i have advert to and actually without know it have the note in my pocket-book when he mention the default of these pseudo banker i pay ten dollar for a useful lesson the passenger from cleveland form a motley group for irrespective of french dutch american and canadian we have on board eight or ten family of the mormon sect follow in the wake of they leader smith and rigdon to they new settlement in the far west these people be very reserved and seem incline to keep aloof from they fellow-passenger this however may be account for by the prejudice so justly exist at the time against they as a body from the cause i have already mention in fact the indignation of the people could hardly be keep in check by the authority and lynching be resort to on more than one occasion the man be clothe in drab broad-cloth and wear large white hat they garb altogether resemble that of the more respectable society of friend in america the resemblance however cease with the dress for if report speak true and they be many-tongued they be very exceptionable in they morality and general principle amongst other peculiarity polygamy be allow for the avowed purpose of extend and perpetuate the sect we progress be pretty rapid though it lay through a uninteresting country in many part uncultivated and barren-looking massillon be a very flourishing town with some good store and two or three hotel as the captain be oblige to make a short stay here i go into the town and step into a hotel to procure a cigar i find a company engage in earnest conversation interrupt at interval by loud laughter on inquiry i be tell that the landlord have that morning be play a yankee trick by a travel pedlar who have stop the previous night at he house it appear that the same man have some month before practice on the landlord but either suppose the matter blow over and forget or what be more likely with a view to put another of he art into exercise he again put up at the same house the proprietor however at once recognize the pedlar and after tax he with the cheat he have practice on the former occasion wound up he lecture by state in true american style that if he again succeed in cheat he he would forego the amount of he tavern expense the man exclaim do and at once it appear set he wit to work to obtain the object a few hour after the conversation the fellow bring in from he waggon some box of fancy goods and endeavor to induce the landlady to purchase this however no doubt prompt by she husband she resolutely refuse and he have they remove to he room upstairs as be customary after breakfast the follow morning he call the landlady aside and say he forget the day before to show she a fancy quilt of superior workmanship and if she would only look at it he would be satisfy as it be one of great beauty she consent to this and the man at once go to he waggon which be now at the door he be about to start and bring in a box which contain amongst numerous other article the quilt he have be eulogize the landlady be much take with its appearance and after some little persuasion consent to become the purchaser accordingly the bargain be conclude and the balance between he tavern bill and the article in question be hand over at the hotel bar to the pedlar who at once start from the house the landlord on he do so jocosely remark on the conversation of the previous day in reply to which the wily pedlar observe that he guess it be all right soon after the man leave the landlady call she spouse to the inner room and show he she bargain say she have be induce to buy the quilt because it be a exact match for the one in the large room up-stair this lead to a female help -lrb- as servant be there call -rrb- be despatch to the room to fetch and compare the original with that newly purchase the girl speedily return in the greatest consternation say it have vanish the truth now become apparent the artful pedlar have actually sell the landlady she own quilt this ludicrous circumstance lead to the confusion i have notice when i arrive the man have go they know not whither and have it be possible to overtake he i question whether he would have be pursue the cleverness of the trick be highly applaud by the company and the landlord feeling perhaps ashamed of be outwit a second time after himself give the challenge the ingenuity of american pedlar in cozen they countryman have long be proverbial and in general people be wary of they they have however i suppose by long practice become such adept at roguery that however alive to they propensity folk be daily victimize by such man it be nothing new to hear a roguish action applaud but on this occasion the company be vociferous in he praise and declare they would certainly patronize he when he come that way again for he deserve encouragement after stroll through the town which present little worth recording i again return to the boat which proceed on its way i have frequently hear and read of those vast flock of wild pigeon which periodically pursue they flight to milder latitudes : and as the boat be now approach the center of the state of ohio where myriad of these bird be see the year before i anxiously watch the horizon for they appearance for several day however i be doom to disappointment and give it up in despair but a day or two after when in the vicinity of the tuscarawa river it be about noon the helmsman suddenly call out a field of pigeon this announcement call all hand to the promenade deck of the packet look in the direction indicate a heavy black cloud appear in the far horizon this seem to extend from right to left and be so dense that the novice amongst we at once pronounce it either a mistake or a hoax the helmsman declare that it be neither and that we should soon be convince of it the cloud seem now gradually and visibly to spread in truth the whole firmament in that direction be totally obscure by this time a general rummage have commence in the boat for fire-arm the captain hail the driver on the tow path who pull up and the boat be moor by the canal side we now land intend to replenish the larder of the vessel with what to most of the passenger be a rare treat on the left bank of the canal and on the bank of the river which here run parallel with it be a forest of gigantic tree and as the bird be evidently make in that direction it be decide that all those who wish to take part in the expect sport should proceed and wait they pass this spot in the hope that some would settle on the branch of the tree accordingly after cross the river by a rude bridge which be very nearly half a quarter of a mile in length we reach the intended spot after wade up to we knee in a swamp or turbary and get miserably bemaul by the briar and cane vine we have not to wait long the bird weary by a long flight be evidently attract by the favourable resting-place and in less than a quarter of a hour the air be darken with the host hover over we head the sound of they wing defy description those of my reader who remember the peculiar noise make by a single pigeon in its flight may form a faint idea by multiply the sound a million time it in fact fill the air and produce a startling effect thousand of the bird alight on the tree the branch of which snap and crackle fearfully under the superincumbent load those of we party who be arm continue to fire and load as fast as they possibly could they bring hundred to the ground but still through weariness perhaps the rest keep they station on the branch and do not appear to heed the attack much -- shift they position or only fly off for a moment and then again alight by this time many of the settler from the surround district have arrive to share in the quarry thousand of bird be bring to the ground in fact every discharge of the gun and rifle bring down shower to we foot and the noise seem to resemble we be engage in action with a foe without however the dire effect of such a rencontre to ourselves after bag we game of which we secure nearly two hundred brace we return to the boat leave the rest of the sport to those who choose to continue it we have enough and for the remainder of the passage be completely surfeit with pigeon fare administer by the boat 's cook in all sort of outlandish form in we progress onward through the state we see many carcase of these bird outside the village such number have be destroy that the inhabitant could not consume they and they be accordingly throw out as refuse these bird be in good condition and be excellent eating as the packet be likely to be detain for some hour at zoar a settlement about two mile beyond bolivar owe to a dispute between the captain and some officer connect with the canal i availed myself of the opportunity on the invitation of a very gentlemanly fellow-passenger from connecticut to visit a farm a few mile in the interior where reside a celebrated character name adam poe surname by the inhabitant the indian-killer who have acquire the summit of a backwoods-man 's fame by some forty year ago shooting black-foot a formidable indian marauder who for a long period spread consternation and alarm among the early settler as this exploit -lrb- whether justify by the circumstance and time or not i can not pretend to say -rrb- be one that restore security among the settler and disperse a body of indian who destroy every white inhabitant they encounter and lay waste they farm it be no wonder that adam poe be regard as a great man on arrive at the farm-house which be one of the better description in that region we be kindly welcome by the son of the hero i have mention who bear the father 's patronymic and after the usual hospitality be usher into a adjoining apartment and introduce to the object of we visit he be sit in a armchair by the side of he wife who like himself be far advance in year they unite age numbering 173 the old man who be so feeble as to be unable to rise when we enter salute we with the usual glad to see you stranger he spouse at the same time advance towards we to shake hand he be evidently use to such intrusion for after inquiry where we come from and whither bind he begin in a tremulous voice which from he extreme age be scarcely intelligible to narrate he early adventure it be absolutely shocking as he become more animated by the subject to hear the coolness with which the veteran relate some of he bloody combat so much so indeed that i and my companion at once cut short he narration be horrify at the turpitude of the aged sinner who although gasp for breath and evidently on the verge of the unseen world talk of he deed of violence with a ardor that befit a better cause the old man dwell at great length on he hair-breadth escape and deed of prowess but the destruction of the implacable black-foot be the absorb subject this chief it appear have with a small party be hover round poe 's farm for several night and the inmate be in great terror of a midnight attack the principal aim of the chief be it be suppose to despatch a man whose activity have render he particularly obnoxious to he tribe and whose bravery be acknowledge by the settler far and near after several night pass in anxiety every little circumstance any unusual noise the baying of a dog a disturbance in the hog-pens exciting the greatest apprehension poe determine on stealthily watch the enemy under covert of a hillock or embankment on the farm he accordingly sally out with he indian rifle in the haze of the evening take with he a supply of _ aqua vita _ as he facetiously say to keep up he dander after watch a considerable time every now and then apply he ear to the ground to listen for approach footstep -lrb- a plan invariably follow by indian themselves -rrb- he ascertain that a indian be in the vicinity again intently listen he soon satisfy himself that the alarm he have experience be occasion by one individual only instantly on the _ qui-vive _ he first cock he rifle and just as he descry the indian 's head above the embankment he pull with unerring aim the fatal trigger when with a agonizing howl the indian topple backwards down the embankment and all be silent poe now spring forward and with he knife sever the war scalp from the head of the savage and after secure he knife and rifle return to he home in high glee to announce the horrid achievement it be however deem unsafe to venture out again that night for fear of other indian of black-foot 's band who it be well know be in the neighborhood in the morning poe sally out to the place of reconnoitre with some of the inmate of the farm here they find stretch on the ground weltering in gore the vanquish warrior who be now for the first time from a plume he wear and some other peculiarity in he equipment identify as the veritable sachem who have for month keep that settlement in a state of alarm poe be soon compliment by the settler around and from that day forward become a celebrated character i be subsequently tell on board the canal packet that the indian refer to be not the notorious chief of that name but a second-rate warrior who have head a band of marauder \*\*\* med the soubriquet how far this may be the fact i can not determine i however frequently hear poe 's name mention as a brave defender of the hearth and home of the early settler in the remote district of ohio i could perceive that he son 's wife -lrb- a matronly dame of about sixty -rrb- be adverse to such interview as to use she expression they bring the old man back to this world again when he should be ponder on the next and that she be grieve at the recital of they indeed she several time check he expression when they border as they not unfrequently do on impiety she act rightly for there be evidently much more of the soldier than the christian about the old man and before we leave i express a hope that such visit would be discourage a suggestion that be receive in a kindly spirit after inspect the farm which be well stock and appear to be cultivate in the most approve modern style and be well fenced with the usual rail we start on we return to zoar where the packet have halt on we way thither we pass through a hamlet of primitive appearance consist of some half-dozen house build of log at one end of which be a rudely-constructed meeting-house belong to the sect of whitfieldite methodist the congregation be assemble and the horse and vehicle belong to those who reside at a distance be tethered and my companion pass the occupant be chant a hymn previous to the discourse which it appear be a valedictory one the minister be about to leave this for a more extensive field of pastoral labor have time to spare and such a assembly on a week-day attract we attention from its rarity we step in and remain during the whole of the service arrive at zoar a few minute before the boat start as we pass through a densely-wooded district between bolivar and chillicothe i observe that for many mile the tree be denude of every green leaf from the devastating effect of million of locust which periodically visit the western state of the union to the dismay of the settler the tree in many place be at the time cover with these destructive insect i go on shore and procure several with the intention of preserve they they be beautiful creature about ten time the size of a ordinary field grasshopper and except that they hind leg be longer in proportion to they size the exact shape of that harmless little insect they color be brilliant green slate and flamingo red beautifully line and variegate the humming noise produce by these insect be very disagreeable and fill the surround air with murmur while the wilderness look of the scene of they depredation have a depressing effect on the mind of the traveller they visit be much dread as they be follow by the total destruction of foliage in the district and in many instance the young sapling die in consequence of they attack after a pleasant passage of four or five day the packet arrive at the river junction and take passage at once in a steamer which be wait its arrival in the ohio river i be soon rapidly on my way to that fairy city of the west cincinnatus this be the largest city in the state of ohio and be the capital of hamilton county fort washington a defense of some renown during the war be two mile above and opposite to the mouth of the lick river the broad bosom of the ohio be here cover with steam-boat employ in the virginium missourus and new orlean trade the wharf be commodious and a broad inclined plane from the city to the water 's edge give the former a fine appearance as it rest majestically in the background as i be anxious to proceed to the state of missourus with as little delay as possible i at once engage a passage to st loui and the follow morning be steam in the direction of the fall of st anthony the passenger in this boat employ themselves nearly the whole of the route at game of card _ faro _ be the favorite this predilection for gambling which be generally carry to great extreme on board southern boat be not however confine to the cabin for i notice the crew at every spare interval sit about on deck with pack of card completely absorb in the game the negro hand be particularly addict to this vice and a gentleman who be proceed in the boat inform I that but a trifle of the earnings of boat-hand in general be spare from they devotedness to this ruinous practice the effect of association with and the example set by white man give to gamble will account perhaps for the habit this moral pestilence be in vain prohibit by the state and be pursue by all class in the south with frenzied avidity after twice run on shore and meeting with sundry other stoppage and minor mishap through the mismanagement of the two engineer we reach the city of st loui to the gratification of myself and fellow-passenger this be a place of considerable extent although awkwardly build and for the most part irregularly lay out it be a considerable fur depôt of the hudson bay company and there be a recruiting station from whence start expedition of trapper to the rocky mountain i see a large party of these adventurer who be about to start on a expedition to these remote confines it consist entirely of young frenchman and hollander who be prefer for the service by the company they be of slight make and little calculated from they appearance to encounter the hardship of such a life but i be tell they soon become harden and return strong athletic man the employment be however beset with danger from the hostile disposition of the various tribe of indian in the western wild who view they intrusion with vindictive feeling and seize every opportunity of attack and annihilate small party notwithstanding they profession of friendship not long after my arrival a party of trapper arrive from the upper missourus in two boat which be load with buffalo and other fur the stalwart look of these hardy mountaineer prove the hardening effect of they mode of life they be brawny fellow of a ruddy brown complexion of the true indian hue and habit in skin these man i ascertain have be in the mountain for four or five year during which time they have subsist entirely on buffalo and other meat bread not be use or care for they healthy look under such circumstance completely shake my faith in the brahminical vegetarian theory and go far i think to prove that man be intend by he maker to be a carnivorous animal just before the steamer approach the city a circumstance occur on board that fill I and my fellow-passenger with horror we be take breakfast in the cabin congratulating each other on the near termination of we tedious passage when a sudden shriek follow by shout from the deck-hand of the vessel disturb we meal hasten in great perturbation to the deck we soon discover the cause of the disturbance one of the white waiter be lie on the deck with a frightful gash in he side from which the blood be fast ooze we first care be to attend to the sufferer and a surgeon be fortunately amongst the passenger the hemorrhage be soon abate but the wound be pronounced to be of a fatal character the poor fellow who be a lad of about eighteen year of age moan piteously every attention that skill and kindness could suggest be pay to he he be immediately carry to a state-room in the cabin where he remain in great agony until the vessel be moor alongside the levee when he be carefully remove on a litter to a hospital on shore the perpetrator of the savage act prove to be a negro fill the office of assistant cook the passenger be very clamorous and would without doubt have hang the culprit immediately have it not be for the interference of the captain who after a curt examination have he pinion and take below from the version give of the affair by the negro who witness it -lrb- but which be contradict by two white man who be on the spot -rrb- i be incline to think the crime be commit under feeling of great provocation the negro as be commonly the case on board steam-boat have be for a long time browbeat by the victim of the sad catastrophe and subject to very insolent and overbearing treatment at he hand the culprit who be a very sullen stolid-looking full-bred negro refuse to answer the question put to he on the subject and certainly manifest a careless indifference to consequence that be not in he favor he fierce scowl denote great ferocity in all probability induce by long ill-treatment as soon as convenience allow some officer from the shore come on board and secure the prisoner who be convey by they to the city gaol to await the investigation of the outrage by the civic authority and the result of the injury commit the victim of revenge die a few day after the occurrence in excruciating agony it will scarcely be believe that the perpetrator of the deed after a short confinement be spirit away up the country no doubt at the connivance of the authority and sell thus justice be often defeat from pecuniary consideration in the slave state of america where if a slave commit even the heinous crime of murder the ordinary course of the law be interfere with to save the owner from loss this of itself be sufficient to stamp for ever as infamous the social cancer of slavery and brand as ridiculous the boast regard for justice so pragmatically urge in the southern state of the american continent a mile or two from st loui on the carondelet road be situate spacious infantry barracks name after jefferson one of the former president of the union where troops be station in readiness to act against the various tribe of indian in the upper missourus country who sometimes show a disposition to be hostile a reserve of troops be more particularly needful for the protection of the inhabitant for either from mismanagement or a aggressive spirit the government be continually embroil with the aboriginal tribe in harassing and expensive warfare this state of thing act as a perpetual blister and have engender a rancorous enmity between the indian and they white neighbor to the great detriment of peaceful agricultural pursuit by the latter and the periodical perplexity of the chancellor of the american exchequer whereas a conciliate policy would not only keep the tribe in close friendship but secure they service as valuable ally in case of emergency -- a point that may possibly suggest itself eventually to the executive if the rampant spirit of aggrandisement now abroad continue to govern the public mind in america soon after landing i be accost by a middle-aged gentlemanly man on the subject of the outrage on board the boat and as he appear to have less of that swaggering air about he than most man in the south possess i enter freely into conversation with he and in a very short time we interchange of sentiment create a mutual partiality that lead to he invite I to pass the follow evening at he house a result i rather wish for as he manifest a disposition to inform I fully on several question i put to he relative to the state i be now in and my future movement moreover he seem somewhat attach to the english or rather be not strong in he prejudice against they i accordingly repair to he residence at the time appoint this be situate in one of the lateral street of the city lead to the outskirts and although not large be furnish with great taste and elegance he lady who be i think from illinoi make herself very agreeable she kind attention tend to confirm the impression i already entertain of she countrywoman they have no child and the husband be engage in some way with the fur company establish in st loui i be entertain with great hospitality my kind host materially assist I by information & c in my intention to pursue my route south he be the son of a new englander or native of one of the eastern state he father have fight at bunker 's hill and otherwise take a active part in the struggle for independence between the year 1776 and 1785 this make it the more extraordinary that he should treat a englishman with the courtesy he show to I especially as under such circumstance a bias be in general hand down from father to son which operate prejudicially to my countryman after put a variety of question as to the old country as he term great britain on which i readily satisfied he curiosity he enter into a detail of some of the stir event relate to the period of he father 's career in arm against the british some of these be of a thrilling character and strongly depict the misery of war present a lamentable picture of the debase influence of sanguinary struggle on the human mind the barbarous mode of harass the british troops by pick off straggler which the lower order of american pursue in most instance for the sake of the wretched clothing and accoutrements of the victim the former be dye of a dark color and sell for a dollar per set -lrb- as he call the military suit -rrb- to the american citizen-soldier fairly make my blood creep one instance in particular fill I with horror for it be a cold-blooded murder of the deepest dye i must however do the narrator the justice to say that he view the atrocity in the same light as i do the occurrence i be about to relate take place somewhere on the bank of the hudson below west point where a force of british troops be encamp or pursue they operation under the protection of some vessel of war lie in the stream he mention the exact spot where it occur but i have forget it it appear that this force be harass and beset by party of citizen who by pursue a guerilla system of warfare surprising small party and firing entirely in ambush make great havoc amongst the rank and file of the invader almost every straggler fall a victim one evening during this state of thing two of the citizen whilst prowl in a coppice within a few mile of the camp on the look-out come suddenly upon a infantry soldier who be off he guard at the moment and whose firelock be rest against a tree the foremost of the american dart forward and seize the weapon while the second capture the wretched soldier under ordinary circumstance and in more honorable hand the man would have be convey as a prisoner of war to the american camp but plunder be they object this would not answer the purpose of the miscreant the most resolute of whom order the captive -lrb- who be a lad of seventeen or eighteen -rrb- to take off he jacket know this be a preliminary step to he be shoot he fall on he knee and implored mercy he captor be however inexorable and he begin to cry bitterly and beseech they to spare he life these manifestation have however no effect on he deadly foe who now threaten to fall he with the butt end of a fusee if he do not comply : this have the effect and the poor captive reluctantly pull off the jacket and throw it on the ground this be immediately pick up by one of the party to avoid its be stain with the life-blood of the victim withdraw now a few pace one of the american take a deliberate aim the young soldier instantly turn to run but as he wheel round for the purpose -lrb- for he enemy be face he -rrb- a ball enter he left side just under the armpit and spring frantically several foot into the air he fall dead to the ground he be then strip and leave on the spot this horrid relation i should have think for the credit of he country a american would have keep secret but as i before observe he be by no means dispose to take the part of these so-called patriot although he state that many atrocity be commit by the british some of which he related and which be he say never record these i fear if expose would not much redound to they credit with the present generation at first i could not understand why the soldier be order before be shoot to pull he jacket off this he explain by say that a rent in the garment make by the ball of a fusee would have lessen its value and further that the american soldier be averse from superstitious fear at the time to wear any article of dress in which a enemy have yield he breath notwithstanding which repugnance the american soldier not long after dismiss the objection from the extreme scantiness of the clothing afford they on my intimate the abhorrence i feel at the relation my entertainer inform I that it be impossible at the time to prevent such occurrence the annihilation of the invader be the _ primum mobile _ of all american and many citizen harass the enemy on they own account the principle be the same on which european vessel bear letter of marque be suffer to waylay and seize for the purpose of private gain the merchant vessel belong to the country with which they be at war such atrocity as he remark however horrifying in time of peace be of every-day occurrence between contend army amongst those i have occasion to call on at st loui be a major -- he have formerly be engage in indian warfare and have receive a wound from a rifle-ball that incapacitate he for active military duty he be live as a retired citizen -- he wife 's jointure and a allowance from government allow he to keep up a tolerably good establishment he be the owner of several slave and amongst the rest a young woman who be employ as nursemaid in the family the first time i call at he residence i think he a man of superior manners and education and be much pleased with the visit which be conclude with a promise to renew it on a future day when however i repeat my visit soon after i find he alone in he study and he constrain manner soon lead I to perceive that something unusual perturb he mind the cause be soon after explain for the negress before mention come into the room on some trifling errand to my surprise accost he rather freely she master suddenly break out in a paroxysm of rage swear at she awfully and accuse she in a ruffianly way of be insolent to she mistress then violently ring a bell which stand on the table he summon a negro lad into the room and at once despatch he to a neighbor 's house to borrow a new raw-hide whip threaten all the while to flay she alive in vain the terrify creature plead innocence he would take no excuse and although i begged earnestly for he to pass over the offence and the poor slave fall on she knee in the greatest terror he vow vengeance with dreadful imprecation at last the whip come and disregard alike the presence of a stranger and the entreaty of a woman he begin the flagellation with murderous earnest my interference only add to he ungovernable rage the raw-hide be new and the major be a strong muscular man every stroke tell the blood soon flow from the back neck and breast of the poor victim whose cry as she writhe under the savage infliction enter my soul they however make no impression on she brutal tormentor who keep vociferate with all he energy to keep she quiet it be with some difficulty i stand by and witness the assault but i well know my life would be in jeopardy if i attempt to interfere i however screw up my courage to stay in the hope that some sense of shame might induce the fellow to hold he hand this be however a delusive hope for he continue to lay on the whip until he be exhaust the girl be now on the floor of the room moan piteously and a stream of blood be flow from she lacerated person which soak the matting that cover the floor she dress be hang in tatters and the blood trickle down she cheek have a horrifying effect as soon as the ruffian be tired he bid the woman get down stair and wash herself the miserable creature arise with difficulty and pick up she apron and turban which be in different part of the room she hobble out cry bitterly as soon as she be go the major pointed to the blood and say if we do not see that sometimes there would be no living with the brute to which i reply in term he could not misunderstand and at once leave the house determine never again to enter it -- a resolution i religiously keep i afterwards hear that this miserable creature be pregnant at the time a circumstance that would have induce at least some regard to leniency in any man not utterly debased those who be acquaint with southern scene will see nothing extraordinary in this recital for they be every-day occurrence and scarcely elicit a remark unless the perpetrator should happen to be a slave-holding wesleyan or whitfieldite when perhaps he would be call to some account -- he own version of the affair being of course admit _ in limine _ many of the slave-holder be a incorrigibly degrade set of man it be by no means uncommon for they to inflict chastisement on negress with whom they be in habitual illicit intercourse and i be credibly inform that this cruelty be often resort to to disabuse the mind of a deceive and injure wife who suspect unfair treatment this attest fact disgraceful as it be can scarcely be wonder at in man who mercilessly subject defenceless woman to the lash without a spark of human feeling or compunction of conscience it be little to the credit of united state senator that they have not at least make law to protect woman from the barbarous usage of flog one would imagine that man who perhaps above all other in the world pay homage to the sex would have establish a distinction in this respect but i apprehend the truth to be that they be so far influence by they wife who be notoriously jealous of they sable rival that they have succumb to they sentiment and dictation there be many dutch in st loui and along the levee you perceive boarding-house and grocery keep for they accommodation these man be generally great drinker and think as little of quaff at a few draught half-a-pint of whiskey as a englishman would the same quantity of malt liquor they consume also vast quantity of claret i have frequently see a couple of these man at a café drink five or bottle without betray any ill effect it must however be remember that claret be not so potent as the heavier wine a few day after my arrival while stand in the vestibule of my hotel my attention be draw to a loud altercation go on at the bar and as it be evident from the manner of the party that some public question be be discuss i listen and ascertain that a obnoxious citizen have be seize for perpetrate a petty act of revenge on a neighbor by damage he horse and be that day to be publicly tar feathered and escort out of the city as they say bag and baggage have ascertain the spot select for the scene i determine to witness it accordingly at noon the appoint hour i repair to a open spot of building-land on the carondelet side of the city here i find assemble a motley assemblage of citizen negro steamboat-hand and the general riff-raff of the place although the crowd be not so great the meeting strongly remind I of those scene of infamy and disgrace in england -- public execution the conduct of the assemble throng on this occasion be the more decorous of the two precisely at twelve the mob make a rush towards one corner of the open space from which direction i see the culprit advance in charge of thirty or forty well-dressed people -lrb- the committee appoint for the occasion be among the number -rrb- he be a stout man and describe to I as a great bully but now he look completely crest-fallen as the party come on he be hiss by the mob who however keep at a good distance from he guard a man with a large tin can of smoking pitch a brush of the kind use in apply the same and a pillow of feather under he arm follow immediately behind the prisoner vociferate loudly arrive at the spot the poor wretch be place on a stool and a citizen who have take a very prominent part in front of the procession and who i be tell be the chief cause of this outrage step in front of he and pull out a sheet of paper read a lecture on the enormity of he crime which wind up with the sentence about to be enforce when this be finish the man who carry the tar-vessel step up and begin with a scissors to cut off the culprit 's hair which he do most effectually fling portion amongst the crowd who scramble after they as soon as this be finish and the man be strip to the waist the brush be dip into the pitch and the upper part of he person lather therewith not a word escape he but the individual who have take so prominent a part in the punishment keep give direction to the operator to put it on thick even he eye and ear be not spare as soon as this part of the operation be complete the bag of feather be rip open by a by-stander and the contents stick thickly on the part besmear with tar amidst the deafening cheer of the spectator who be by this time in such frantic excitement that i begin to fear a tragedy would ensue especially as many of they shout now hang the varmint hang he this proposal be eagerly second by the mob this be however resolutely overrule by he keeper the appearance present by the victim in this peculiarly american dress be ludicrous in the extreme and _ look _ very comfortable as soon as this part of the exhibition be finish a man with a small drum follow by the mob with yell and execration drive the culprit before they at a run the poor wretch run like a deer from he pursuer who follow at he heel shout frantically until he reach the brink of the river where a boat be wait to take he off he dash into it and be at once row into the middle of the stream out of reach of he tormentor who i quite believe would have administer more severe lynch-law if they could have get hold of he for they passion be work up to the highest pitch of excitement one feature in the scene i could not help remark -- the negro all appear in high glee and many of they actually dance with joy i do not wonder at this for the negro always seem to exult if a white man be in disgrace which after all be no more than might be expect from a class of man tyrannize over as the color people be there and be one of the result of the oppressive system that exact everything that human labor can furnish without remuneration and without -lrb- in by far the greater number of instance -rrb- any approach to sympathy or grateful feeling this alone without take into consideration the outrage inflict on the race by they cruel oppressor supply a sufficient cause for such a tendency if every other be want pass through the principal street the day before i leave st loui a assembly of man chiefly overseer and negro dealer who stand at the entrance of a large store attract my attention large placard with a description of various lot of negro to be submit to public competition soon tell I i should now be able to gratify my curiosity by witness a missourus slave-vendue a man with a bell which he ring most energetically at the door shortly after summon the company the auction be about to commence on a table inside a negress of a little over middle age be stand vacantly gaze with grief-worn countenance on the crowd that now throng to the table on the floor stand two child of about the age of ten and thirteen respectively the auctioneer with the customary volubility of such man in america begin by state that the lot now to be offer be the remnant of a precede sale which he gratuitously observe have be a most satisfactory one and after dilate with some energy on the good quality of the woman before we whose face brighten up a little on hear such a flattering account of she good quality he earnestly request a bidding the poor creature be evidently in ill-health after the most revolting question have be put to she and she person examine by the competitor with disgraceful familiarity she be pronounced all but worthless use up as one of the company observe and be after much demur on the part of the auctioneer knock down for two hundred dollar this sum be as he remark but the moiety of what she ought to have realize she be then roughly tell to get off the table and take she stand near it at a place point out by she purchaser who be a rollicking-looking big-whiskered fellow with a immense leghorn hat the brim of which be line with black and have a broad black ribbon round the crown as the poor woman get down she cast a furtive glance at she child who although the auctioneer certainly try to prevent it be sell to two individual neither of whom be the purchaser of the parent the poor woman look about in great despair while the bidding be go on it be in vain i seek one sympathize look in that company but how could it be expect when it consist of man long inure to such heartless scene -- man whose heart be case-harden by the impious traffic they be now engage in i be however pleased to hear afterwards that the purchaser all reside in st loui and that the woman would often see she child -- poor amends it be true for a cruel separation but more satisfactory than such case generally be chapter iv where will-o ' - the-wisp and glow-worm shine in bulrush and in brake where wave moss shroud the pine and the cedar grow and the poisonous vine be spot like the snake -- longfellow from st loui on the missourus river i take passage to new orlean in one of those magnificent steamer that crowd the inland water of the american continent and which sumptuously furnish as they be have not inaptly be term float palace we have a prosperous passage as far as the junction of the ohio with the mississippus where the boat strike the branch of a large tree that have be wash into the bed of the stream and be there stick fast root downward this formidable chevaux-de-frise -lrb- or snag as it be term by the captain -rrb- fortunately do not do much damage to the vessel although at first a alarm be raise that she be sink and much confusion ensue this apprehension be however soon dissipate by the report of the carpenter whose account of the damage be so far favourable that after extrication by back the vessel and a few temporary repair she be again get under headway the pellucid water of the ohio as they enter the turbid rush current of the mississippus which be swollen by the illinoi and other tributary have a remarkable effect the clear current of the former river refusing for a considerable distance to mingle with the murky stream of the latter and form a visible blue channel in its center -- a phenomenon i think allegorical of the slave-stained condition of the one state and the free soil of the other for while ohio be free from the curse of slavery the bank of the mississippus have for century be deep dye in the life 's blood of the oppressed african we vessel be bear on the rush water with great impetuosity the maddening current of the mississippus seem to carry everything before it as we proceed we constantly see tree topple over into the river the bank of which be continually widen and which in many part have the appearance of a lake after a storm impregnate with debris the tree thus wash into the bed of the river sink root downward and make the navigation perilous as i have before describe we meet numerous steamer come up the stream one of they have a freight of indian from florida remove to the western frontier under the surveillance of we soldiery and government agent the compulsory removal of indian from one remote state to another whenever new territory be need form a disgraceful feature in internal american policy transport to new hunting grounds the poor indian be bring into contact with other tribe when feud arise from feeling of jealousy and the new-comer be often annihilate in a few year many tribe have thus become totally extinct and the remainder be rapidly become so as the steamer pass we with she freight of red man they set up a loud yell which reverberate through the forest on the river-shore it sound to I very much like defiance and probably be for they execrate the white man as hereditary enemy and feel deeply the wrong inflict on they people all the steamer we meet be more or less crowd with passenger the visage of many of whom bear trace of fever and ague and who be doubtless remove to a healthier climate this insidious disease often terminate fatally in the city and district skirt the swamp of louisiana and to avoid its baneful effect the more affluent people migrate south-west or north when the sickly season set in the yellow fever be also very fatal in such situation and annually claim number of victim we have by this time reach that latitude where perpetual summer reign the bank of the mighty mississippus which have for age roll on in increase grandeur present to the eye a wilderness of sombre scenery indescribably wild and romantic the bay form by the current be choke with palmetto and other tree and teem with alligator water-snake and freshwater turtle the former basking in the sun in conscious security overhead pelican paroquet and numberless other strange bright bird on they starry wing bear the rich hue of all glorious thing while the gorgeous magnolia in luxuriant bloom and a thousand other evergreen on shore vie with voluptuous aquatic flower to bewilder and delight the astonished traveller accustomed hitherto only to the more unassuming production of the sober north everything here be new strange and solemn the gigantic tree encircle by enormous vine and heavily shroud in gray funereal moss mournfully wave in the breeze -- the doleful night-cry of the death-bird and the whip-poor-will -- the distant bugle of the advance boat -- the moan of the turbid current beneath -- the silent and queenly moon above appear nearer larger and brighter than in we cooler latitudes -- the sultry atmosphere -- and most of all perhaps the sense of the near vicinity of death in this infected region -- oppressed my spirit with a ominous feeling of solemnity and awe as we pass the plantation which here and there vary the scene gang of negro could be see at labor -- they sturdy overseer of ruffianly mien prowl sulkily about watch every motion of the bondsmen whip in hand which weapon they apply with the most wanton freedom as if the poor sufferer be as destitute of physical sensation as they themselves be of moral or humane feeling arm with a huge bowie-knife and pistol these embruted creature be very cut-throats in appearance and it be well know there that they conduct in general towards those they lord over justify the appellation i have give they the steamer halt at interval to take in wood which be invariably use instead of coal as in england this be pile in parrallelogram on the bank -- the log be split longitudinally this form a source of good profit and be in many instance the chief maintenance of the squalid settler of these plague-stricken and unwholesome place after the measurement of the pile by the mate or captain the deck-passenger and boat-hand stow it away in the vicinity of the furnace -- it be part of the term of passage that the lower order of passenger shall assist in the operation this be much dislike by the latter and many of the german of this class on board endeavor to escape the laborious duty by hide amongst the package on deck a general search be however institute by the officer of the vessel just before it stop at a wooding-station -- and the skulker be bring out amidst the clamorous jeer of they fellow the class of passenger i have just refer to consist chiefly of german and irish who although there be no profess distinction bargain for a deck-passage the charge be better suit to they means amongst the object that arrest my attention as we vessel float majestically down the turbid current be gibbet stand on the bank depend from several of which be short chain doubtless require occasionally in carry out this kind of discipline as the horrifying object occur at interval of a few mile i at first imagine they be crane use to lower bale of cotton into the hold of vessel and address a passenger whose physiognomy prepossess I in he favor and who have several time show a disposition to impart the knowledge he possess concern the object around he soon convince I of my mistake add that such engine be as necessary to the proper discipline of the negro in that latitude as the overseer himself he then proceed to detail several instance of fugitive negro be drag in capture to the foot of the gallows where with halter-encircled neck they be make not only to acknowledge the error commit and expose accessory but pump dry as he facetiously term it as to the intended flight of other negro on the estate sometimes he say it be necessary to suspend the culprit for a moment or so to intimidate but this be only in case where the victim -lrb- he use the word rascal -rrb- be incline to be sullen and refuse readily to give the require information i inquire whether it ever occur that actual execution take place to this my new acquaintance reply wall yes where the nigger have dar would to strike a white man but that it be usual to go to a magistrate first in such case the appearance of these gibbet after the information i have receive respect they from my slave-holding acquaintance make my flesh creep as we steam onward the more so as in many of the grounds skirt the river where these sombre murky-looking object present themselves to the gaze of the traveller gang of negro be at work look up complacently for a moment as the vessel glide by i be subsequently tell by a gentleman who have be long resident in the state of louisiana that no punishment so effectually strike with terror the negro mind as that of hang the very threat be sufficient to subdue -lrb- in general -rrb- the most hardened offender this i do not wonder at for perhaps there be few field-hand live in the south but have at some time or other witness the barbarity use at a negro execution sudden death by pistol or bowie knife be far preferable to the brutal sneer and indignity heap upon the victim by the cowardly assassin who superintend such operation the monotony of the scene which have for a thousand mile render the passage irksome begin to break as we approach natchez this place take its name from the natch-i-toch or red river which fall into the mississippus the abbreviation be a corruption of the original indian name which be as above state the town stand on a declivity or bluff and be of considerable extent i do not visit it although the boat halted for a considerable time to land letter-bag and passenger i be inform by a fellow-passenger of gentlemanly bearing who reside in the vicinity that it be a dissipate place and gamble the chief occupation of its inhabitant the locality have be remarkable for landslip owe to the siliceous nature of the soil i see trace of a fearful catastrophe of the kind which have some time before bury or destroy many of the house and they occupant the enormous mass have also sink several steam-boat and other vessel which be moor at the foot of the bluff under the town after leave natchez we steam away with renew vigor towards that center of slavery and dissipation new orlean and be in due course moor to the levee which extend the whole river-length of the city and be about a mile in extent the first news i hear and which alarm I not a little be that the yellow fever be at this time rage in the city new orlean be just fifty-four mile from the mouth of the mississippus and be build at the time of the orlean regency contain many ancient structure its inhabitant even to this day be to a great extent either french or of gaelic origin it lie exceedingly flat which cause the locality to be unhealthy and ill-suited to european constitution the soil be however fertile and rich this be perhaps to be account for by the constant irrigation it undergo from the overflow of the mississippus which like another nile periodically submerge the country around its bank the town be situate on the east side of the river the vast quantity of shipping of all class in the harbor be a very striking feature in this extensive and wealthy city the bad eminence to which new orlean have attain be painful to contemplate its wealth be purchase by the blood and tear of thousand of slave who be daily expose like cattle in its market and this fact operate on the mind of a englishman to the prejudice of its inhabitant i be myself fill with disgust towards the whites as well as pity towards the black on behold immediately on we arrival a gang of forty or fifty negro of both sex and nearly all age work in shackle on the wharf these i be inform be principally capture fugitive they look haggard and care-worn and as they toil with they barrow with uncovered head under a burning sun they be mercilessly lash with a heavy slave-whip by a tall athletic negro who act as overseer and who with refine cruelty dispense the punishment alike on stout man slender youth and thin attenuate female we arrival have attract the notice of the gang and induce a momentary halt in they work the unfeeling wretch commence a furious onslaught with the whip each crack of which follow as it be by the groan or cry of the sufferer rouse the indignant feeling of the passenger many of whom be from the free state and who simultaneously raise a yell of execration which make the welkin resound and cause the cruel driver to stand aghast this demonstration draw a remonstrance from the captain who represent to the passenger the danger of such conduct and conclude by observe that if it be repeat it would probably arouse the indignation of the citizen who be very bigoted he should be sorry he add to be oblige to put the vessel about again a proceeding that might be necessary for the safety of all on board unless they be more cautious some of the passenger seem disposed to dispute this argument but they be overrule by the majority who better acquaint with southern usage prejudice and barbarity think that discretion under the circumstance would be the better part of valor i afterwards find that the captain 's view be a strictly correct one for so jealous be the citizen of man entertaining hostility to the pro-slavery cause that spy be often send on board newly-arrived boat to ascertain if missionary be amongst the passenger these spy with jesuitical art introduce themselves by make apparently casual inquiry on lead topic of those they suspect and if they end be subserve basely betray they or what be more usual keep they under strict surveillance with a view to they be detect in disseminate abolition doctrine amongst the slave when they be immediately make amenable to the law and be fine or imprison on landing i hire a sorry conveyance drive by a creole and draw by a mule and have my luggage take to a house in the suburb where i have be recommend to take up my residence during my stay which owe to the presence of the yellow fever that daily carry off number of victim i have determine contrary to my original intention should be short the crowd of people on the levee attract by the constant arrival of steam-boat have a motley appearance many of these be rough-looking fellow fit for any occupation most of they be arm with bowie knive the silver hilt of which could often be see peer suspiciously from under the waistcoat in the inner lining of which a case or scabbard of leather be sew for the reception of the weapon the vast proportion of black in the street soon strike I i should think they be five to one of the white population these for the most part wear in wretched plight many of they beg of the passer-by which practice i find afterwards to be very general especially in the suburb of the city amongst the passenger on we boat be a person apparently of the better class who be meet at the levee by two black servant with a carriage i notice particularly that although the negro touch they hat and inquire how he be -lrb- by which i conclude he have be absent for some time -rrb- he do not deign to answer they inquiry from they timidity it be evident that he be a overbearing man and the imperial haughtiness manifest in give they he order confirm this impression this individual be one of those who condemn the demonstration i have notice when the boat first approach the levee after a day 's rest at my boarding-house i walk through the city and afterwards visit the calaboose which in new orlean be a mart for produce as well as a place of detention and punishment for slave here those owner who be averse to correct they slave in a rigorous manner at home send they to be flog the brutal way in which this be do at the calaboose strike terror into the negro mind and the threat be often sufficient to tame the most incorrigible instance i be tell have often occur of negro expire under the severity of the discipline here but it be remark that the pecuniary loss attendant on such casualty make the keeper careful not to exceed the physical endurance of the sufferer and that they be so well acquaint with negro constitution that it be a rare exception for death to ensue the punishment however almost always result in the victim be invalide and unfitted for exertion for a considerable time i believe new orlean to be as vile a place as any under the sun a perfect ghetto or curse place in fact it be the rendezvous of renegade of all nation and horde of negro trader and planter be to be see flock round the hotel these be extensive patron of the gambling-house and the faro _ rouge-et-noir _ roulette and other establishment fit up with gorgeous saloon be generally crowd with they as you pass you may observe the frequenter of such place in dozen deeply engage in play while the teller of the establishment sit at a table with a huge heap of spanish doubloon or mexican mill dollar before he which he add to or take from with the tact of a banker 's clerk as the chance of luck may arise violence and woodsh have be indigenous to this city from time immemorial and feud be instantly settle by a appeal to the bowie knife or ever-ready revolver highway robbery be very frequent and i be tell it be more than you life be worth to be out after dark in certain locality unless armed and on you guard the police authority be nevertheless vigilant and the magistrate severe so that many desperado be bring to justice the suburb of new orlean lie low and the swampy soil emit a poisonous miasma this be without doubt the cause of virulent epidemic that visit the city annually with direful effect thousand fly to the northern state to escape the contagion but there be many who for want of means be oblige to risk a continued residence at such period and it be amongst those that the yellow fever the ague or the flux play dreadful havoc it be the custom for the small store-keeper as well as the more affluent merchant to confide they affair at such season to other and i have frequently see advertisement in the _ new orlean picayune _ and other papers offer a gratuity to person to undertake the charge in they absence the heat although the summer be not far advance be excessive and the thousand of mosquito that fill the air especially after a fall of rain when they seem to burst into life in myriad spontaneously keep up a increase annoyance at night this be ten-fold for notwithstanding the gauze awning or bar as they be call which completely envelop the bedstead to the floor of the room they find admittance with pertinacious audacity and keep up a buzz and hum about my ear that almost entirely deprive I of rest this unceasing nuisance in the hot season make it difficult to keep one 's equanimity of temper and have probably much to do with that extreme irascibility show by the southern inhabitant of the american continent the appearance and situation of hundred of quadroon female in this city soon attract my attention and deserve notice i see number of they not only at the bazaar or shop make purchase but ride in splendid carriage through the street so prodigal be these poor deluded creature of they money that although slave and liable to immediate sale at the caprice of they keeper they have often be know to spend in one afternoon 200 dollar in a shopping excursion endowed with natural talent they be readily instruct in every accomplishment requisite to constitute they charming companion often as a carriage dash by the pedestrian be able to catch a glimpse of some jewelled and turbaned sultana of dazzling beauty attend by she maid who do not always possess a sinecure for the mistress be often haughty proud and petulant very hard to please and exact great deference from she inferior many of they live in regal splendor and everything that wealth and pampered luxury can bestow be theirs as long as they personal charm remain but when they beauty have cease to gratify the passion of they master they be in most instance cast off and frequently die in a condition which present the greatest possible contrast to they former gay but not happy life oh that they have earlier die sleep calmly side by side where the tyrant 's power be o'er and the fetter gall no more many of such poor outcast be to be find scatter all over the slave state some employ as field hand but in general they be select as domestic they former habit of luxury and ease render they constitution too delicate for the exposure of ordinary field labor it be not however as the reader will have observe commiseration that save they from that degradation as soon as beauty begin to fade which in southern clime it do prematurely the unfeeling owner of these unfortunate succeed in rid themselves of what be now consider a burden by dispose of the individual to some heartless trader this be do unknown to the victim and the news when it reach she drive she almost frantic she at once seek she perfidious paramour and find to she dismay that he have be go some day on a tour to the province and be perhaps a thousand mile off tear and protestation avail she nothing the trader be inexorable she belong to he by law and go she must at length have vainly expend she entreaty she become calm and submit in sullen apathy to she wretched fate this be the ordinary history of such case consider it unsafe to remain longer in this infected city from the report that the fever be gain ground i now make preparation for leave new orlean and as i have make a engagement to manage the affair of a gentleman in florida during he absence at washington i determine to proceed thither with the least possible delay in furtherance of this object i make inquiry for a conveyance by water to st mark give the preference to steam in this object i be however disappointed and be oblige to take a passage on board a brig about to sail for that obscure port the vessel be tow down to the balize or mouth of the mississippus in company with two other by a depart steamer which have on board the mail for bermuda and st george 's island arrive at the balize whose bank for several mile be overflow by the sea i see a small fleet of vessel some outward and some inward bind amongst these be a united state ship of war of great beauty carry heavy gun a boat from this vessel in charge of a officer board we and deliver to the captain a seal packet which i understand to be a dispatch address to general taylor the officer in command of the troops operate against the indian in florida the coast about the balize be low and swampy and everywhere abound in rush and cane brake which give its sea-beach a desolate appearance these morass harbor thousand of alligator whose roar have a singular effect as it rise above the breeze flock of aquatic bird be to be see on every side the most numerous be the pelican and a bird of the cotinga species about the size of a english throstle the plumage of which be jet black and flamingo red have a beautiful effect in the sunshine as they fly or settle in thousand on the cane we passage across the gulf of mexico be a favourable one but when within forty mile of we destination the vessel strike on a hidden sand-bank the fog be so dense that the captain have be mistake in he reckoning and have take a wrong course for a considerable time we be in great jeopardy and every attempt to get the ship again afloat be unavailing and have not the weather be moderate there be little doubt but that she would have be lose and we life place in great peril after some hour ' exertion during which a anchor be lose and a quantity of iron throw overboard we have the satisfaction to find that the vessel be adrift this be a great relief to we for have a gale spring up in the night which be close in we must have take to the boat and abandon the vessel a perilous undertaking from which we all feel too happy to have escape i be tell by the captain that the coast here abound with hidden sand-bank of the description we have encounter this perhaps together with the poor harbor accommodation in florida account for the small size of the vessel which generally trade there the desolate look of the coast from the deck of the vessel do not convey to my mind a very favourable impression of the country and the hostile disposition of the indian tend not a little to excite foreboding of evil that at one time almost induce I to abandon my intention and return to the north these apprehension be however allay by the representation of the captain of the vessel who state that the indian seldom attempt to molest armed party and that a understanding with the government be daily expect through the recent capture of some important sachem or chief under whose influence and leadership hostility have be carry on this information reassure I and i determine to proceed although i find afterwards that it be almost entirely a misrepresentation which however i can not believe be wilful as the captain would have have I for a passenger on the return voyage i soon after land in a boat from the shore the bay or harbor of st mark be not attractive neither be the town which present a desolate appearance the house or store be chiefly of wood paint white the venetian blind of the house be green as in most part of the united state the hotel-entrance be crowd with lounger in snow-white clothing large leghorn or palmetto hat and fancy-coloured shirt who smoke cigar incessantly and generally discuss with energy the inroad of the indian or other lead topic of the day the house be low and irregularly build and the appearance of the whole place and its inhabitant as far as i could see wear a forbid aspect and be indicative of anything but prosperity my next stage be to tallahassee by railroad through a desolate-looking country whose soil be sand and whose vegetation look stunt present little to cheer the sens or call forth remark in fact everything around tell of a country whose center be flourish but whose frontier be a wilderness just before we start a well-dressed negro apparently a footman or butler apply for a seat in the carriage he be tell by the station-keeper that there be no conveyance for nigger this train and he must wait for the follow one he at first dispute he right to refuse he a passage in the carriage which rouse the ire of the station-keeper who threaten to kick he if he be not soon off this seem to awe he for he quietly leave the station mutter however as he go he intention of report the circumstance to colonel gambole this cause I to make some inquiry about the colonel whose name he have mention and who i learn be he master i be also inform that no negro in that district be so insolent owe to the indulgence with which all he hand be treat i could see however that the negro have different man to deal with here and if he have not take he departure he would without a doubt have be kick or fell to the ground on the least further provocation -- a course pursue without hesitation in case where a negro assume anything like equality in the south chapter v the fragrant birch above he hang she tassel in the sky and many a vernal blossom spring and nod careless by but there be weep far away and gentle eye for he with watch many a anxious day be sorrowful and dim -- bryant florida in which state i now find myself be divide into east west and middle it be a wild extent of country about 300 mile from north to south the king of spain hold possession of the territory in 1810 but it be afterwards cede by treaty to the federal government it be discover in 1497 by sebastian cabot st augustine be the capital of east and pensacolum of west florida this country be for the most part a howling wilderness and be never likely to become thickly populate the dreary pine-barren and sand-hill be slightly undulating and be here and there thickly mat with palmetto in pursuance of my original design i have now to penetrate nearly a hundred mile into the interior and as the indian and fugitive negro be scour that part of the country in hostile band i contemplate this part of my route with no little anxiety i determine however to proceed the journey lay through a wild country intersect with stream and river every one of which swarm with alligator this although not a very pleasant reflection do not trouble I much as i have by this time become acquaint with the propensity of these creature and know that they be not give to attack white man unless provoke or wound although a negro or a dog be never safe within they reach they be however repulsive-looking creature and it be not easy to divest the mind of apprehension when in they vicinity my destination be a inlet of the sea call deadman 's bay from whence it be my intention after transact some business i have undertake to take passage by steamer to cuba intend to return to the continent after a limited stay there and on some of the adjacent island in this however i be disappoint as i shall by-and-by show my plan be to travel by easy stage under escort and encamp out at night so have secure the service of six man who be well arm and mount on horseback and have furnish ourselves with a tent and other necessaries which be carry by individual of the party we leave tallahassee on we way inland under a scorching sun we could proceed but slowly after reach the pine-barren the soil of which be loose sand and at every step the animal we ride sink to the fetlock which cause they to be greatly fatigue at the close of the day at night-fall after select we ground adjacent to a river we pitch we tent and supper be prepare this consist of jerk venison -lrb- dry by a slow fire -rrb- broil turkey two of which we have shoot upon we way bread and coffee one of we party walk round we position as a sentinel and be relieved every two hour it be necessary to keep a vigilant look out on account of the indian and runaway negro marauder who roam through these wild in band and subsist chiefly in plunder farm and small party a huge fire of resinous pine branch -lrb- which be plentiful in these solitude and strew the ground in all direction blacken with fire and age -rrb- be blaze to keep off the wolf and catamount whose terrific yell in conjunction with other beast prevent we sleep they do not however venture within rifle shoot the indian on attack small party have a practice of imitate the cry of the wolf and this circumstance be know to we tend not a little to raise we suspicion on hear the fearful howling that ring through the wilderness in the morning we proceed through barren sand-plain skirt with dense hammock -lrb- jungle -rrb- and forest we be much annoy by mosquito and sand-fly which keep the whole party in discomfort from they attack dusky-looking deer-fly constantly alight on we face and hand and make we jump with the severity of they bite as do also a large fly of brilliant mazarine blue color about the size of a humble bee the name of which i have forget in cross one of the numerous stream we have to wade or swim we horse over a incident occur which rather alarm I i be on a horse of that arabian blood build and spirit so common in saddle-horse in america and a little in advance of the party when i reach a river that intersect we track and which we have to cross after allow the animal to quench its thirst i apply spur and urge it into the stream it be averse from some cause to take the water the stream be however deeper than i anticipate and the horse immediately begin to stumble and flounder in a alarming manner show that the river bed be uneven and rocky about half-way across be a small island that divide the stream which after much difficulty he reach rest here about a minute i again urge he forward but the animal seem very reluctant to go he wheel short round snort loudly as if in fear and be evidently in unusual alarm after some coax he however plunge into the water and i expect to be able to gain the opposite shore in advance of my companion but just as we be half-way between the little island and the opposite bank which be very steep the horse again become restive rearing as if dreadfully frightened i have the greatest difficulty to keep the saddle which be a high mexican one cover with bear-skin and as easy to ride in as a chair i now begin to suspect the cause of he alarm the stream be one of those black-looking current that flow noiselessly along and which in florida always harbor the largest-sized alligator when i first come to it i remember this and think to frighten off any of these lurker that might be in the vicinity i have dash precipitately into the stream this practice or shout loudly and firing a pistol into the water usually succeed i soon find out however that the presence of one of the ugly creature be the cause of the horse 's trepidation for within six foot of we i discern a pair of eye set in huge brown excrescence fix intently on I and my horse with malicious gaze i know they belong to a veteran and dread lest its snout might be within two foot of my leg for the old alligator boast enormous length of jaw i sit tailor-wise in my saddle and level my rifle at the horrid object the reptile have however observe my movement and disappear beneath the surface i instantly discharge my piece in the direction he have take and certainly give he a lesson for the water around I be directly after tinge with blood he be probably hurt severely or he might have resent my temerity i soon after reach the shore in safety where i be speedily join by the escort who see nothing of the reptile in they way across and who be man breed amongst such scene and totally divest of fear at once take the water although they have witness the encounter the cayman of south america be very ferocious and be popularly style the hyena of the alligator tribe this savage creature will instantly attack a man or a horse and on this account the indian of chili before wade a stream take the precaution of use long pole to ascertain its presence or to drive it away naturalist assert that the cayman be not find in the north american river and i should imagine this to be correct for although engage in many alligator hunt i find from personal experience and minute inquiry that the species find in north america be harmless if unmolested after a laborious ride we arrive at fort andrew where we find a military station of we infantry we halt here for several day i have business require my attention and ourselves and we beast need to recruit we strength before continue we route to the bay the forest scenery here almost defy description immense cedar and other lordly tree rear they gigantic and lightning-scathed head over they smaller and less hardy but graceful neighbor cactus mimonia and tropical shrub and flower which at home be to be see only in conservatory or green-house be here in profusion and plant at whose name the verse feel loath fill the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue livid and star with a lurid hue while innumerable form of insect and reptile life from the tiny yellow scorpion to the murky alligator of eighteen foot in length give a forbid aspect to the scene racoon squirrel wild turkey pelican vulture quail dove wild deer opossum chickmunck white fox wild cat wolf -- be ever and anon to be see among the high palmetto brake and the alligator in the bayous arid swamp make night hideous with they discordant bellowing and the vile odour which they emit the _ tout ensemble _ of the place bring to recollection those striking line of hood o'er all there hang the shadow of a fear a sense of mystery the spirit daunt and say as plain as whisper in the ear the place be haunt during my stay at fort andrew a large detachment of we troops arrive continue a campaign against the recreant indian and negro the appearance of the man and officer be wretched in the extreme they have for week be beat through swamp and hammock thickly mat with palmetto bush which have tear they undress uniform in tatters search for a invisible enemy who thoroughly acquaint with the everglade defy every attempt at capture the whole party look harass disappointed and forlorn general taylor be with and have command of this detachment which be about 400 strong as i have hear this man vauntingly speak of in the north as the brave cotemporary of scott i feel no little curiosity to see he he appearance surprise I he be a burly unmilitary-looking man of most forbid aspect and much more like a yeoman than a soldier a sword much out of place dangle awkwardly by he side and be the only badge of he profession about he except a black leathern cap otherwise he be habit as a private citizen he small army encamp below the fort and as i think in most un-general style he superintend the erection of he own marquee he have with he several negro who be he body servant and the coarse epithet he apply to they during the operation do not prepossess I in he favor or i think reflect much credit on he refinement at nightfall cry of distress arise from the marquee and as i approach it i could distinctly hear one of the bondsman earnestly plead for mercy listen for a moment i hear this distinguished general exclaim vociferously and belabour the poor negro heavily with a raw-hide whip most likely vent the spleen he feel at he non-success against the indian the expedition have hitherto be unsuccessful the poor negro have offend he master by some trivial act no doubt and in southern style he be correct he without much regard it be true to publicity this in southern latitudes be so common that it be think little of and the occurrence cause on this occasion only a pass remark from those present the negro be he own and he have a right it be state to correct he as and when he please who could dispute it for my own part i entertain the most abhorrent feeling towards a man who without sense of shame or decent regard for he station thus unblushingly publish he infamy amongst stranger and this man a would-be patriot too and candidate for the presidential chair which it will be remember he afterwards obtain i be tell that flog he negro be a favorite pastime with this eminently-distinguished general and that he be by no means like by he officer or man he appearance bespeak he tyrannical disposition and this couple with incapacity there be little doubt conduce to make it necessary for he to relinquish he command of the army of the south which he do not long after be succeed i believe by general armstead as i mention before the force that accompany he be in forlorn case remind I strongly of shakspere 's description of falstaff 's ragged regiment it consist chiefly of raw undrilled troops quite unused to discipline but perhaps as effective as veteran in the service in which they be employ the adroitness of the enemy accustom to the interminable swamp hammock and cane-brake which abound in this country quite paralyze the energy of the man and destroy that _ esprit du corps _ without which no success can be expect in a army several indian sachem or chief accompany the command these be fine-looking fellow but appear exhaust from long march through the wilderness one of these name powell particularly attract my notice he be a very interesting young man of feminine aspect and little resemble he stalwart companion he have originally be capture but by kind treatment have be bring over to friendly view and be now act as a guide it be state that he father be much incense against he and have employ emissary to despatch he secretly a few month after this campaign i hear that he be shoot while out hunting no doubt at the instigation of he unnatural parent who prefer he death to he continue in league with white man leave fort andrew i now push onward to deadman 's bay the country we pass through be much the same as i have before describe the journey take we the better part of two day on the way we see a herd of wild cattle which scour the plain in consternation on espy we party urge on we horse we try to bring one down but they outstrip we some mile farther on and near a thick hammock about a quarter of a mile a-head a huge black bear stand snuff the air we again put spur to we horse to try to intercept he retreat but he be too quick for we and make at he utmost speed -lrb- a sort of shambling trot -rrb- for the coppice or jungle which he soon enter and disappear from we sight at nightfall a pack of ravenous wolf head by a large white one serenade we and come near enough to we camp-fire to seize a small terrier belong to one of the party the poor animal unused to the danger around have the temerity to run out and bark at the pack -- he soon after give one agonizing yelp and we never see he again as a reprisal three of the party fire and bring one of the wolf to the ground he be of great size and i should say could have carry away a sheep or a good size hog -lrb- of which they be very fond -rrb- with ease we could not however skin he -- he be so infested with flea in the settlement they often seize and carry off child but they do not molest adult as we proceed we keep a vigilant look-out for indian a number of whom we have hear at fort andrew have be drive in the direction we be travel we fortunately escape molestation but see in several place human bone probably the relic of a former combat between the united state troops or traveller like ourselves and indian or negro one skull i pick up have be split with a tomahawk besides have a bullet-hole in it about the region of the left ear we situation be one of great peril but i have make up my mind to proceed at all hazard despite the opposition show by two or three of the settler compose my escort who on more than one occasion point out indian camp-grounds of only a few day ' age at one of these we find a quantity of indian flour or arrowroot part of a bridle and the offal of a calf but we leave the former imagine it might be poison the latter be of no use we only dog have be devour by the wolf pass through a dense hammock of a quarter of a mile in width through which the pioneer of the american army have recently cut a rough road i dismount to take a view of these sombre shades on either hand the solemn stillness around seem to I like the shadow of death -- especially so from the peril we be in through the deadly feud exist at the time between the indian and white man i penetrate for full a quarter of a mile into this fastness in a lateral direction and in do so suddenly startle two immense white bird of the adjutant species which be stand in a swamp surround by majestic cedar tree i could easily have bring one down with my rifle but i think it wanton cruelty to do so they be i should think quite six foot high and beautifully white with a yellow tinge the head of one which i suppose be the male bird be surmount by a golden crest they sail quietly away over my head not appear much alarm by the intrusion in these primeval shades where perhaps the foot of man never before trod -lrb- for i look in vain for such trace -rrb- be many beast bird and reptile which live in perfect security for although the indian dwell here and subsist by hunting yet the territory be so vast and the red man be so few in proportion that there can be little doubt that many place be untraversed emerge on the open sand-plain somewhat unexpectedly i cause my party no little alarm they instinctively grasp they rifle imagine the approach of a party of hostile indian the constant dread of molestation cause the traveller here to be ever on the _ qui-vive _ the precaution be highly necessary to prevent surprise the least movement in a coppice excite apprehension and fill the soul of both the resolute and the timorous with anticipation of danger nor be these fear groundless for the treacherous indian crawl stealthily to the attack and without a moment 's warn two or three of a party may fall to the earth pierce by rifle-ball or rear horse may throw the rider and leave they at the mercy of these ruthless assassin arrive at length at the bay in safety i be accommodate in the officer ' quarter of a temporary fort or stockade erect there the steamer have leave so that i be compel to remain here longer than i have intend await the arrival of the next boat to beguile the time i go for mile into the forest look for game often come back disappointed and weary at other reward by perhaps a racoon or what i value more a fawn or wild turkey there be however plenty of sport on the river and thousand of wild duck gannet and pelican inhabit the little island in the vicinity and rear they young there some of these island be cover with they egg large number of alligator infested the stream adjacent and they bellowing in concert with bull-frog and other reptile often banish sleep for night together although i be pretty well accustomed to such annoyance snake be often to be meet with although harmless if unmolested amongst these the moccason hoop and garter snake of which i procure several specimen be the most common to be meet with rattle-snakes exist in rocky district but i see none of they here the steamer not arrive as i anticipate after remain for a considerable time and get tired of so solitary a life i determine to retrace my step to tallahassee while remain at this post a party of mount volunteer arrive from georgium these man be mostly son of farmer who have suffer from the unceasing attack of the indian on they farm in many instance accompany by the butchery of some member of they family it be arrange that a company of we infantry station at the fort should act in concert with these man and scour the country for twenty mile round to search for indian trace of whom have be see and who it be very certain be encamp not many mile off as i feel desirous of observe the operation of these little campaign against so wily a foe i intimate to a major my intention of accompany the expedition he be please with the proposal and furnish I with a splendid rifle and other equipment from the store of the depôt after a short delay owe to the non-arrival of some waggon that be intend to accompany the expedition the whole force muster in front of the stockade enclosure and be furnish with ten day ' provision for man and horse start under command of the major aforesaid across the sand-plain in order to reach a dense cedar and cypress swamp ten mile distant where it be suspect the enemy be conceal after a tedious march through a wild country so overgrown with saw palmetto and underbrush that we horse have great difficulty to get through it we arrive at the skirt of the swamp here a consultation take place between the officer present and it be arrange that a indian guide whom we have with we should go in and hold a parley with the indian to induce they if possible to surrender the guide go into the hammock which extend along the edge of the swamp as far as the eye could reach right and leave i should have mention that this man with the usual indian acuteness have discover indubitable sign that the enemy be in the vicinity long before we reach the spot after a absence of about a hour during which time we refresh ourselves and make preparation for a expect struggle we guide return bring with he a bow and quiver of arrow as proof of he interview with the secrete indian the account he give which be interpret by a half-bred indian who accompany the expedition for the purpose be that after penetrate some distance into the fastness he come to the encampment of the enemy and be instantly surround by warrior who seize he but after parley for a considerable time let he go present he with a bow and arrow as a symbol of they unflinching resolve to continue the war on hearing this it be at once determine by the officer in command that the whole force -lrb- except a guard for the horse and waggon -rrb- should go in and surprise they the guide shake he head at this and point towards the swamp say that be the way i have show it to you follow it if you will i do not go it be however of no use to dally and order be give for all hand to follow into the swamp for my own part i wish to stay behind but be tell that such a course be attend with danger as the indian would most likely emerge from another part of the hammock and endeavor to seize the horse and ransack the waggon this decide my adopt the least of the two evil although i fully expect we should have a battle after penetrate for i should think upward of two mile sometimes up to we knee in miry clay and often stop by impassable barrier of wild vine and other prehensile plant which annoy we greatly and make I regret a thousand time that i have court such danger and inconvenience the sound of two rifle-shot throw the whole party into indescribable commotion suppose we be attack all hand fly as quick as think to the tree around where each one peeping from behind the trunk which be seek as a shelter against the rifle-ball of the expect foe wait for a few moment in great suspense when suddenly a loud cheer from the party in advance follow by several rifle-shot tell we they have come upon the encampment as the firing cease i know the indian have flee this seem also the opinion of the volunteer near I who simultaneously leave they hiding-place and push forward to the scene on arrive at the spot i find the soldier around a large indian fire over which be suspend a boiling cauldron fill with venison the indian have be no doubt prepare a meal when disturb by we by the side and not far from the fire be a large trough make out of a fall tree in which be a quantity of arrowroot in course of preparation this plant grow plentifully in this latitude and be the principal fare of the indian they squaw superintend the management of it the remains of a fine buck lay near and also some moccason leggings and other indian gear the enemy we have so unceremoniously disturb have as usual take flight but we find trace of blood and the advanced party state that they have fire on two warrior who with a woman and two child be on the spot when they come up as it be deem quite useless to pursue they from they be no doubt well acquaint with the intricacy of the fastness and therefore sure to evade we we regale ourselves on the venison of which some refuse to partake lest it should be poison it be decide that the force should emerge from the swamp to the open plain about a mile above the spot where we have leave the waggon by a circuitous route this be accordingly do but we progress be so difficult that the indian have ample opportunity to fly before we and we see no further trace of they on reach the waggon we find to we great satisfaction that all be safe and as night be approach it be decide to encamp there a spring of turbid water be in the vicinity a cordon of sentinel be accordingly place around we resting-place and some tent be pitch for a portion of the party the remainder wrap in blanket sleep on the sand after the whiskey have pass round the jocular little major in command propose a song and as one of the infantry soldier be a adept at the art he be invite to we marquee although in the very midst of danger for we know not how formidable in number the indian be we pass a merry evening soon after this affair the party return to the bay and in a day or two i start on my return to tallahassee about twenty mile from deadman 's bay we overtake a fugitive negro and as we come upon he unexpectedly when turn the edge of a hammock he have not time to retreat be within rifle-range or he would doubtless have do so he throw up he arm and give a pierce shriek -lrb- a unvariable custom of indian when in danger -rrb- expect to be instantly shoot he have however nothing to fear have fall in with friend and not foe as i see he be without a rifle i dash forward and accost he first he be soon assure by my manner of address he and beg earnestly that we would not detain or hurt he this i at once promise if he would inform we whether indian be near he say no they have leave that country two sun -lrb- day -rrb- ago take a easterly direction and we might proceed to fort andrew in safety after put several other question to he i inquire if the indian would cross we path to tallahassee from that post he say no they be far off in another direction have go to east florida eighty mile distant the fellow be in poor case and beg for food say he be starve i therefore desire the man to supply he with some dry venison and bread which he eat with avidity he refuse to tell I he master 's name but say there be hundred of negro fight with the indian six from the same plantation as himself my companion be at first intent upon secure he but be averse to that course i dare they to do it when see i be fully determine on this point they do not insist point to the hammock after give he a dram of brandy i bid he be off when he dart like a deer into the thicket and disappear from we view with a loud shout of exultation about ten mile further on as we pass the edge of a dense hammock we hear the bay of a indian dog and fear the proximity of a party of marauder we be instantly on the alert the dog do not however come out of the wood and we ride from the dangerous vicinity with all dispatch arrive again at fort andrew without any further adventure worth record we find a party of volunteer about to proceed to fort pleasant in the direction we be go after recruit my now almost exhaust strength by a refreshing sleep i go down to they encampment by the river 's edge they have the day before encounter a strong party of indian whom they repulse with loss some of the party show I several bloody scalp of warrior they have kill i could not help remark the beauty of the hair which be raven-black and shone with a beautiful gloss they have several capture indian woman with they and half-a-dozen child the former be absorb in grief and one in particular whose young husband have be shoot in the fray and whose scalp be one of those i have just mention be quite overwhelm the child little conscious of the misery of they parent swim about and dive in the river like amphitrite they each carry a small bow and quiver of arrow there be no doubt the indian these volunteer have fall in with and route be the identical party refer to by the negro we have meet some forty-eight hour before i have make up my mind to stay at fort andrew for a time partly to fulfil a engagement with a friend whom i have arrange to meet here and to whom i shall shortly have to refer more at length and partly to recruit my strength a tertian ague have seize I which much debilitate my frame and make travel very irksome my accommodation be indifferent but medical assistance which i need most be not want and i shall never forget the courtesy of the officer i employ my time chiefly in ramble the wood when health would permit and have a boat lend to I with which in company i several time penetrate the tortuous river esteenahatchie to the bay some mile distant at night the boat be all sink or they would have be steal or destroy by the indian who hover round and committed petty depredation at every opportunity below the fort be a ruinous mill in a gloomy dell through which the river wend its silent course this have once be tenant but the inhabitant be murder some year before by the indian who afterwards -lrb- as be they almost unvarying custom -rrb- add to the atrocity by set fire to the building sit one day after a lengthen ramble in solitary meditation on my position and the surround scenery i see a fine indian who appear greatly fatigue emerge from the adjoining hammock and walk to the edge of the stream and there after glance round he with eager eye and air he lay down he rifle and step on to a tree which debouch into the stream -lrb- lie as it have be strike down by a tornado -rrb- he crouch down at the end of it and commence laving himself with the water he appearance be romantic and there be no doubt from he dress he be a warrior of some note probably follow he wife one of the squaw capture by the volunteer i have before mention and who be still at fort andrew await order from general taylor i could have shoot he to a certainty have i be arm which be not the case have it be so however i be predetermine never unless in self-defence to imbrue my hand in indian or negro blood while in the territory neither be i dispose to betray he for i deeply sympathize with the misfortune of he race and well know that a inexcusable spirit of aggrandizement on the part of the federal government have in the first place rouse the indignation of both negro and red man and provoke hostility after perform he ablution the indian stalk like a deer into the recess of the forest i have in the mean time as a matter of policy move out of danger for he be no doubt animated with feeling of dire revenge and in a very different mood from that in which i have describe myself to have be at the time during my visit to deadman 's bay i have become acquaint with a scotch gentleman who be employ on the medical staff of the we army i believe as a supernumerary or candidate for a commission as a surgeon he be a most agreeable companion of good natural part fluent in conversation intelligent in remark free from egotism and well educate i believe at cambridge in england we soon become attach to each other he accompany I in my ramble and we be almost inseparable companion during my stay he be one of those being in fine who seem to be send at time to cheer the darkened highway of existence under gloomy circumstance and i fondly hope to enjoy with he a lengthen period of virtuous intimacy and close unalloyed friendship on more propitious soil but the decree of providence be inscrutable and he way indeed past find out this be certainly strikingly exemplify by the catastrophe i be about to relate which deprive I for ever of my friend when at the bay he express a wish to visit st mark tallahassee and apalachicolum and state he intention as soon as he engagement permit to proceed thither by steamer if opportunity offer -- or fail this to go overland avail himself of some escort which might be proceed in that direction as i feel desirous to have he company on my route to south carolina i arrange to halt at fort andrew as before state that he should join I there in a week and then proceed in company with I to fort pleasant forty mile distant and thence to tallahassee the time have now come at which i be expect he arrival i be one morning anxiously look out through the long vista of pine tree and barren when i descried in the distance two horseman approach at they greatest speed i at first imagine they to be as they indeed prove a advanced party of my friend 's escort -- but on they come up i could see from the agitation they be in and the foam state of they horse which be quite white and in a dreadfully exhaust state that something alarming have happen the tale be soon tell : -- it appear that about midway between the two settlement or station a party of indian in ambush have fire upon the party and my friend have be treacherously murder i be much affect by this intelligence and after some consultation with a gentleman there determine to get up a pretty strong party and proceed to the scene of the murder to collect the remains of my poor friend whose bone would otherwise be leave as i have see other in those region to bleach on the sand hill we soon start the party consist of fourteen man well arm with rifle bowie knife and pistol accompany by a waggon draw by four stout mule and drive by a negro to convey back the remain the expedition be attend with no little danger from the proximity of a newly-discovered party of indian who be commit dreadful ravages in the district -- but whether in large or small force be uncertain they be probably the party i have before advert to linger about the vicinity after a melancholy journey during which we be so absorb by we feeling that little be say we reach the fatal spot it be point but by one of the party who form my friend 's escort ' it be on the edge of a dense hammock by the skirt of which lay some enormous tree which have be level by a recent tornado from behind this barricade the indian have unexpectedly fire on the party -- the attack be so sudden that they appear to have be quite take by surprise this be the more extraordinary as the whole neighborhood be of a description likely to be choose by the red man for a ambuscade the party attack must have be in great trepidation for from what i could glean the survivor put spur to they horse ' flank and gallop off to fort andrew leave my poor friend entirely at the mercy of the enemy the survivor who accompany we state that they be ride in indian file as be customary there that poor h -- be in front of he and that directly the indian give they fire he see he fall backwards from he horse at the same time raise he left hand to he head he could tell no more the horse he be on have wheel round suddenly and be urge on in retreat by its rider who be in the greatest imaginable terror have the party halted and return the fire for they be well arm in all probability some of the marauder would have be lay low or if the indian be but few they might at least have rescue my poor friend we find footmark of indian which we trace by these it appear that they be in small force and that when h -- fall from he horse he recover he foot and run from the enemy in the direction of the plain for about two hundred yard -- here it be evident he have be overtake and he skull cloven with a tomahawk from behind we soon discover he remains in the sand denude of every particle of flesh and muscle by the vulture and the ravenous wolf we collect the bone with reverential care and place they in the waggon for transit to fort andrew on the bone of the little finger of the left hand be a emerald ring which i have often see the murder man wear and which be cover with blood and sand at the time of the catastrophe no doubt escape the attention of the villian who perpetrate the atrocious act the left jaw be fracture by a rifle-bullet which knock he off he horse backwards as describe by one of the survivor in the pine opposite the place of ambush we find several ball imbed and one have lodge in the pummel of the saddle of the man who be present and who form one of we party it appear probable that there be not more than four or five indian engage in the attack a force which might easily have be repel and annihilate with ordinary courage but formidable enough to man want the presence of mind which be necessary under such circumstance after a fatiguing journey for which i be at the time almost totally unfitted by ill-health we party reach fort andrew with the mangled remains of the victim a short time afterwards these be commit to the sand a military salute be fire over the grave by some soldier at the garrison on a elevated slab of wood to the north of fort andrew may be see a zinc plate erect by I to the memory of my friend with he name the date of he death and a epitome of the circumstance attend it this memento of regard have in all probability escape the cupidity of the indian for i take the precaution to have it place as much out of sight as possible and the place of burial be off the beaten track thus perish miserably one whose generous openness and manly virtue render he dear to all who have the privilege of he acquaintance he be a native of somewhere near arbroath in scotland but he accent do not betray he nativity in traverse the sandy desert of west florida i have frequent opportunity of trace the devastating effect of those awful visitation in tropical climate -- hurricane or tornado and notwithstanding i have the good fortune to escape the danger of be expose to one i more than once prepare for the worst one of these be accompany with phenomenon so unusual and striking to a native of europe that i must not omit some notice of it if for no other purpose than to convey to the mind of the reader one of the many unpleasant but wonderful accompaniment of a residence in these latitudes so poetically and indeed so truthfully apostrophize as the sunny south it be while on a journey -lrb- accompany by two yeoman from east florida who be proceed to join a expedition against the indian to defend they hearth and by the friend whose melancholy loss i have advert to -rrb- from deadman 's bay towards tallahassee that the occurrence i be about to mention take place it be in the height of summer and for several day fahrenheit 's barometer have range from 84 to 90 degree the temperature be occasionally even higher by some degree than this we start soon after eight in the morning and have ride all day under a scorching sun from the effect of which we be but ill-defended by we palm-leaf hat for we head be ache intensely -- my own be in common parlance ready to split not a inapt simile by the way as i often experience in the south towards evening the sultriness increase to a great degree and respiration become painful from the closeness of the atmosphere a suspicious lull soon after succeed and we momentarily expect the storm to overtake we it be not however one that be to be relieve by a ordinary discharge of thunder lightning and rain -- deeper cause be evidently at work the denseness of the air be accompany by a semi-darkness similar to that which prevail during a eclipse of the sun which luminary on the occasion i refer to after all day emit a lurid glare be so shroud in vapor as to be scarcely discernible even in outline -- while a subterranean noise add to the terror of we situation which strongly call to mind the account we read of earthquake and similar phenomenon we move slowly on as people naturally would who be about to be overwhelm in a calamity that threaten they annihilation while a indefinable sensation of sleepiness and inertia seize the whole of the party vulture and other bird of prey scream dismally as they hover round we head in the greatest excitement arise either from terror or the anticipation of a rich repast we could not tell which these voracious creature with great audacity often descend to within a few foot of the head of we horse which seem terror-stricken at they near approach i take aim at one of the largest of they with my rifle and it fall a little to my leave with a impetus i can only compare to the fall of a human be directly it touch the ground it vomit carrion and die it be many foot in breadth from tip to tip of wing but we be too perturb to stop and measure it when i discharge the rifle the report be unusually faint owe to the state of the air so much so that my companion who be not fifty yard behind scarcely hear it the wild animal in the jungle which skirt the road and which in general skulk in silence and secresy in they haunt rent the air with they howling the very order of nature seem about to be reverse while the long streamer of gray moss sway backwards and forwards mournfully from the tree add to the solemnity of the scene as the party slowly wend its way through the wilderness each individual look round with suspicion exchange furtive glance or now and then utter some exclamation of alarm -- they manner and bearing indicate mind ill at ease this dismal state of thing last nearly a hour after which time nature seem to recover herself by a sudden throe for a brisk breeze which be highly refreshing to we sens and which be attend by the loud hollow subterranean sound i have before refer to unexpectedly spring up and sweep off as if by magic the inertia of nature what make the phenomenon more extraordinary be the total absence of thunder or lightning my companion shout for joy when the hollow moan of the embryo tempest be hear to move off to the eastward -lrb- for as they inform I it tell of deliverance from peril -rrb- i feel a sensation of delight i can not describe and heartily respond to the noisy demonstration of satisfaction raise by my companion we horse apparently participate in we delight prick up they ear and snort fairly prance with pleasure tired and jade as they be after thirty mile ' travel through sand into which they sink at every step fetlock deep often groan pitifully i notice that during the impending storm they hang down they head in a listless manner and sigh heavily a circumstance that to we mind presage calamity and which i may add be altogether unlike the usual indication of fatigue in animal which have travel a great distance have the tornado burst upon we instead of pass off as it do it be very doubtful whether the hand that write this would not have be mingle with its native dust in the arid sand of florida for as we ride on we see gigantic pine cedar and hiccory tree tear up by the root and scatter over the surrounding country by by-gone hurricane many of they hundred of yard from the spot that nurture they root -- while the gnarled branch lie across we track scorch black-with the lightning or from long exposure to a burning sun impede we advance and make the journey anything but pleasant the occurrence i have mention form a topic of conversation for some mile as we journey to we destination and one of my companion state that a few month before when in the neighborhood of pensacolum a hurricane come on unexpectedly and cause great devastation unroof the house tear up tree and fill the air with branch and fragment of property he happily escape although he little estate situate at mardyke enclosure some short distance from the town be greatly injure and some six or eight people be crush to death by the fall tree and ruin of house chapter vi before we vision come of slave-ship on virginium 's coast of mother in they childless home like rachel sorrowing o'er the lose the slave-gang scourge upon its way the bloodhound and he human prey -- whittier florida produce orange peach plum a species of cocoa-nut and musk and water-melon in abundance the more open portion of the country be dot over with clump of gnarled pine of a very resinous nature white and red oak hiccory cedar and cypress and be in general scantily clothe with thin grass fit only for deer to browse upon the dreary sameness of the interior of this desolate country be distressing to the traveller and the journey from one settlement to another through pine-forest seem almost interminable one morning a short time prior to my intended departure for tallahassee i be rouse before daybreak by a rifle-shot which be instantly follow by the cry of guard turn out and much hubbub as this be no unusual occurrence from the constant apprehension we be in of a attack by the indian on the stockade and as it have several time occur before during my stay i resolve to lie and listen awhile before i rise the earnest conversation and the noise of horse soon after satisfied I it be only a friendly arrival i however feel anxious to obtain intelligence as to the success of a treaty then pend between the united state government and the indian the favourable termination of which would not only render my return to tallahassee more safe but put a stop perhaps for ever to those constant scene of blood and depredation that be by this time become quite sickening to I this feeling be much enhance at the time by the express between fort andrew and deadman 's bay be shoot by a party of the common enemy the body of this poor fellow be never find but trace of blood be to be see near the spot where he have be attack and the saddle and bridle of he horse be find cut into a thousand piece the probability be that he be wound and take prisoner doubtless to be tortured to death a practice common with all indian tribe in time of war on my proceed to a house use as officer ' quarter outside the stockade i find the stir have be cause by the arrival of two company of light-horse soldier from st mark escort several couple of bloodhound to aid the army operating in that part of florida to exterminate the indian these dog be very ferocious and on approach the leashman who have they in charge they open in full yell and attempt to break loose the dog have just arrive from cuba with they keeper they importation have be cause by the supposition that like the maroon in jamaica who for nearly thirty year defy the colonist there the indian would be terrify into submission this however turn out to be erroneous for on they first trial the indian kill several and the scheme be very properly abandon a short time after such barbarous means be very unjustifiable although many -lrb- to use the language of the earl of chatham when deprecate a similar course in the english house of lord -rrb- consider that every means that god and nature have place in they hand be allowable in the endeavor to bring to a close a war that have cost the federal government a immense amount of blood and treasure i be of opinion however from what i afterwards hear that the step be not a altogether popular one in the eastern and northern state although it certainly be so in the southern it be argue in the public print there that as dog have be use in hunting down fugitive negro from time immemorial the mere fact of bloodhound be use instead of mastiff be a peccadillo unworthy of name the tobacco plant though grow in many part of florida spontaneously like the broad-leafed dock in england be often cultivate in garden-ground for domestic use some of the finer kind be as aromatic as those of cuba the soil in such place be rich indeed the plant will not thrive in many part where this be not the case the method of propagation generally follow by the large grower be that recommend by loudon in he incomparable _ encyclopedia of agriculture _ and be as follow : -- the soil select be in general loamy and deep this be well break up before plant and frequently stir to free it from the rich growth of weed that in florida in particular choke the growth of all plant if neglect the seed be small they be lightly cover with earth and then the surface be press down with a flat instrument use for the purpose in two month after the seedling be ready to transplant and be place in drill three foot apart every way these be frequently water if there happen to be but little rain which in that arid climate be often the case for week together and the plant regularly look over to destroy a species of worm winch if not remove play great havoc with the young bud when four inch high the plant be mould up like potato in england when they have six or seven leaf and be just put out a stalk the top be nip off to make the leaf stronger and more robust after this the bud which show themselves at the joint of the leaf be pluck and then the plant be daily examine to destroy a caterpillar of a singular form and gray in color which make its appearance at this stage and be very destructive to narcotic plant when fit for cut which be know by the brittleness of the leave the plant be cut close to the ground and allow to lie some time they be then put in farm-house in the chimney-corner to dry or if the crop be extensive the plant be hang upon line in a drying-house so manage that they will not touch each other in this state they be leave to sweat and dry when this take place the leaf be strip off and tie in bundle these be put in heap and cover with a sort of mat make from the cotton-fibre or seaweed to engender a certain heat to ripen the aroma care be take lest a fermentation should occur which injure the value of the article to avoid which the bundle be expose and spread about now and then in the open air this operation be call ventilate by the planter and be continue until there be no apparent heat in the heap the plant be quite ornamental and its blossom form a please feature in a garden of exotic production after a brief stay at fort andrew subsequent to the last sad office for my deceased friend i leave that spot on horseback for tallahassee in company with four settler we soon reach the more populated district without be molest by the indian here they have commit sad devastation we see many farm without occupant the holder have be either murder by midnight assassin or have flee in alarm adjoining these habitation we find line peach orchard teem with fruit of the richest description which lay in bushel on the ground and with which we regale ourselves enclose maize field overgrow with bramble and cotton field with the gin and apparatus for pack the produce in bale for the market present to the eye the very picture of desolation owe to cross road we be at one time completely at fault and there be no house in sight i volunteer to ride off to the right and endeavor to obtain the information we be in need of after ride about half-a-mile i hear voice through a road-side coppice which i take to be those of field-hand at work go farther on i dismounted and climb the zigzag rail fence approach a negro at work in the field i inquire if he could put I on the road to tallahassee he appear much frightened at the intrusion but state he do not know but he ma ' r do at the same time point to the plantation-house situate the greater part of a mile distant be averse to go there for fear of impudent interrogation i offer he money to go with I to the point where i have leave my companion and show we the way to the next house he do not even know what it be i offer he and in apparent amazement inquire what that be for i explain buy tobacco buy whiskey he appear totally ignorant of its use and i have no doubt he have never have money in he possession or learn its use still he refuse to leave the field a wise precaution as i afterwards find both for himself and I the negro be resolute there be now no alternative but to go to the house on arrive at which i meet with such a reception as i have fear and anticipate three fierce dog of the mastiff breed regularly train to hunting fugitive negro rush out upon I i have only a small ride whip with I have leave my fire-arm with a friend at fort andrew and much dreaded laceration they noise soon bring out a ferocious lank-visaged-looking man about forty year of age who immediately call off the dog but before i have time to make the inquiry that bring I there he begin in about the follow strain what dye yer waunt up yar stranger arter no good i guess you would better put it ` bout straight i see would yer tork to the hand yonder -- none o ' yer ` mancipator doctrine yar the fellow 's address strike I all of a heap as he would himself have say have he be in my situation he speak so fast that i could not edge in a word at last i state the cause of my intrusion but he would not believe a word order I to quit the plantation or he would set the dog on I and be get into such a ungovernable rage that i think it would be wise to follow he advice so i slowly retreat to the yard entrance by which i have come in return to my companion at the cross-road i find that in my absence a passer-by have give they the wished-for information and we push on to a house of call a few mile distant as the ride be a long one we halt at this house for refreshment and after bait we horse regale ourselves upon some choice ham and egg at the table three little negro one girl and two boy under fourteen year of age serve as waiter they clothing be supply by nature be solely the primitive habiliment wear in eden before the fall this be quite customary in the south where the rule of decency be commonly set at defiance as if the curse of adam 's transgression apply not in this respect to the african race the little creature do not seem to be in the least aware of they degraded state they be as agile as fawn and they tact in administer to the want of the company be quite remarkable just as we be about to proceed on we journey a party of some half-a-dozen planter or overseer of neighbouring estate mount on fine mule who have be search for fugitive field-hand ride up i could see they be greatly excite and one of they have a negro lasso by the neck one end of the rope be fasten to he high spanish saddle on come up to the entrance gate the one most in advance dismount to open it the mule eager perhaps to get to a crib or what be more likely to evade a brutal kick or blow trot through this do not please its owner who bellow loudly to it to stop the mule however still keep on when the ruffian in demoniac anger draw from he belt a long bowie knife and dart after the animal hurl it at he with all he force the blade of the weapon which be six or seven inch long enter and stick fast in the abdomen of the agonize creature which for about twenty yard run on furiously with the murderous knife in its vitals it then fell-with a deep groan while the fiend who have perpetrate this wanton act of barbarity and he companion watch its fall and loudly exult in it i notice that there be a deep scowl of hatred on the countenance of the negro prisoner as this drama be be enact and when the knife strike the poor mule he cry out oh mas ' r ma ' r society for the suppression of cruelty to animal be as might be suppose unknown in such remote situation nor do they exist in any of the slave state and territory of america so that redress in such a case be out of the question i therefore console myself that the outrage have bring its own punishment in the loss of the mule which be at least worth from eighty to one hundred dollar pass onward we reach tallahassee by rather a circuitous route _ viá _ mount pleasant although in a indifferent state of health from exposure to the poisonous miasma of the country i on the whole feel pleased with my journey now that its danger be over and grateful to the great dispenser of all good who have safely conduct I through they at tallahassee i saw in the street in charge of a ruffianly-looking fellow two negro with heavy iron collar round they neck these be capture run-away the collar which must have weigh seven or ten pound have spike project on either side one of the poor creature have hold of the spike as he walk along to ease the load that press painfully on he shoulder general murat reside at the time in this neighborhood he be the brother of jehoiachin ex-king of naple and own a large plantation and i be tell upward of two hundred negro who be describe as be humanely treat by he this however be a very indefinite term where all slave-owner profess to do the same though the poor wretch over whom by law they impiously assume god 's heritage in ninety case out of every hundred be scantily clothe worse fed than horse or mule and work to the utmost extent of human endurance the humanity be in most case leave to the tender mercy of a brutal overseer who exact all he can if the poor tattered squalid-looking being i saw in tallahassee be a fair specimen of the humane treatment i have refer to heaven help they general murat some year ago marry a american lady who delight in be call the princess a little piece of vanity quite in keep with the aristocratical prejudice of american female in the south who be devoted worshipper of lordly institution and usage i do not see the general myself but be tell he be often to be meet lounge about the bar of the principal hotel -lrb- be quite americanize in this respect -rrb- he be describe as a very garrulous old gentleman extremely fond of recount he adventure particularly he escape when the ally troops enter pari about the year of bonaparte 's subjugation after remain a few day in tallahassee i take the conveyance to macon in georgium intend to pursue my route overland to charleston in south carolina in the diligence -lrb- a clumsy apology for a coach -rrb- from tallahassee to macon be several loquacious passenger one of these amuse and disgust we by turn for after give a epitome of he career which be a chequered one he relate a incident that have recently occur on a plantation he have be visit and as it present a novel feature in the assert rights of slave-holder -- how profane i will not stop to inquire -- i think it worth record after a recital of a drunken debauch in which he have take a part describe by he as a frolic and which have be keep up for several day he host he say anxious to show the high sense he entertain of the honor of the visit by make almost any sacrifice -lrb- this be say with great conceit -rrb- propose to put a negro up with a apple on he head in imitation of the ordeal impose on william tell the swiss patriot declare that he who divide the apple or perforated it with a rifle-ball should own the slave this proposal the gentleman very facetiously observe the party jump at expect some good sport but add the fellow spoilt it for he refuse to stand still although we ` use up ' a cowhide over he for he obstinacy the frivolous manner in which this intended outrage be related fill I and my fellow-passenger with disgust i think it be not safe to remark on the proceeding for i could see he be a very strenuous upholder of that disgraceful system of oppression which stigmatize and degrade the american as a people and will continue to do so until it be utterly abrogate and they character retrieve this would-be patrician be a pedantic swaggering bully who it be evident entertain high notion of he importance and own perhaps large possession -- in a word he be a american aristocrat and the description i have give be a fair one of he class in the south point to a hill as we enter a little settlement on we way to macon he exclaim see there gentleman twenty year ago i toil up that hill without a cent in my wallet -lrb- purse -rrb- but now he continue with the air of a potentate my nigger be the sleekest in we country in those day he go on glass inkstand stand on the desk of the bank i now be chief proprietor of we have nothing but gold one now the fellow 's bombast lower he in the esteem of the passenger who seem indispose to listen to he and the latter part of the journey he say little be in fact regularly send to coventry by we all he afterwards amuse himself much to we annoyance by whistle air and singing snatch of song which cause one of the passenger a lady to leave the diligence at the next change of horse he be quite a adept at whistle the air of yankee doodle this want of deference to the sex which i must say be a exception to the general behavior of man there and in other part of the union i visit do not fail to call forth animadversion the remark at one time be so pointed that i begin to feel uneasy lest the pugnacious spirit might be arouse in he which lead so often in the south to serious encounter we conveyance which more resemble a waggon than a stage-coach have by this time stop at a large hotel at macon i alight with much pleasure for the roughness of the road the disagreeable loquacity of the passenger i have describe and the recklessness of the driver make the journey excessively unpleasant the negro population in georgium be very numerous and they constant attempt to escape to the everglade in florida make unceasing vigilance on the part of they owner necessary for the safety of they property in many instance where suspicion exist they be never allow on any pretence to leave the estate or residence of the owner at the greensborough railway terminus i notice two negro on they way to charleston before be allow to take they seat in a open carriage in the rear of the train the clerk at the station step up to they and with a air of great effrontery demand to see they pass these be instantly show with a alacrity that plainly indicate fear they be then shut in a box in the rear of the train in which i could see no sit accommodation the way in which these man be treat present nothing new for i have invariably notice that color people in the south whether bond or free be speak to with supercilious haughtiness which i never once see they openly resent on arrive at the next station a trader get into the carriage he have with he two negro man and a boy these be secure to each other by hand-cuff and a slight negro chain for the last forty mile of my journey i have a very pleasant companion in a gentleman from the state of alabama he be a most agreeable and intelligent young fellow but invalide like myself through the poisonous miasma of the south i enter freely into conversation with he on general matter in the course of which i introduce slavery in several of its bearing i soon discover by he bias that he be decidedly in favor of thing as they be be anxious to obtain some information as to the observance of the nuptial tie amongst slave i touch upon that subject when he tell I the ceremony be mostly a burlesque and that union be in general but temporary although he have know some very devoted couple but he proceed to state that there be much room for reform in this respect i will relate to you a instance say he of the manner in which this as we white people consider it solemn compact be enter into amongst field-hand when a couple wish to live together as man and wife the male nigger mention it to the overseer and if there be no impediment they have a cabin assign to they he describe a scene of this kind which i will endeavor to give verbatim he say it occur on he father 's estate some year before and that he be stand by at the time although he continue ` tis do the same now in most instance a negro approach where the overseer be stand apparently by he sidle manner about to ask some favor when the follow colloquy ensue _ overseer _ -- well you black rascal what do you stand grin there for _ negro _ -- please ma ' r want lucy for wife _ overseer _ -- wife you scoundrel what do you want a wife for be off with you and mind you horse -lrb- he be employ as a teamster on the estate -rrb- _ negro _ -- oh mas ' r i love lucy _ overseer _ -- and she love you i suppose a fine taste she must have indeed where be you go to live _ negro _ -- get room in no 2 cabin if ma ' r please let ` um _ overseer _ -- well now listen go along and take she but you lazy dog if you get into any scrape and do not work like live coal i 'll send she to the other estate -lrb- which be situate forty mile distant -rrb- and flay you alive into the bargain the poor fellow after thank the overseer -lrb- not for he politeness certainly -rrb- dart off to communicate the joyful intelligence to he affianced make the welkin ring with he shout the gentleman who describe this scene say that it be always the custom on he father 's estate to give a gallon or two of whiskey for the attendant merry-making after numerous stoppage the train at length reach charleston the journey from greensborough have be a tedious one besides the annoyance of slow travel through the inefficient state of the line which be so defective that the carriage frequently leave the rail the noisome effluvium arise from the swamp we have to pass through which harbor innumerable alligator and other reptile have the most debilitating effect on the frame which be increase by the extreme sultriness of the weather after leave my ticket at the terminus i dispose of my baggage by hire a negro to carry it to my boarding-house and slowly wend my way into the city a spacious public square at the end of king-street through which i have to pass to my _ table d'hote _ present a animated view the citizen be assemble to celebrate the anniversary of the independence confer by washington and he compatriot by the solemn declaration of the 4th July 1776 long table under gay awning to shield the company from the burning ray of the sun which at the time be intense groan with every luxury the climate afford but the banquet be not furnish by this alone for cuba and some of the neighbouring island it be state have be ransack for delicacy crowd of elegantly-dressed lady -lrb- in general of very sallow look and languid air -rrb- and spirit-like child with swarthy-looking man many of whose visage bear evident trace of exposure to the ill effect of the climate and of dissipation crowd the festive board the negro attendant in dozen move about with automatic order as be characteristic of all the race on such occasion for the negro be a model waiter at a banquet they snowy costume contrast strongly with they black visage and the jovial scene around the merry peal of laughter as some unlucky wight upset a dish or scatter the sauce in everybody 's face within reach indicate lightness of heart and merriment and conviviality seem the order of the day the impose scene before I after a long absence from social meeting in civilized life be very cheer and have it not be for the inertia i feel at the time arise from a fatiguing journey and the tertian ague i should have feel disposed to participate in the day 's enjoyment other consideration might however have prevent this : i be a stranger to all around and know that i should be either subject to impertinent interrogation or become the object of invidious remark -- this in my debilitated state of health i feel anxious to avoid as calculate to impede my restoration my join the assemble party might also have involve the chance of surveillance during my stay which before my departure for europe i intend should be rather protracted i may have be mistake in this view but from the character i have hear of the place i feel justified in give way to the suspicion i be beguile into the erroneous idea that a sense of happiness and security reign in the assemble multitude a notion quite fallacious from attendant circumstance as i shall directly explain troops be station at a guard-house in the vicinity and the sentinel pace in front of the building as if in preparation for or in expectation of a foe afford a great contrast to the apparent security of the inhabitant assemble in the square before reach charleston i have be apprise of the state of jeopardy the citizen be in from the possibility of a recurrence of those scene of anarchy enact at the insurrection of the slave some time before -- scene which have fill every heart with dismay and spread ruin and desolation on every side from what i could glean of that fearful drama the slave in the surround district on a concerted signal from they confederate in charleston make a descent upon the city and render furious by long oppression proceed to fire it and massacre the inhabitant no language can convey a accurate idea of the consternation of the white inhabitant as it be describe to I the tocsin be sound the citizen assemble armed _ cap-a-pié _ and after much hard fight the rebellion be crushed and large number of the insurgent be slay or arrest then come the bloody hand of what be impiously term retributive justice a court or sort of drum-head court-martial not worthy to be call a trial condemn number of the slave to death and they be lead out instantly to execution my informant tell I that many a brave noble-hearted fellow be sacrifice who under happier circumstance though in a cause not half so righteous would have be extol as a hero and bow down with honor many a humble hearth be make desolate and in the language quote by my informant as in the day of the curse that descend on the people of the obdurate pharaoh every house mourn its dead still there be a strong lurk suspicion that the _ emeute _ of the negro have only be temporarily suppress and awful foreboding of fire and of blood spread a gloom on the mind of all this be the version give to I by a friend of what he describe as the most fearful rise amongst the negro ever before know in the southern state of america as i pass up the long range of table the health of the president of the republic be respond to by the company the cheer be deafening and what most surprised I be that the negro waiter join heartily i may say frantically in it and dance about like mad creature wave they napkin and shout with energy some of the elder one i notice look mournfully on and be evidently not in a gay humor seem a prey to bitter reflection notwithstanding the curse of slavery which like a poisonous upa taint the very air they breathe with the murder remains of its victim the white citizen of the south be extremely sensitive of they civil and political rights and seem to regard the palladium of independence secure by they progenitor as a especial benefit confer by the deity for they good in particular actuate by this mock patriotism -lrb- for it be nothing less -rrb- the citizen of the south omit no opportunity of demonstrate the blessing they so undeservedly inherit and which if i be not mistake will ere many year elapse be wrest from they amidst the terrible thunder of a oppressed and patient people whose power of endurance be indeed surprising leave the square i pass up king-street at the top of which be my intended boarding-house the shop in this fashionable resort be fit out in good style and the goods be of the best description after sunset the street be often line with carriage the city lie flat like the surrounding country and owe to this be insalubrious stagnant water collect in the cellar of the house and engender a poisonous vapor which be a fertile source of those destructive epidemic that combine with other cause be annually decimate the white population of the south of the american continent in all part at the top of king-street face you as you advance be a large protestant episcopal church i go there to worship on the follow Sunday but be oblige to leave the building there be it be state by the apparitor no accommodation for stranger a piece of illiberality that i consider very much in keep with the slave-holding opinion of the worshipper who attend it this want of politeness i be not however surprise at for it be notorious as have be before observe by a able writer that except the church of rome the member of the unestablished church of england -- the protestant episcopalian be the most bigotted sectarian and illiberal in the united state of america be fully persuade to follow the same writer that prelatical ordination and the three order be indispensable to they profession they be like too many of they fellow professor in the mother country deeply dye with laudean principle or that love of formulum in religion and grasp for power which have so conspicuously show itself among the oxford tractarian and which it be to be fear be gradually undermine protestant conformity by gnawing at its very heart in the college of great britain vital piety or that deep sense of religious duty that impel man to avoid the devious path of sin and to live near to god be i be incline to believe -lrb- and i regret it as a painful truth -rrb- by no means common in america there be however many pastor who faithfully warn they flock of the danger of the world and who strenuously advise they hearer to take warn lest they be over-captivate with the song of the syren these however i must say be chiefly in the free state for i can not regard southern minister in any other light than pharisaical while they continue openly -lrb- as be they constant practice -rrb- to support from they pulpit the institution that be the main stay of the southern state i mean slavery in my intercourse with serious individual with whom i come in contact during my stay on the continent of america the doctrine of dr pusey and he confederate be often refer to and although i believe the association for restore the ancient power of the clergy and the primary rite and usage of the church do not acknowledge the protestant episcopalian in america -lrb- owe perhaps chiefly to the invidious position the latter stand in with the state and the little chance of they view be universally embrace by they but partially no doubt to the evangelical principle of most of the minister officiate in that church -rrb- yet the subject have excite much interest there and the romish propensity of many pastor plainly indicate that inherent love of power that invariably and it may be say necessarily develope itself in hierarchical institution -- a propensity that ought to be closely watch by protestant lay congregation as be not only innovate and dangerous in its tendency but calculate to foster that superstition which be at once the fundamental principle of the faith of the city of the seven hill and the power of that triple-crowned monster popery i afterwards go into a large independent chapel in another part of the town where i be more courteously treat here be a very eloquent and note preacher a dr groyard from mobile he be deliver a very eloquent harangue intersperse with touch of pro-slavery sentimentalism and rhetorical flourish the former especially direct to the negro in the gallery when suddenly a cry of fire fire be raise in the street the learn doctor stand as if electrify and the instant after he hearer rush pell-mell out of the chapel amidst the shriek of the female and the consternation of the man cause without doubt by a lurk suspicion of impend evil from the negro which i have before refer to on ascertain that the alarm be cause by a house be on fire in the vicinity the service be abruptly terminate the follow day i continue my perambulation to the left of the episcopal church i have already mention and surround by umbrageous tree in a park-like enclosure be the town-hall i enter this building where i find a bench of magistrate the mayor of the city be amongst they adjudicate on the case bring before they these consist chiefly of negro apprehend in the street after nine o'clock the previous night they be in all case except where they owner pay the fine sentence to receive from ten to twenty lash which be administer at once by the city gaoler in a yard at the rear of a building near which officer be in attendance for the purpose i must mention in explanation that one of the law pass directly after the insurrection be to prohibit negro on any pretence to be out after nine pm at that hour the city guard arm with musket and bayonet patrol the street and apprehend every negro male or female they find abroad it be a stir scene when the drum beat at the guard-house in the public square i have before describe preparatory to the round of the soldier to witness the negro scour the street in all direction to get to they place of abode many of they in great trepidation utter ejaculation of terror as they run this be a inexorable law and punishment or fine be sure to follow its dereliction no excuse be available and as the owner seldom submit to pay the fine the slave be compel to take the consequence which in the language that consign they to the cruel infliction consist of from ten to twenty lash well lay on with a raw-hide a murderous whip which draw blood after the first few stroke and be as torturing i should imagine as the russian knout certainly prove in many instance as fatal as that odious instrument the crowning severity of the enactment i have refer to remain however to be tell so heinous in a negro be the crime of lift he hand in opposition to a white man in south carolina that the law adjudge that the offend member shall be forfeit this be or be quite as inexorable as the one i have before speak of and when in charleston i frequently amongst the flock of negro pass and repass saw individual with one hand only like the administration of miscall justice on negro in all slave-holding state in america the process be summary the offender be arrest bring before the bench of sit magistrate and on the _ ex parte _ -lrb- a -rrb- statement of he accuser condemn to mutilation be at once march out to the rear of the building and the hand lop off on a block fix there for the purpose i notice a block and axe myself in the yard of a building near the town-hall and on look at they closely see they be stain almost black with what i have little hesitation in say be human blood my conductor however try to divert my attention from the object and know i be a englishman refuse to enter on the subject -lrb- footnote a : the writer be assure when in charleston that this be the case in five out of every six case -rrb- another of the many cruel law put in force after the _ emeute _ of the negro be to prohibit any color person from walk on the pavement and force all male to salute every white they meet these distinction although fall into disuse be not even yet abolish but still with many other equally odious disgrace the carolinean statute book i see several negro from the plantation district walk in the road instead of on the pavement in accordance with this law touch they hat to every white passer-by they be consequently oblige to be continually lift they hand to they head for they pass white people at every step although i believe no punishment be now enforce for the omission of this humiliating homage to color the man i have refer to be doubtless afraid to disregard the ceremony a partiality exist in every part of america for music indeed so strongly be this develop that in almost all the town and even in some hamlet in the western state subscription band be keep up -- these play every evening when the weather admit in the center of the public square the citizen the while promenade round with they wife and family but although a decide penchant prevail for music the preference be give by the mass to a few ordinary air calculate to inspire that love of country which every reminiscence of the struggle for independence call forth the favorite air be the so-called national one of hail columbium although this be but second to the fantastic drollery of yankee doodle the latter be vociferously call for at all place of amusement and excite in the audience at such place of resort almost frantic sensation this be the more remarkable as it be originally compose by a englishman and as it be so intimately connect with americanism i shall perhaps be excuse for introduce here what may be term its history in the attack make upon the french post in america in 1755 those against niagara and frontenac be make by governor shirley of massachusett and general jackson of new york they army during the summer lay on the eastern bank of the hudson a little south of albany early in June the troops of the eastern province begin to pour in company after company and such a assemblage never before throng together on such a occasion it would have relax the gravity of a anchorite say the historian to see the descendant of the puritan march through the street of the ancient city and take they station on the left of the british army -- some with long coat and other with no coat at all and with color as various as the rainbow some with they hair crop like the army of cromwell and other with wig the lock of which float with grace round they shoulder they march they accoutrements and the whole arrangement of the troops furnished matter of amusement to the british army the music play the air of two century ago and the _ tout ensemble _ upon the whole exhibit a sight to the wonder stranger to which they have be unaccustomed among the club of wit that belong to the british army there be a doctor shackburg attach to

celebrated air of martial music the joke take to the no small amusement of the british brother jonathan exclaim it be nation fine and in a few day nothing be hear in the provincial camp but the air of

march -- now universally recognize by the patriot -- inspire the hero of bunker 's hill and in less than thirty lord cornwalli and he army march into the american line to the tune of yankee doodle chapter vii woe worth the hour when it be crime to plead the poor dumb bondman 's cause when all that make the heart sublime the glorious throb that conquer time be traitor to we cruel law -- lowell the general appearance of the majority of the color people in the street of charleston denote abject fear and timidity some of they as i pass look with servile dread at I -lrb- as they do at almost every one who happen to pass -rrb- so that i could read in many of they look a suspicion of interference which commiserate they condition as i do be quite distressing it be impossible to form a correct estimate of what the perpetuator of slavery have to expect if once the color population obtain a dominant position the acknowledged gradual depopulation of the whites in the slave state through sickness exhaustion of the land and consequent emigration unite with other cause there be no doubt will eventually result in a great preponderance of color people who arouse by the iniquitous treatment they undergo will rise under some resolute leader and redress they wrong i be quite strike to see in charleston such a disproportion of the color and without exaggerate i can say that almost if not quite three-fourths of those i meet in the street be if not actually of the negro race tinge in a greater or less degree with the hue pursue my perambulation i come to the slave and general cotton place of vendue to the left of the general post-office which building be a very substantial edifice of stone here a dozen or twenty auctioneer be loudly hold forth to the assemble crowd and crack up they wares in new york style the most indescribable scene of bustle and confusion prevail the whole street be cover with open bale and box of goods in one part of the street be a slave warehouse and advertisement be placard outside of the particulars of the various lot to be offer for competition and now on view as the privilege of view in this instance be confine to those who possess ticket i do not apply for one as i know that the wish would be attribute to curiosity and possibly a worse construction be put upon it through my be a stranger in the place pass onward through the assemble throng i get into a more secluded part of the city and come upon a large burial-ground in which many of the monument erect to the memory of the dead be of a very expensive description one in particular attract my notice this on inquiry of a gentlemanly-looking man who like myself be incline to meditate among the tomb i ascertain have be erect by the relative of a planter who have reside in a adjoining state but who have several cotton plantation within ten mile of charleston these he occasionally visit but in general confide to the care of a overseer who live with he family on one of they the season anterior to he last visit have be a very unpropitious one and he be much dissatisfied with the management to prevent a recurrence of this loss and under the strong impression that the hand be not work as they should be he resolve to inspect the plantation himself and administer some wholesome discipline in _ propriâ personâ _ for this purpose he visit one of the plantation intend afterwards to proceed to the other in rotation it so happen that he arrive when not expect and find he overseer absent and many of the hand not as closely engage as he wish he become violently enraged summon the overseer he order all hand in front of the house to witness a punishment and cause eight or ten of those whom he point out to be tie up at once and well whip stand by the while in uncontrollable anger to give direction in the midst of the scene and while urge greater severity he be seize with a fit of apoplexy which be of such a nature that it at once close he career and he die instantaneously directly the man fall the negro collect round he and utter cry and lamentation and the poor wretch who be at the moment the victim of he brutality on be untied which be immediately do join in it notwithstanding that my companion have a decide lean towards the extinction of slavery -lrb- although he start various objection to its abolition -rrb- i be quite inclined to believe he relation have when in florida meet with a somewhat similar instance of the devotedness of the negro race in a old woman who be bitterly bewail the loss of she deceased mistress the latter be a english lady but not over kind to she and reflect no credit on she countrywoman the poor creature in touching strain enlarged upon she beauty and accomplishment but when i question she as to she treatment of the negro in general belong to the estate would say little on the subject and shake she head in it be plain that like most female live in the south she be a pampered worldling entirely engross by principle of self-interest and little regard the welfare of she dependent if not as i have before observe very severe towards they she die prematurely from the effect of one of those virulent fever that in southern latitudes be so often fatal to the inhabitant especially to those who have be nurture in europe she encoffined remains be ship on board a vessel to be convey to england for burial in accordance with she express wish when the poor creature come to that part of she piteous tale when as she call she she beautiful angel of a mistress be put in the coffin and the estate hand be call in to take a last view of she -lrb- a custom in vogue there sometimes -rrb- she be overpower with grief and she utterance be so choke that she could scarcely proceed during my stay in charleston i become acquaint with a gentleman of color who follow a lucrative business as a dealer of some kind and who have formerly be a slave the introduction arise in rather a singular way it be through a proposition make to open a school for the education of colored child in which i take a interest great opposition be offer to the scheme by the white ruler of the place who declare the project illegal the enactment pass subsequent and prior to the insurrection stringently forbid it or any attempt to impart secular knowledge to the slave notwithstanding the violent threat use to prevent it a meeting be however convene to be hold at the house of the gentleman refer to and which i resolve though not unaccompanied with danger to my person to take a active part in i accordingly go to he home on the evening appoint this be a spacious house furnish in sumptuous style with extensive premise adjoining contiguous to the north end of the levee i notice that the wall be hang with good oil painting gorgeously frame principally family portrait but the most prominent in position be that of the unfortunate haytian chief toussaint l'ouverture whose cruel end at the instigation of the vindictive bonaparte will for ever reflect shame on the french name as long as a sense of justice and love of virtue and probity exist in the bosom of mankind far be it from I to trample on the name of one whom retributive justice have consign to the dust but the cruelty of napoleon towards this magnanimous prince and he final barbarity in consign he to a damp dungeon in a fastness amongst the alp where he perish in exile from he subject and family after ten month ' miserable endurance of the hardship wrongfully impose on he almost cause a feeling of exultation at the downfall of a despot who aim at the sovereignty of the world scruple not to sacrifice virtue and good faith at the shrine of ambition the fate of both chief be similar for both perish in captivity -- the one the victim perhaps of inordinate ambition the other of unscrupulous avarice and envious malignity the misfortune of toussaint l'ouverture have indeed with justice be pronounce the history of the negro race for in almost every instance where color man have push themselves above the common level they have incur the envy of white man and in too many instance have be crush by they overbearing tyranny the meeting be conduct with religious decorum most if not all of the color gentleman present be member of the wesleyan connection i be please with the temperate spirit in which they wrong be discuss and after draw up the rule form a committee and arrange other necessary preliminary the meeting break up on reach my hotel on my return i be at once wait upon by the landlord who in certainly a respectful manner inform I that the interest i have the day before incautiously express regard the school have lead to my be watch to the house where the meeting be hold and that to avoid the unpleasantness which would result from my continue to take any step in the matter and which might ensue he say from the suspicion excite he strongly advise that i should the next day address a letter to the editor of the principal newspaper in the city repudiate all connection with a movement calculate he say to disturb the public mind and perhaps cause disturbance this i refuse to do but tell he i do not intend to figure prominently in the matter and that my stay in the city would be very limited he then relate several instance of mob law which have be enacted-within the twelve month precede which he say be quite necessary to maintain southern rights and which he do not fail to let I know he fully concur in after this hint convey i must say in a friendly spirit whatever my private opinion be as to the occasion of it i mingle during the remainder of my stay very little with the frequenter of he establishment -- a policy which i consider necessary from personal consideration and owe to this cautious behavior i be not afterwards interfere with though often eye with suspicion the school be open during my stay but continue so but a short time the virulent conduct of the constable support by some of the citizen and the civil authority compelling its discontinuance this be not to be wonder at when it be remember that the old statute law of south carolina prohibit the education of negro bond or free under a penalty of fine and imprisonment and although before the recent _ emeute _ it be fall into disuse that event revive its enforcement with ancient malignity the free negro gentleman at whose house the preliminary for open the school refer to be go through inform I on a subsequent occasion that the constant vexation and annoyance he be subject to owe to the prejudice in the mind of southern people regard color would compel he to relinquish he business and proceed either to canada or to the free state he deplore the alternative much as he have be bear and breed a slave in carolina and by untiring assiduity have save money enough to emancipate himself and he wife in fact he add i feel this be my country and leave it will come hard he have a numerous family which he maintain in great respectability and he business be a profitable one make he more reluctant to abandon it and the advantage that otherwise would attend he continuance in charleston he hospitably entertain I at he home and appear highly gratify at meeting with a white man who feel disposed to regard he with equality after dine at he house one day he take I a ride round the suburb of the city which i notice be flat and exceedingly uninteresting we return by way of the marine parade which be certainly a _ chef d'oeuvre _ of its kind this be on the south side of the city and command a magnificent sea-view it be raise far above the sea and lay out with carriage-drive and path for pedestrian far out look towards cape hattera be a fort on a island this be always garrison by a detachment of we troops and of late year have be use as a receptacle for those daring chief among the indian who by they indomitable courage have be the terror of the united state frontier here that hero oceolum chief of the seminole die not long before in captivity from excessive grief cause by the treachery of certain american officer who under a pretended truce seize he and he attendant warrior below we in the bay we could see the fin of several shark plough the wave in search of prey while the constant sailing to and fro of cuba fruit-boat laden with banana pawpaw pine-apple and every luxury that and contiguous island afford enliven the scene which altogether be one of extraordinary beauty there be a large assemblage of lady and gentleman promenade and as i ride with my friend i have some very furtive glance from the crowd which be intend no doubt to remind I that my keep such company be _ infra dig _ if not open to suspicion there be in truth no little hazard in ride about in public with a man against whose acquaintance i have a short time before be caution and i feel my position rather a uncomfortable one have some of the young blood of charleston be up there be little doubt but that i must have leave the place _ san ceremonie _ possess of a natural urbanity or what in elevated society amongst white people would be term true politeness the manner of the well-bred negro be prepossess this be very remarkable in my color friend who be well inform and possess a refinement and intelligence i have never before meet with in any of he race on the subject of enslavement he would at first venture few observation confine himself to those inconvenience and annoyance that affect he individually he however become after a time more communicative on the whole at first i be not a little apprehensive that my color acquaintance be under the impression that my friendship be not sincere although he do not say as much in he conversation the impression however soon leave I after a further intimacy i consider then and do now that the suspicion be quite excusable the jesuitical practice and underhand trickery descend to by the white population in the slave state in order to ascertain how individual stand affect be so numerous that the color people be oblige to be wary of those they either suspect or of whom be stranger they know little i remember well whilst ride with he on the occasion i have already refer to we drive past a white man on horseback who -lrb- as be common in charleston -rrb- be correct he negro in the street the poor fellow be writhe under the cruel infliction of a flagellation with a raw-hide and rent the air with he cry this only increase the rage of he master who seem to take delight in striking he face and ear i eagerly watch the scene and as we pass lean over the back of the gig my companion fear i suppose lest the sight might provoke in I some exclamation and thus get we into notice nudge I violently with he elbow say at the same time hurriedly do not heed do not heed my blood be get hot and but for my companion my passion would in all probability have get the better of my discretion and i should without remedy have be involve in a dispute if not immediately apprehend as we ride on i adverted to this barefaced exhibition of tyranny in a open thoroughfare which i remark be sufficient proof of the iniquity of the system in spite of the assertion make by the southerner to the contrary in reply to this all my companion remark be do you never see that do before my answer be i have see negro cruelly treat on estate and elsewhere but that this scene be the more revolting from its be enact in the open highway see that he be anxious to avoid the subject and that the observation he have make be draw from he by my remark i remain silent and wrap in deep reflection on the outrage we have witness at length reach he dwelling the occurrence i suppose somewhat affect my spirit for soon after we get into the drawing-room no one else be present my friend address I no doubt observe my depression nearly as follow sir you seem to have a tender compassion for my poor countryman would to god white man be all as feeling here the system be a accursed one but what can we do but bear it patiently every hand seem against we and we dare not speak for ourselves i tell he i deeply sympathised with he oppressed countryman and live in hope that before long the public mind in america would be arouse from its apathy and the accumulate wrong of the race be redress he only reply be god grant it i hope so too in charleston there exist several charitable institution but these i believe with only one exception be for the benefit of poor white people the innate benevolence of the human heart be thus in the midst of dire oppression wont to hold its sway notwithstanding the poisonous influence that surround but the pro-slavery business neutralize these would-be benefactor and taint all they endeavor under the cloak of benevolence to remove the odium it so justly incur liberate you slave and then i will talk to you about religion and charity be the emphatic word of a eminent northern divine in he correspondence with the committee of a benevolent institution in the south some year ago and the admonition speak as forcibly now as it do then as you walk the street of charleston row of greedy vulture with sapient look sit on the parapet of the house watch for offal these bird be great blessing in warm climate and in carolina a fine of ten dollar be inflict for wantonly destroy they they appear to be quite conscious of they privilege and sail down from the house-top into the street where they stalk about hardly care to move out of the way of the horse and carriage pass they be of a eagle-brown color and many of they appear well condition even to obesity at night score of dog collect in the street and yelp and bark in the most annoying manner this it be customary to remedy by a gun be fire from a window at the midnight interloper when they disperse in great terror i should remark that this be a common nuisance in warm latitudes some of these animal live in the wild and like jackal steal into the town at night to eke out a scanty subsistence at first my rest be greatly disturb by they noisy yelping but i soon become accustomed to the inconvenience and think little of it the warmth of the climate induce great lassitude and indisposition to exertion _ alia _ indolence i begin to experience this soon after arrive in the south this which in england would be call laziness be encourage by the most trifling office be perform by slave the female in particular give way to this inertness and active woman be seldom to be meet with the wife of man in affluent circumstance be in general like pampered child and suffer dreadfully from _ ennui _ on one occasion a english gentleman at charleston with whom i become acquaint and whose hospitality i shall never forget when converse on the subject address I thus : good active wife be seldom to be meet with in this state amongst the native i may say hardly ever the female be nurture in indolence and in seek what they term a settlement look more to the man 's means than the likelihood of live happily with he there be no disguise it -- the considera -- with they be a _ sine quâ non _ few girl would refuse a man who possess a goodly number of slave though they be sure he affection would be share by some of the best-looking of the female amongst they and he conduct towards the remainder that of a very demon these sentiment i very soon ascertain to be in no way libellous a southern wife if she be prodigally furnish with dollar to go shopping apparently consider it no drawback to she happiness if some brilliant mulatto or quadroon woman ensnare she husband of course there be exception but the patriarchal usage be so engraft in society there that it elicit little notice or comment nor from what i glean be the lady themselves immaculate as may be infer from the occasional quadroon aspect of they progeny the jew be a very numerous and influential body in charleston and monopolize many of its corporate honor they be describe as very haughty and captious this however be say no more of the stock of israel than be observable all over the world hen they be in prosperous circumstance although when this be not the case perhaps none of the human family be so abject and servile not except slave themselves in process of time these people bid fair to concentrate in themselves most of the wealth and influence of charleston if they perseverance -lrb- which be here indomitable -rrb- should attain this result they will be in pretty much the same position there that pharaoh occupy over they race in egypt in olden time and if report speak true will wield the sceptre of authority over they captive in a somewhat similar style avarice be the beset sin of the israelite and here he slave be tax beyond endurance to exact the utmost from he labor be the constant aim and i be inform that many of the slave belong to jew be send out and compel on the Saturday night to bring in a much larger sum than it be reasonably possible the poor creature could earn and if not successful they be subject to the most cruel treatment not long after my arrival in charleston i several time meet a young color man who be of so prepossess a appearance that i feel desirous to become acquaint with he and as i be at a loss to find my way to the residence of the mayor a good opportunity one day offer and i address he he very courteously take I to the street in which the house be situate and we talk on general topic as we go -- in the course of which he state he be save money for he ransom and in two year intend to proceed to montreal in canada i could see however that the free manner in which we converse attract the attention of three or four individual as we pass they -- these would stop as if to satisfy they curiosity some even take the trouble to watch we out of sight look back i several time see one more impertinent-looking than some other eye we intently and once i fancied i see he turn as if to overtake we this curiosity i have often perceive before but as disagreeable result might follow i invariably make a practice to take no notice of it when in the company of a color individual a smile play upon the feature of my dusky companion as i turn to observe the inquisitive fellow i have refer to perhaps i be take for a negro-stealer but as i treat my companion with equality i be most likely set down as one of those dangerous personage who through zeal in the cause of emancipation sometimes penetrate into the slave district and be accuse -lrb- with what degree of justice i can not tell -rrb- of infuse into the mind of the slave discontented notion and agrarian principle as i meet on the occasion i have just refer to a individual who know i have feel a interest in endeavor to establish the school for the education of negro child the result of which i have already mention i be apprehensive that the _ contretemps _ would have expose I to the unpleasantness of at least be shun afterwards as a man entertaining principle inimical to southern interest -- and however resolute i feel to pursue a independent course while i remain in charleston i could not shake off a fear i vaguely entertain of a public recognition by a deeply prejudiced and ignorant populace who once set on do not hesitate to proceed to disagreeable extreme this fear be enhance in no little degree by the operation i have witness of the tar and feather process practice by enraged citizen in the missourus country which i have before describe the most degrading phrase that can be apply in the south to those white individual who sympathize in the wrong inflict on the african race i soon find to be that he associate with nigger thus a kind-hearted individual at once lose caste among he fellow citizen and invidious though it certainly be many slave-owner be deter by this consideration blended with a politic regard for they own safety from exercise that benevolence towards they dependent which they sincerely feel place as it be under a sort of social ban such man artfully conceal they sentiment from the public and by a more lenient treatment of they own hand quiet they conscience while at the same time they blunt they sense of what be honest upright just and manly instance have occasionally occur where man of correct principle have so far succumb to this sense of duty as to liberate they slave these be however rare occurrence and when they do happen be usually confine to man of sterling religious principle who like that great exception the respectable class of people call quaker in america refuse from a conviction of the enormity of the evil to recognize as member those who hold or traffic in slave it be through the influence of such man that the iniquity of the system become expose to public view and remedy be sometimes in flagrant case of cruelty apply the legislature of the several slave state however have give such absolute dominion by a rigorous code of law to the owner that the greatest enormity may be commit almost with impunity or at least with but a remote chance of justice have its legitimate sway the mass of slave-owner be interested in conceal enormity commit by they fellow and be back by a venal press which whether bribe or not -lrb- and there be every reason to suspect that this be often the case -rrb- put such a construction on _ outrage _ by garbled _ report _ as to turn the tide of sympathy from the victim to the perpetrator no editor possess the least leaven of anti-slavery principle would be patronize and it not infrequently happen that such man be mob and drive perforce to leave the slave for the more northern or free state here they stand a better chance but in many instance the prejudice it be say follow they course and southern influence occasion they bankruptcy or non-success the practice so common in the slave state of the citizen congregate at the bar of hotel or cafés in the town and city to while away the time render attendance at such place the readiest means of ascertain the state of the public mind on any engrossing subject opinion be here freely discuss not however without bias and anger on the contrary the practice be most sectarian and frequently involve deadly feud and personal encounter these latter being of every-day occurrence ever since i have be in the southern state my attention have be attract to the swarm of well-dressed lounger at cafés and hotel at first like many other traveller i be delude by the notion that these idler be man of independent means but my mind be soon disabused of this fallacy i ascertain that the greater portion of these belong to that numerous class in america know as sport gentleman in plainer term gambler some of these man have belong to the higher walk of life these be the more retire few who -lrb- probably through a sense of shame not quite extinguish -rrb- feel rather dispose to shrink from than to attract attention the majority of these idler be impudent-looking braggart who with jaunty air and coxcombical show of superiority endeavor to enforce they own opinion and to silence those of every one else there be also another class of frequenter at such place this consist of tradesman who pass much of they time hang about at such resort to the great detriment of they individual affair and lastly such traveller as might be stop in the town who through _ ennui _ and inveterate habit have leave they hotel and saunter up town -lrb- as they call gad about -rrb- to hear the news of the day soon ascertain that such place be the best and except the public print the only resort to ascertain the latest intelligence and to collect information respect the movement of the black population and the company however exceptionable be term there respectable i adopt the plan on several successive evening of quietly smoke a cigar and listen to pass observation and remark some of these be disgust enough so much so that i will not offend my reader by repeat they suffice it to say that any individual possess the slightest pretension to the name of gentleman in any hotel i have visit in england on indulge in the indecorous language i hear at these place would by a very summary process have meet with ejectment without ceremony here however a laxity of moral feeling prevail that stifle all sense of propriety and scurrility obscene language and filthy jest of which the color population be i suppose per force of habit the principal butt form the chief attraction of such place of resort to they vitiated frequenter in the course of these visit i be present at some angry altercation one of these refer to the recent visit of a individual who be term by the disputant a incendiary abolitionist and who it appear have be detect in the act of distribute tract which have be publish at salem in massachusett expose the disability the african race be labor under extract from one of these tract be read and appear very much to increase the violence of the contend party one of whom insist that the publication contain nothing but what might be read by every slave in the sacred scripture and that therefore it could not be class as dangerous although he admit that it contain notion of human rights that be calculate to imbue the mind of the nigger with unbecoming idea these sentiment do not at all accord with those of the company and several expression of doubt as to the soundness of the speaker 's own pro-slavery principle together with the increase excitement cause he to withdraw from the contest he immediate antagonist who be evidently the lead man on the occasion enlarged on the danger attend the sufferance of such man at large in the slave state and proceed with great volubility to quote various passage from the black code to show that the legislature have contemplate the intrusion of such pestilent fellow and have in fact give full power to remedy the evil if the citizen choose to exercise it and go on to observe that the rights of southern people be now-a-days invade on every hand and it behove they to stand in they own defense he advice he say be if the municipal authority let the fellow go to form a committee of justice to adjudicate on the case and if it be consider conducive to the public weal to administer salutary punishment this proposal be uproariously applaud and four of the citizen present with the last speaker for chairman be name on the spot to watch the case and now add this gentleman we 'll have a gin sling round for success i hear the day follow that the individual who be the subject of the foregoing proceedings be accuse before the mayor who dismiss the case with a caution advise he to leave the city with all dispatch to avoid disagreeable consequence this the man by the aid of a constable manage to do that functionary no doubt for a consideration take he to the city prison and lock he up until nightfall when he be assist to leave the place disguise as a soldier this i be inform by a friend to whom i afterwards related it be one of those commotion that occur almost daily in southern town and city such lawless frequenter of hotel tavern and cafés form a kind of social police and scarcely a stranger visit the place without he motive for the visit be canvass and he business often expose much to he great annoyance and inconvenience so accustomed do american traveller in the south appear to this system of internal surveillance that i several time notice stranger at the hotel or café counter openly explain the object of they visit and if there be nothing to conceal however annoy the alternative appear i be convince the policy be not have a host of suspicion be silence by such a course in my travels on the whole route from new york to charleston i discover a most unjustifiable and impertinent disposition to pry into the business of other if i be question once i be sure i be at least fifty time by my fellow -- traveller from time to time as to my motive for visit america and my intended proceedings i find however ' that a certain reserve be a efficient remedy captain waterton of south american celebrity as a ornithologist and who visit north america in he travels mention that if you confide you affair and intention when question the american reciprocate that confidence by relate they own my own experience however do not corroborate this view of the case for though loquacious in the extreme and gifted so that to use a yankee phrase they would talk a dog 's hind-leg off they be in general cautious not to divulge they secret to say the least of it the habit of prying into the business of other be one totally unbecome a well-ordered state of society which the american speak generally be decidedly not it be extremely annoying from the unpleasant feeling it excite that you be suspect if not watch -lrb- this apply forcibly to the slave district -rrb- and it be a habit that have arise purely from the incongruity of society at large on the american continent and a want of that subdivision of class that exist in europe during my visit to the various hotel while i remain in charleston for the purpose of collect information i be several time interrogate in a barefaced manner by the visitor who frequent those place as to my politics and especially as to my principle in regard to the institution of slavery now as i be not unaware that my intimacy with the gentleman of color which i have already refer to have get abroad i be oblige to be extremely guard in my reply on such occasion it be on one of these that i feel myself in great hazard for two individual in the company be discuss with much energy the question of amalgamation -lrb- that be marriage contract between black and white man and woman -rrb- and i be listen intently to they altercation when suddenly one of they eye I with malicious gaze no doubt have notice my attention to the colloquy say you opinion stranger on this subject i guess you understand it torrably well as you seem to be pretty hard on b -- 's eldest daughter this unexpected sally rather alarm I for the name he mention be that of my color friend i have before allude to and whose daughter i have only meet once and that at she father 's house i scarcely know what to reply but think it best to put on a bold face so face the man i thank he with much irony for the inuendo and say it be a piece of impudence i think very much like he from what i have overhear this be say in a resolute tone and the fellow quail before it he reply be now stranger do not get angry i see you the other day at b -- 's house and could not tell what to make of it but i hope you do not think that i be in arnest i reply to this that i know best what business i have at b -- 's house and that he plan be to mind he own business i then leave he apparently highly indignant but in fact glad to make my escape like bully all the world over the southern one be coward there be however great danger here in embroil yourself with such character the pistol and bowie knife be instantly resort to if the quarrel become serious i see this braggart on several occasion afterwards but he evidently keep aloof and be disincline to venture in the part of the room i occupy i ascertain that he keep a dry goods store in king-street and be a boisterous fellow often involve in quarrel the discussion on amalgamation which be a very vexed one be again introduce on a subsequent occasion a planter from the north of the state have -lrb- as be sometimes the case -rrb- sell off everything he possess and remove to the state of maine take with he a young quadroon woman with the intention of make she he lawful wife and live there retire after the expression of a variety of opinion as to what this man deserve some being of opinion that the subject ought to be moot in the legislature at washington -- other that he whole effect ought to be escheat for the benefit of the public treasury -- and by far the greater number that he ought to be summarily deal with at the hand of the so-considered outraged citizen which in other language mean lynch -- it be state by a very loquacious yankee-looking fellow present who make himself prominent in the discussion that it be the opinion of the company that any man marry a woman with negro blood in she vein should be hang as a traitor to southern interest and a bad citizen this sentiment be loudly applaud and have the unfortunate subject of it be in charleston or near it he would in all probability have be call to account to I it appear remarkable that man who be always boast of the well-ordered institution of they country -lrb- slavery be a very important one be it remembered -rrb- should be ever ready to set aside all law and as it be by _ ex parte _ evidence alone inflict summary vengeance on the offender i be however always of opinion when amongst they that four-fifth of the man would rejoice if all law be abrogate and the passion of the people allow to govern the country thus constitute themselves judge in they own case and trample under foot every semblance of justice equity and common propriety as it be in many part of the union the judge and magistrate be notoriously awed by the people and the most perfidious wretch be suffer to escape the hand of justice a full confirmation of this be to be find in the frequent outrage against law and order report in the newspaper and which there elicit little regard walk for a stroll a day or two after in the vicinity of the marine-promenade i see a strange-looking cavalcade approach two armed overseer be escort five negro recently capture to the city gaol the poor creature be so heavily shackle that they could walk but slowly and they brutal conductor keep urge they on chiefly by coarse language and oath now and then accompany by a severe stroke with a slave-whip carry by one of they the recover fugitive look very dejected and be no doubt brooding over the consequence of they conduct the elder of the party a stout fellow of about forty-five year old of very sullen look have a distinct brand on he forehead of the initial str i afterwards inquire what these brand-mark signify suppose naturally that they be the initial of the name of he present or former owner my informant who be a by-stander state that he be no doubt a incorrigibly bad fellow and that the initial str be often use in such case i inquire they signification when to my astonishment he reply it might be stop the rascal and add that private signal be in constant use among the inland planter as he call they who he say suffer so much by they hand run away that it be absolutely necessary to adopt a plan of the kind for security he further state that such incorrigible when catch be never allow to leave the plantation so that if they venture abroad they carry the warrant for they immediate arrest with they but he go on people be begin to dislike such severity and a new code of regulation back by the legislature be much talk of by the innovator as we call they to prevent such practice i have no doubt this man own slave himself i say i think myself that the policy of kindness would answer better than such severity and it would be well if slave-holder generally be to try it ah stranger he reply i see you do not understand thing here down south do not you know that people who be over kind get impose on this be specially the case with slave treat they well and you 'll soon find they run off or complain the only way to manage nigger be to keep they down then you can control they but not else it have be urge a thousand time in defense of the upholder of slavery in its various ramification that they be in reality as a body oppose to the system and would readily conform to any change that would be sufficiently comprehensive to indemnify they from present and future loss from conversation hear in south carolina and other slave district i be quite satisfied that this be a misrepresentation and that the generality of proprietor regard any change as a dangerous innovation and that far from reluctantly follow the occupation of trader in flesh and blood it be quite congenial to the vitiated taste of the greater portion of southern citizen whose perverted notion of justice and propriety be clamorously express on the most trivial occasion in whatever sphere of society amongst they you go you find the subject of protect they rights urge with impetuosity the same rancorous feeling towards man of abolitionist sentiment and the same deprecation of the slave race to decry the negro in public opinion be one of they constant rule of action and if a individual attempt to assert they equal rights with mankind at large he be consider as disaffected towards southern interest and if not openly threaten as i have before observe in this work be unceremoniously talk down ' it be thus often dangerous to broach the subject and if a individual more daring than people generally be when in the plague-infected latitudes of slavery attempt to repudiate the view so unhesitatingly express by the pro-slavery advocate that the negro race be but the connect link between man and the brute creation he be look upon with disgust and he society contemn this overbearing conduct be so ingrained that it show itself on the most trifling occasion in they intercourse with they fellow-citizen argumentative fact might be produce _ ad infinitum _ to prove that the legal enactment for the government of the slave state of america have be frame so as to vest in the proprietor as much control over the life and person of those they hold in servitude as any animal in the category of plantation stock this in my tour through that region of moral darkness and despair the state of louisiana i have numberless opportunity of observe which would not fail to convince the most sceptical and if i have pass over many of these in the foregoing page it be because the incident themselves -lrb- though prove that the slightest approach to independent action or opposition to the depraved will of they tyrannical superior be at once visit with consequence that make I shudder to reflect upon -rrb- be of too trivial a nature to interest the general reader i will however copy here a extract from a paper publish in virginium the _ richmond time _ for August 1852 which must i think tend to remove any doubt if they exist in the mind of the reader that the conclusion i have come to from personal observation be correct and sufficient to prove that the despotic nichola of russium himself do not exercise more absolute control over the life and liberty of the degraded serf he rule than the slave-appropriator of america do over they victim the newspaper in question be a highly popular one with the aristocratical slave-owner of virginium and the editor one of those champion of the unjust and iniquitous system who invariably meet with extensive patronage in every part of the southern state a field-hand shot -- a gentleman name ball overseer to mr edward t taylor find it necessary to chastise a field-hand attempt to do so in the field the negro resist and make fight and be the stronger of the two give the overseer a beating and then betook himself to the wood mr ball as soon as he could do so mount he horse and proceed to mr taylor 's residence inform he of what have occur taylor in company with ball repair to the corn-field to which the negro have return and demand to know the cause of he conduct the negro reply that ball attempt to flog he and he would not submit to it taylor say he should and order he to cross he hand at the same time direct ball to seize he ball do so but perceive the negro have attempt to draw a knife tell mr taylor of it who immediately spring from he horse and draw a pistol shoot the negro dead at he foot the _ richmond reporter _ a contemporary of the _ time _ comment on this impious affair as follow : -- mr taylor do what every man who have the management of negro ought to do enforce obedience or kill they it be the practice of the inhabitant of charleston in common i believe with all owner of slave in town or city in the slave state who have not employment sufficient for they at home or when the slave be a cripple to send they out to seek they own maintenance in such case the slave be compel to give a account of what he have earn during the week at he owner 's house where he attend on Saturday evening for the purpose a fix sum be generally demand in proportion to the average value of such labor at the time i be inform that it frequently happen that the master exact the utmost the slave can earn so that the miserable pittance left be scarcely sufficient to sustain nature this no doubt account for the haggard care-worn appearance of such labourer for with few exception i find hand thus send out more miserably clothe and less hale than the common run of slave on the other hand if a slave be a good handicraftsman he be able to earn more than he master demand such instance be however rare these be the man who by dint of hard work and thrifty habit accumulate sufficient eventually to obtain manumission there be in most case a strict eye keep on such hand and if the boon be attain it be in general by stealthy means at my boarding-house in charleston i often see negro laundress who call for linen one of these in particular i notice seem to be in habitual low spirit on one occasion she appear to be in unusual distress in consequence of one of the boarder leave the house in she debt she say that she owner would certainly punish she if she do not make up the require sum and where to procure it she could not tell i be touch by she tale and immediately open a subscription amongst the boarder in the house and succeed in collect a trifle over the amount she have lose this i hand she and she go on she way rejoice i be tell by a carolinian who lodge at this house that the practice of send out slave to earn money in the way i have describe have be in vogue from time immemorial and that it be such a profitable mode of realize by slave labor that it be follow more extensively in that state now than formerly i will conclude this part of my narration by quote the word of a powerful writer on the subject of slavery as i have witness its operation in america amongst the afflict ill which the wickedness of man have establish upon earth the greatest beyond compare be slavery indeed its consequence be so dreadful the sin which it engender be of such gigantic proportion and all its accompaniment be so loathsome and hideous that the mind of benevolent person revolt from contemplate it as offer a spectacle of crime and cruelty too deep for a remedy and too vast for sympathy slavery be a infinite evil the calculation of its murder its rapine its barbarity its deed of lust and licentiousness though authenticate by the most unquestionable authority would produce a total of horror too great to be believe and to narrate the history of these cruelty which have be perpetrate by american slave-master within the last five year alone would be to tell idle fable in the opinion of those who have not deeply study the tragical subject if we take the united state of america where the outcry against slavery be greater than in any other country under heaven and where we hear more of religion and revivalism more of bustle and machinery of piety a country set itself up as a beacon of freedom then do slavery amongst such a people appear transcendently wicked a sin which in addition to its usual cruelty and selfishness be in they load with hypocrisy and ingratitude with hypocrisy as it relate to they pretension to liberty and with ingratitude as it relate to that god who give they to be free this indeed make all the institution of america civil and religious little better than a solemn mockery a tragical jest
