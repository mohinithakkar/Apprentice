that false accusation have plot and penn would six play to attend the farce of he negotiation killegrew be a man of very great humor and frequently divert king charle ii by he lively spirit of mirth and drollery he be frequently at court and have often access to king charle when admission be deny to the first peer in the realm amongst many other merry story the following be related of killegrew charle ii who hate business as much as he love pleasure would often disappoint the council in vouchsafe he royal presence when they be meet by which they business be necessarily delay would and many of the council much offend by the disrespect throw on they : it happen one day while the council be meet and have sit some time in expectation of he majesty that the duke of lauderdale who be a furious ungovernable man quit the room in a passion and accidentally meet with killegrew to whom he express himself irreverently of the king : killegrew bid he grace be calm for he would lay a wager of a hundred pound that he would make he majesty come to council in less than half a hour lauderdale be a little heated and under the influence of surprize take he at he word -- killegrew go to the king and without ceremony tell he what have happen and add i know that you majesty hate lauderdale tho ' the necessity of you affair oblige you to behave civilly to he now if you would get rid of a man you hate come to the council for lauderdale be a man so boundlessly avaricious that rather than pay the hundred pound lose in this wager he will hang himself and never plague you more the king be please with the archness of this observation and answer ` then killegrew i 'll positively go ' which he do -- it be likewise related that upon the king 's suffer he mistress to gain so great a ascendant over he as to sacrifice for they the interest of the state and neglect the most important affair while like another sardanapalus he waste he hour in the apartment of those enchantress : killegrew go one day into he apartment dress would like a pilgrim bent upon a long journey the king be surprize at this extraordinary frolic ask he the meaning of it and to what distant country he be go to which killegrew bluntly answer the country i seek may it please you majesty be hell and what to do there reply the king to bring up oliver cromwel from thence return the wag to take care of the english affair for he successor take none -- we can not particularly ascertain the truth of these relation but we may venture to assert that these be not improbable when it be consider how much delighted king charle the iid be with a joke however severe and that there be not at court a more likely person to pass they than killegrew who from he long exile with the king and be about he person have contract a kind of familiarity which the lustre that be throw round the prince upon he restoration be not sufficient to check tho ' sir john denham mention but six we author write nine play in he

family in the city of canterbury she be bear in charle ist 's reign -lrb- 1 -rrb- but in what year be not know she father 's name be johnson whose relation to the lord willoughby engage he for the advantageous post of lieutenant general of surinam and six and thirty island to undertake a voyage with he whole family to the west-indy at which time we poetess be very young mr johnson die at sea in he passage thither but he family arrive at surinam a place so delightfully situated and abound with such a vast profusion of beauty that accord to mr behn 's description nature seem to have join with art to render it perfectly elegant : she habitation in that country call st john 's hill she have challenge all the garden in italy nay all the globe of the world to shew so delightful a recess it be there we poetess become acquaint with the story and person of the american prince oroonoko whose adventure she have so feelingly and elegantly describe in the celebrated novel of that name upon which mr southern have build he tragedy of oroonoko part of which be so entertaining and move that it be almost too much for nature mr behn tell we that she herself have often see and converse with that great man and be a witness to many of he mighty action and that at one time he and imoinda he wife be scarce a hour in a day from she lodgings that they eat with she and that she oblige they in all thing she be capable of entertain they with the life of the roman and great man which charm he with she company while she engage he wife with teach she all the pretty work she be mistress of relate story of nun and endeavor to bring she to the knowledge of the true god this intimacy between oroonoko and mr behn occasion some reflexion on she conduct from which the authoress of she life already quote justified she in the follow manner ` here say she i can add nothing to what she have give the world already but a vindication of she from some unjust aspersion i find be insinuate about this town in relation to that prince i know she intimately well and i believe she would not have conceal any love affair from I be one of she own sex whose friendship and secrecy she have experience which make I assure the world that there be no intrigue between that prince and astræa she have a general value for he uncommon virtue and when he relate the story of he woe she might with the desdemona of shakespear cry out that it be pitiful wondrous pitiful which never can be construe into a amour besides he heart be too violently set on the everlasting charm of he imoinda to be shake with those more faint -lrb- in he eye -rrb- of a white beauty and astrea 's relation there present keep too watchful a eye over she to permit the frailty of she youth if that have be powerful enough ' after this lady 's return to london she be marry to mr behn a merchant there but of dutch extraction this marriage strengthen she interest and perhaps restore she character give she a opportunity of appear with advantage at court she give king charle ii so accurate and agreeable a account of the colony of surinam that he conceive a great opinion of she ability and think she a proper person to be entrust with the management of some important affair during the dutch war which occasion she go into flander and reside at antwerp here by she political intrigue she discover the design form by the dutch of sail up the river thame and burn the english ship in they harbor which she communicate to the court of england but she intelligence though well ground as appear by the event be only laugh at and slight she lay aside all other thought of state affair and amuse herself during she stay at antwerp with the gallantry in that city but as we have mention that she discover the design of the dutch to burn we ship it would be injustice to the lady as well as to the reader not to give some detail of she manner of do it she make this discovery by the intervention of a dutchman whom she life-writer call by the name of vander albert as a ambassador or negociator of she sex could not take the usual means of intelligence of mix with the multitude and bustling in the cabal of statesman she fall upon another way perhaps more efficacious of work by she eye this vander albert have be in love with she before she marriage with mr behn and no sooner hear of she arrival at antwerp than he pay she a visit and after a repetition of he former vow and ardent profession for she service press she to receive from he some undeniable proof of the vehemence and sincerity of he passion for which he would ask no reward 'till he have by long and faithful service convince she that he deserve it this proposal be so suitable to she present aim in the service of she country that she accept it and employ albert in such a manner as make she very serviceable to the king the latter end of the year 1666 he send she word by a special messenger that he would be with she at a day appoint at which time he reveal to she that cornelius de wit who with the rest of that family have a implacable hatred to the english nation and the house of orange have with de ruyter propose to the state the expedition abovemention this proposal concur with the advice which the dutch spy in england have give they of the total neglect of all naval preparation be well receive and be resolve to be put in execution as a thing neither dangerous nor difficult albert have communicate a secret of this importance and with such mark of truth that she have no room to doubt of it : as soon as the interview be at a end she dispatch a account of what she have discover to england -lrb- 2 -rrb- but we can not conclude mr behn 's gallantry at antwerp without be a little more particular as we find she attack by other lover and think she find mean to preserve she innocence yet the account that she herself give of she affair there be both humorous and entertaining in a letter to a friend she proceed thus ` my other lover be about twice albert 's age nay and bulk too tho ' albert be not the most barbary shape you have see you must know he by the name of van bruin and he be introduce to I by albert he kinsman and be oblige by he to furnish I in he absence with what money and other thing i should please to command or have occasion for this old fellow have not visit I often before i begin to be sensible of the influence of my eye upon this old piece of touchwood but he have not the confidence to tell I he love I and modesty you know be no common fault of he countryman he often insinuate that he know a man of wealth and substance though striken indeed in year and on that account not so agreeable as a younger man be passionately in love with I and desire to know whether my heart be so far engage that he friend should not entertain any hope i reply that i be surprize to hear a friend of albert 's make a interest in I for another and that if love be a passion i be any way sensible of it could never be for a old man and much to that purpose but all this would not do in a day or two i receive this eloquent epistle from he here mr behn insert a translation of van bruin 's letter which be write in french and in a most ridiculous stile tell she he have often strove to reveal to she the tempest of he heart and with he own mouth scale the wall of she affection but terrify with the strength of she fortification he conclude to make more regular approach to attack she at a farther distance and try first what a bombardment of letter would do whether these carcass of love throw into the sconce of she eye would break into the midst of she breast beat down the out-guard of she aversion and blow up the magazine of she cruelty that she might be bring to a capitulation and yield upon reasonable term he then consider she as a goodly ship under sail for the indy she hair be the pennant she fore-head the prow she eye the gun she nose the rudder he wish he could once see she keel above water and desire to be she pilot to steer thro ' the cape of good-hope to the indy of love we ingenious poetess send he a suitable answer to this truly ridiculous and dutchman like epistle she rally he for set out in so unprofitable a voyage as love and humorously reckon up the expence of the voyage as ribbon and hood for she pennant diamond ring locket and pearl-necklace for she gun of offence and defense silk holland lawn cambric & c for she rigging mr behn tell we she divert herself with van bruin in albert 's absence till he begin to assume and grow troublesome to she by he address so that to rid himself of he she be force to disclose the whole affair to albert who be so enraged that he threaten the death of he rival but he be pacify by he mistress and content to upbraid the other for he treachery and forbid he the house but this say mr behn ` produce a very ridiculous scene for ` my nestorian lover would not give ground to albert but be as high as he challenge he to sniker-snee for I and a thousand thing as comical in short nothing but my positive command could satisfy he and on that he promise no more to trouble I sure as he think himself of I he be thunder-struck when he hear I not only forbid he the house but ridicule all he address to he rival albert with a countenance full of despair he go away not only from my lodgings but the next day from antwerp unable to stay in a place where he have meet so dreadful a defeat ' the authoress of she life have give we a farther account of she affair with vander albert in which she contrived to preserve she honor without injure she gratitude there be a woman at antwerp who have often give astræa warning of albert 's fickleness and inconstancy assure she he never love after enjoyment and sometimes change even before he have that pretence of which she herself be a instance albert have marry she and desert she on the wedding-night we poetess take the opportunity of she acquaintance with this lady to put a honest trick upon she lover and at the same time do justice to a injured woman accordingly she make a appointment with albert and contrived that the lady whose name be catalina should meet he in she stead the plot succeed and catalina infinitely pleased with the adventure appoint the next night and the follow till at last he discover the cheat and resolve to gratify both he love and resentment by enjoy astæa even against she will to this purpose he bribe a elderly gentlewoman whom mr behn keep out of charity to put he to bed drest in she night-cloath in she place when astræa be pass the evening in a merchant 's house in the town the merchant 's son and he two daughter wait on astræa home and to conclude the evening 's mirth with a frolick the young gentleman propose go to bed to the old woman and that they should all come in with candle and surprize they together as it be agree so they do but no sooner be the young spark put to bed but he find himself accost with ardor and a man 's voice say ` have i now catch thee thou malicious charmer now i 'll not let thee go till thou hast do I justice for all the wrong thou hast offer my deal love ' the rest of the company be extremely surprize to find albert in astraea 's bed instead of the old woman and albert no less surprize to find the young spark instead of astræa in the conclusion the old woman be discard and albert 's fury at he

submission to the authority of these writer the charge be ill-founded which will appear from the specimen upon which dryden himself make she a compliment as to the latter i be afraid it can not be so

whom dryden have this very singular expression ` that he do not think that at the general resurrection she can be make to look more charming than now ' sir george dedicate this play to he royal mistress with the most courtly turn of compliment in this play he be say to have draw or to use the modern cant take off some of the cotemporary coxcomb and mr dryden in a epilogue to it have endeavor to remove the suspicion of personal satire and say that the character of flutter be mean to ridicule none in particular but the whole fraternity of finish fop the idolater of new fashion he word be true fop help nature 's work and go to school to file and finish god almighty 's fool : yet none sir fople he or he can call he be knight o'th ' shire and represent you all but this industry to avoid

course before have be unable to make any profit by he trade grow afterwards upon the public exhibition of he so industrious and notable that he draw a crowd of the best customer to he and become a very thriving tradesman whether the poet mean to display these character we can not now determine but it be certain the town 's ascribe they to some particular person be pay he a very high compliment and if it prove no more it at least demonstrate a close imitation of nature a beauty which constitute the greatest perfection of a comic poet we author it seem be addict to some gay extravagance such as gaming and a unlicensed indulgence in woman and wine which bring some satirical reflexion upon he gildon in he life of the dramatic poet say that upon marry a fortune he be knight the circumstance of it be these : he have by he gaming and extravagance so embarrassed he affair that he court a rich widow in order to retrieve they but she be a ambitious woman would not condescend to marry he unless he could make she a lady which he be oblige to do by the purchase of a knighthood and this appear in a consolatary epistle to captain julian from the duke of buckingham in which this match be reflect on we have no account of any issue he have by this lady but from the information of mr bowman we can say that he cohabit for some time with the celebrated mr barry the actress and have one daughter by she that he settle 5 or 6000 l on she but that she die young from the same intelligence it also appear that sir george be in he person a fair -lrb- 1 -rrb- slender genteel man but spoil he countenance with drinking and other habit of intemperance in he deportment he be very affable and courteous of a generous disposition which with he free lively and natural vein of write acquire he the general character of gentle george and easy etherege in respect of which quality we often find he compare to sir charle sedley he courtly and easy behavior so recommend he to the duchess of york that when on the accession of king jame ii she become queen she send he ambassador abroad gildon say to hamburgh but it be pretty evident that he be in that reign a minister at ratisbon at least from the year 1686 to the time he majesty left this kingdom if not later but it appear that he be there by he own letter write from thence to the earl of middleton after this last comedy we meet with no more he ever write for the stage however there be preserve some letter of he in prose publish among a collection of familiar letter by john earl of rochester two of which send to the duke of buckingham have particular merit both for the archness of the turn and the acuteness of the observation he give he lordship a humorous description of some of the german they excessive drunkenness they plodding stupidity and ostensive indelicacy he complain that he have no companion in that part of the world no sir charle sedley nor buckingham and what be still worse even deprive of the happiness of a mistress for the woman there he say be so coy and so narrowly watch by they relation that there be no possibility of accomplish a intrigue he mention however one monsieur hoffman who marry a french

otherwise have have and though he be not very considerable as a poet yet he be of great eminence as a actor mr cibber in he apology for he own life have mention he with the greatest respect and draw he character with strong touch of admiration after have delineate the theatrical excellence of kynaston sandford & c he thus speak of mountford ` of person he be tall well make fair and of a agreeable aspect he voice clear full and melodious in tragedy he be the most affect lover within my memory he address have a resistless recommendation from the very tone of he voice which give he word such softness that as dryden say -- ` like flake of feather would snow ` they melt as they fall all this he particularly verify in that scene of alexander where the hero throw himself at the foot of statira for pardon of he past infidelity there we see the great the tender the penitent the despair the transport and the amiable in the highest perfection in comedy he give the truest life to what we call the fine gentleman he spirit shine the brighter for be polish by decency in scene of gaiety he never break into the regard that be due to the presence of equal or superior character tho ' inferior actor play they he fill the stage not by elbow and cross it before other or disconcert they action but by surpass they in true and masterly touch of nature he never laugh at he own jest unless the point of he raillery upon another require it he have a particular talent in give life to bon mots and repartee the wit of the poet seem always to come from he extempore and sharpen into more wit from he brilliant manner of deliver it he have himself a good share of it or what be equal to it so lively a pleasantness of humor that when either of these fall into he hand upon the stage he wanton with they to the highest delight of he auditor the agreeable be so natural to he that even in that dissolute character of the rover he seem to wash off the guilt from vice and give it charm and merit for though it may be a reproach to the poet to draw such character not only unpunished but reward the actor may still be allow he due praise in he excellent performance and this be a distinction which when this comedy be act at whitehall king william 's queen mary be please to make in favor of mountford notwithstanding she disapprobation of the play which be heighten by the consideration of its have be write by a lady viz mr behn from whom more modesty might have be expect ` he have besides all this a variety in he genius which few capital actor have shewn or perhaps have think it any addition of they merit to arrive at he could entirely change himself could at once throw off the man of sense for the brisk vain rude lively coxcomb the false flashy pretender to wit and the dupe of he own sufficiency of this he give a delightful instance in the character of sparkish in wycherley 's country wife : in that of sir courtly nice by crown he excellence be still greater there he whole man voice mien and gesture be no longer mountford but another person there the insipid soft civility the elegant and formal mien the drawling delicacy of voice the stately flatness of he address and the empty eminence of he attitude be so nicely observe that have he not be a entire matter of nature have he not keep he judgment as it be a centinel upon himself not to admit the least likeness of what he use to be to enter into any part of he performance he could not possibly have so compleatly finish it ' mr cibber further observe that if some year after the death of mountford he himself have any success in those part he acknowledge the advantage he have receive from the just idea and strong impression from mountford 's act they ' ` have he be remember -lrb- say he -rrb- when i first attempt they my defect would have be more easily discover and consequently my favourable reception in they must have be very much and justly abate if it could be remembered how much he have the advantage of I in voice and person i could not here be suspect of a affected modesty or overvalue he excellence for he sing a clear counter-tenor and have a melodious warble throat which could not but set off the last scene of sir courtly with uncommon happiness which i alas could only struggle through with the faint excuse and real confidence of a fine singer under the imperfection of a feigned and scream treble which at least could only shew you what i would have do have nature be more favourable to I ' this be the amiable representation which mr cibber make of he old favorite and whose judgment in theatrical excellence have be ever indispute but this finish performer do not live to reap the advantage which would have arise from the great figure he make upon the stage he fall in the 33d year of he age by the hand of a assassin who cowardly murder he and slide from justice as we imagine it will not be unplease to the reader to be make acquaint with the most material circumstance relate to that affair we mail here insert they as they appear on the trial of lord mohun who be arraign for that murder and acquit by he peer lord mohun it be well know be a man of loose moral a rancorous spirit and in short reflect no honor on he title it be a true observation that the temper and disposition of a man may be more accurately know by the company he keep than by any other means of read the human heart : lord mohun have contract a great intimacy with one captain hill a man of scandalous moral and despicable life and be so fond of this fellow whom it seem nature have wonderfully form to be a cut throat that he enter into he scheme and become a party in promote he most criminal pleasure this murderer have long entertain a passion for mr bracegirdle so well know as a excellent actress and who die not many year ago that it would be superfluous to give a particular account of she he passion be reject with disdain by mr bracegirdle who do not think such a heart as he worth possess the contempt with which she use captain hill fire he resentment he value himself for be a gentleman and a officer in the army and think he have a right at the first onset to triumph over the heart of a actress but in this he find himself miserably mistaken : hill who could not bear the contempt shewn he by mr bracegirdle conceive that she aversion must proceed from have previously engage she heart to some more favored lover and though mr mountford be a married man he become jealous of he probably from no other reason than the respect with which he observe mr mountford treat she and they frequently play together in the same scene confirm in this suspicion he resolve to be revenge on mountford and as he could not possess mr bracegirdle by gentle means he determine to have recourse to violence and hire some ruffian to assist he in carry she off he chief accomplice in this scheme be lord mohun to whom he communicate he intention and who concur with he in it they appoint a evening for that purpose hire a number of soldier and a coach and go to the playhouse in order to find mrs bracegirdle but she have no part in the play of that night do not come to the house they then get intelligence that she be go with she mother to sup at one mr page 's in drury-lane thither they go and fix they post in expectation of mr bracegirdle 's come out when they intend to have execute they scheme against she she at last come out accompany with she mother and mr page : the two adventurer make a sign to they hire bravo 's who lay they hand on mr bracegirdle : but she mother who throw she arm round she waist prevent they from thrust she immediately into the coach and mr page gain time to call assistance they attempt be frustrated and mrs bracegirdle she mother and mr page be safely convey to she own house in howard-street in the strand lord mohnn and hill enrage at this disappointment resolve since they be unsuccessful in one part of they design they would yet attempt another and that night vow revenge against mr mountford they go to the street where mr mountford live and there lay in wait for he : old mr bracegirdle and another gentlewoman who have hear they vow revenge against mr mountford send to he house to desire he wife to let he know he danger and to warn he not to come home that night but unluckily no messenger mr mountford send be able to find he : captain hill and lord mohun parade in the street with they sword draw and when the watch make enquiry into the cause of this lord mohun answer that he be a peer of the realm and dare they to touch he at they peril the night-officer be intimidate at this threat leave they unmolested and go they round towards midnight mr mountford go home to he own house be salute in a very friendly manner by lord mohun and as he lordship seem to carry no mark of resentment in he behavior he use the freedom to ask he how he come there at that time of night to which he lordship reply by ask if he have not hear the affair of the woman mountford ask what woman to which he answer mr bracegirdle i hope say he my lord you do not encourage mr hill in he attempt upon mr bracegirdle which however be no concern of mine when he utter these word hill behind he back give he some desperate blow on he head and before mr mountford have time to draw and stand on he defense he basely run he thro ' the body and make he escape the alarm of murder be give the constable seize lord mohun who upon hear that hill have escape express great satisfaction and say he do not care if he be hang for he : when the evidence be examine at hick 's - hall one mr bencroft who attend mr mountford swear that mr mountford declare to he as a die man that while he be talk to lord mohun hill strike he with he left hand and with he right hand run he thro ' the body before he have time to draw he sword thus fall the unfortunate mountford by the hand of a assassin without have give he any provocation save that which he own jealousy have raise and which could not reasonably be imputed to mountford as a crime lord mohun as we have already observe be try and acquit by he peer as it do not appear that he immediately assist hill in perpetrate the murder or that they have concerted it before for tho ' they be hear to vow revenge against mountford the word murther be never mention it seem abundantly clear that lord

espouse the opposite interest be dispossessed of he place of poet laureat and mr shadwell succeed he in it which employment he possess till he death mr shadwell have be illustrious for nothing so much

which they think proper however to refuse we know not for what reason -- the poet indeed have assign one whether true or false be immaterial but it may serve to shew he humor for the act this comedy -lrb- say he -rrb- those who have the government of the stage have they humor and would be intreat and i have mine and will not entreat they and be all dramatic writer of my mind they should wear they old play thread-bare er ' e they should have any new till they better understand they own interest and how to distinguish between good and bad ' this anger of mr flecknoe 's at the player for refuse the piece bear some resemblance to that of baye when the player go to dinner without he leave ` how be the player go to dinner if they be i will make they know what it be to injure a person who do

which mr flecknoe stile the people and call they judge without judgment for want of its be rightly represent to they he own it want much of the ornament of the stage but that he say by a lively imagination may be easily supply ` to the same purpose he speak of he damoiselles à la mode : that together with the person represent he have set down the comedian he have design should represent they that the reader might have half the pleasure of see it act and a lively imagination might have the pleasure of it all entire 5 the marriage of oceanus and britannium a masque we author 's other work

author 's work in prose and verse be own would without dispute thro ' all the realm of nonsense absolute we can not be certain in what year mr flecknoe die : dryden 's satire have perhaps render he so

of tickermish in northamptonshire and bear at aldwincle near oundle 1631 -lrb- 1 -rrb- he have he education in grammar learning at westminster-school under the famous dr busby and be from thence elect in 1650 a scholar of trinity-college in cambridge we have no account of any extraordinary indication of genius give by this great poet while in he earlier day and he be one instance how little regard be to be pay to the figure a boy make at school : mr dryden be turn of thirty before he introduce any play upon the stage and he first call the wild gallant meet with a very indifferent reception so that if he have not be impel by the force of genius and propension he have never again attempt the stage : a circumstance which the lover of dramatic poetry must ever have regret as they would in this case have be deprive of one of the greatest ornament that ever adorn the profession the year before he leave the university he write a poem on the death of lord hasting a performance say some of he critic very unworthy of himself and of the astonishing genius he afterwards discover that mr dryden have at this time no fixed principle either in religion or politics be abundantly evident from he heroic stanza on oliver cromwel write after he funeral 1658 and immediately upon the restoration he publish astræa redux a poem on the happy restoration of charle the iid and the same year he panegyric to the king on he coronation : in the former of these piece a remarkable distich have expo would we poet to the ridicule of the wit a horrid stillness first invade the ear and in that silence we the tempest hear which it must be own be downright nonsense and a contradiction in term : amongst other captain radcliff have ridicule this blunder in the follow line of he news from hell laureat who be both learn would and florid be damn would long since for silence horrid : nor have there be such clutter make but that he silence do invade invade and so it might that be clear but what do it invade a ear in 1662 he address a poem to the lord chancellor hyde present on new-year 's - day and the same year publish a satire on the dutch he next piece be he annus mirabili or the year of wonder 1668 a historical poem which celebrate the duke of york 's victory over the dutch in the same year mr dryden succeed sir william davenant as poet laureat and be also make historiographer to he majesty and that year publish he essay on dramatic poetry address to charle earl of dorset and middlesex mr dryden tell he patron that the write this essay serve as a amusement to he in the country when he be drive from town by the violence of the plague which then rage in london and he divert himself with think on the theater as lover do by ruminate on they absent mistress : he there justify the method of write play in verse but confess that he have quit the practice because he find it troublesome and slow -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the preface we be inform that the drift of this discourse be to vindicate the honor of the english writer from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the french to they langbaine have injuriously treat mr dryden on account of he dramatic performance and charge he as a licentious plagiary the truth be we author as a dramatist be less eminent than in any other sphere of poetry but with all he fault he be even in that respect the most eminent of he time the critic have remark that as to tragedy he seldom touch the passion but deal rather in pompous language poetical flight and description and too frequently make he character speak better than they have occasion or ought to do when they sphere in the drama be consider : and it be peculiar to dryden -lrb- say mr addison -rrb- to make he personage as wise witty elegant and polite as himself that he could not so intimately affect the tender passion be certain for we find no play of he in which we be much disposed to weep and we be so often inchant with beautiful description and noble flight of fancy that we forget the business of the play and be only attentive to the poet while the character sleep mr gildon observe in he law of poetry that when it be recommend to mr dryden to turn he thought to a translation of euripide rather than of homer he confess that he have no relish for that poet who be a great master of tragic simplicity mr gildon further observe as a confirmation that dryden 's taste for tragedy be not of the genuine sort that he constantly express great contempt for otway who be universally allow to have succeed very happily in affect the tender passion : yet mr dryden in he preface to the translation of m du fresnoy speak more favourably of otway and after mention these instance gildon ascribe this taste in dryden to he have read many french romance -- the truth be if a poet would affect the heart he must not exceed nature too much nor color too high distressful circumstance short speech and pathetic observation never fail to move infinitely beyond the highest rant or long declamation in tragedy : the simplicity of the drama be otway 's peculiar excellence a living poet observe that from otway to we own time from bard to bard the frigid caution creep and declamation roar would while passion sleep mr dryden seem to be sensible that he be not bear to write comedy for say he ' i want that gaiety of humor which be require in it my conversation be slow and dull my humor saturnine and reserve in short i be none of those who endeavor to break jest in company and make repartee so that those who decry my comedy do I no injury except it be in point of profit : reputation in they be the last thing to which i shall pretend -lrb- 3 -rrb- ' this ingenuous confession of inability one would imagine be sufficient to silence the clamor of the critic against mr dryden in that particular but however true it may be that dryden do not succeed to any degree in comedy i shall endeavor to support my assertion that in tragedy with all he fault he be still the most excellent of he time the end of tragedy be to instruct the mind as well as move the passion and where there be no shine sentiment the mind may be affect but not improve and however prevalent the passion of grief may be over the heart of man it be certain that he may feel distress in the acutest manner and not be much the wiser for it the tragedy of otway lee and southern be irresistibly move but they convey not such grand sentiment and they language be far from be so poetical as dryden 's now if one dramatic poet write to move and another to enchant and instruct as instruction be of greater consequence than be agitate it follow naturally that the latter be the most excellent writer and possess the greatest genius but perhaps we poet would have write better in both kind of the drama have not the necessity of he circumstance oblige he to comply with the popular taste he himself in he dedication to the spanish fryar insinuate as much ' i remember say he some verse of my own maximin and almanzor which cry vengeance upon I for they extravagance all that i can say for those passage which be i hope not many be that i know they be bad when i write they but i repent of they amongst my sin and if any of they fellow intrude by chance into my present writings i draw a veil over all these dalilah of the theater and be resolve i will settle myself no reputation upon the applause of fool ` tis not that i be mortified to all ambition but i scorn as much to take it from half witted judge as i should to raise a estate by cheating of bubble neither do i discommend the lofty stile in tragedy which be naturally pompous and magnificent but nothing be truely sublime that be not just and proper ' he say in another place ` that he spanish fryar be give to the people and that he never write any thing in the dramatic way to please himself but he all for love ' in 1671 mr dryden be publicly ridicule on the stage in the duke of buckingham 's comedy cull the rehearsal under the character of bay : this character we be inform in the key to the rehearsal be originally intend for sir robert howard under the name of bilboa but the representation be put a stop to by the break out of the plague in 1665 it be lay by for several year and not exhibit on the stage till 1671 in which interval mr dryden be advance to the laurel the noble author change the name of he poet from bilboa to bay and make great alteration in he play in order to ridicule several dramatic performance that appear since the first write it those of mr dryden which fall under he grace 's lash be the wild gallant tyrannic love the conquest of granada marriage a la-mode and love in a nunnery : whatever be extravagant or too warmly express or any way unnatural the author have ridicule by parody mr dryden affect to despise the satire level at he in the rehearsal as appear from he dedication of the translation of juvenal and persius where speaking of the many lampoon and libel that have be write against he he say ' i answer not to the rehearsal because i know the author sit to himself when he draw the picture and be the very bay of he own farce because also i know my betters be more concerned than i be in that satire and lastly because mr smith and mr johnson the main pillar of it be two such languish gentleman in they conversation that i could liken they to nothing but they own relation those noble character of man of wit and pleasure about town ' in 1679 come out a essay on satire say to be write jointly by mr dryden and the earl of mulgrave this piece which be hand about in manuscript contain reflexion on the duchess of portsmouth and the earl of rochester who suspect as wood say mr dryden to be the author hire three ruffian to cudgel he in will 's coffee-house at eight o'clock at night this short anecdote i think can not be tell without indignation it prove rochester be a malicious coward and like other coward cruel and insolent he foul be incapable of any thing that approach towards generosity and when he resentment be heat he pursue revenge and retain the most lasting hatred he have always entertain a prejudice against dryden from no other motive than envy dryden 's play meet with success and this be enough to fire the resentment of rochester who be naturally envious in order to hurt the character and shake the interest of this noble poet he recommend crown a obscure man to write a masque for the court which be dryden 's province as poet-laureat to perform crown in this succeed but soon after when he play call the conquest of jerusalem meet with such extravagant applause rochester jealous of he new favorite not only abandon he but commence from that moment he enemy the other person against whom this satire be level be not superior in virtue to the former and all the nation over two better subject for satire could not have be find than lord rochester and the duchess of portsmouth as for rochester he have not genius enough to enter the list with dryden so he fall upon another method of revenge and meanly hire bravo to assault he in 1680 come out a translation of ovid 's epistle in english verse by several hand two of which be translate by mr dryden who also write the preface in the year follow we author publish absalom and achitophel it be first print without he name and be a severe satire against the contriver and abettor of the opposition against king charle ii in the same year that absalom and achitophel be publish the medal a satire be likewise give to the public this piece be aim against sedition and be occasion by the striking of a medal on account of the indictment against the earl of shaftsbury for high treason be find ignoramus by the grand jury at the old bailey November 1681 : for which the whig party make great rejoicing by ringing of bell bonfire & c in all part of london the poem be introduce with a very satirical epistle to the whig in which the author say ' i have one favor to desire you at parting that when you think of answer this poem you would employ the same pen against it who have combate with so much success against absalom and achitophel for then you may assure yourselve of a clear victory without the least reply rail at I abundantly and not break a custom to do it with wit by this method you will gain a considerable point which be wholly to wave the answer of my argument if god have not bless you with the talent of rhime make use of my poor stock and welcome let you verse run upon my foot and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockhead reduce to the last extremity of sense turn my own line against I and in utter despair of my own satire make I satirize myself ' the whole poem be a severe invective against the earl of shaftsbury who be uncle to that earl who write the characteristic mr elkanah settle write a answer to this poem entitle the medal reverse however contemptible settle be as a poet yet such be the prevalence of party at that time that for some year he be dryden 's rival on the stage in 1682 come out he religio laicus or a layman 's faith this piece be intend as a defense of reveal religion and the excellency and authority of the scripture as the only rule of faith and manners against deist papist and presbyterian he acquaint we in the preface that it be write for a ingenious young gentleman he friend upon he translation of father simon 's critical history of the old testament and that the stile of it be epistolary in 1684 he publish a translation of m maimbourg 's history of the league in which he be employ by the command of king charle ii on account of the plain parallel between the trouble of france and those of great britain upon the death of charle ii he write he threnodium augustali a poem sacred to the happy memory of that prince soon after the accession of jame ii we author turn roman catholic and by this extraordinary step draw upon himself abundance of ridicule from wit of the opposite faction and in 1689 he write a defense of the papers write by the late king of bless memory find in he strong box mr dryden in the abovementioned piece take occasion to vindicate the authority of the catholic church in decree matter of faith upon this principle that the church be more visible than the scripture because the scripture be see by the church and to abuse the reformation in england which he affirm be erect on the foundation of lust sacrilege and usurpation dr stillingfleet hereupon answer mr dryden and treat he with some severity another author affirm that mr dryden 's tract be very light in some place ridiculous and observe that he talent lay towards controversy no more in prose than by the hind and panther it appear to do in verse this poem of the hind and panther be a direct defense of the romish church in a dialogue between a hind which represent the church of rome and a panther which support the character of the church of england the first part of this poem consist most in general character and narration which say he ' i have endeavor to raise and give it the majestic turn of heroic poetry the second be matter of dispute and chiefly concern church authority i be oblige to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly i could yet not wholly neglect the number though i have not frequent occasion for the magnificence of verse the third which have more of the nature of domestic conversation be or ought to be more free and familiar than the two former there be in it two episode or fable which be interweave with the main design so that they be properly part of it though they be also distinct story of themselves in both of these i have make use of the common place of satire whether true or false which be urge by the member of the one church against the other ' mr dryden speak of he own conversion in the follow term but gracious god how well dost thou provide for err judgment a unerring guide thy throne be darkness in th ' abyss of light a blaze of glory that forbid the sight o teach I to believe thee thus conceal and search no further than thyself reveal but she alone for my director take whom thou hast promis would never to forsake my thoughtless youth be wing would with vain desire my manhood long mislead by wand ` ring fire follow would false light and when they glimpse be go my pride strike out new sparkle of she own such be i such by nature still i be be thine the glory and be mine the shame good life be now my talk my doubt be do -lrb- 4 -rrb- this poem be attack by mr charle montague afterwards earl of hallifax and mr matthew prior who join in write the hind and panther transverse to the country mouse and city mouse lond 1678 4to in the preface to which the author observe ` that mr dryden 's poem naturally fall into ridicule and that in this burlesque nothing be represent monstrous and unnatural that be not equally so in the original ' they afterwards remark that they have this comfort under the severity of mr dryden 's satire to see he ability equally lessen with he opinion of they and that he could not be a fit champion against the panther till he have lay aside he judgment mr dryden be suppose to have be engage in translate m varilla 's history of heresy but to have drop that design this we learn from a passage in burnet 's reflexion on the ninth book of the first volume of m varilla 's history be a reply to he answer i shall here give the picture the dr have draw of this noble poet which be like a great many of the doctor 's other character rather exhibit to please himself than accord to the true resemblance the doctor say ' i have be inform from england that a gentleman who be famous both for poetry and several other thing have spend three month in translate mr varilla 's history but as soon as my reflexion appear he discontinue he labor find the credit of he author be go now if he think it be recover by he answer he will perhaps go on with he translation but this may be for ought i know as good a entertainment for he as the conversation he have set on foot between the hind and panther and all the rest of the animal for whom m varilla may serve well enough as a author and this history and that poem be such extraordinary thing of they kind that it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem become the translator of the worst history that the age have produce if he grace and he wit improve so proportionably we shall hardly find that he have gain much by the change he have make from have no religion to chuse one of the worst it be true he have somewhat to sink from in matter of wit but as for he moral it be scarce possible for he to grow a worse man than he be he have lately wreak he malice on I for spoil he three month labor but in it he have do I all the honor a man can receive from he which be to be rail at by he if i have ill-nature enough to prompt I to wish a very bad wish for he it should be that he would go and finish he translation by that it will appear whether the english nation which be the most competent judge of this matter have upon see this debate pronounce in m varilla 's favor or I it be true mr dryden will suffer a little by it but at least it will serve to keep he in from other extravagancy and if he gain little honor by this work yet he can not lose so much by it as he have do by he last employment ' when the revolution be compleat mr dryden have turn papist become disqualify for hold he place and be accordingly dispossessed of it and it be confer on a man to whom he have a confirm aversion in consequence whereof he write a satire against he call mac flecknoe which be one of the severest and best write satire in we language mr richard flecknoe the new laureat with whose name it be inscribe be a very indifferent poet of those time or rather as mr dryden express it and as we have already quote in flecknoe 's life in prose and verse be own would without dispute thro ' all the realm of nonsense absolute this poem furnish the hint to mr pope to write he dunciad and it must be own the latter have be more happy in the execution of he design as have more leisure for the performance but in dryden 's mac flecknoe there be some line so extremely pungent that i be not quite certain if pope have any where exceed they in the year wherein he be deprive of the laurel he publish the life of st franci xavier translate from the french of father dominic bouchor in 1693 come out a translation of juvenal and persius in which the first third sixth tenth and fifteenth satire of juvenal and persius entire be do by mr dryden who prefix a long and ingenious discourse by way of dedication to the earl of dorset in this address we author take occasion a while to drop he reflexion on juvenal and to lay before he lordship a plan for a epic poem : he observe that he genius never much inclined he to the stage and that he write for it rather from necessity than inclination he complain that he circumstance be such as not to suffer he to pursue the bent of he own genius and then lay down a plan upon which a epic poem might be write : to which say he i be more inclined whether the plan propose be faulty or no we be not at present to consider one thing be certain a man of mr dryden 's genius would have cover by the rapidity of the action the art of the design and the beauty of the poetry whatever might have be defective in the plan and produce a work which have be the boast of the nation we can not help regret on this occasion that dryden 's fortune be not easy enough to enable he with convenience and leisure to pursue a work that might have prove a honor to himself and reflect a portion thereof on all who should have appear he encourager on this occasion in 1695 mr dryden publish a translation in prose of du fresnoy 's art of painting with a preface contain a parallel between painting and poetry mr pope have address a copy of verse to mr jerva in praise of dryden 's translation in 1697 he translation of virgil 's work come out this translation have pass thro ' many edition and of all the attempt which have be make to render virgil into english the critic i think have allow that dryden -lrb- 5 -rrb- best succeed : notwithstanding as he himself say when he begin it he be past the grand climacteric so little influence it seem age have over he that he retain he judgment and fire in full force to the last mr pope in he preface to homer say if dryden have live to finish what he begin of homer he -lrb- mr pope -rrb- would not have attempt it after he ` no more say he than i would he virgil he version of whom -lrb- notwithstanding some human error -rrb- be the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language ' dr trap charge mr dryden with grossly mistake he author 's sense in many place with add or retrench as he turn be best serve with either and with be least a translator where he shine most as a poet whereas it be a just rule lay down by lord roscommon that a translator in regard to he author should fall as he fall and as he rise rise mr dryden he tell we frequently act the very reverse of this precept of which he produce some instance and remark in general that the first six book of the æneis which be the best and most perfect in the original be the least so in the translation dr trap 's remark may possibly be true but in this he be a instance how easy it be to discover fault in other man 's work and how difficult to avoid they in we own dr trap 's translation be close and convey the author 's meaning literally so consequently may be fitter for a school-boy but man of riper judgment and superior taste will hardly approve it if dryden 's be the most spirited of any translation trap 's be the dullest that ever be write which prove that none but a good poet be fit to translate the work of a good poet besides the original piece and translation hitherto mention mr dryden write many other publish in six volume of miscellany and in other collection they consist of translation from the greek and latin poet epistle to several person prologue and epilogue to several play elegy epitaph and song he last work be he fable ancient and modern translate into verse from homer ovid boccace and chaucer to this work which be perhaps one of he most imperfect be prefix by way of preface a critical account of the author from whom the fable be translate among the original piece the ode to st cecilium 's day be justly esteem one of the most elevated in any language it be impossible for a poet to read this without be fill with that sort of enthusiasm which be peculiar to the inspired tribe and which dryden largely feel when he compose it the turn of the verse be noble the transition surprize the language and sentiment just natural and heighten we can not be too lavish in praise of this ode : have dryden never write any thing besides he name have be immortal mr pope have the follow beautiful line in its praise -lrb- 6 -rrb- hear how timotheus vary lay surprize and bid alternate passion fall and rise while at each change the son of lybian jove now burn with glory and then melt with love : now he fierce eye with sparkling fury glow now sigh steal out and tear begin to flow persian and greek like turn of nature find and the world 's victor flood subdue by sound : the power of music all we heart allow and what timotheus be be dryden now as to we author 's performance in prose besides he dedication and preface and controversial writings they consist of the life of plutarch and lucian prefix to the translation of those author by several hand the life of polybius before the translation of that historian by sir henry sheer and the preface to the dialogue concern woman by william walsh esquire before we give a account of the dramatic work of dryden it will be proper here to insert a story concern he from the life of congreve by charle wilson esquire which that

intend for mr rowe in this line beneath a rude and nameless stone he lie in a note upon which we be inform that the tomb of mr dryden be erect upon this hint by sheffield duke of buckingham to which be originally intend this epitaph this sheffield raise -- the sacred dust below be dryden once the rest who do not know which be since change into the plain inscription now upon it viz j dryden natus aug 9 1631 mortus maius 1 1701 johanne sheffield dux buckinghamienfi secit the character of mr dryden have be draw by various hand some have do it in a favourable other in a opposite manner the bishop of sarum in the history of he own time say that the stage be defile beyond all example ` dryden the great master of dramatic poetry be a monster of immodesty and impurity of all sort ' -lrb- 8 -rrb- the late lord lansdown take upon himself to vindicate mr dryden 's character from this severe imputation which be again answer and apology for it by mr burnet the bishop 's son but not to dwell on these controversy about he character let we hear what mr congreve say in the dedication of dryden 's work to the duke of newcastle : congreve know he intimately and as he could have no motive to deceive the world in that particular and be a man of untainted moral none can suspect he authority and by he account we shall see that dryden be indeed as amiable in private life as a man as he be illustrious in the eye of the public as a poet mr dryden -lrb- say congreve -rrb- ` have personal quality to challenge love and esteem from all who be truly acquaint with he he be of a nature exceed humane and compassionate easily forgiving injury and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with those who have offend he -- he friendship where he profess it go much beyond he profession -- as he reading have be very extensive so be he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing he have read he be not more possess of knowledge than he be communicative of it but then he communication of it be by no means pedantic or impose upon the conversation but just such and go so far as by the natural turn of the discourse in which he be engage it be necessarily prompt or require he be extremely ready and gentle in the correction of the error of any writer who think fit to consult he and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of other in respect of he own oversight or mistake he be of a very easy i may say of very please access but something slow and as it be dissident in he advance to other he have something in he nature that abhor intrusion in any society whatsoever and indeed it be to be regret that he be rather blameable on the other extreme he be of all man i ever know the most modest and the most easy to be discountenance in he approach either to he superior or he equal -- as to he writings -- may venture to say in general term that no man have write in we language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well another thing i may say be very peculiar to he which be that he part do not decline with he year but that he be a improve writer to the last even to near 70 year of age improve even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness he ode on st cecilium 's day and he fable he latest performance he be equally excellent in verse and prose : he prose have all the clearness imaginable without deviate to the language or diction of poetry and i have hear he frequently own with pleasure that if he have any talent for write prose it be owe to he frequently have read the writings of the great archbishop tillotson in he poem he diction be wherever he subject require it so sublime and so truly poetical that it be essence like that of pure gold can not be destroy take he verse and divest they of they rhime disjoint they of they number transpose they expression make what arrangement or disposition you please in he word yet shall there eternally be poetry and something which will be find incapable of be reduce to absolute prose what he have do in any one species or distinct kind of write would have be sufficient to have acquire he a very great name if he have write nothing but he preface or nothing but he song or he prologue each of they would have entitle he to the preference and distinction of excel in its kind ' besides mr dryden 's numerous other performance we find he the author of

buckhurst buckingham and some few more whom i omit to name approve my sense i count they censure same it happen by sir charle in respect of the king as be say of the famous cardinal richlieu viz that they who recommend he to the royal savor thereby supplant themselves and afterwards envy he but with this difference between the cardinal and sir charle that the latter be never ungrateful when he have a taste of the court as the king never would part with he so he never would part from the king and yet two thing prove particularly detrimental to he in it first he estate so far from be improve be diminish and secondly he moral be debauch the king delighted in he conversation and he be the dearer to he majesty on this account that he never ask a favor whereas some other courtier by they bold importunity exhaust that prince 's treasure who could not deny a man who crave tho ' he hate he forwardness nor could remember the silent indigence of he friend tho ' he applaud the modesty of it he

appoint sir charle desire mr henry killegrew and another gentleman to apply to he majesty to have the fine remit which they undertake to do but in place of supplicate for it they represent sir charle 's frolic rather in a aggravating light and not a farthing be abate after this affair sir charle 's mind take a more serious turn and he begin to apply himself to the study of politics by which he might be of some service to he country he be choose say wood a recruiter of that long parliament which begin at westminster the 8th of may 1661 to serve for new romney in kent and sit in three succeed

of he stile the politeness of he expression in he bellamira and even those part of it which be purely translation be very delightful and engaging to the reader lord rochester in he imitation of the 10th satire of the first book of horace have the follow verse in he commendation sedley have that prevail gentle art that can with a resistless charm impart the loosest wish to the chastest heart : raise such a conflict kindle such a fire betwixt decline virtue and desire that the poor vanquish would maid dissolve away in dream all night in sigh and tear all day before we give a account of we author 's work it will not be amiss to observe that he be extremely active in effect the revolution which be think the more extraordinary as he have receive favor from king jame ii that prince it seem have fall in love with a daughter of sir charle 's who be not very handsome for jame be remarkable for dedicate he affection to woman who be not great beauty in consequence of he intrigue with she and in order to give she greater lustre in life he create miss sedley countess of dorchester this honor so far from please greatly shocked sir charle however libertine himself have be yet he could not bear the thought of he daughter 's dishonor and with regard to this she exaltation he only consider it as render she more conspicuously infamous he therefore conceive a hatred to jame and readily join to dispossess he of he throne and dominion be ask one day why he appear so warm against the king who have create he daughter a countess it be from a principle of gratitude i be so warm return sir

's witchcraft it be a art too successful in those day to propagate the immorality of the time but it must be own that in point of chastity he excel dorset and rochester who as they conceive lewdly write in plain english and do not give themselves any trouble to wrap up they ribbaldry in a dress tollerably decent but if sedley be the more chaste i know not if he be the less pernicious writer : for that pill which be gilded will be swallow more readily and with less reluctance than if tender in its own disgustful color sedley insinuate gently into the heart without give any alarm but be no less fraught with poison than be those whose deformity bespeak they mischief it would be tedious to enumerate here all the poem of sir charle sedley let it suffice to say that they be print in two

part of north america which be call nova scotium the vivacity of he genius make he soon grow impatient of the gloomy education he receive in that country which he therefore quit in order to seek he fortune in england but it be he fate upon he first arrival here to engage in a employment more formal if possible than he american education mr denni in he letter vol i p 48 have give we the best account of this poet and upon he authority the above and the succeed circumstance be related he necessity when he first arrive in england be extremely urgent and he be oblige to become a gentleman usher to a old independent lady but he soon grow as weary of that precise office as he have do before of the discipline of nova scotium one would imagine that a education such as this would be but a indifferent preparative for a man to become a polite author but such be the irresistable force of genius that neither this nor he poverty which be very deplorable could suppress he ambition : aspire to reputation and distinction rather than to fortune and power he writings soon make he know to the court and town yet it be neither to the savor of the court nor to that of the earl of rochester that he be indebted to the nomination the king make of he for the write the masque of calypso but to the malice of that noble lord who design by that preference to mortify mr dryden upon the break out of the two party after the pretended discovery of the popish plot the favor he be in at court and the gaiety of he temper which incline he to join with the fashion engage he to embrace the tory party about that time he write the city politick in order to satirize and expose the whig : a comedy not without wit and spirit and which have obtain the approbation of those of contrary principle which be the highest evidence of merit but after it be ready for the stage he meet with great embarrassment in get it act bennet lord arlington -lrb- who be then lord chamberlain be secretly in the cause of the whig who be at that time potent in parliament in order to support himself against the power of lord treasurer danby who be he declare enemy -rrb- use all he authority to suppress it one while it be prohibit on account of its be dangerous another while it be lay aside upon pretence of its be flat and insipid till mr crowne at last be force to have recourse to the king himself and engage he to lay he absolute command on the lord chamberlain to have it no longer delay this command he be please to give in he own person for charle ii love comedy above all other amusement except one which be both more expensive and less innocent and besides have a very high opinion of mr crowne 's ability while he be thus in favor with the king and court mr denni declare he have more than once hear he say that though he have a sincere affection for the king he have yet a mortal hatred to the court the promise of a sum of money make he sometimes appear there to sollicit the payment of it but as soon as he receive the sum he vanish and for a long time never approach it it be at the latter end of king charle 's reign that mr crowne tired with the fatigue of write shock with the uncertainty of theatrical success and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of those numerous enemy he have make by he city politics immediately address the king himself and desire he majesty to establish he in some office that might be a security to he for life : the king answer he should be provide for but add that he would first see another comedy mr crowne endeavor to excuse himself by tell the king he plot slowly and awkwardly he majesty reply that he would help he to a plot and so put in he hand the spanish comedy call non poder esser mr crowne be oblige immediately to go to work upon it but after he have write three act of it find to he surprize that the spanish play have some time before be translate and act and damned under the title of tarugo 's wiles or the coffee-house : yet support by the king 's command he go briskly on and finish it mr crowne who have once before oblige the commonwealth of taste with a very agreeable comedy in he city politics yet in sir courtly nice go far beyond it and very much surpass himself for though there be something in the part of crack which border upon farce the spanish author alone must answer for that : for mr crowne could not omit the part of crack that be of tarugo and the spanish farce depend upon it without a downright affront to the king who have give he the play for he ground-work all that be of english growth in sir courtly nice be admirable for though it have neither the fine design of ben johnson nor the masculine satire of wycherley nor the grace delicacy and courtly air of etherege yet be the dialogue lively and spirited attractively diversified and adapt to the several character four of these character be entirely new yet general and important draw truly and graphically and artfully oppose to each other surly to sir courtly and hot-head to testimony : those extreme of behavior the one of which be the grievance and the other the plague of society and conversation excessive ceremony on the one side and on the other rudeness and brutality be finely expose in surly and sir courtly : those division and animosity in the two great party of england which have so long disturb the public quiet and undermine the general interest be happily represent and ridicule in testimony and hot-head mr denni speaking of this comedy say ` that though he have more than twenty time read it yet it still grow upon he and he deliver it as he opinion that the greatest comic poet who ever live in any age might have be proud to have be the author of it ' the play be now just ready to appear to the world every one that have see it rehearse be highly please with it all who have hear of it conceive great expectation and mr crowne be delighted with the flattering hope of be make happy for the remain part of he life by the performance of the king 's promise : but upon the very last day of the rehearsal he meet underhill come from the playhouse as he himself be go towards it upon which the poet reprimand the player for neglect so considerable a part as he have in the comedy and on a day of so much consequence as the very last of the rehearsal oh lord say underhill we be all undo how say crowne be the playhouse on fire the whole nation reply the player will quickly be so for the king be dead at the hearing of which dismal word the author be throw almost into distraction for he who the moment before be ravish with the thought of the pleasure he be about to give the king and the favor which he be afterwards to receive from he this moment find to he unspeakable sorrow that he royal patron be go for ever and with he all he hope the king indeed revive from this apoplectic fit but three day after die and mr crowne by he death be replunge into the deepest melancholly thus far mr denni have trace the life of crowne in the same letter he promise a further account of he upon another occasion which it seem never occur for we have not be able to find that he have any where else mention we author the king 's death have put a period to mr crowne 's expectation of court-favour -lrb- for the reign of he successor be too much hurry with party design to admit of any leisure to reward poetical merit though the prince himself with all he error about he be a man of taste and have a very quick discernment of the power of genius -rrb- he no doubt have recourse to write play again for bread and support himself the best way he could by he wit the most unpleasing and precarious manner of life to which any man can be expose we can not be absolutely certain when mr crowne die mr coxeter in he note say he be alive in the year 1703 and as he must then have be much advance in year in all probability he do not long survive it he be the author of 17 play 1 juliana or the princess of poland a tragi-comedy act

to all you lady now at land we man at sea indite but first would have you understand how hard it be to write the muse now and neptune too we must implore to write to you with a fa la la la la ii for tho ' the muse should prove kind and fill we empty brain yet if rough neptune rouze the wind to wave the azure main we paper pen and ink and we roll up and down we ship at sea with a la fa & c iii

with a fa & c v should foggy opdam chance to know we sad and dismal story the dutch would scorn so weak a foe and quit they fort at goree : for what resistance can they find from man who have leave they heart behind with a fa & c vi let wind and weather do its worst be you to we but kind let dutchmen vapor spaniard curse no sorrow we shall find ` tis then no matter how thing go or who be we

to rouse the gallery or to rant with any success besides he be defective in point of assurance nor could ever enough overcome he natural timidity he more excellent talent however might perhaps have continue the player at dublin and lose the poet at london but for a accident which be likely to turn a feigned tragedy into a real one : the story be this mr farquhar be extremely beloved in ireland

something better should offer but he resolution be soon break by a accident be to play the part of guyomar in dryden 's indian emperor who kill vasquez one of the spanish general and forget to exchange he sword for a foil in the engagement he wound he brother tragedian who act vasquez very dangerously and though it prove not mortal yet it so shock the natural tenderness of mr farquhar 's

best player in that time which in we day be not equal to that of a second rate performer -rrb- which he think proper to accept of and mr farquhar who now have no inducement to remain at dublin

following fact on the truth of which you may depend she father captain oldfield not only run out all the military but the paternal bound of he fortune have a pretty estate in house in pall-mall it be wholly owing to captain farquhar that mr oldfield become a actress from the follow incident dining one day at she aunt 's who keep the mitre tavern in st jame 's market he hear miss nanny read a play

year we meet with mr farquhar in holland probably upon he military duty from whence he have give a description in two of he letter date that year from brill and from leyden no less true than humorous as well of those place as the people and in a third date from the hague he very facetiously relate how merry he be there at a treat make by the earl of westmoreland while not only himself but king william and other of he subject be detain there by a violent storm which he have no less humorously describe and have among he poem write also a ingenious copy of verse to he mistress on the same subject whether this mistress be the same person he call he charming penelope in several of he love letter address to she we know not but we have be inform by a old officer in the army who well know mr farquhar that by that name we be to understand mr oldfield and that the person mean by mr v -- in one of they say to be she bedfellow be mrs verbruggen the actress the same who be some year before mr mountfort whom mr oldfield succeed -lrb- when mr v -- die some year after in child-bed -rrb- with singular commendation in she principal part and from so bright a flame it be no wonder that farquhar be more than ordinarily heat the author of mr oldfield 's life say that she have often hear she mention some agreeable hour she spend with captain farquhar : as she be a lady of true delicacy nor meanly prostitute herself to every adorer it would be highly ungenerous to suppose that they hour ever pass in criminal freedom and ` tis well know whatever be she failing she wrong no man 's wife nor have a husband to injure mr farquhar encourage by the success of he last piece make a continuation of it in 1701 and bring on he sir harry wildair in which mr oldfield receive as much reputation and be as greatly admire in she part as wilk be in he in the next year he publish he miscellany or collection of poem letter and essay already mention and which contain a variety of humorous and pleasant sally of fancy : there be amongst they a copy of verse address to he dear penelope upon she wear she masque the evening before which be a female fashion in those day as well at public walk as among the spectator at the playhouse these verse naturally display he temper and talent and will afford a very clear idea of they and therefore we shall here insert they ` the argument you make use of

of himself which we should not now omit transcribe if he work be not in every body 's hand in 1703 come out another comedy entitle the inconstant or the way to win he which have sufficient merit to

sylvium and serjeant kite be properly dispose of he last play be the beau -- stratagem of which he do not live to enjoy the full success of this pleasing author 's untimely end we can give but a melancholy account he be oppress with some debt which oblige he to make application to a certain noble courtier who have give he formerly many profession of friendship he could not bear the thought that he wife and family would want and in this perplexity be ready to embrace any expedient for they relief he pretended patron persuade he to convert he commission into the money he want and pledge he honor that in a very short time he would provide he another this circumstance appear favourable and the easy bard accordingly sell he commission but when he renew he application to the nobleman and represent he needy situation the latter have forget he promise or rather perhaps have never resolve to fulfil it this distracting disappointment so preyed upon the mind of mr farquhar who see nothing but beggary and want before he that by a sure tho ' not sudden declension of nature it carry he off this worldly theater while he last play be act in the height of success at that of drury-lane and tho ' the audience bestow the loudest applause upon the performance yet they could scarce forbear mingle tear with they mirth for the approach loss of its author which happen in the latter end of April 1707 before he be thirty year of age thus have attend we entertaining dramatist o'er the contract stage of he short life thro ' the various character he perform in it of the player the lover and the husband the soldier the critic and the poet to he final catastrophe it be here time to close the scene however we shall take the liberty to subjoin a short character of he work and some farther observation on he genius it would be injurious to the memory of wilk not to take notice here of he generous behavior towards the two daughter of he deceased friend he propose to he brother manager -lrb- who readily come into it -rrb- to give each of they a benefit to apprentice they to mantua-maker which be a instance amongst many other that might be produce of the great worth of that excellent comedian the general character which have be give of mr farquhar 's comedy be ` that the success of the most of they far exceed the author 's expectation that he be particularly happy in the choice of he subject which he take care to adorn with a variety of character and incident he style be pure and unaffected he wit natural and flowing and he plot generally well contrived he lash the vice of the age tho ' with a merciful hand for he muse be good-natured not abound over-much with gall tho ' he have be blame for it by the critic : it have be object to he that he be too hasty in he production but by such only who be admirer of stiff and elaborate performance since with a person of a sprightly fancy those thing be often best that be strike off in a heat -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be think that in all he hero he generally sketch out he own character of a young gay rakish spark bless with part and ability he work be loose tho ' not so grossly libertine as some other wit of he time and leave not so pernicious impression on the imagination as other figure of the like kind more strongly stampt by indelicate and heavier hand ' he seem to have be a man of a genius rather sprightly than great rather flow ` ry than solid he comedy be divert because he character be natural and such as we frequently meet with but he have use no art in draw they nor do there appear any force of think in he performance or any deep penetration into nature but rather a superficial view pleasant enough to the eye though capable of leave no great impression on the mind he draw he observation chiefly from those he converse with and have seldom give any additional heightening or indelible mark to he character which be the peculiar excellence of shakespear johnson and congreve have he live to have gain a more general knowledge of life or have he circumstance not be straiten and so prevent he mingle with person of rank we might have see he play embellish with more finish character and with a more polished dialogue he have certainly a lively imagination but then it be capable of no great compass he have wit but it be of no peculiar a sort as not to gain ground upon consideration and it be certainly true that he comedy in general owe they success full as much to the player as to any thing intrinsically excellent in themselves if he be not a man of the highest genius he seem to have have excellent moral quality of which he behavior to he wife and tenderness to he child be proof and deserve a better fate than to die oppressed with want and under the calamitous apprehension of leave he family destitute : while farquhar will ever be remember with pleasure by people of taste the name of the courtier who thus inhumanly ruin he will be for ever dedicate to infamy -lrb- footnote 1 :

borrow pride the buskin wear ' this account give by mr sewel of the splendid shilling be perhaps heighten by personal friendship and that admiration which we naturally pay to the production of one we love the stile seem to be unnatural for a poem which be intend to raise laughter for that labor gravity have rather a contrary influence dispose the mind to be serious : and the disappointment be not small when a man find he have be betray into solemn thinking in read the description of a trifle if the gravity of the phrase chastise the laughter the purpose of the poem be defeat and it be a rule in write to suit the language to the subject philip 's splendid shilling may have please because its manner be new and we often find people of the best sense throw away they admiration on monster which be seldom to be see and neglect more regular beauty and juster proportion it be with reserve we offer this criticism against the authority of dr sewel and the tatler but we have resolve to be impartial and the reader who be convince of the propriety and beauty of the splendid shilling have no doubt as good a right to reject we criticism as we have to make it we author 's come to london we be inform be owe to the persuasion of some great person who engage he to write on the battle of blenheim he poem upon which introduce he to the earl of oxford and henry st john esq afterwards lord viscount bolingbroke and other noble patron he swell stile it must be own be better suit to a subject of this gravity and importance than to that of a light and ludicrous nature : the exordium of this piece be poetical and have a allusion to that of spencer 's fairy queen : from low and abject theme the grov ` ling muse now mount aërial to sing of arm triumphant and emblaze the martial act of britain 's hero the next poem of we author be he cyder the plan of which he lay at oxford and afterwards compleat it in london he be determine to make choice of this subject from the violent passion he have for the production of nature and to do honor to he native country the poem be found upon the model of virgil 's georgic and approach pretty near it which in the opinion of critic in general and mr dryden in particular even excel the divine æneid : he imitate virgil rather like a pursuer than a follower not servilely trace but emulate he beauty he conduct and management be superior to all other copier of that original and even the admire rapin -lrb- say dr sewel -rrb- be much below he both in design and success ` for the frenchman either fill he garden with the idle fable of antiquity or new transformation of he own and in contradiction of the rule of criticism have injudiciously blended the serious and sublime stile of virgil with the elegant turn of ovid in he metamorphosis nor have the great genius of cowley succeed better in he book of plant who besides the same fault with the former be continually vary he number from one sort of verse to another and allude to remote hint of medicinal writer which though allow to be useful be yet so numerous that they flatten the dignity of verse and sink it from a poem to a treatise of physic ' dr sewel have inform we that mr philip intend to have write a poem on the resurrection and the day of judgment and we may reasonably presume that in such a work he would have exceed he other performance this awful subject be proper to be treat in a solemn stile and dignified with the noblest image and we need not doubt from he just notion of religion and the genuine spirit of poetry which be conspicuous in he he would have carry he reader through these tremendous scene with a exalted reverence which however might not participate of enthusiasm the meanest soul and the lowest imagination can not contemplate these alarming event describe in holy writ without the deepest impression : what then might we not expect from the heart of a good man and the regulate flight and rapture of a christian poet we author 's friend mr smith who have probably see the first rudiment of he design speak thus of it in a poem upon he death o have relent heaven prolong would he day the tow ` ring bard have sing in nobler lay : how the last trumpet wake the lazy dead how saint aloft the cross triumphant spread how open heav ` ns they happier region shew and yawning gulph with flame vengeance glow and saint rejoice above and sinner howl below well might he sing the day he could not fear and paint the glory he be sure to wear all that we have leave more of this poet be a latin ode to henry st john esq which be esteem a master-piece the stile be pure and elegant the subject of a mixt nature resemble the jublime spirit and gay facetious humor of horace he be beloved say dr sewel ` by all who know he somewhat reserve and silent amongst stranger but free familiar and easy with he friend he be averse to dispute and think no time so ill spend and no wit so ill use as that which be employ in such debate he whole life be distinguish by a natural goodness and well-grounded and unaffected piety a universal charity and a steady adherence to he principle no one observe the natural and civil duty of life with a stricter regard whether a son a friend or a member of society and he have the happiness to fill every one of these part without even the suspicion either of undutifulness insincerity or disrespect thus he continue to the last not owe he virtue to the happiness of he constitution but the frame of he mind insomuch that during a long sickness which be apt to ruffle the smoothest temper he never betray any discontent or uneasiness the integrity of he life still preserve the chearfulness of he spirit and if he friend have measure they hope of he life only by he unconcern in he sickness they could not but conclude that either he date would be much longer or that he be at all time prepare for death ' he have long be trouble with a linger consumption attend with a asthma and the summer before he die by the advice of he physician he remove to batly where he get only some present ease but go from thence with but small hope of recovery and upon the return of the distemper he die at hereford the 15th of February 1708 he be inter in the cathedral church of that city with a inscription upon he grave-stone and have a monument erect to he memory in westminster-abbey by sir simon harcourt afterwards lord chancellor the epitaph of which be write by dr friend \* \* \* \* \* william walsh esq this poet be the son of joseph walsh of aberley in worcestershire he become a gentleman-commoner of wadham-college oxford in easter-term 1678 when he be only fifteen year of age he leave it without a degree retire to he native county and some time after go to london he write a dialogue concern woman be a defense of the fair-sex address to eugenia and print in the year 1691 this be the most considerable of we author 's production and it will be somewhat necessary to take further notice of it which we can not more effectually do than by transcribe the word of dryden in its commendation -- that great critic thus characterise it ` the perusal of this dialogue in defense of the fair-sex write by a gentleman of my acquaintance much surprise I : for it be not easy for I to imagine that one so young could have treat so nice a subject with so much judgment it be true i be not ignorant that he be naturally ingenious and that he have improve himself by travel and from thence i might reasonably have expect that air of gallantry which be so visibly diffuse through the body of the work and be indeed the soul that animate all thing of this nature but so much variety of read both in ancient and modern author such digestion of that reading so much justness of thought that it leave no room for affectation or pedantry i may venture to say be not over common amongst practice writer and very rarely to be find amongst beginner it put I in mind of what be say of mr waller the father of we english number upon the sight of he first verse by the wit of the last age that he come out into the world forty-thousand strong before they have hear of he here in imitation of my friend 's apostrophe i hope the reader need not be tell that mr waller be only mention for honor 's sake that i be desirous of lay hold on he memory on all occasion and thereby acknowledge to the world that unless he have write none of we all could write my friend have not it seem confidence enough to send this piece out into the world without my opinion of it that it might pass securely at least among the fair reader for whose service it be principally design i be not so presuming as to think my opinion can either be he touch-stone or he passport but i think i might send he back to ariosto who have make it the business of almost thirty stanza be in the beginning of the thirty-seventh book of he orlando furioso not only to praise that beautiful part of the creation but also to make a sharp satire on they enemy to give mankind they own and to tell they plainly that from they envy it proceed that the virtue and great action of woman be purposely conceal and the failing of some few amongst they expose with all the aggravating circumstance of malice for my own part who have always be they servant and have never draw my pen against they i have rather see some of they praise extraordinarily than any of they suffer by detraction and that at this age and at this time particularly wherein i find more heroine than hero let I therefore give they joy of they new champion : if any will think I more partial to he than i really be they can only say i have return he bribe and he word i wish he be that he may receive justice from the man and favor only from the lady ' this be the opinion of mr dryden in favor of this piece which be sufficient to establish its reputation mr wood the antiquarian observe that this eugenia be the mistress of walsh but for this he produce no proof neither be it in the lead material whether the circumstance be true or no mr walslh be likewise author of several occasional poem print 1749 amongst the work of the minor poet and which he first publish in the year 1692 with some letter amorous and gallant to which be prefix the follow address to the public go little book and to the world impart the faithful image of a amorous heart those who love 's dear delude pain have know may in my fatal sorrow read they own : those who have live from all its torment free may find the thing they never feel by I perhaps advi would avoid the gilded bait and warn would by my example shun my fate whilst with calm joy safe land on the coast i view the wave on which i once be tost love be a medley of endearment jar suspicion quarrel reconcilement war then peace again o would it not be best to chase the fatal poison from we breast but since so few can live from passion free happy the man and only happy he who with such lucky star begin he love that he cool judgment do he choice approve ill ground passion quickly wear away what be build upon esteem can ne'er decay mr walsh be of a amorous complexion and in one of he letter mention three of he amours in pretty singular term ' i value -lrb- say he -rrb- one mistress after i leave love she i love another after i leave value she i love and value the third after have lose all hope of she and accord to the course of my passion i should love the next after have obtain she however from this time forward upon what folly soever you fall be please for my sake to spare those of love be very well satisfied there be not one folly of that kind -lrb- except marriage -rrb- which i have not already commit i have be without raillery in love with the beauty of a woman whom i have never see with the wit of one whom i never hear speak nor see any thing she have write and with the heroic virtue of a woman without know any one action of she that could make I think she have any cupid will have it so and what can weak mortal do against so potent a god ' such be the sentiment of we author when he be about 30 year of age queen anne constitute mr walsh she master of the horse on what account this place in particular be allot he we know not but with regard to he literary ability mr dryden in he postscript to he translation of virgil have assert that mr walsh be the best critic then live and mr pope speaking of we author thus conclude he essay on criticism viz to he the wit of greece and rome be know and ev'ry author 's merit but he own such late be walsh : the muse judge and friend who justly know to blame or to commend to failing mild but zealous for desert the clearest head and the sincerest heart in the year 1714 the public be oblige with a small posthumous piece of mr walsh 's entitle æsculapius or the hospital of fool in imitation of lucian there be print amongst mr walsh 's other performance in a volume of the minor poet a essay on pastoral poetry with a short defense of virgil against some of the reflexion of m fontenellé that critic have censure virgil for write he pastoral in a too courtly stile which he say be not proper for the doric muse but mr walsh have very judiciously shew that the shepherd in virgil 's time be hold in greater estimation and be person of a much superior figure to what they be now we be too apt to figure the ancient countryman like we own lead a painful life in poverty and contempt without wit or courage or education but man have quite different notion of these thing for the first four thousand year of the world health and strength be then more in esteem than the refinement of pleasure and it be account more honorable to till the ground and keep a flock of sheep than to dissolve in wantonness and effeminate sloth mr walsh 's other piece consist chiefly of elegy epitaph ode and song they be elegant tho ' not great and he seem to have have a well cultivate tho ' not a very extensive understand dryden and pope have give they sanction in he favor to whom he be personally know a circumstance greatly to he advantage for have there be no personal friendship we have reason to believe they encomium would have be less lavish at least he work do not carry so high a idea of he as they have do mr walsh die about the year 1710 \* \* \* \* \* thoma betterton -lrb- write by r -lrb- 1 -rrb- -rrb- almost every circumstance relate to the life of this celebrated actor be expose to dispute and he manner of first come on the stage as well as the action of he younger year have be controvert he be son of mr betterton undercook to king charle the ist and be bear in tothill-street westminster some time in the year 1635 have receive the rudiment of a genteel education and discover a great propensity to book it be once propose he should have be educate to some learn profession but the violence and confusion of the time put this out of the power of he family he be at he own request bind apprentice to a bookseller one mr holden a man of some eminence and then happy in the friendship of sir william davenant in the year 1656 it be probable mr betterton make he first appearance on the stage under the direction of sir william at the opera-house in charter-house-yard it be say that go frequently to the stage about he mailer 's business give betterton the first notion of it who shew such indication of a theatrical genius that sir william readily accept he as a performer immediately after the restoration two distinct company be form by royal authority the first in virtue of a patent grant to henry killegrew esq call the king 's company the other in virtue of a patent grant to sir william davenant which be stile the duke 's company -lrb- 2 -rrb- the former act at the theater royal in drury-lane the other at that in lincoln 's - inn-field in order that the theater might be decorate to the utmost advantage and want none of the embellishment use abroad mr betterton by command of charle ii go to pari to take a view of the french stage that he might the better judge what would contribute to the improvement of we own upon he return mr betterton introduce move scene into we theater which before have the stage only hang with tapestry the scene no doubt help the representation by give the spectator a view of the place and increase the distress by make the deception more powerful and afflict the mind with greater sensibility the theater in lincoln 's - inn-field be very inconvenient another be build for they in dorset-garden call the duke 's theater to which they remove and follow they profession with great success during all that reign of pleasure the stage at this time be so much the care of the state that when any dispute arise they be generally decide by he majesty himself or the duke of york and frequently canvass in the circle mr cibber assign very good reason why at this time theatrical amusement be so much in vogue the first be that after a long eclipse of gallantry during the rage of the civil war people return to it with double ardor the next be that woman be then introduce on the stage they part formerly be supply by boy or effeminate young man of which the famous kynaston possess the capital part when any art be carry to perfection it seldom happen that at that particular period the profit arise from it be high and at this time the advantage of playing be very inconsiderable : mr hart the greatest performer at the king 's theater have but three pound a week and mr betterton then but young very probably have not so much and besides benefit then be thing unheard of in 1670 mr betterton marry a gentlewoman on the same stage one mr saunderson who excel as a actress every thing but she own conduct in life in she he be compleatly happy and by they joint endeavor even in those day they be able not only to acquire a genteel subsistence but also to save what might support they in a advanced age -lrb- 3 -rrb- after sir william davenant 's death the patent come into the hand of he son dr charle davenant so well know to the world by he political writings but whether he genius be less fit than he father 's for such a administration or the king 's company be really superior to he in act we can not determine but they gain upon the town and dr davenant be oblige to have recourse to the dramatic opera rich scene and fine music to support the stage on which betterton play the dr himself write the opera of circe which come first on the stage in 1675 and be receive with such applause as give hope of succeed in this new way the same year a pastoral call calista or the chaste nymph write by mr crowne at the desire of queen katherine be represent at court and the lady mary and anne daughter to the duke of york play part in it on this occasion mr betterton instruct the actor and mr betterton give lesson to the princess in grateful remembrance of which queen anne settle a pension of 100 l per annum upon she during this time a emulation subsist between the two company and a theatrical war be proclaimed aloud in which the town reap the advantage by see the part perform with the greater life the duke 's company however maintain it be superiority by means of the new-invented artillery of music machine and scenery and other underhand dealings and bribe of actor in the opposite faction from perform they duty by these measure a coalition be effect and the two company join together and be unite form one of the perfectest that ever fill a stage in 1682 it be in this unite company that the merit of betterton shone with unrivalled lustre and have survive the great actor on whose model he have form himself he be at liberty to discover he genius in its full extent by replace many of they with advantage in these very character in which during they life-time they have be think inimitable and all who have a taste for scenical entertainment can not but thank the present laureat for preserve for they so lively a portrait of betterton and painting he in so true a light that without the imputation of blind adulation he may be justly stile the british roscius this account be too important and picturesque to be here omit and it would be a injury to betterton not to shew he in that commanding light in which the best judge of that species of excellence have place he betterton be a actor as shakespear be a author both without competitor form would for the mutual assistance and illustration of each other genius how shakespear write all man who have a taste for nature may read and know -- but with what higher rapture would he still be read could they conceive how betterton play have he then might they know the one be bear alone to speak what the other only know to write pity it be that the momentary beauty flow from a harmonious elocution can not like those of poetry be they own record that the animated grace of the player can live no longer than the instant breath and motion that present they or at belt can but faintly glimmer through the memory or imperfect attestation of a few survive spectator could how betterton speak be as easily know as what he speak then might you see the muse of shakespear in she triumph with all they beauty in they belt array rise into real life and charming she beholder but alas since all this be so far out of the reach of description how shall i shew you betterton should i therefore tell you that all the othello hamlet hotspur mackbeth and brutus 's whom you may have see since he time have fall far short of he : this still would give you no idea of he particular excellence let we see then what a particular comparison may do whether that may yet draw he nearer to you you have see a hamlet perhaps who on the first appearance of he father 's spirit have throw himself into all the strain vociferation requisite to express rage and fury and the house have thunder with applause tho ' the misguided actor be all the while -lrb- as shakespear term it -rrb- tear a passion into rag -- be the more bold to offer you this particular instance because the late mr addison while i sate by he to see this scene act make the same observation ask I with some surprize if i think hamlet should be in so violent a passion with the ghost which though it might have astonish it have not provok would he for you may observe that in this beautiful speech the passion never rise beyond a almost breathless astonishment or a impatience limit by filial reverence to enquire into the suspect wrong that may have rai would he from he peaceful tomb and a desire to know what a spirit so seemingly distress might wish or enjoin a sorrowful son to execute towards he future quiet in the grave this be the light into which betterton throw this scene which he open would with a pause of mute amazement then rise slowly to a solemn tremble voice he make the ghost equally terrible to the spectator as to himself and in the descriptive part of the natural emotion which the ghastly vision give he the boldness of he expostulation be still govern by decency manly but not brave he voice never rise into that seem outrage or wild defiance of what he naturally rever would but alas to preserve this medium between mouthing and meaning too little to keep the attention more pleasingly awake by a temper spirit than by meer vehemence of voice be of all the master-stroke of a actor the most difficult to reach in this none yet have equall would betterton but i be unwilling to shew he superiority only by recount the error of those who now can not answer to they let they farther failing therefore be forget or rather shall i in some measure excuse they for i be not yet sure that they might not be as much owe to the false judgment of the spectator as the actor while the million be so apt to be transport when the drum of they ear be so roundly rattle while they take the life of elocution to lie in the strength of the lung it be no wonder the actor whose end be applause should be so often tempt at this easy rate to excite it shall i go a little farther and allow that this extreme be more pardonable than its opposite error i mean that dangerous affectation of the monotone or solemn sameness of pronunciation which to my ear be insupportable for of all fault that so frequently pass upon the vulgar that of flatness will have the fewest admirer that this be a error of ancient standing seem evident by what hamlet say in he instruction to the player viz be not too tame neither & c the actor doubtless be as strongly ty would down to the rule of horace as the writer si vis I flere dolendum est primum ipsus tibus -- he that feel not himself the passion he would raise will talk to a sleep audience : but this never be the fault of betterton and it have often amaz would I to see those who soon come after he throw out in some part of a character a just and graceful spirit which betterton himself could not but have applaud and yet in the equally shine passage of the same character have heavily dragg have the sentiment along like a dead weight with a long ton would voice and absent eye as if they have fairly forget what they be about : if you have never make this observation i be contented you should not know where to apply it a farther excellence in betterton be that he could vary he spirit to the different character he act those wild impatient start that fierce and flaming fire which he throw into hotspur never come from the unruffled temper of he brutus -lrb- for i have more than once see a brutus as warm as hotspur -rrb- when the betterton brutus be provoke in he dispute with cassius he spirit fly only to he eye he steady look alone supply would that terror which he disdain would a intemperance in he voice should rise to thus with a settle dignity of contempt like a unheeding rock he repell would upon himself the foam of cassius perhaps the very word of shakespear will better let you into my meaning : must i give way and room to you rash choler shall i be fright when a madman flare and a little after there be no terror cassius in you look & c not but in some part of this scene where he reproach cassius he temper be not under this suppression but open into that warmth which become a man of virtue yet this be that hasty spark of anger which brutus himself endeavor to excuse but with whatever strength of nature we see the poet shew at once the philosopher and the heroe yet the image of the actor 's excellence will be still imperfect to you unless language cou would put color in we word to paint the voice with et si vis similem pingere pinge sonum be enjoin a impossibility the most that a vandyke can arrive at be to make he portrait of great person seem to think a shakespear go farther yet and tell you what he picture think a betterton step beyond 'em both and call they from the grave to breathe and be themselves again in feature speech and motion when the skilful actor shew you all these power unite he gratify at once you eye you ear and you understanding to conceive the pleasure rise from such harmony you must have be present at it ` tis not to be tell you thus be betterton happy in he fortune in the notice of he sovereign in he fame and character and in a general respect of all rank of life thus happy might he have continue have he not be persuade to attempt become rich and unluckily engage in a scheme that sweep away all he capital and leave he in real distress this accident fall out in 1692 and be of too particular a kind to pass unnoticed mr betterton have a great many friend amongst the wealthy trader in the city and so amiable be he private life that all who know he be concerned and interested in he success : amongst these there be a gentleman whose name the author of he life think proper to conceal who enter into the strictest amity with this actor this gentleman in the year 1692 be concern in a adventure to the east-indy upon the footing then allow by the company 's charter which vessel so employ be stile interloper the project of success be great the gain unusually high and this induce mr betterton to whom he friend offer any share in the business he please to think of so large a sum as eight-thousand pound but it be not for himself as he have no such sum in he power : and whoever consider the situation of the stage at that time will need no other argument to convince he of it yet he have another friend whom he be willing to oblige which be the famous dr radcliffe so mr betterton advance somewhat more than two-thousand pound which be he all and the dr make it up eight-thousand the vessel sail to the east-indy and make as prosperous a voyage as those concern in she could wish and the war with france be then very warm the captain very prudently come home north about and arrive safe in ireland but in he passage from thence he be take by the french he cargo be upward of 120000 l which ruin mr betterton and break the fortune and heart of he friend in the city : as for doctor radcliffe he express great concern for mr betterton but none for himself the dr merrily console himself with observe ` that it be only trot up 200 pair of stair more and thing be as they be ' this accident however fatal to mr betterton 's fortune yet prove not so to he peace for he bear it without murmur and even without mention so far from entertaining resentment against he friend in the city who doubtless mean he well he continue he intimacy till he death and after he decease take he only daughter under he protection and watch over she education till she think proper to dispose of herself in marriage to mr bowman the player whose behavior be such as to gain the esteem of all that know he he have not be many year dead and reflect credit on the report of the excellency of the old stage such the virtue such the honor of mr betterton who in he private character be as amiable as any he borrow from the poet and therefore be always deservedly consider as the head of the theater though vet there with very little power the manager as the company be now unite exercise the mod despotic stage-tyranny and oblige we author to remonstrate to they the hardship they inflict on they actor and represent that bad policy of the few forget they obligation to the many this language in the ear of the theatrical ministry sound like treason and therefore instead of consider how to remedy the mischief complain of they bent they thought to get rid of they monitor : as if the not hearing of fault be equivalent to mend they it be with this view they begin to give away some of betterton 's first part to young actor -lrb- 4 -rrb- suppose this would abate he influence this policy ruin they and assist he : the public resent they have play ill act when they know they might have better the best player attach themselves wholly to betterton and desire he to turn he thought on some method of procure himself and they justice thus theatrical despotism produce its own definition and the very step take to render betterton desperate point out the way for he deliverance mr betterton who have a general acquaintance with people of fashion represent he case to they and at last by the interposition of the earl of dorset a patent be grant he for build a new play-house in lincoln 's - inn-field which he effect by a subscription the patentee in order to make head against they get over to they party mr william and mr mountford both eminent player they have also recruit from the country but with all the art of which they be capable they continue still unequal to mr betterton 's company the new theater be open in 1695 with very great advantage : mr congreve accept of a share with this company as mr dryden have formerly with the king 's and the first play they act be congreve 's comedy of love for love the king honor it with he presence there be a large and splendid audience mr betterton speak a prologue and mr bracegirdle a epilogue suit to the occasion and it appear by the reception they meet with that the town know how to reward the merit of those the patentee use so ill but with all these vast advantage betterton 's company be not able to maintain this flow of prosperity beyond two or three season : mr congreve be a slow writer vanbrugh and mr cibber who write for the other house be more expeditious and if they do not finish they at least writ pleasing comedy the frequency of new piece however give such a turn in they favor that betterton 's company with all they merit have be undo have not the mourning bride and the way of the world come like reprieve and save they from the last gasp -lrb- 5 -rrb- in a few year however it appear plainly that without a new support from they friend it be impossible for they to maintain they superiority or independance the patron of mr betterton set about a new subscription for build a theater in the hay-market under the direction of sir john vanbrugh which be finish in 1706 -lrb- 6 -rrb- and be to be conduct upon a new plan music and scenery to be intermix with the drama which with the novelty of a new house be likely to retrieve mr betterton 's affair this favor be kindly receive by mr betterton but he be now grow old he health and strength much impaired by constant application and he fortune still worse than he health he choose therefore -lrb- as a mutinous spirit occasion by disappointment grow up amongst the actor -rrb- to decline the offer and so put the whole design under the conduct of sir john vanbrugh and mr congreve the latter of whom soon abandon it entirely and mr betterton 's strength fail many of the old player die and other accident intervene a reunion of the company become absolutely necessary and soon after take place hitherto betterton be consider as at the head of he company and the affair of the stage be naturally connect with he as the transaction of a nation be interweave with the life of a prince after we author reach seventy he infirmity grow upon he greatly he fit of the gout be more lasting and more severe : he circumstance also which have not be mend since he take upon he the conduct of the theater grow more necessitous and all this join to he wife 's ill state of health make he condition melancholy at a time when the highest affluence could not have make they chearful yet under all these pressure he keep up he spirit and though less active be as serene as ever the public in those day have a grateful remembrance of the pleasure betterton have give they and would not suffer so distinguished and so deserving a man after fifty-year service to withdraw till he have receive from they some mark of they favor in the spring of 1709 a benefit be grant to mr betterton and the play of love for love be act for that purpose two of the best actress that ever grace the stage appear on it upon that occasion tho ' they have long quit it to render the benefit more advantageous : the part of valentine be perform by mr betterton angelica by mr bracegirdle and mr barry perform that of frail the epilogue be write by mr rowe mr bracegirdle mr barry and mr betterton appear on the stage together and the lady take hold of he represent he infirmity of age and plead he ancient merit in a very natural and move manner : this epilogue be exquisite in its kind the profit arise from that benefit we be tell amount to 500 l he have also a promise that the favor should be annually continue these extraordinary act of public gratitude have a proper effect upon mr betterton who instead of indulge himself on they bounty exert the spirit give by this generosity in they service and appear and act as often as he health would permit -lrb- 7 -rrb- on the 20th of September follow in particular he perform the part of hamlet with such vivacity as well as justice that it give ample satisfaction to the best judge this activity in the winter keep off the gout longer than usual but the fit return in the spring be the more unlucky as it happen at the time of he benefit when the success of he play be sure to depend in a great measure upon he own performance the play he make choice of be the maid 's tragedy in which he act the part of melantius and notice be accordingly give by he good friend the tatler but the fit intervene and that he might not disappoint the town mr betterton be force to submit to outward application to reduce the swell of he foot : which have such a effect that he be able to appear on the stage though he be oblige to use a slipper he act that day say the laureat with unusual spirit and briskness by which he obtain universal applause but this could not prevent he pay a very dear price for these mark of approbation since the gouty humor repel by fomentation soon seize upon the nobler part which be perhaps weaken by he extraordinary fatigue on that occasion he be not able to make a long resistance : but on the 28th of April 1710 he pay the debt to nature and by he death occasion the most undissembled mourning amongst people of rank and fashion he behavior as a man and he ability as a player raise he character and procure he the esteem of all worthy and good man and such honor be pay he memory as only he memory could deserve on the second of may he corpse be with much ceremony inter in westminster abbey and the excellent author of the tatler have give such a account of the solemnity of it as will outlast the abbey itself and it be no small mortification to we that it be inconsistent with we propose bound to transcribe the whole : it be writ with a noble spirit there be in it a air of solemnity and grandeur the thought rise naturally from one another they fill the mind with a awful dread and consecrate mr betterton to immortality with the warmth of friendship heighten by admiration as to the character of this great man in he profession the reader need but reflect on mr colley cibber 's account here insert who be well qualify to judge and who in he history of the stage have draw the most striking picture that ever be exhibit even the famous lord clarendon whose great excellence be characterise be not more happy in that particular than the laureat no one can read he portrait of the player without imagine he see the very actor before he eye they air they attitude they gesticulation mr betterton be a man of great study and application and with respect to the subject that employ he attention he be as much a master of they as any man he be a excellent critic more especially on shakespear and fletcher mr rowe who be a good judge and also study the same author with deep attention give this testimony in he favor and celebrate in the warmest manner betterton 's critical ability he knowledge of shakespear 's merit give he so strong and so perfect a esteem for he that he make a pilgrimage into staffordshire to visit he tomb and to collect whatever particulars tradition might have preserve in relation to he history and these he freely communicate to the same friend who candidly acknowledge that the memoirs of shakespear 's life he publish be the produce of that journey and freely bestow upon he by the collector mr booth who know he only in he decline frequently make mention of he and say he never see he either off or on the stage without learn something from he he frequently observe that mr betterton be no actor but he put on he part with he clothes and be the very man he undertake to be 'till the play be over and nothing more so exact be he in follow nature that the look of surprize he assume in the character of hamlet so astonished booth -lrb- when he first personate the ghost -rrb- as to disable he for some moment from go on he be so communicative that in the most capital part he would enter into the grounds of he action and explain the principle of he art he be a admirable master of the action of the stage consider as independent of sentiment and know perfectly the connection and business of the scene so as to attract preserve and satisfy the attention of art audience : a art extremely necessary to a actor and very difficult to be attain what demonstrate he thorough skill in dramatic entertainment be he own performance which be sufficient to establish a high reputation independent of he other merit as he have the happiness to pass through life without reproach a felicity few attain so he be equally happy in the choice of a wife with whom he spend he day in domestic quiet though they be of very different temper he be naturally gay and chearful she of a melancholy reserved disposition she be so strongly affect by he death which be in some measure sudden that she run distract tho ' she appear rather a prudent and constant than a fond and passionate wife : she be a great ornament to the stage and she death which happen soon after be a public loss the laureat in he apology thus characterise she : ` she be say he though far advance in year so great a mistress of nature that even mr barry who act lady macbeth after she could not in that part with all she superior strength and melody of voice throw out those quick and careless stroke of terror from the disorder of a guilty mind which the other give we with a facility in she manner that render they at once tremendous and delightful time could not impair she skill though it bring she person to decay : she be to the last the admiration of all true judge of nature and lover of shakespear in whose play she chiefly excel and without a rival when she quit the stage several good actress be the better for she instruction she be a woman of a unblemished and sober life and have the honor to teach queen anne when princess the part of semandra in mithridate which she act at court in king charle 's time after the death of mr betterton that princess when queen order she a pension for life but she live not to receive more than the first half year of it ' thus we have see that it be not at all impossible for person of real worth to transfer a reputation acquire on the stage to the character they possess in real life and it often happen as in the word of the poet that scenic virtue form the rise age and truth display she radiance from the stage the follow be mr betterton 's dramatic work 1 the woman make a justice a comedy 2 the unjust judge or appius and virginium a tragedy write originally by mr john webster a old poet who live in the reign of jame i it be alter only by mr betterton who be so cautious and reserve upon this head that it be by accident the fact be know at least with certainty 3 the amorous widow or the wanton wife a play write on the plan of moliere 's george dandin the amorous widow have a under-plot interwoven to accommodate the piece to the prevail english taste be be act with great applause but mr betterton during he life could never be induce to publish it so that it come into the world as a posthumous performance the chief merit of this and he other piece lie in the exact disposition of the scene they just length great propriety and natural connexion and of how great consequence this be to the fate of either tragedy or comedy may be learn from all bank 's play which though they have nothing else to recommend they yet never fail to move a audience much more than some justly esteem superior who ever see bank 's earl of essex represent without tear how few bestow they upon the cato of addison besides these piece betterton write several occasional poem translation of chaucer 's fable and other little exercise in a word to sum up all that we have be say with regard to the character of this extraordinary person as he be the most perfect model of dramatic action so be he the most unblemished pattern of private and social quality : happy be it for that player who imitate

precarious success of he play and the indigence of he profession naturally expose he : mr bank no doubt have gain one part of he design by commence poet namely that of be remember after death which

the death of mary queen of scot which it seem be reject whether from its want of merit or motive of a political kind we can not now determine but mr bank think proper then to publish it in the year 1706 he obtain the favor of queen anne to command it to be act at the theatre-royal which be do with success for it be really a very move tragedy it have be often revive and perform at the theater

mention the earl of essex by bank we should say something of a tragedy which have appear this year on the theater at covent-garden of the same name we can not but acknowledge that mr jone have improve the story and heighten the incident in the last act which render the whole more move after the scene of parting between essex and southampton which be very affect rutland 's distress upon the melancholy occasion of parting from she husband be melt to the last degree it be in this scene mr barry excell all he cotemporary in tragedy he there shew he power over we passion and bid the heart

prefix to the translation of lucretius : but this sudden blaze of reputation be soon obscure by he fail in a arduous task which the success of he lucretius prompt he to attempt this be a translation of the work of horace a author more diversified and consequently more difficult than lucretius some have insinuate that mr dryden jealous of he rise fame and willing to take advantage of he vanity in

as he country in general he well understand the ancient have a unusual penetration in discover they beauty and it appear by he own translation of lucretius how elegantly he could cloath they in a english attire he judgment be solid he be perfectly acquaint with the rule of criticism and he have from nature a extraordinary genius however he certainly over-rate he importance or at lead he friend deceive he when they set he up as a rival to dryden but if he be inferior to that great man in judgment and genius there be few of the same age to whom he need yield the palm have he be content to be

much he fall short of dryden in point of harmony though he seem to have be equal to any other poet who precede dryden in that particular ` tis pleasant when the sea be rough to stand and view another 's danger safe at land : not 'cause he be troubled but ` tis sweet to see those care and fear from which we self be free ` tis also pleasant to behold from far how troops engage secure ourselves from war but above all ` tis pleasantest to get the top of high philosophy and sit on the calm peaceful flourishing head of it : whence we may view deep wondrous deep below how poor mistaken mortal wand `

dark path of strife we walk this little journey of we life while frugal nature seek for only ease a body free from pain free from disease a mind from care and jealousy at peace and little too be needful to maintain the body sound in health and free from pain : not delicate but such as may supply contented nature 's thrifty luxury : she ask no more what tho ' no boy of gold adorn the wall and sprightly taper hold whose beauteous ray scatt ` ring the gawdy light might grace the feast and revel of the night : what tho ' no gold adorn no music 's sound with double sweetness from the roof

mind but if all this be vain if the same care and dread and fear remain if traytor-like they seize thee on the throne and dance within the circle of a crown if noise of arm nor dart can make they fly nor the gay sparkling of the purple dye if they on emperor will rudely seize what make we value all such thing as these but folly and dark ignorance of happiness for we as boy at night by day do fear

six and twenty year old about which time he father die and leave he a estate of near eight-hundred pound a year but so incumbred that the interest money amount to almost as much as the revenue upon the conclusion of the peace of ryswick he go to pari where he become acquaint with monsieur boileau who invite he to he country house entertain he very elegantly and speak much to he of the english poetry but all by way of enquiry for he affect to be as ignorant of the english muse as if we nation have be as barbarous as the laplander a gentleman a friend of mr maynwaring visit he some time after upon the death of mr dryden ` boileau say that he be wonderfully pleased to see by the public papers that the english nation have pay so extraordinary honor to one of they poet bury he at the public charge ' and then ask the gentleman who that poet be with as much indifference as if he have never hear dryden 's name which he could no more be unacquainted with than we country be with he for he often frequent lord montague 's house when he be embassador in france and be also a intimate friend of monsieur de la fontaine who have spend some time in england it be therefore impossible he could be ignorant of the fame of dryden but it be peculiar to that nation to hold all other in contempt the french would as fain monopolize wit as the wealth and power of europe but thanks to the arm and genius of britain they have attempt both the one and the other without success boileau 's pretend not to know dryden to use the word of milton ` argue himself unknown ' but perhaps a reason may be assign why the wit of france affect a contempt for mr dryden which be this that poet in many of he preface and dedication have unanswerably shewn that the french writer be really deficient in point of genius ' that the correctness for which they be remarkable and that even pace which they maintain in all they dramatic composition be a proof that they be not capable of sublime conception that they never rise to any degree of elevation and be in truth uninspired by the muse : -- judgment they may have to plan and conduct they design but few french poet have ever find the way of write to the heart have they attain the sublime height of shakespear the tenderness of otway or the pomp of rowe and yet these be name which a french versifier will pretend with a air of contempt never to have hear of the truth be we poet have lately do the french too much honor by translate they piece and bring they on the stage as if we own stock be exhaust and the british genius have fail : but it be some satisfaction that these attempt seem now to be discourage we have see a late play of theirs -lrb- we call it a play for it be neither a tragedy nor a comedy -rrb- translate by a languid poet of

language and he exercise be generally so well perform that the dr be fill with admiration of he part from newport school he remove to christ 's - church college in oxford and distinguish himself there for he easy attainment in literature but some little irregularity of he life would not suffer he to continue long at the university it be probable he become sick of that discipline which they who spend they life in the recluseness of a college be in some measure oblige to submit to the father of mr brown who intend to have he educate to some profession be not make acquaint with he design of quit the university and have remit he a sum of money to be appropriate for the promotion of he study he son think proper to defeat he kind intention with this money we author plann have a scheme of go to london which he soon after execute not very advantageously -- ` my first business say he be to apply myself to those few friend i have there who conjecture i have leave the university exclusive of my father 's knowledge give but slender encouragement to a young beginner however no whit daunt -lrb- my first resolution still stand by I -rrb- i launch forth into the world commit myself to the mercy of fortune and the uncertain temper of the town i soon acquire a new set of acquaintance and begin to have a relish of what i have only taste before by hearsay and indeed every thing serve to convince I i have change for the better except that my slender subsistance begin to waste extremely and ruminate upon the difficulty of obtain a supply i be then lay under the necessity of think what course to steer i know how justly i have incur the displeasure of a indulgent father and how far i have put myself from retrieve he favor amidst this serious contemplation i resolve to go through stitch with my enterprize let what will come o not : however that i might use discretion to palliate a unforeseen event i determine ` twere better to trust to the flexibility of a father 's temper than to lay too great a stress upon the humanity of fortune who would let a man of moral starve if he depend on she favor therefore without more ado -lrb- have take my sorrowful leave of my last guinea and reduce carolus secundus from a whole number to decimal fraction -rrb- i dispatch a letter into the country full of excuse and penitence bait with all the submissive eloquence imaginable in the mean time i be no less sedulous to find out some employment that might suit with my genius and with my dependency at home render my life easy ' whether he father be touch by the epistle which we author in consequence of this resolution write to he we can not ascertain as there be no mention make of it soon after this we find he school master of kingston upon thame and happy for he have he continue in that more certain employment and not have so soon exchange it for beggary and reputation mr brown impatient of a recluse life quit the school and come again to london and as he find he old companion more delighted with he wit than ready to relieve he necessity he have recourse to scribble for bread which he perform with various success dr drake who have write a defense of we author 's character prefix to he work inform we that the first piece which bring he into reputation be a account of the conversion of mr bay in a dialogue which meet with a reception suitable to the wit spirit and learning of it but though this raise he fame yet it add very little to he profit : for though it make he company exceedingly coveted and might have recommend he to the great as well as to the ingenious yet he be of a temper not to chuse he acquaintance by interest and slight such a opportunity of recommend himself to the powerful and opulent as if wisely improve might have procure he dignity and preferment the stile of this dialogue be like that of he ordinary conversation lively and facetious it discover no small erudition but manage with a great deal of humor in a burlesque way which make both the reasoning and the extensive reading which be abundantly shewn in it extremely surprize and agreeable the same manner and humor run through all he writings whether dialogue letter or poem the only considerable objection which the critic have make to he work be that they want delicacy but in answer to this it may be affirm that there be as much refinement in he work as the nature of humorous satire which be the chief beauty of he composition will admit for as satire require strong idea the language will sometimes be less polished but the delicacy so much demand by soften the color weaken the draw mr brown have be charge with inequality in he writings : which be inseparable from humanity we author 's letter though write carelesly to private friend bear the true stamp and image of a genius the variety of he learning may be see in the lacedaemonian mercury where abundance of critical question of great nicety be answer with much solidity and judgment as well as wit and humor but that design expose he too much to the scruple of the grave and reserve as well as to the censure and curiosity of the impertinent he soon discontinue it besides as this be a periodical work he who be totally without steadiness be very ill qualify for such a undertaking when the press call upon he for immediate supply he be often find debauch himself at a tavern and by excessive drinking unable to perform he engagement with the public by which no doubt the work considerably suffer but there be yet another reason why mr brown have be charge with inequality in he writings viz that most of the anonymous piece which happen to please the town be father upon he this though in reality a injury to he be yet a proof of the universality of he reputation when whatever pleased from a unknown hand be ascribe to he but by these means he be repute the writer of many thing unworthy of he in poetry he be not the author of any long piece for he be quite unambitious of reputation of that kind they be generally ode satire and epigram and be certainly not the best part of he work he translation in prose be many and of various kind he stile be strong and masculine and if he be not so nice in the choice of he author as might be expect from a man of he taste he must be excuse for he perform he translation as a talk prescribe he by the bookseller from whom he derive he chief support it be the misfortune of we author to appear on the stage of the world when fear and jealousy have sour the temper of man and politics and polemic have almost drive mirth and good nature out of the nation : so that the careless gay humor and negligent chearful wit which in former day of tranquility would have recommend he to the conversation of prince be in a gloomy period lose upon a people incapable of relish genuine humor a anonymous author who have give the world some account of mr brown observe ` that it be not he immorality that hinder he from climb to the top of poetry and preferment but that he have a particular way of sinning to himself to speak in plain english -lrb- say he -rrb- tom brown have less the spirit of a gentleman than the rest of the wit and more of a scholar tom think himself as happy with a retailer of damnation in a obscure hole as another to have go to the devil with all the splendor of a fine equipage 'twa not the brightness of caelium 's eye nor she gaudy trappings that attract he heart cupid might keep he dart to himself tom always carry he fire about he if he have but a mouth two eye and a nose he never enquire after the regularity of she dress or feature he always bring a good stomach with he and use but little ceremony in the preface as of he mistress so he be very negligent in the choice of he companion who be sometimes mean and despicable a circumstance which never fail to ruin a man 's reputation he be of a lazy temper and the bookseller who give he credit enough as to he capacity have no confidence to put in he diligence the same gentleman inform we that though tom brown be a good-natured man yet he have one pernicious quality which eternally procure he enemy and that be rather to lose he friend than he joke one of he lampoon have almost cost he a procession at the cart 's tail nor do he either spare friend or foe if the megrim of abuse once seize he he have a particular genius for scandal and deal it out liberally when he could find occasion he be famed for be the author of a libel fix one Sunday morning on the door of westminster-abbey and many other against the clergy and quality as for religion brown never profess any and use to say that he understand the world better than to have the imputation of righteousness lay to he charge : and the world to be even with he really think he a atheist but though brown never make any profession of religion yet it proceed more from affectation than conviction when he come upon he death-bed he express remorse for he past life and discover at that period sentiment which he have never before suffer to enter he mind this penitential behavior in the opinion of some be the occasion why all he brethren neglect he and do not bestow on he memory one elegiac song nor any of the rite of verse we find no encomium upon he but what appear in a grubstreet journal which however be much superior to what be usually to be find there -- a mournful muse from albion swain produce sad as the song a gloomy genius chuse in artful number let he wit be shewn and as he sing of doron 's speak he own such be the bard for only such be fit to trace pale doron thro ' the field of wit towards the latter end of we author 's life we be inform by mr jacob that he be in favor with the earl of dorset who invite he to dinner on a christmas-day with mr dryden and some other gentleman celebrate for ingenuity -lrb- accord to he lordship 's usual custom -rrb- when mr brown to he agreeable surprize find a bank note of 50 l under he plate and mr dryden at the same time be present with another of 100 l act of munificence of this kind be very common with that generous spirited nobleman mr brown die in the year 1704 and be inter in the cloyster of

time before my death and for news i have not leisure to bring any thing of moment but ere we have talk much more we see two other passenger approach we who by they often turn to one another and they

lordship be give to understand it could bear no other construction than that mr pomfret prefer a mistress before a wife though the word may as well admit of another meaning and import no more than the preference of a single life to marriage unless the gentleman in order will assert that a unmarried clergyman can not live without a mistress but the bishop be soon convince that this aspersion against he be no more than a effort of malice as mr pomfret at that time be really marry the opposition which he enemy make to he have in some measure its effect for by the obstruction he meet with he be

be so much a stranger to impartiality that he have be guilty of the very crime he exclaim against for he have not only attribute the prospect of death to the earl of roscommon which be write by mr

be tedious here to enumerate -lrb- 1 -rrb- we have already observe that we author while in ireland neglect the best opportunity of encrease he fortune and the circumstance which occasion it we find to be this : he have contract a intimacy which soon grow into friendship with judge upton a man of the same temper with himself who delight in retirement and poetical amusement he have a country villa call mountown near dublin where he and dr king use to retire and spend most of they time without any regard to they public office and by these means neglect to pay court to the lord lieutenant they

in trifle and he be never happier than when hide from the world few people pleased he in conversation and it be a proof of he like they if he behavior be tolerably agreeable he be a great dissembler of he natural temper which be fall morose and peevish where he dare shew it but he be of a timorous disposition and the least slight or neglect offer to he would throw he into a melancholy despondency he be apt to say a great many ill-natur would thing but be never know to do one : he be make up of tenderness pity and compassion and of so feminine a disposition that tear would fall from he eye upon

dr to sit up till three or four o'clock in the morning upon those day the gazette be publish to correct the error of the press which be not the business of the author but a corrector who be keep for that purpose in every printing-office of any consequence this slavery the dr be not able to bear and therefore quit the office the alderman 's severity be the more unwarrantable as the dr have be very kind in oblige he by write examiner and some other papers grati which be of advantage to he as a printer those writings at that juncture make he know to the ministry who afterwards employ he in a

out the rye-house plot a relation of the particulars of which charle the iid command dr sprat to draw up this the dr in a letter to lord dorset inform we he do with great unwillingness and would have be impel by no other consideration than that of a royal command the reason he execute these order with so much reluctance be because many of the most popular man in the nation be either concern themselves or have some relation engage so that a account of a plot thus support must expose he writer to partial or popular resentment he request the king that he might be permit to spare some name and to represent the behavior of other in as candid a light as possible in which request he majesty indulge he but notwithstanding all the candor he observe and the most dispassionate representation of fact yet he composing this relation be bring against he as a crime for which a opposite party endeavor and have almost effect he ruin this work tho ' finish in the year 1683 be not publish till

1689 which thus begin ` my lord i think i should be want to myself at this time in my own necessary vindication should i forbear any longer to give my friend a true account of my behavior in the late ecclesiastical commission though i profess what i now say i only intend as a reasonable mitigation of the offence i have give not entirely to justify my sit in that court for which i acknowledge i have deservedly incur the censure of many good man and i wish i may ever be able to make a sufficient amends to my country for it ' he crime in this particular be somewhat alleviate by he renounce the commission when he perceive the illegal practice they be go to put in execution he offence be strenuously urge against he and have not the earl of dorset warmly espouse he interest he have probably be stript of he ecclesiastical preferment he lordship charge the ill-conduct of both these affair upon king jame and he ministry and thereby bring the bishop 's opponent to a perfect reconciliation with he notwithstanding this accommodation such be the inquietude of the time that he lordship have not long enjoy this tranquility before there be hatch a most villainous contrivance not only to take away

most remarkable blessing of he life ` in such ` critical time -lrb- say he -rrb- how little evidence would have suffice to ruin any man that have be accuse with the least probability of truth i do therefore most solemnly oblige myself and all mine to keep the grateful remembrance of my deliverance perpetual and sacred ' hitherto we have consider dr sprat in he episcopal and public character in which if he fall into some error he have a right to we candor as they seem rather to have proceed from misinformation and excess of good-nature than any malevolent or selfish principle : we shall now take a view of he as a author he first appearance in that sphere be in the year 1659 when in concert with mr waller and mr dryden he print a pindarique ode to the memory of the most renowned prince oliver lord protector & c print in quarto which he dedicate to the reverend mr wilkin 's then warden of wadham-college by whose approbation and request it be make public as the author design it only for a private amusement this be a unfavourable circumstance for we author as it more particularly shew the fickleness of he disposition in state-matter and give he less credit with those party he afterwards espouse he next production in poetry be a ode on the plague of athen which happen in the second year of the pelopponesian war first describe by thucydide afterwards by lucretius : this mr sprat dedicate to he worthy and learn friend dr walter pope the performance stand the test of the severest critic and in the opinion of the best judge the manner of he great original be judiciously imitate soon after this he proceed to give the public a specimen of he ability in another kind and succeed with the greatest applause which be he observation on monsieur de serbiere 's voyage into england write to dr wren professor of astronomy in oxford print in octavo in the year 1665 mr sprat in the beginning of he letter acquaint the dr with the motive of he engage with monsieur serbiere ` have now -lrb- say he -rrb- under my hand the history of the royal-society it will be in vain for I to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory of england if my countryman shall know that one who call himself a member of that society have escape unanswered in the public disgrace which he have cast on we whole nation ' -- in this performance mr sprat have give a undeniable proof that the strength and solidity of a english pen be infinitely superior to the gallant air of a french author who be sprightly without propriety and positive without truth about two year after 1667 we author publish he incomparable history of the royal society of london for the improvement of natural knowledge a work which have acquire he very great reputation and have rank he with the most elegant and polite writer of that age soon after this mr sprat lose he amiable and much esteemed friend mr abraham cowley who by he will recommend to the care of he reverend friend the revise of all he work that be print and the collect of those papers which he have design for the press this truth mr sprat faithfully discharge and to the new edition of mr cowley 's work he prefix a account of he life and writings address to mr martin clifford happy be it for a good man when he have such a friend to close he eye : this be a desire peculiar to all and the portion of few to enjoy for who to dumb

drop the closing eye require e ` en from the tomb the voice of nature cry awake and faithful to she wonted fire -lrb- 1 -rrb- this life of cowley by dr sprat have be esteem one of the most elegant composition in we language there be several extract from it in we account of the life of that amiable poet these be the most material performance of dr sprat : a man who be early introduce into a elevated station in life which he hold not without enemy to he die moment villier duke of buckingham be he first patron who notwithstanding he fickleness and inconsistent levity never forsake he a circumstance which have induce many to believe that that nobleman owe much to the refinement of we author and that he rehearsal have never be so excellent nor so pungent a satire have it not first pass under dr sprat 's perusal this learn prelate die of a apoplexy may the 20th 1713 at he episcopal feat in bromly in kent in the 79th year of he age and be inter in the abbey-church of westminster as he live esteem by all he acquaintance as well as the clergy of he diocese so he die regret by they and indeed by all man of taste for it be the opinion of many that he raise the english tongue to that purity and beauty which former writer be wholly stranger to and which those who have succeed he can but imitate -lrb- 2 -rrb- the benevolence of we author be very conspicuous in he last will in favor of he widow and son in which he command they to extend that beneficence to he poor relation which they always find from he and not to suffer any of those to want whose necessitous merit have

upon which she look out of she chariot and speak very audibly you wycherley you be a son of a whore and then burst into a fit of laughter mr wycherley at first be very much surprize at this but he

have always a punk for they mother during mr wycherley 's surprize the chariot drive different way they be soon at a considerable distance from each other when mr wycherley recollect order he coachman to drive back and overtake the lady as soon as he get over against she he say to she madam you be please to bestow a title upon I which generally belong to the fortunate will you ladyship be at the

under she where he entertain she during the whole play and this be the beginning of a correspondence between these two person which afterwards make a great noise in the town this accident be the occasion of bring mr wycherley into favor with george duke of buckingham who be passionately in love with that lady but be ill-treated by she and who believe that mr wycherley be he happy rival the duke have long sollicit she without obtain any favor : whether the relation between they shock she for she be he cousin-german or whether she apprehend that a intrigue with a person of he rank and character must necessarily in a short time come to the king 's ear whatever be the cause she refuse so long to admit he visit that at last indignation rage and disdain take place of love and he resolve to ruin she when he take this resolution he have she so narrowly watch by he spy that he soon discover those whom he have reason to believe be he rival and after he know they he never fail to name they aloud in order to expose the lady to all those who visit she and among other he never fail to mention mr wycherley as soon as it come to the knowledge of the latter who have all he expectation from court he apprehend the consequence of such a report if it should reach the king and apply himself therefore to wilmot earl of rochester and sir charle sedley entreat they to remonstrate to the duke of buckingham the mischief he be about to do to one who have not the honor to know he and who have not offend he upon open the matter to the duke he cry out immediately that he do not blame wycherley he only accuse he cousin ` ay but they reply by render he suspect of such a intrigue you be about to ruin he that be you grace be about to ruin a man whose conversation you would be please with above all thing ' upon this occasion they say so much of the shine quality of mr wycherley and the charm of he conversation that the duke who be as much in love with wit as he be with he cousin be impatient till he be bring to sup with he which be in two or three night after supper mr wycherley who be then in the height of he vigor both in body and mind think himself oblige to exert he talent and the duke be charm to that degree that he cry out with transport and with a oath ` my cousin 's in the right of it ' and from that very moment make a friend of a man he before think he rival in the year 1673 a comedy of he call the gentleman dancing-master be act at the duke 's theater and in 1678 he plain dealer be act with general applause in 1683 he country wife be perform at the same theater these play raise he so high in the esteem of the world and so recommend he to the favor of the duke of buckingham that as he be master of the horse and colonel of a regiment he bestow two place on wycherley : as master of the horse he make he one of he equery and as colonel of a regiment a captain lieutenant of he own company king charle likewise give we author the most distinguishing mark of favor perhaps beyond what any sovereign prince have shew before to a author who be only a private gentleman : mr wycherley happen to be ill of a fever at he lodgings in bow-street covent-garden during he sickness the king do he the honor of a visit when find he fever indeed abate but he body extremely weaken and he spirit miserably shatter he command he to take a journey to the south of france believe that nothing could contribute more to the restore he former state of health than the gentle air of montpelier during the winter season : at the same time the king assure he that as soon as he be able to undertake that journey he would order five-hundred pound to be pay he to defray the expence of it mr wycherley accordingly go to france and return to england the latter end of the spring follow with he health entirely restore the king receive he with the utmost mark of esteem and shortly after tell he he have a son whom he resolve should be educate like the son of a king and that he could make choice of no man so proper to be he governor as mr wycherley and that for this service he should have fifteen-hundred pound a year allot he the king also add that when the time come that he office should cease he would take care to make such a provision for he as should set he above the malice of the world and fortune these be golden prospects for mr wycherley but they be soon by a cross accident dash to piece soon after this promise of he majesty 's mr denni tell we that mr wycherley go down to tunbridge to take either the benefit of the water or the diversion of the place when walk one day upon the wells-walk with he friend mr fairbeard of gray 's - inn just as he come up to the bookseller 's the countess of drogheda a young widow rich noble and beautiful come to the bookseller and enquire for the plain dealer ` madam say mr fairbeard since you be for the plain dealer there he be for you ' push mr wycherley towards she ` yes say mr wycherley this lady can bear plain deal for she appear to be so accomplished that what would be a compliment to other when say to she would be plain dealing -- no truly sir say the lady i be not without my fault more than the rest of my sex and yet notwithstanding all my fault i love plain dealing and never be more fond of it then when it tell I of a fault : ' then madam say mr fairbeard you and the plain dealer seem design by heaven for each other in short mr wycherley accompany she upon the walk wait upon she home visit she daily at she lodgings whilst she stay at tunbridge and after she go to london at she lodgings in hatton-garden : where in a little time he obtain she consent to marry she this he do by he father 's command without acquaint the king for it be reasonably suppose that the lady have a great independent estate and noble and powerful relation the acquaint the king with the intended match would be the likeliest way to prevent it as soon as the news be know at court it be look upon as a affront to the king and a contempt of he majesty 's order and mr wycherley 's conduct after marriage make the resentment fall heavier upon he : for be conscious he have give offence and seldom go near the court he absence be construe into ingratitude the countess though a splendid wife be not form to make a husband happy she be in she nature extremely jealous and indulge it to such a degree that she could not endure she husband should be one moment out of she sight they lodgings be in bow-street covent garden over against the cock tavern whither if mr wycherley at any time go he be oblige to leave the window open that he lady might see there be no woman in the company this be the cause of mr wycherley 's disgrace with the king whose favor and affection he have before possess in so distinguish a degree the countess settle all she estate upon he but he title be dispute after she death the expence of the law and other incumbrance so far reduce he that he be not able to satisfy the impatience of he creditor who throw he at last into prison so that he who but a few year before be flourish in all the gaiety of life flush with prospects of court preferment and happy in the most extensive reputation for wit and part be condemn to suffer all the rigor of want : for he father do not think proper to support he in this severe extremity he fall upon a expedient which no doubt be dictate by he distress of apply to he bookseller who have get considerably by he plain dealer in order to borrow 20 l but he apply in vain the bookseller refuse to lend he a shilling and in that distress he languish for seven year : nor be he release 'till one day king jame go to see he plain-dealer perform be so charm with it that he give immediate order for the payment of the author 's debt add to that bounty a pension of 200 1 per annum while he continue in england but the generous intention of that prince to he have not the design effect purely through he modesty he be ashamed to tell the earl of mulgrave whom the king have send to demand it a full state of he debt he labor under the weight of these difficulty 'till he father die and then the estate that descend to he be leave under very uneasy limitation he be only a tenant for life and not be allow to raise money for the payment of he debt : yet as he have a power to make a jointure he marry almost at the eve of he day a young gentlewoman of 1500 l fortune part of which be apply to the use he want it for he die eleven day after the celebration of he nuptials in December 1715 and be inter

he be admire by the man for he part in wit and learning and he be admire by the woman for those part of which they be more competent judge ' mr wycherley be a man of great sprightliness and vivacity of genius he be say to have be handsome form for gallantry and be certainly a idol with the lady a felicity which even he wit might not have procure without exterior advantage as a poet and a dramatist i can not better exhibit he character than in the word of george lord lansdowne he observe ` that the earl of rochester in imitation of one of horace 's epistle thus mention we author of all we modern wit none seem to I once to have touch would upon true comedy but hasty shadwel and slow wycherley shadwel 's unfinish would work do yet impart great proof of nature 's force tho ' none of

-rrb- merely for the sake of the verse if hasty say he would have stand as a epithet for wycherley and slow for shadwel they would in all probability have be so applied but the verse would have be spoil and to that it be necessary to submit those who would form they judgment only upon mr wycherley 's writings without any personal acquaintance with he might indeed be apt to conclude that such a diversity of image and character such strict enquiry into nature such close observation on the several humor manners and affection of all rank and degree of man and as it be so true and perfect a dissection of humankind deliver with so much pointed wit and force of expression could be no other than the work of extraordinary diligence labor and application but in truth we owe the pleasure and advantage of have be so well entertain and instruct by he to he facility of do it if it have be a trouble to he to write i be much mistaken if he would not have spare that trouble what he have perform would have be difficult for another but a club which a man of a ordinary size could not lift be a walk staff for hercule to judge by the sharpness and spirit of he satire you might be lead into another mistake and imagine he a ill-natur 'd man but what my lord rochester say of lord dorset be applicable to he the best good man with the worst natured muse as pointed and severe as he be in he writings in he temper he have all the softness of the tenderest disposition gentle and inoffensive to every man in he particular character he only attack vice as a public enemy compassionate the wound

diversity of thought and allusion and though it may appear a pleasant ridicule to a ignorant reader be wholly groundless and unjust mr addison 's answer be however upon the whole rather a palliation than a defense all the skill of that writer could never make that poetical or a fine panegyric which be in its own nature remove from the very appearance of poetry but friendship good nature or a coincidence of party will sometimes engage the greatest man to combat in defense of trifle and even against they own judgment as dryden finely express it in he address to congreve vindicate a friend

early acquaintance with some of the most powerful wisest and wittiest man of the age in which he live he attach himself to a party which at last obtain the ascendant and he be equally successful in he

improve and finish under the care of the famous dr busby of westminster school where about the age of 12 year he be choose one of the king 's scholar besides he skill in the latin and greek language he have make a tolerable proficiency in the hebrew but poetry be he early bent and darling study he compose at different time several copy of verse upon various subject both in greek and latin and some in english which be much admire and the more so because they be produce with so much facility and seem to flow from he imagination as fast as from he pen he father who be a serjeant at law design he for he own profession take he from that school when he be about sixteen year of age and enter he a student in the middle temple whereof himself be a member that he might have he under he immediate care and instruction be capable of any part knowledge to which he think proper to apply he make very remarkable advance in the study of the law and be not content to know it as a collection of statute or custom only but as a system found upon right reason and calculate for the good of mankind be afterwards call to the bar he promise as fair to make a figure in that profession as any of he cotemporary if the love of the belle lettre and that of poetry in particular have not stop he in he career to he there appear more charm in euripide sophocle and aeschilus than in all the record of antiquity and when he come to discern the beauty of shakespear and milton he soul be captivate beyond recovery and he begin to think with contempt of all other excellence when put in the balance with the enchantment of poetry and genius mr rowe have the best opportunity of rise to eminence in the law by means of the patronage of sir george treby lord chief justice of the common plea who be fond of he to a very great degree and have it in he power to promote he but be overcome by he propension to poetry and he first tragedy call the ambitious step-mother meeting with universal applause he lay aside all thought of the law the ambitious step-mother be we author 's first attempt in the drama write by he in the 25th year of he age and dedicate to the earl of jersey ` the purity of the language -lrb- say mr welwood -rrb- the justness of he character the noble elevation of the sentiment be all of they admirably adapt to the plan of the play ' the ambitious step-mother be the first be conduct with less judgment than any other of rowe 's tragedy it have a infinite deal of fire in it the business be precipitate and the character active and what be somewhat remarkable the author never after write a play with so much elevation critic have complain of the sameness of he poetry that he make all he character speak equally elegant and have not attend sufficiently to the manners this uniformity of versification in the opinion of some have spoil we modern tragedy as poetry be make to supply nature and declamation character whether this observation be well found we shall not at present examine only remark that if any poet have a right to be forgive for this error mr rowe certainly have as he cadence be the sweetest in the world he sentiment chaste and he language elegant we author write several other tragedy but that which he value himself most upon say welwood be he tamerlane act at the theater in lincoln 's - inn-field and dedicate to the marquis of hartington in this play continue welwood ` he aim at a parallel between the late king william and tamerlane and also bajazet and a monarch who be since dead that glorious ambition in tamerlane to break the chain of enslaved nation and set mankind free from the encroachment of lawless power be paint in the most lively as well as the most amiable color on the other side he manner of introduce on the stage a prince whose chief aim be to perpetuate he name to posterity by that havock and ruin he scatter through the world be all draw with that pomp of horror and detestation which such monstrous action deserve and since nothing could be more calculate for raise in the mind of the audience a true passion for liberty and a just abhorrence of slavery how this play come to be discourage next to a prohibition in the latter end of queen anne 's reign i leave it to other to give a reason ' thus far dr welwood who have endeavor to point out the similiarity of the character of tamerlane to that of king william though it be certainly true that the tamerlane of rowe contain grander sentiment than any of he other play yet it may be a matter of dispute whether tamerlane ought to give name to the play for tamerlane be victorious and bajazet the sufferer besides the fate of these two monarch there be likewise contain in it the episode of monese and arpasium which be of itself sufficiently distressful to make the subject of a tragedy the attention be divert from the fall of bajazet which ought to have be the main design and bewilder in the fortune of monese and arpasium axallum and selima : there be in short in this play event enough for four and in the variety and importance of they tamerlane and bajazet must be too much neglect all the character of a play should be subordinate to the lead one and they business in the drama subservient to promote he fate but this performance be not the tragedy of bajazet or tamerlane only but likewise the tragedy of monese and arpasium axalum and selima it be now perform annually on the 4th and 5th of November in commemoration of the gun-powder treason and the landing of king william in this realm when a occasional prologue be speak another tragedy of mr rowe 's be the fair penitent act at the theater in lincoln 's - inn-field and dedicate to the duchess of ormond : this be one of the most finished performance of we author the character of sciolto the father be strongly marked horatio 's the most amiable of all character and be so sustained as to strike a audience very forcibly in this as in the former play mr rowe be guilty of a mis-nomer for he calista have not the least claim to be call the fair penitent which would be better change to the fair wanton for she discover not one pang of remorse till the last act and that seem to arise more from the external distress to which she be then expose than to any compunction of conscience she still love and doat on she base betrayer though a most insignificant creature in this character rowe have be true to the sex in draw a woman as she generally be fond of she seducer but he have not draw draw a penitent the character of altamont be one of those which the present player observe be the hardest to represent of any in the drama there be a kind of meanness in he join with a unsuspecting honest heart and a doat fondness for the false fair one that be very difficult to illustrate : this part have of late be generally give to performer of but very moderate ability by which the play suffer prodigiously and altamont who be really one of the most important person in the drama be behold with neglect or perhaps with contempt but seldom with pity altamont in the hand of a good actor would draw the eye of the audience notwithstanding the blustering lothario and the superior dignity of horatio for there be something in altamont to create we pity and work upon we compassion so many player fail of late in the this character leave it a matter of doubt whether the actor be more mistaken in he performance or the manager in the distribution of part the next tragedy mr rowe write be he ulyss act at the queen 's theater in the hay market and dedicate to the earl of godolphin this play be not at present in possession of the stage though it deserve highly to be so as the character of penelope be a excellent example of conjugal fidelity : who though she lord have be ten year absent from she and various account have be give of he death yet notwithstanding this and the address of many royal suitor she preserve she heart for she ulyss who at last triumph over he enemy and rescue he faithful queen from the persecution of she wooer -- this play have business passion and tragic propriety to recommend it -- the next play mr rowe bring upon the stage be he royal convert act at the queen 's theater in the haymarket and dedicate to the earl of hallifax he next be the tragedy of jane shore write in imitation of shakespear 's stile act at the theatre-royal in drury-lane and dedicate to the duke of queensberry and dover how mr rowe could imagine that this play be write at all in imitation of shakespear 's stile we can not conceive for so far as we be able to judge it bear not the least resemblance to that of shakespear the conduct of the design be regular and in that sense it partake not of shakespear 's wildness the poetry be uniform which mark it to be rowe 's but in that it be very different from shakespear whose excellency do not consist merely in the beauty of soft language or nightingale description but in the general power of he drama the boldness of the image and the force of he character we author afterwards bring upon the stage he lady jane gray dedicate to the earl of warwick this play be justly in posession of the stage likewise mr edmund smith of christ 's - church author of phædra and hyppolitus design write a tragedy on this subject and at he death leave some loose hint of sentiment and short sketch of scene from the last of these mr rowe acknowledge he borrow part of one and insert it in he third act viz that between lord guilford and lady jane it be not much to be regret that mr smith do not live to finish this since it fall into the hand of one so much above he as a dramatist for if we may judge of mr smith 's ability of write for the stage by he phædra and hyppolitus it would not have be so well execute as by rowe phædra and hyppolitus be a play without passion though of inimitable versification and in the word of a living poet we may say of it that not the character but poet speak it may be justly say of all rowe 's tragedy that never poet paint virtue religion and all the relative and social duty of life in a more alluring dress on the stage nor be ever vice or impiety better expose to contempt and abhorrence the same principle of liberty he have early imbibe himself seem a part of he constitution and appear in every thing he write and he take all occasion that fall in he way to make he talent subservient to they : he muse be so religiously chaste that i do not remember say dr welwood one word in any of he play or writings that might admit of a double meaning in any point of decency or moral there be nothing to be find in they to flatter a depraved populace or humor a fashionable folly mr rowe 's play be write from the heart he practice the virtue he admire and he never in he gayest moment suffer himself to talk loosely or lightly upon religious or moral subject or to turn any thing sacred or which good man reverence as such into ridicule we author write a comedy of three act call the biter it be perform at the theater in lincoln 's - inn-field but without success for rowe 's genius do not lie towards comedy -- in a conversation he have with mr pope that great poet advise he to rescue the queen of scot from the hand of bank and to make that lady to shine on the stage with a lustre equal to she character mr rowe observe in answer to this that he be a great admirer of queen elizabeth and as he could not well plan a play upon the queen of scot 's story without introduce he favorite princess who in that particular make but a indifferent figure he choose to decline it : besides he know that if he favor the northern lady there be a strong party concern to crush it and if he should make she appear less great than she be and throw a shade over she real endowment he should violate truth and incur the displeasure of a faction which though by far the minority he know would be yet too powerful for a poet to combat with the late duke of queensberry when secretary of state make mr rowe secretary for public affair and when that nobleman come to know he well he be never more delighted than when in he company : after the duke 's death all avenue be stopt to he preferment and during the rest of queen anne 's reign he pass he time with the muse and he book and sometimes with the conversation of he friend while mr rowe be thus without a patron he go one day to pay he court to the earl of oxford lord high treasurer of england then at the head of the tory faction who ask he if he understand spanish well he answer no : but imagine that he lordship might intend to send he into spain on some honorable commission he presently add that in a short time he do not doubt but he should presently be able both to understand it and speak it the earl approve of what he say mr rowe take he leave and immediately retire out of town to a private country farm where within a few month he learn the spanish tongue and then wait again on the earl to give he a account of he diligence he lordship ask he if he be sure he understand it thoroughly and mr rowe answering in the affirmative the earl burst into a exclamation ` how happy be you mr rowe that you can enjoy the pleasure of reading and understanding don quixote in the original ' this wanton cruelty inflict by he lordship of raise expectation in the mind that he never intend to gratify need only be tell to excite indignation upon the accession of king george the 1st to the throne mr rowe be make poet-laureat and one of the surveyor of the custom in the port of london the prince of wale confer on he the place of clerk of he council and the lord chancellor parker make he he secretary for the presentation the very day he receive the seal and without he ask it he be twice marry first to a daughter of mr auditor parson and afterwards to a daughter of mr devenish of a good family in dorsetshire by he first wife he have a son and by he second a daughter mr rowe die the 6th of December 1718 in the 45th year of he age like a christian and a philosopher and with a unfeigned resignation to the will of god : he prefer a evenness of temper to the last and take leave of he wife and friend immediately before he last agony with the same tranquility of mind as if he have be take but a short journey he be inter in westminster-abbey over against chaucer he body be attend with a vast number of friend and the dean and chapter officiating at the funeral a tomb be afterwards erect to he memory by he wife for which mr pope write a epitaph which we shall here insert not one word of which be hyperbolical or more than he deserve epitaph on rowe by mr pope thy relique rowe to this sad shrine we trust and near thy shakespear place thy honor would bust oh next he skill have to draw the tender tear for never heart feel passion more sincere : to nobler sentiment to fire the brave for never briton more disdain have a slave peace to thy gentle shade and endless rest blest in thy genius in thy love too blest and bless that timely from we scene remov would thy soul enjoy the liberty it lov would to these so mourn would in death so lov would in life the childless parent and the widow would wife with tear inscribe this monumental stone that hold they ash and expect she own mr rowe as to he person be graceful and well make he face regular and of a manly beauty he have a quick and fruitful invention a deep penetration and a large compass of think with a singular dexterity and easiness in communicate he opinion he be master of most part of polite learning especially the classic author both greek and latin he understand the french italian and spanish language he have likewise read most of the greek and roman history in they original language and most that be write in english french italian and spanish : he have a good taste in philosophy and have a firm impression of religion upon he mind he take delight in divinity and ecclesiastical history in both which he make great advance in the time he retire to the country which be frequent he express upon all occasion he full perswasion of the truth of reveal religion and be a sincere member of the established church himself he pity but condemn not those who depart from he he abhor the principle of persecute man on account of religious opinion and be strict in he own he take it not upon he to censure those of another persuasion he conversation be pleasant witty and learn without the least tincture of affectation or pedantry and he inimitable manner of divert or enliven the company make it impossible for any one to be out of humor when he be in it : envy and detraction seem to be entirely foreign to he constitution and whatever provocation he meet with at any time he pass they over without the least thought of resentment or revenge there be not want some malevolent people and some pretender to poetry too that would sometimes bark at he best performance but he be too much conscious of he own genius and have so much good-nature as to forgive they nor could however be tempt to return they a answer ' this be the amiable character of mr rowe draw by mr welwood to which we shall add the word of mr pope in a letter to edward blount esq date February the 10th 1715 ` there be a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to mr rowe which make it impossible to part with he without that uneasiness which generally succeed all we pleasure ' it would perhaps be injurious to the memory of rowe to dismiss he life without take notice of he translation of lucan and quillet 's callipædia the versification in both be musical and well adapt to the subject nor be there any reason to doubt but that the true meaning of the original be faithfully preserve throughout the whole these translation however with mr rowe 's occasional poem and birth-day ode be but little read and he be only distinguish as a dramatist for which we shall not pretend to assign a reason but we may observe that a muse capable of produce so many excellent dramatic piece can not be suppose to have execute any plan indifferently however it may charm a reader less than that kind of composition which be set off on the theater with so many advantage he publish likewise a edition of the work of shakespear and prefix the life of that great man from material which he have be industrious to collect in the county where shakespear be bear and to which after he have fill the world with admiration of he genius he retire we deem it unnecessary to give any specimen of mr rowe 's poetry the most celebrated speech in he play which be beautifully harmonious be repeat by every body who read poetry or attend play and to suppose the reader ignorant of they would be to degrade he from that rank of intelligence without which he can be

what afterwards happen misfortune age and other accident will make a great man differ from himself we find we young nobleman while he be aboard a ship amidst the noise of the crew could yet indulge he

stain upon they as can never be wipe off and have that nobleman and the ship 's crew perish they would have add actual murther to concerted baseness upon the approach of he lordship 's force the moor retire and the result of this expedition be the blow up of tangier some time after the king be appease the earl forget the ill office that have be do he and enjoy he majesty 's favor to the last he continue in several great port during the short reign of king jame the iid till that prince abdicate the throne as the earl constantly and zealously advise he against several imprudent measure which be take by the court the king some month before the revolution begin to grow cooler towards he but yet be so equitable as not to remove he from he preferment : and after the king lose he crown he have the inward satisfaction to be conscious that he council have not contribute to that prince 's misfortune and that himself in any manner have not forfeit he honor and integrity that he lordship be no violent friend to or promoter of the revolution seem to appear from he conduct during that remarkable æra : and particularly from the unfinished relation he leave concern it which be suppress some year ago by order of the government in a passage in he lordship 's writings it appear he be unwilling that king jame should leave england -lrb- 3 -rrb- just as the king be step into bed the night before he go away the earl of mulgrave come into the bed-chamber which be at so late a hour might possibly give the king some apprehension of that lord 's suspect he design with which he be resolve not to trust he nor any protestant : he therefore stop short and turn about to whisper he in the ear that he commissioner have newly send he a very hopeful account of some accommodation with the prince of orange to which that lord only reply with a question ask he if the prince 's army halt or approach nearer to london the king own they still march on at which the earl shake he head and say no more only make he a low bow with a dejected countenance humbly to make he understand that he give no credit to what the king 's hard circumstance at that time oblige he to dissemble it also appear that the earl of mulgrave be one of those lord who immediately after the king 's departure send letter to the fleet to the abandon army of king jame and to all the considerable garrison in england which keep they in order and subjection not only to the present authority but that which should be settle afterwards to he lordship 's humanity be owe the protection king jame obtain from the lord in london upon he be seize and insult by the populace at feversham in kent before which time say he ` the peer sit daily in the council chamber in whitehall where the lord mulgrave one morning happen to be advertise privately that the king have be seize by the angry rabble at feversham and have send a poor countryman with the news in order to procure he rescue which be like to come too late since the messenger have wait long at the council door without any body 's be willing to take notice of he this sad account move he with great compassion at so extraordinary a instance of worldly uncertainty and no caution of offend the prevail party be able to restrain he from shew a little indignation at so mean a proceeding in the council upon which they new president the marquis of hallifax would have adjourn it hastily in order to prevent he but the lord mulgrave earnestly conjure they all to sit down again that he might acquaint they with a matter that admit no delay and be of the highest importance imaginable accordingly the lord who know nothing of the business could not but hearken to it and those few that guess it and see the consequence yet want time enough for concert together about so nice and very important a matter as save or lose a king 's life the lord then sit down again and he represent to they what barbarity it would be for such a assembly 's conniving at the rabble 's tear to piece even any private gentleman much more a great prince who with all he popery be still they sovereign so that mere shame oblige they to suspend they politics awhile and call in the messenger who tell they with tear how the king have engage he to deliver a letter from he to any person he could find willing to save he from so imminent a danger the letter have no superscription and be to this effect ` to acquaint the reader of it that he have be discover in he retreat by some fisherman of kent and secure at first there by the gentry who be afterwards force to resign he into the hand of a insolent rabble upon so press a occasion and now so very publickly make know the council be surprize and under some difficulty for as there be danger of displease by do they duty so there be no less by omit it since the law make it highly criminal in such a extremity besides that most of they as yet unacquainted with the prince of orange imagine he prudent and consequently capable of punish so base a desertion either out of generosity or policy these find afterwards they caution needless but at present it influence the council to send 200 of the life guard under they captain the earl of feversham first to rescue the king from all danger of the common people and afterwards to attend he toward the sea side if he continue he resolution of retire which they think it more decent to connive at than to detain he here by force ' whoever have the least spark of generosity in he nature can not but highly applaud this tender conduct of he lordship 's towards he sovereign in distress and look with contempt upon the slowness of the council in dispatch a force to he relief especially when we find it be only out of dread lest they should displease the prince of orange that they send any : this shew a meanness of spirit a want of true honor to such a degree that the prince of orange himself could not consistently with good policy trust those worshipper of power who could hear unconcerned that they late sovereign be in the hand of a vile rabble and intreat they in vain for rescue the earl of mulgrave make no mean compliance to king william immediately after the revolution but when he go to pay he address to he he be well receive yet do he not accept of a post in the government till some year after may 10 in the 6th year of william and mary he be create marquis of normanby in the county of lincoln when it be debate in parliament whether the prince of orange should be proclaimed king or the princess he wife reign solely in she own right he vote and speak for the former and give these reason for it that he think the title of either person be equal and since the parliament be to decide the matter he judge it would much better please that prince who be now become they protector and be also in itself a thing more become so good a princess as queen mary to partake with she husband a crown so obtain than to possess it entirely as she own after long debate in parliament the crown at last be settle upon william and mary burnet lord bishop of salisbury whose affection for the revolution none i believe can doubt freely acknowledge that the king be resolve not to hold the government by right of he wife ` he would not think of hold any thing by apron string : ' he be jealous of the friend of he wife and never forgive they and last of all he threaten to leave they in the lurch that be to retire to holland with he dutch army so restless say mulgrave in another place be ambition in its highest scene of success during the reign of king william however he enjoy some considerable post and be generally pretty well in he favor and confidence April 21 1702 he be swear lord privy seal and the same year appoint one of the commissioner to treat of a union between england and scotland and be make lord lieutenant and custo rotulorum for the north ride of yorkshire and one of the governor of the charterhouse march 9 1703 he be create duke of normanby have be make marquis of normanby by king william and on the 19th of the same month duke of buckingham in 1711 he be make steward of she majesty 's houshold and president of the council and on she decease be one of the lord justice in great britain 'till king george arrive from hanover in 1710 the whig ministry begin to lose ground and mr harley since earl of oxford and the lord treasurer make the proper use of those circumstance yet want some assistance apply to the duke of buckingham the duke who be not then on good term with mr harley at first slight he proposal but afterwards join with he and other which produce a revolution in the ministry and shake the power of the duke and duchess of marlborough while mr harley the earl of shrewsbury lord bolingbroke & c come into the administration the duke be attach to tory principle she majesty offer to make he chancellor which he think proper to refuse he be out of employment for some time during which he do not so much as pay he compliment at court 'till he marry he third wife and then go to kiss she majesty 's hand the duke of buckingham though reckon haughty and ill natured be yet of a tender compassionate disposition but as the best character have generally some allay he be allow to have be very passionate but after he warmth subside he endeavor to atone for it by act of kindness and beneficence to those upon whom he passion have vent itself several year before he grace die he be well know to have express some concern for the libertinism of he youth especially regard the fair sex in which he have indulge himself himself very freely he be survive only by one legitimate son but leave several natural child we noble author have be charge by some of he enemy with the sordid vice of covetousness but without foundation for as a strong indication that he be not avaritious he lose a considerable part of he fortune merely by not take the pain to visit during the space of 40 year he estate at some distance from london and whoever be acquaint with human nature know that indolence and covetousness be incompatible he grace die the 24th of February 1720 in the 75th year of he age and after lie in state for some day at buckingham-house be carry from thence with great funeral solemnity and inter in westminster-abbey where a monument be erect to he memory upon which the follow epitaph be engrave by he own direction as appear from a passage in he will ` since something be usually write on monument i direct that the follow line shall be put on mine viz ` in one place pro rege sæpe pro republica semper ` in another dubius sed non improbus vixi incertus morior sed inturbatus humanum est nescire & errare christum adveneror deo confido omnipotentus benevolentissimo en entium miserere mihus ' the word christum adveneror be omit at the desire of the late bishop atterbury who think they not strong enough in regard to christ under the whole be the follow word catharina buckinghamicæ : ducissa mærens extrui curavit anno mdccxxi edmund the duke 's eldest son already mention be snatch away in he bloom a youth from whom the greatest thing might have be expect as he be untainted with the vice of the age : he be very remarkable for he modesty which vulgar mind imputed to want of power but those who know he best have give a different testimony concern he and have represent he as possess of all the genius of he father with more strict and inviolable moral with this young nobleman the title of the sheffield family expire the duke he father inform we of a duel he be to have fight with the witty earl of rochester which he thus relate after tell we that the cause of the quarrel happen between the first and second dutch war ' i be inform would -lrb- say he grace -rrb- that the earl of rochester have say something very malicious of I i therefore send colonel aston a very mettled friend of mine to call he to account for it he deny the word and indeed i be soon convince he have never say they but a mere report though i find it to be false obliged I -lrb- as i then foolishly think -rrb- to go on with the quarrel and the next day be appoint for we to fight on horseback : a way in england a little unusual but it be he part to chuse accordingly i and my second lay the night before at knightsbridge privately to avoid be secure at london on any suspicion which we find ourselves more in danger of there because we have all the appearance of highwayman that have a mind to lye skulk in a odd inn for one night in the morning we meet the lord rochester at the place appoint who instead of jame porter whom he assure aston he would make he second bring a errant life-guard-man whom nobody know to this mr ` aston take exception as be no suitable adversary especially consider how extremely well he be mount whereas we have only a couple of pad upon which we all agree to fight on foot but as my lord rochester and i be ride into the next field in order to it he tell I that he have at first choose to fight on horseback because he be so weak with a certain distemper that he find himself unfit to fight at all any way much less a foot i be extremely surprized because no man at that time have a better reputation for courage and my anger against he be quite subside i take the liberty to represent to he what a ridiculous story it would make should we return without fight and tell he that i must in my own defense be oblige to lay the fault on he by tell the truth of the matter he answer be that he submit to it and hope i would not take the advantage in have to do with any man in so weak a condition : i reply that by such a argument he have sufficiently tie my hand upon condition i might call we seconds to be witness of the whole business which he consent to and so we part upon we return to london we find it full of this quarrel upon we be absent so long and therefore mr aston think fit to write down every word and circumstance of this whole matter in order to spread every where the true reason of we return without have fight which be not in the least contradict or resent by the lord rochester entirely ruin he reputation for courage though nobody have still a greater as to wit which support he pretty well in the world notwithstanding some more accident of the same kind that never fail to succeed one another

merit of this play in the original it be sufficient to observe that the critic have allow it to be the best tragedy of corneille and the author himself be of the same opinion provide the three last act have be equal to the two first as to the translation by mr cotton we have very considerable authority to pronounce it better than that of mr katherine philip who could not number versification

which soon procure he the notice of some of the poetical judge in that age the verse be not without they elegance but if they be much remove above common rhime they fall infinitely short of the character mr addison 's friend bestow upon they some little space intervene he send into the world a translation of the 4th georgic of virgil of which we need not say any more than that it be commend by mr dryden he write also that discourse on the georgic prefix to they by way of preface in mr dryden 's translation and choose to withhold he name from that judicious composition because it contain a untried strain of criticism which bear hard upon the old professor of that art and therefore be not so fit for a young man to take upon himself and mr dryden who be above the meanness of father any one 's work own the essay on the georgic to have come from a friend whose name be not mention because he desire to have it conceal the next year mr addison write several poem of different kind amongst

but be conscious of the importance of the undertaking and deter by he extreme modesty he relinquish say mr tickell all view that way but sir richard steel in he letter to mr congreve prefix to the drummer who have a quarrel with tickell on account of a injurious treatment of he say that those be not the reason which make mr addison turn he thought to the civil world ` and as you be the inducement -lrb- say he -rrb- of he become acquaint with my lord hallifax i doubt not but you remember the warm instance that noble lord make to the head of the college not to insist on mr addison 's go into order he argument be found on the general pravity and corruption of man of business who want liberal education and i remember as if i have read the letter yesterday that my lord end with a compliment that however he might be represent as no friend to the church he would never do it any other injury than by keep mr addison out of it ' mr addison have discover a inclination to travel the abovementioned patron out of zeal as well to he country as we author procure he from the crown a annual pension of 300 l which enable he to make a tour to italy the latter end of 1699 he latin poem dedicate to mr montague then chancellor of the exchequer be print before he departure in the musaæ anglicanæ and be as much esteem in foreign country as at home particularly by that noble wit of france boileau it be from mr tickell we learn this circumstance in relation to boileau and we shall present it to the reader in he own word ` he country owe it to mr addison that the famous monsieur boileau first conceive a opinion of the english genius for poetry by peruse the present he make he of the musæ anglicanæ it have be currently report that this famous french poet among the civility he shew mr addison on that occasion affirm that he would not have write against perrault have he before see such excellent piece by a modern hand the compliment he mean be that these book have give he a very new idea of the english politeness and that he do not question but there be excellent composition in the native language of a country which possess the roman genius in so eminent a degree ' in 1701 mr addison write a epistolary poem from italy to lord hallifax which be much admire as a finish piece in its kind and indeed some have pronounce it the best of mr addison 's performance it be translate by the abbot antonio mario salvinus greek professor at florence into italian verse which translation be print with the original in mr tickell 's 4to edition of mr addison 's work this poem be in the highest esteem in italy because there be in it the best turn compliment on that country that perhaps be to be find any where : and the italian on account of they familiarity with the object it describe must have a higher relish of it this poem likewise shew he gratitude to lord hallifax who have be that year impeach by the common in parliament for procure exorbitant grant from the crown to he own use and further charge with cut down and waste the timber in he majesty 's forest and with hold several office in he majesty 's exchequer that be inconsistent and design as check upon each other : the common have likewise address the king to remove he from he council and presence for ever these be the cause of he retire and mr addison 's address at this time be a noble instance of he fidelity and stedfastness to he friend on he return to england he publish a account of he travels dedicate to lord somer he would have return earlier than he do have not he be think of as a proper person to attend prince eugene who then command for the emperor in italy which employment would much have please he but the death of king william intervene cause a cessation of he pension and he hope for a considerable space of time he remain at home and as he friend be out of the ministry he have no opportunity to display he ability or to meet a competent regard for the honor he work have already do he country he owe both to a accident : in the year 1704 lord treasurer godolphin happen to complain to the lord hallifax that the duke of marlborough 's victory at blenheim have not be celebrate in verse in the manner it deserve and tell he that he would take it kind if he lordship who be the patron of the poet would name a gentleman capable of write upon so elevated a subject lord hallifax reply with some quickness that he be well acquaint with such a person but that he would not name he and observe that he have long see with indignation man of little or no merit maintain in pomp and luxury at the expence of the public while person of too much modesty with great ability languish in obscurity the treasurer answer very coolly that he be sorry he lordship have occasion to make such a observation but that in the mean time he would engage he honor that whoever he lordship should name might venture upon this theme without fear of lose he time lord hallifax thereupon name mr addison but insist the treasurer should send to he himself which he promise accordingly he prevail upon mr boyle then chancellor of the exchequer to go in he name to mr addison and communicate to he the business which he do in so oblige a manner that he readily enter upon the task -lrb- 3 -rrb- the lord treasurer see the poem before it be finish when the author have write no farther than the celebrated simile of the angel and be so much pleased with it that he immediately make he commissioner of appeal in the room of mr locke who be promote to be one of the lord commissioner for trade & c he poem entitle the campaign be receive with loud and general applause : it be address to the duke of marlborough and contain a short view of the military transaction in the year 1704 and a very particular description of the two great action at schellemberg and blenheim in 1705 mr addison attend the lord hallifax to hanover and in the succeed year he be make choice of for under-secretary to sir charle hedge then appoint secretary of state in the month of December in the same year the earl of sunderland who succeed sir charle in that office continue mr addison in the post of under secretary opera be now much in fashion many people of distinction and true taste importune he to make a trial whether sense and sound be really so incompatible as some admirer of the italian piece would represent they he be at last prevail upon to comply with they request and compose he rosamond : this piece be inscribe to the duchess of marlborough and meet with but indifferent success on the stage many look upon it as not properly a opera for consider what number of miserable production have bear that title they be scarce satisfied that so superior a piece should appear under the same denomination about this time we author assist sir richard steel in a play call the tender husband to which he write a humorous prologue sir richard whose gratitude be as warm and ready as he wit surprize he with a dedication which may be consider as one of the few monument of praise not unworthy the great person to whose honor it be raise in 1709 he go over to ireland as secretary to the marquis of wharton appoint lord lieutenant of that kingdom she majesty also be please as a mark of she peculiar favor to augment the salary annex to the keeper of the record in that nation and bestow it upon he while he be in ireland he friend sir richard steel publish the tatler which appear for the first time on the 12th of April 1709 : mr addison -lrb- say tickell -rrb- discover the author by a observation on virgil he have communicate to he this discovery lead he to afford farther assistance insomuch that as the author of the tatler well exprest it he fare by this mean like a distrest prince who call in a powerful neighbor to he aid : that be he be undo by he auxiliary the superiority of mr addison 's papers in that work be universally admit and be more at leisure upon the change of the ministry he continue assist in the tatler till 1711 when it be dropt no sooner be the tatler lay down but sir richard steel in concert with mr addison form the plan of the spectator the first paper appear on the first of march 1711 and in the course of that great work mr addison furnish all the papers mark with any letter of the muse clio and which be generally most admire tickell who have no kindness for sir richard steel meanly suppose that he mark he paper out of precaution against sir richard which be a ill-natur 'd insinuation for in the conclusion of the spectator he acknowledge to mr addison all he have a right to and in he letter to congreve he declare that addison 's papers be mark by he out of tenderness to he friend and a warm zeal for he fame steel be a generous grateful friend it therefore ill become mr tickell in the defense of mr addison 's honor which need no such stratagem to depreciate one of he dearest friend and at the expence of truth and he reputation raise the character of he hero sir richard have oppose mr addison in the choice of mr tickell as he secretary which it seem he could never forget nor forgive in the spectator sir roger de coverly be mr addison 's favorite character and so tender be he of it that he go to sir richard upon he publish a spectator in which he make sir roger pick up a woman in the temple cloister and would not part with he friend until he promise to meddle with the old knight 's character no more however mr addison to make sure and to prevent any absurdity the writer of the subsequent spectator might fall into resolve to remove that character out of the way or as he pleasantly express it to a intimate friend kill sir roger that no body else might murther he when the old spectator be finish a new one appear but though write by man of wit and genius it do not succeed and they be wise enough not to push the attempt too far posterity must have a high idea of the taste and good sense of the british nation when they be inform that twenty-thousand of these papers be sometimes sell in a day -lrb- 4 -rrb- the guardian a paper of the same tendency entertain the town in the year 1713 and 1714 in which mr addison have likewise a very large share he also write two papers in the lover in the year 1713 appear he famous cato he enter into a design of write a tragedy on that subject when he be very young and when he be on he travels he actually write four act of it : however he retouch it on he return without any design of bring it on the stage but some friend of he imagine it might be of service to the cause of liberty he be prevail upon to finish it for the theater which he accordingly do when this play appear it be receive with boundless admiration and during the representation on the first night on which its fate depend it be say that mr addison discover uncommon timidity he be agitate between hope and fear and while he remain retire in the green-room he keep a person continually go backwards and forwards from the stage to the place where he be to inform he how it succeed and till the whole be over and the success confirm he never venture to move when it be publish it be recommend by many copy of verse prefix to it amongst which the sincerity of mr steele and the genius of eusden deserve to be distinguish : but as i would not omit any particulars relative to this renowned play and its great author i shall insert a letter of mr pope 's to sir william turnbull date the 30th of April 1713 in which be some circumstance that merit commemoration sir ` as to poetical affair i be content at present to be a bare looker on and from a practitioner turn a admirer which as the world go be not very usual cato be not so much the wonder of rome in he day as he be of britain in ours and though all the foolish industry possible have be use to make it think a party play yet what the author once say of another may the most properly in the world be apply to he on this occasion envy itself be dumb in wonder lose and faction strive who shall applaud he most the numerous and violent clap of the whig party on the one side of the theater be ecchoe back by the tory on the other while the author sweat behind the scene with concern to find they applause proceed more from the hand than the head this be the case too with the prologue writer who be clapp would into a staunch whig at the end of every two line i believe you have hear that after all the applause of the opposite faction my lord bolingbroke send for booth who play cato into the box between one of the act and present he with fifty guinea in acknowledgment as he express it for defend the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator the whig be unwilling to be distance this way and therefore design a present to the same cato very speedily in the mean time they be get ready as good a sentence as the former on they side so betwixt they it be probable that cato -lrb- as dr garth exprest it -rrb- may have something to live upon after he die ' immediately after the publication of this tragedy there come abroad a pamphlet entitle observation on cato write by the ingenious dr sewel : the design of this piece be to show that the applause this tragedy meet with be found on merit it be a very accurate and entertaining criticism and tend to secure the poet the heart of he reader as well as of he audience we author be not however without enemy amongst whom be mr dennis who attack it first in a pamphlet and then in a subsequent work in which he employ seven letter in pull it to piece : in some of he remark he be candid and judicious enough in other he be trifling and ill natur would and i think it be pretty plain he be agitate by envy for as the intent of that play be to promote the whig interest of which mr denni be a zealous abettor he could not therefore disesteem it from party principle another gentleman who call himself a scholar at oxford consider the play in a very different light and endeavor to serve he party by turn the cannon upon the enemy the title of this pamphlet be mr addison turn tory : it be write with great spirit and vivacity cato be speedily translate into french by mr boyer but with no spirit : it be translate likewise into italian voltaire have commend and condemn mr addison by turn and in respect to cato he admire and censure it extravagantly the principal character he allow superior to any before bring upon the stage but say that all the love-scene be absolutely insipid : he might have add unnecessary as to the plot and the only reason that can be assign for the poet 's introduce they be the prevalence of custom but it must be acknowledge that he lover be the most sensible and address each other in the best language that be to be find in any love dialogue of the british stage : it will be difficult to find a more striking line or more picturesque of a lover 's passion than this pathetic exclamation a lover do not live by vulgar time queen anne be not the last in do justice to we author and he performance she be please to signify a inclination of have it dedicate to she but as he intend that compliment to another it come into the world without any dedication if in the subsequent part of he life he leisure have be greater we be tell he would probably have write another tragedy on the death of socrate but the honor accrue from what he have already perform deprive posterity of that production this subject be still drier and less susceptible of poetical ornament than the former but in the hand of so great a writer there be no doubt but genius would have supply what be want in the real story and have cover by shine sentiment and noble language the simplicity of the plot and deficiency in business upon the death of the queen the lord justice appoint mr addison they secretary this divert he from the design he have form of compose a english dictionary upon the plan of a famous italian one : that the world have much suffer by this promotion i be ready to believe and can not but regret that we language yet want the assistance of so great a master in fix its standard settle its purity and illustrate its copiousness or elegance in 1716 we author marry the countess of warwick and about that time publish the freeholder which be a kind of political spectator this work mr addison conduct without any assistance upon a plan of he own form he do it in consequence of he principle out of a desire to remove prejudice and contribute all he could to make he country happy however it produce he own promotion in 1717 to be one of the principal secretary of state he health which have be before impaired by a asthmatic disorder suffer exceedingly by a advancement so much to he honor but attend with such great fatigue : find that he be not able to manage so much business as he station lead he to he resign and in he leisure hour begin a work of a religious nature upon the evidence of the christian religion which he live not to finish he likewise intend a paraphrase on some of the psalm of david : but a long and painful relapse break all he design and deprive the world of one of its brightest ornament June 17 1719 when he be enter the 54th year of he age he die at holland-house near kensington and leave behind he a only daughter by the countess of warwick after he decease mr tickell by the authority and direction of the author collect and publish he work in four volume 4to in this edition there be several piece as yet unmentioned which i shall here give account of in order the first be a dissertation upon medal which though not publish 'till after he death be begin in 1702 when he be at vienna in 1707 there come abroad a pamphlet under the title of the present state of the war and the necessity of a augmentation consider the whig examiner come out September 14 1710 for the first time : there be five papers in all attribute to mr addison these be by much the tartest thing he ever write dr sacheverel mr prior and many other person be severely treat the examiner have do the same thing on the part of the tory and the avowed design of this paper be to make reprisal in the year 1713 be publish a little pamphlet call the late trial and conviction of count tariff it be intend to expose the tory ministry on the head of the french commerce bill : this be also a severe piece the follow have likewise be ascribe to we author dissertatio de insignioribus romanorum poeti i e a dissertation upon the most eminent roman poet : this be suppose to have be write about 1692 a discourse on ancient and modern learn the time when it be write be uncertain but probably as early as the former it be preserve amongst the manuscript of lord somer which after the death of sir joseph jekyl be publickly sell this little piece come to be print 1739 and be well receive to these we must add the old whig no 1 and 2 pamphlet write in defense of the peerage bill : the scope of the bill be this that in place of 16 peer sit in parliament as representative of the peerage of scotland there be for the future to be twenty five hereditary peer by the junction of nine out of the body of the scotch nobility to the then 16 sit peer that six english peer should be add and the peerage then remain fix the crown be restrain from make any new lord but upon the extinction of family this give a great alarm to the nation and many papers be write with spirit against it amongst the rest one call the plebeian now know to have be sir richard steele 's in answer to this come out the old whig n ° 1 on the state of the peerage with some remark on the plebeian this controversy be carry on between the two friend addison and steele at first without any knowledge of one another but before it be end it appear from several expression that the author of the old whig be acquaint with he antagonist thus we have go through the most remarkable passage of the life of this great man in admiration of whom it be but natural to be a enthusiast and whose very enemy express they dislike with diffidence nor indeed be he enemy mr pope excepted -lrb- if it be proper to reckon mr pope mr addison 's enemy -rrb- in one particular case of any consequence it be a true and a old observation that the greatest man have sometimes failing that of all other human weakness one would not suspect they to be subject to it be say of mr addison that he be a slave to flattery that he be jealous and suspicious in he temper and as pope keenly express it bear like the turk no rival near the throne that he be jealous of the fame of pope many have believe and perhaps not altogether without ground he prefer tickel 's translation of the first book of homer to pope 's he word be ` the other have more of homer ' when at the same time in a letter to pope he strenuously advise he to undertake it and tell he there be none but he equal to it which circumstance have make some people conjecture that addison be himself the author of the translation imputed to mr tickell : be this as it may it be unplease to dwell upon the failing and quarrel of great man let we rather draw a veil over all they error and only admire they virtue and they genius of both which the author the incident of whose life we have now be trace have a large possession he add much to the purity of the english stile in prose he rhime be not so flowing nervous or manly as some of he cotemporary but he prose have a original excellence a smoothness and dignity peculiar to it he poetry as well as sentiment in cato can not be praise enough mr addison be stedfast to he principle faithful to he friend a zealous patriot honorable in public station amiable in private life and as he live he die a good man and a pious christian -lrb- footnote 1

forsake the profession of the law and throw himself upon the public by write for the stage -- that d'urfey be a man of some ability and enjoy the esteem and friendship of man of the greatest part in he time appear from the favourable testimony of the author of the guardian : and as the design of this work be to collect and throw into one view whatever may be find concern any poet of eminence in various book and literary record we shall make no scruple of transcribe what that ingenious writer have humorously say concern we author in numb 29 vol i speaking of the advantage of laugh he thus mention d'urfey ' a judicious author some year since publish a collection of sonnet which he very successfully call laugh and be fat or pill to purge melancholy : i can not sufficiently admire the facetious title of these volume and must censure the world of ingratitude while they be so negligent in reward the jocose labor of my friend mr d'urfey who be so large a contributor to this treatise and to whose humorous production so many rural squire in the remotest part of this island be oblige for the dignity and state which corpulency give they it be my opinion that the above pill would be extremely proper to be take with ass milk and might contribute towards the renew and restore decayed lung ' numb 67 he thus speak of he old friend -- ` it have be remark by curious observer that poet be generally long live and run beyond the usual age of man if not cut off by some accident or excess as anacreon in the midst of a very merry old age be choak with a grape stone the same redundancy of spirit that produce the poetical flame keep up the vital warmth and administer uncommon fuel to life i question not but several instance will occur to my reader 's memory from homer down to mr dryden i shall only take notice of two who have excel in lyric the one a antient the other a modern the first gain a immortal reputation by celebrate several jockey in the olympic game the last have signalize himself on the same occasion by the ode that begin with -- to horse brave boy to new-market to horse the reader will by this time know that the two poet i have mention be pindar and mr d'urfey the former of these be long since lay in he urn after have many year together endear himself to all greece by he tuneful composition we countryman be still live and in a bloom old age that

friend and cotemporary as we both flourish together in king charle the iid 's reign we divert ourselves with the remembrance of several particulars that pass would in the world before the greatest part of my reader be bear and could not but smile to think how insensibly we be grow into a couple of venerable old gentleman tom observe to I that after have write more ode than horace and about four time as many comedy as terence he be reduce to great difficulty by the importunity of a set of man who of late year have furnish he with the accommodation of life and would not as we say be pay with a song in order to extricate my old friend i immediately send for the three director of the play-house and desire they would in they turn do a good office for a man who in shakespear 's phrase often fill they mouth i mean with pleasantry and popular conceit they very generously listen to my proposal and agree to act the plot sister -lrb- a very take play of my old friend compose -rrb- on the 15th of next month for the benefit of the author ` my kindness to the agreeable mr d'urfey will be imperfect if after have engage the player in he favor i do not get the town to come into it i must therefore heartily recommend to all the young lady my disciple the case of my old friend who have often make they grand-mother merry and whose sonnet have perhaps lull asleep many a present toast when she lay in she cradle the gentleman i be speaking of have lay obligation on so many of he countryman that i hope they will think this but a just return to the good service of a veteran poet ' i myself remember king charle the iid lean on tom d'urfey 's shoulder more than once and hum over a song with he it be certain that monarch be not a little support by joy to great cæsar which give the whig such a blow as they be not able to recover that whole reign my friend afterwards attack popery with the same success have expose beliarmine and portocarero more than once in short satirical composition which have be in every body 's mouth he make use of italian tune and sonato 's for promote the protestant interest and turn a considerable part of the pope 's music against himself in short he have oblige the court with political sonnet the country with dialogue and pastoral the city with description of a lord mayor 's feast not to mention he little ode upon stool-ball with many other of the like nature ` should the very individual he have celebrate make they appearance together they would be sufficient to fill the play-house pretty peg of windsor gilian of croydon with dolly and molly and tommy and johny with many other to be meet with in the musical miscellany would make a great benefit ` as my friend after the manner of the old lyric accompany he work with he own voice he have be the delight of the most polite company and conversion from the beginning of king charle the iid 's reign to we own time : many a honest gentleman have get a reputation in he country by pretend to have be in company with tom d'urfey ' i might here mention several other merit in my friend as he enrich we language with a multitude of rhime and bring word together that without he good office would never have be acquaint with one another so long as it have be a tongue but i must not omit that my old friend angle for a trout the best of any man in england ` after what i have say and much more that i might say on this subject i question not but the world will think that my old friend ought not to pass the remainder of he life in a cage like a singing bird but enjoy all that pindaric liberty which be suitable to a man of he genius he have make the world merry and i hope they will make he easy as long as he stay amongst we this i will take upon I to say they can not do a kindness to a more divert companion or a more chearful honest good-natur would man ' -- the same author numb 82 put he reader in mind when d'urfey 's benefit come on of some other circumstance favourable to he ` the plot sister say he be this day to be act for the benefit of the author my old friend mr d'urfey this comedy be honor with the presence of king charle ii three of the first five night my friend have in this work shewn himself a master and make not only the character of the play but also the furniture of the house contribute to the main design he have make excellent use of a table with a carpet and the key of a closet with these two implement which would perhaps have be over-looked by a ordinary writer he contrive the most natural perplexity -lrb- allow only the use of these houshold goods in poetry -rrb- that ever be represent on a stage he also make good advantage of the knowledge of the stage itself for in the nick of be surprize the lover be let down and escape at a trap door in a word any who have the curiosity to observe what please in the last generation and do not go to a comedy with a resolution to be grave will find this evening ample food for mirth

rake and be sheepish without have modesty with great success mr bullock succeed noke in the part of bubble and in my opinion be not much below he for he do excellently that kind of folly we call absurdity which be the very contrary of wit but next to that be of all thing properest to excite mirth what be foolish be the object of pity but absurdity often proceed from a opinion of sufficiency and consequently be a honest occasion for laughter these character in this play can not but make it a very pleasant entertainment and the decoration of singing and dancing will more than repay the good-nature of those who make a honest man a visit of two merry hour to make he follow year unpainful ' these be the testimony of friendship and esteem which this great author have give in favor of d'urfey and however he genius may be turn for the sing-song or ballad which be certainly the lowest species of poetry yet that man can not be term contemptible who be thus love and though in jocular term praise by mr addison there be few or no particulars relate to the life of this poet preserve he be attach to the tory interest and in the latter part of queen anne 's reign frequently have the

poetry in which he live to make no inconsiderable figure find the nation divide between the opinion of whig and tory and be sensible that a man of part could not make any considerable figure unless he attach himself to one of these party settle think proper on he first set out in life to join the whig who be then though the minor yet a powerful party and to support whose interest he employ he talent about the year 1680 when the debate run high concern the exclusion of the duke of york from the succession on account of he religious principle we author write a piece call the character of a popish successor and what may be expect from such a one humbly offer to the consideration of both the house of parliament appoint to meet at oxon on march 21 1681 this essay it seem be think of consequence enough to merit a answer as at that time the exclusion bill employ the general conversation the answer to it be entitle the character of a rebellion and what england may expect from one print 1682 the author of this last piece be very severe on the character of settle he represent he as a errant knave a despicable coward and a prophane atheist and seem amaze that any party should make choice of a champion whose moral be so tainted but as this be only the language of party violence no great credit be to be give to it the author of this pamphlet carry he zeal and ill manners

shift and supposition without so much as a argument either offer or answer in stress of the question & c ' mr settle 's cause be so much better than that of he antagonist 's that if he have not possess half the power he really do he must have come off the conqueror for who do not see the immediate danger the fatal chance to which a protestant people be expose who have the misfortune to be govern by a popish prince as the king be naturally powerful he can easily dispose of the place of importance and trust so as to have they fill with creature of he own who will engage in any enterprise or pervert any law to serve the purpose of the reign monarch have not the nation a instance of this during the short reign of the very popish prince against whom settle contend do not judge jeffry a name justly devote to everlasting infamy corrupt the stream of justice and by the most audacious cruelty pervert the form of law that the blood of innocent person might be shed to gratify the appetite of a suspicious master besides there be always a danger that the religion which the king profess will imperceptibly diffuse itself over a nation though no violence be use to promote it the king as he be the fountain of honor so be he the fountain of fashion and as many people who surround a throne be of no religion in consequence of conviction it be but natural to suppose that fashion would influence they to embrace the religion of the prince and in jame ii 's reign this observation be verify for the people of fashion embrace the popish religion so very fast in order to please the king that a witty knight who then live and who be by he education and principle a papist be ask by a nobleman what news he make answer i hear no news my lord only god 's papist can get no preferment

power he be a man of very great endowment and be of a bustling tumultuous disposition be admirably fit to be the head of a party he be the lead man against the succession of the duke of york and argue in the house of lord with great force against he and what be more remarkable sometimes in the duke 's presence it be related that at the council-table when he majesty and he royal brother be both present something concern the succession be canvass when shaftsbury not in the least intimidate speak he opinion with great vehemence against the duke and be answer with equal heat but with less force by the then lord chamberlain during this debate the duke take occasion to whisper the king that he majesty have a villain of a chancellor to which the king merrily reply oddsfish york what a fool you have of a chamberlain : by which it appear he majesty be convince that shaftsbury 's argument be the strongest in consequence of shaftsbury 's violent opposition to the duke and the court party there be a bill of indictment of high treason read before he majesty 's commissioner of oyer and terminer in the sessions-house at the old bailey but the jury find it ignoramus upon which all the party rejoice at the deliverance of they head these disturbance give mr settle a opportunity to display he ability which he do not neglect to improve by which mean he procure so formidable a antagonist as mr dryden who be oblige by he place of laureat to speak and write for the court dryden have formerly join mr settle in order to reduce the grow reputation of shadwell but they interest be now so
