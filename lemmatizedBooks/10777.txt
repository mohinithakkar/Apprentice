to train it it be a bad look-out for I i can tell you and not one of you would care to be in my shoe what be the trouble ned ask a new-comer open the door and glancing at the amuse face of those

not you think it a hard case for such a confirm bachelor as i be i do indeed be the hearty reply but i think you will find a way out of it ned take a wife unto yourself and she will relieve you of all responsibility there be a general laugh at this but in the midst of it the door slowly open and the subject of all this discussion appear on the threshold a fragile little figure with long golden-brown hair and a pair of dark brown eye that look calmly and searchingly in front of she clad in white with she dimpled hand cross in front of she she stand there for a moment in silence then speak : -- where be my uncle edward here reply sir edward as he look helplessly round first at he friend and then at he small niece the child step up to he with perfect composure and hold out she little hand which she uncle take undergo all the while a severe scrutiny from the pair of dark eye fix upon he there be dead silence in the room sir edward 's companion be delight in the scene and he great discomfiture only heighten they enjoyment well he say at length rather feebly i think you know the look of I now do not you where be you nurse ought you not to be in you bed this be not the place for little girl you know i be think you would kiss I and the child 's lip begin to quiver while a pink flush rise to she cheek and she glance wistfully round in the hope of see some sympathetic face near she but sir edward could not bring himself to do this lay he hand on the curly head raise to he he pat it as he might he dog and say -- there there now you have introduce yourself to I you can run away what be you name millicent be not it milly be my name and be all these gentleman my uncle too the tone of doubtful inquiry be too much for the little company and milly 's question be answer by a shout of laughter again the child 's face flush and then a grey-haired man step forward come wentworth this be a severe ordeal for such a mite i have grandchild of my own so be not so scared as you now little one be that better and in a instant the child be lift by he and place upon he knee as he take a seat by the fire milly heave a short sigh i like this she say look up at he confidingly do uncle edward really want I to go to bed nurse say it be not time yet nurse want she supper so she send I in here while she have it the reign of the nurse have begin say sir edward well it may be a very fine joke to all you fellow but if i do not make my authority feel at once it will be all up with I lovell be so good as to ring that bell sir edward 's voice be irate when he old butler appear ford take this child to she nurse and tell she that she be never to appear in my presence again unless send for now millicent go at once the child slide down from she seat but though evidently puzzle at the quick sharp word she seem to have no fear for go up to she uncle she slip she little hand into he be you angry uncle what do ` presence ' mean will you say ` good-night god bless you ' to I with the baby finger cling to he what could sir edward say good-night good-night child now go say ` god bless you ' persist the little one and it be not till she uncle mutter the desire word that she relinquish she hold and follow the butler sedately out of the room chapter ii david and goliath sir edward wentworth be as he express it a confirm bachelor and though during the autumn month he be quite willing to fill he house with he london friend he be better pleased to live the greater part of the year in seclusion occupy himself with look after he estate and write article for several of the lead review of the day the advent of he small niece be indeed a great trial to he but with he characteristic thoroughness he determine that he would make the necessary arrangement for she comfort accordingly he have a long interview with she nurse the follow morning it prove to be satisfactory the nurse be a staid elderly woman who assure he she be accustom to the sole charge of the child and would keep she entirely under she own control i expect you would like she to be send down to you in the evening -- at dessert perhaps sir she inquire sir edward pull the end of he moustache dubiously be it necessary i think child ought to be in bed at that time of course it shall be as you like sir you do not dine so late as some do i think you would expect to see she once in the day after a little hesitation sir edward give he permission and when he find that milly neither scream nor snatch for the fruit on the table and do not herself engross the whole conversation he become quite reconcile to the little white figure steal in and occupy the chair that be always place at he left-hand side for she beyond this he see very little of she while he guest be with he but afterwards when they have all leave he and he relapse into he ordinary life he be constantly come across she sometimes he would find she in the stable she arm round the stable cat and the groom hold a voluble conversation with she or among the cow at the bottom of the paddock or feed the pig and fowl in the poultry yard generally she be attend by fritz a beautiful collie who have with the fickleness of he nature transfer he affection from he master to she and though uncertain in temper towards most be never anything but amiable when with the little girl she uncle 's form approach be quite a sufficient hint to she to make herself scarce she would generally anticipate the usual formulum : now run away child to nurse by sing out cheerfully : i be just off uncle and by the time he have reach the spot where she be stand the little figure would be run off in the distance fritz close at she heel one afternoon sir edward be return from a stroll up the avenue when he see the child at play among the tree and for a moment he pause and watch she she appear to be very busy with a doll wrap in a fur rug which she carefully deposit at the foot of the tree then for some minute she and fritz seem to be have a kind of a game of hide and seek with one another until she push he into a bush and command he to stay there suddenly dog and child dart at each other and then to sir edward 's amazement he see he little niece seize fritz by the throat and bring he to the ground when both be roll over one another and fritz 's short sharp bark become rather indignant in tone as he vainly try to escape from the little hand so tightly round he sir edward think it high time to interfere millicent he call out sharply come to I at once what be you do in a instant milly be upon she foot and lift a hot flush little face to he she place herself in she favorite attitude when in he presence she hand clasp behind she back and foot closely plant together do not you know fritz might bite if you be so rough with he be you try to choke he demand she uncle yes she respond breathless from she late exertion i be try to kill he he be a bear and that be my lamb and i be david that be all a child 's game be beyond sir edward 's comprehension he look down upon she with a knit brow she continue -- you see he have to do for both a bear and a lion for they both come and they both try to get the lamb nurse be the lion one day but she be too big i can not knock she down though i try hard i will not have fritz knock down in that fashion he might hurt you say sir edward sternly milly look sorrowful then brighten up she ask -- but i may kill goliath may not i do you know that be one of my game see i be david and you see that big old tree standing by itself that be goliath he be look at I now do you see where he eye come just up there in those first branch when it be windy he shake he head at I fearful he be a wicked wicked old thing and he think no one can knock he down do you remember about he uncle sir edward be become slightly interested he lean against a tree and take out a cigar no i do not think i do he say do not you remember he stand up so proud and call out : ` choose a man to come and fight I ' he be say that to I now i be david you know and i be go just wait a moment till i be ready she dart away to where she doll be and soon return with a tiny calico bag which she open very carefully and disclose to she uncle 's puzzle gaze five round stone you see she go on it be a pity i have not a sling but tom in the stable say he will make I a cattypot that be a lovely sling he say which would kill anything but it be all right i pretend i have a sling you know now you wait here i be go to meet he i be not a bit afraid though he look so big because david be not you know god help he now goliath i be ready sir edward look on in some amusement as milly step out with regular even step until she be about twenty foot from the tree then suddenly stop i hear what you say goliath you say you 'll give my body to be peck at and eat by the bird but you will not do that for i be come and i be go to kill you and then with all she strength the child fling she stone one by one at the tree pause for some moment when she have do so he be quite dead uncle she say calmly as she retrace she step and stand before sir edward again look up at he with those earnest eye of hers quite dead and if i have a sword i would play at cut off he head i suppose you would not lend I you sword hang up in the hall would you most certainly not be the quick reply then take he cigar from he mouth sir edward ask : and do all you play consist in kill people i only try to kill the bear and lion and goliath because they be so wicked and so strong milly continue -- this be such a lovely place to play in -- tree be so nice to have game with shall i tell you some more do you see that little tree over there that be where i sit when i be the probable son and when i have sit there a long time and be very miserable and eat some of the beech nut that do for husk then suddenly i think i will go home to my father it be rather a long walk but i get happier and happier as i go and i get to walk very quick at last and then i run when i see my father do you see that nice big old tree right up there with the red leaf uncle that be he and i run up and say ` father i have sin i be not fit to come back but i be so sorry that i leave you ' and then i just hug he and kiss he and do you know i feel he hug and kiss I back he do in the story you know and then i have a nice little feast all ready i get some biscuit from nurse and a little jam and some sugar and water and i sit down and feel so happy to think i be not the probable son any more and have not get to eat husk or be with the pig do not you think that be a beautiful game uncle do you get all you game from the bible inquire sir edward i somehow think it be not quite correct and he look very dubiously at he little niece as he speak well say milly the earnest look come into she eye again i love the bible so much you see nurse tell I the story ever so often and i know lot and lot of they but i like the probable son the best do you like it sir edward replace he cigar in he mouth and stroll on without a reply he little niece 's word awaken very uncomfortable feeling within he heart year before he have know and love he bible well he have be active in christian work and have bear many a scoff and jeer from he companion when at oxford for be pious as they term it but there come a time when coldness creep into he christianity and worldly ambition and desire fill he soul gradually he wander farther and farther away from the right path and when he come into he property he take possession of it with no other aim and object in life than to enjoy himself in he own way and to totally ignore both the past and future beyond go to church once on Sunday he make no profession of religion but that custom he conform to most regularly and the vicar of the parish have nothing to complain of in the way in which he appeal for charity be meet by the squire it be needless to say that sir edward be not a happy man there be time when he could not bear he own thought and the solitude of he position and at such time there be a hasty departure for town and some week of club life ensue after which he would return to he home and engross himself in both he literary and country occupation with fresh vigor chapter iii the first punishment slowly but surely little milly be advance in she uncle 's favor she extreme docility and great fearlessness add to she quaintness of speech and action attract he greatly he become interested in watch she little figure as it flit to and fro and the sunny laugh and bright childish voice about the house be no longer a annoyance to he one day he be move to anger by a accident that happen to a small statue in the hall and milly be the delinquent she ball have roll behind it and both she and the dog be have a romp to get it when in the scuffle the statue come to the ground and lay there in a thousand piece hear the crash sir edward come out of he study and completely lose he temper he turn furiously upon the child give vent to language that be hardly fit for she ear to hear she stand before he with round frightened eye and quiver lip she little figure upright and still until she could bear it no longer and then she turn and flee from he through the garden door out upon the smooth grassy lawn where she fling herself down face foremost close to she favorite beech tree there give way to a burst of passionate tear i do not mean it -- oh i do not mean to break it she sob aloud uncle edward be a fearful angry man he do not love I a bit i wish i have a father i want a father like the probable son he would not be so angry and when later on nurse come with a anxious face to fetch she little charge in from the cold wet grass she have not the heart to scold she for the tear-stained face be raise so pitifully to hers with the word -- oh nurse dear carry I in you arm no one love I here i have be tell god all about it he be the only one that be not angry that evening at the accustomed time milly steal quietly into the dining-room wonder in she little heart whether she uncle be still angry with she as she climb into she chair now place on the opposite side of the large table she eye he doubtfully through she long eyelash then gather courage from the immovable expression of he face she say in she most cheerful tone -- it be a very fine night uncle be it respond sir edward who be accustom by this time to some such remark when he little niece want to attract he notice then feel really ashamed of he outburst a few hour before he say by way of excuse himself -- look here millicent you make I exceedingly angry by you piece of mischief this afternoon that statue can never be replace and you have destroy one of my most valuable possession let it be a warning for the future if ever you break anything again i shall punish you most severely do you understand yes uncle she answer look up earnestly ` you will punish I _ most _ severely ' i will remember i have be wonder why i break it when i do not mean to do it nurse say it be a most ` unfortunate accident ' i ask she what a accident be she say it be a thing that happen when you do not expect it -- a surprise she call it i be sure it be a dreadful surprise to I and to fritz too but i 'll never play ball in the hall again _ never _ a week later and sir edward be in he study absorb in he book and papers when there be a knock at he door and to he astonishment he little niece walk in this be so against all rule and regulation that he voice be very stern as he say -- what be the meaning of this intrusion millicent you know you be never allow to disturb I when here milly do not answer for a moment she walk up to she uncle she small lip tightly close and then stand in front of he with clasped hand she say -- i have come to tell you some dreadful news sir edward push aside he papers adjust he glass and see from the pallor of the child 's face and the scared expression in she eye that it be no light matter that have make she venture into he presence uncalled for it be a dreadful surprise again milly continue but i tell nurse i must tell you at once i -- i feel so bad here and she little hand be lay pathetically on she chest well what be it out with it child you be waste my time say she uncle impatiently i have -- i have break something else there be silence then sir edward ask drily -- and what be it now it be a -- a flower-pot that the gardener 's boy leave outside the tool-house i -- i -- well i put it on fritz 's head for a hat you know he do look so funny but he toss up he head and run away and it fall and it be smash to bit i have get the bit outside the door on the mat shall i bring they in a flower-pot be of such small value in sir edward 's eye that he almost smile at the child 's distress well well you must learn not to touch the flower-pot in future now run away and do not disturb I again but milly stand she ground i think you have forget uncle edward you tell I that if i break anything again you would punish I ' _ most _ severely ' those be the word you say do not you remember sir edward pull the end of he moustache and fidget uneasily in he chair he always pride himself upon be a man of he word but much regret at the present moment that he have be so rash in he speech oh ah i remember he say at length meeting he little niece 's anxious gaze with some embarrassment then pull himself together he add sternly -- of course you must be punish it be exceedingly careless and mischievous what do you nurse do when she punish you she never do punish I -- not now say milly plaintively when i be a very little girl i use to stand in the corner i do not think nurse have punish I for year sir edward be in a dilemma child 's punishment be quite unknown to he milly seem to guess at he difficulty how be you punish when you be a little boy uncle i use to be well thrash many be the whipping that i have have from my father what be a whipping -- like you give fritz when he go into the game wood yes there be a pause the child clasp she little hand tighter and set she lip firmer as she see before she eye a strong arm deal very heavy stroke with a riding-whip then she say in a awe-struck tone -- and do you think that be how you have better punish I sir edward smile grimly as he look at the baby figure standing so erect before he no he say i do not think you be a fit subject for that kind of treatment milly heave a sigh of relief and do not you know how to punish she say after some minute of awkward silence there be commiseration in she tone the situation be become ludicrous to sir edward though there be a certain amount of annoyance at feel he inability to carry out he threat nurse tell I continue he little niece gravely that she know a little boy who be shut up in a dark cupboard for a punishment but he be find nearly dead and really die the next day from fright there be a dark cupboard on the kitchen stair i do not think i should be very frightened because god will be in there with I do you think that would do this be not acceptable the child go on with knit brow : i expect the bible will tell you how to punish i remember a man who pick up stick on Sunday -- he be stone dead and elisha 's servant be make a leper and some child be kill by a bear and a prophet by a lion and anna and sophium be strike dead all of they be punish ` most severely ' be not they if you forgive I a little bit and leave out the ` most severely ' it would make it easier i expect perhaps i might do that say poor sir edward who by this time long to dispense with the punishment altogether as it be only a flower-pot i will leave out the ` most severely ' milly 's face brighten i think she say come up to he and lay one hand on he knee -- i think if i be to go to bed instead of come down to dessert with you this evening that would punish I do not you think so very well that will do now run away and let this be you last breakage i can not be worry with you punishment i will try to be very good nurse always say milly while be tuck up in bed that night because uncle edward be very puzzle when he have to punish I he do not know what to do he look quite unhappy and say it worry he and sir edward as he finish he dinner in silence and solitude mutter to himself -- that child be certainly a great nuisance at time but upon my word i quite miss she this evening child after all be original if they be nothing else and she be one of the most original that i have ever meet it be Sunday morning and sir edward be just start for church as he stand over the blaze fire in the hall button a glove a little voice come to he from the staircase : uncle edward may i come down and speak to you permission be give milly dance down the stair and then slip she little hand into she uncle 's she lift a coax face to he will you take I to church with you nurse think i be almost big enough now and i have be to church in the afternoon sometimes sir edward hesitated if you come you will fidget i expect i can not stand that i will sit as still as a mouse i will not fidget if you behave badly i shall never take you again yes you may come be quick and get ready a few moment after sir edward and he little niece be walk down the avenue she clasp a large bible under she arm and try in vain to match she step with he the squire 's pew be one of the old-fashioned high one and milly 's head do not reach the top of it very quiet and silent she be during the service and very particular to follow she uncle 's example in every respect though she nearly upset he gravity at the outset by take off she hat in imitation of he and cover she face with it but when the sermon commence she large dark eye be rivet on the clergyman as he give out the text so well know to she : -- _ i will arise and go to my father and will say unto he father i have sin against heaven and before thee and be no more worthy to be call thy son _ and though the sermon be half a hour in length she gaze never leave the pulpit uncle edward she say when they step at length turn homewards do you know i hear all the sermon and understand it pretty well except the long word be not it nice to hear about the probable son ` prodigal ' you mean can not you pronounce you word properly sir edward 's tone be irritable he have not be feel very comfortable under the good vicar 's word i can not say that i always forget it nurse say one long word be as good as another sometimes uncle what do the clergyman mean by people run away from god no one do do they a great many do be the dry response but how can they because god be everywhere no one can not get away from god and why do they want to because god love they so why do the prodigal want to get away milly consider i s ` pose he want to have some a -- aventure do not you call they i play at that you know all sort of thing happen to I before i sit down at the beech tree but -- but it be so different with god why i should be fearful unhappy if i get away from he i could not could i uncle who would take care of I and love I when i be asleep and who would listen to my prayer why uncle edward i think i should die of fright if i get away from god do tell I i could not milly have stop short and grasp hold of sir edward 's coat in she grow excitement he glance at she flushed cheek and sparkling eye you foolish child there be no fear of you get away from god do not be so excitable we will change the subject i want to see maxwell so we will go through the wood maxwell be sir edward 's head game-keeper and a little later find they at he pretty cottage at the edge of the wood it be milly 's first visit and mr maxwell a motherly-looking body greet she with such a sunshiny smile that the child draw near to she instinctively what a lovely room she exclaim look round the homely little kitchen with a child 's admire eye and what a beautiful cat may i stroke she assent be give milly be soon seat in a large cushion chair a fat tabby cat on she lap and while sir edward be occupy with he keeper she be make fast friend with the wife uncle edward she say when they have take they leave and be walk homeward mr maxwell have ask I to go to tea with she to-morrow may i -- all by myself ask you nurse i have no objection i should love to live in she house continue the child eagerly it be all among the tree and i love tree and this wood be so lovely why i might get lose in it might not i i have never be here before in my story-books child always get lose in a wood uncle edward do you think the tree talk to one another i always think they do look at they now they be just shake they head together and whisper be not they whisper very gently to-day because it be Sunday sometimes they get angry with one another and scream but i like to hear they hum and sing best nurse say it be the wind that make they do it do not you like to hear they when i lie in bed i listen to they around the house and i always want to sing with they nurse do not like it she say it be the wind moan i think it be the tree singing to god and i love they when they do it which do you think it be and so milly chat on and sir edward listen and put in a word or two occasionally and on the whole do not find he small niece bad company he tell she when they enter the house that she could go to church every Sunday morning in future with he and that send milly to the nursery with a radiant face there to confide to nurse that she have have a lovely time and be go to tea as often as she might with mr maxwell in the wood chapter iv mr maxwell 's sorrow milly spend a very happy afternoon at the keeper 's cottage the next day and come down to dessert in the evening so full of she visit that she could talk of nothing else they be so kind to I uncle mr maxwell make a hot currant cake on purpose for I and the cat have a red ribbon for company and we sit by the fire and talk when maxwell be out and she tell I such lovely story and i see a beautiful picture of the probable son in the best parlor and mr maxwell take it down and let I have a good look at it i be go to save up my money and buy one just like it for my nursery and do you know uncle -- she stop short but not for want of breath put she curly head on one side she survey she uncle for a minute meditatively then ask a little doubtfully : can you keep a secret uncle edward because i would like to tell you only you see mr maxwell do not talk about it and i tell she i would not -- at least not to the servant you know i think you can trust I sir edward say gravely this be it then and i think it be so wonderful they have get a real live probable son sir edward raise he eyebrow he little niece continue : yes they really have it be when i be talk about the picture mr maxwell take the corner of she apron and wipe she eye and say she have a dear son who have run away from home and she have not see he for nine year just fancy where be i nine year ago not bear but i must have be somewhere and milly 's active little brain now start another train of thought until she get fairly bewildered i expect i be fast asleep in god 's arm she say at length with knit brow only of course i do not remember and have settle that point to she satisfaction she continue she story : mr maxwell 's ` probable son ' be call tommy he run away when he be seventeen because he do not like the blacksmith 's shop mr maxwell and i cry about he he have such curly hair and stand six foot in he stocking and he be a _ beautiful _ baby when he be little and have croup and -- and confusion and do not come to for four hour but he would run away though he lay the fire and put stick on it and draw the water for mr maxwell before he go and mr maxwell say he may be a soldier or a sailor now for all she know and he may be drownd dead or run over or have both he leg shoot to piece or he may be in indium with the black but i tell she he be very likely take care of some pig somewhere and she get happy a little bit then and we dry we tear and she give I some peppermint to suck be not it a wonderful story uncle very wonderful be the response well we be in the middle of talk when maxwell come in so we hush because mr maxwell say ` it make my man so sad ' but do you know when maxwell be bring I home through the wood he ask I what we have be talk about and he say he know it be about the boy because he could see it in mr maxwell 's eye and then i ask he if he would run and kiss tommy when he come back and if he would make a feast and he say he would do anything to get he home again milly pause then say wistfully -- i wish i have a father uncle edward you see nurse do for a mother but father be so fond of they child be not they it do not always follow that they be sir edward reply the probable son 's father love he and maxwell love tommy and then there be david you know who really have a wicked son with long hair -- i forget he name -- and he cry dreadful when he be dead i sometimes tell god about it when i be in bed and then he -- he just seem to put he arm round I and send I off to sleep at least i think he do nurse say god like I to call he my father but of course that be not quite the same as have a father i can see maxwell be a very nice father i think i tell he i would pray for tommy every night when i go to bed and then i tell he that god have lot of probable son too -- the clergyman say so on Sunday do not he -- people who have run away from he i have be ask god to make they come back i hope he will let I know when they do do you know any one who have run away from god uncle you be chatter too much child say sir edward irritably sit still and be quiet milly instantly obey and after some moment of silence she uncle say -- i do not mind you go to maxwell 's cottage but you must never take fritz with you he be not allow in that wood at all do you quite understand yes but i be very sorry for fritz do not like be leave behind the tear be in he eye when nurse tell he he be not to go with I you see no one talk to he like i do he like I to tell he story and i tell he when i come back about my visit so he want to go but i will not take he with I if you say no when she be leave he that night for bed she pause a moment as she wish he good-night uncle edward when you say you prayer to-night will you ask god to make tommy come back home he mother do want he so badly i will leave you to do that be the curt reply well if you do not want to pray for tommy pray for god 's probable son will not you do uncle edward mrs maxwell say the only thing that comfort she be ask god to bring tommy back sir edward make no reply only dismiss she more peremptorily than usual and when she have leave the room he lean he arm on the chimney piece and rest he head on they gaze silently into the fire with a knit brow he thought do not soothe he for he presently raise he head with a short laugh

packet of letter in he hand he stop and glance at the little fur-clad figure as she stand there eager anticipation write on she face and he thought go back to the time when he as a boy look upon a day 's visit to the neighboring town -- nine mile away -- as one of he greatest pleasure yes he say slowly fumble in he waistcoat pocket you can get I some pen and blot paper at the stationer 's i will write down the kind i want and here be the money keep the change and buy anything you like with it milly 's cheek flush with delight as she take the money -- what a lot it will buy she say thank you very much indeed i be want to buy something my own self and i have only a little cook give I but now i shall be quite rich it be late in the afternoon when nurse and she little charge drive back and sir edward meet they come up the avenue milly 's face be clouded and there be trace of tear on she cheek and this be such a unusual sight that sir edward inquire of the nurse what be the matter she have not be good sir i be sorry to say it be not often that i have to pull she up but she have give I such a fright and trouble this afternoon as i be not likely to forget in a hurry what have she be do but never mind i will not detain you now i can hear about it when we get in nurse be evidently very disturb in mind for she pour into sir edward 's ear directly they be inside the hall a confused story : -- i be in the grocer 's sir and i know i should be there some time for cook she give I so many commission i have to write a long list of they i say to miss milly ` you can stand outside but do not go a step farther ' she know she be never allow to speak to such people i have know as i tell she child be carry bodily off and set down at a street corner with hardly a rag on they back and to think of she march off with he and never a thought of my anxiety -- and the way i go rush up and down the street -- and the policeman -- they be perfectly useless to help a person but can only stare at you and grin i be sure i never expect to light eye on she again and i lose my purse and my best umbrella i leave they both somewhere but it be nigh on two hour i spend and my shopping not near do and he the greatest look rascal that one might see come out of jail i be sure i should not have be so angry but to see she smile face as if she have not do any wrong at all nor disobey I flatly and most likely put herself in the way of catch the most infectious disease from the very look of he and run the risk of be rob and perhaps murder and not a idea in she head that she be a very naughty child but quite expect I to see the reasonableness of it all nurse stop for breath whilst milly 's hang head heave chest and quick sob show that by this time nurse 's word have quite convinced she of she wrong-doing sir edward be surprise at the interest he feel in he little niece 's trouble i be afraid i can not understand you story nurse he say quietly but i daresay miss millicent will tell I herself come into the study child with I he take she hand in he and lead she away while nurse look after he in astonishment and ford the old butler standing by say with great solemnity -- you may well stare nurse mark my word that child will be able to twist he round with she little finger one of these day i see it a-developin ' it will be a terrible come-down to the master -- but there i will say that the woman always conquer and they begin it when they be in short frock i do not see the remarkableness in a gentleman take notice of he own sister 's child return nurse testily the wonder be that he should hold she at arm 's length as he do and treat she as if she be a dog or a piece of furniture without any feeling and she he own flesh and blood too there be no ` come down ' to have a spark of humanity in he breast occasionally and nurse sail upstairs the loss of she purse and umbrella have considerably ruffle she usually even temper sir edward seat himself by the study fire and milly stand before he one little hand rest upon he knee and the other hold she tiny handkerchief to she eye and vainly try to restrain she sob now suppose you stop cry and tell I what have happen she uncle say feeling move at see he usually self-contained little niece in such grief milly apply she handkerchief vigorously to she eye and look up with quiver lip she say -- i do not mean to be naughty uncle nurse have not be angry with I like she be now for _ year _ and i be _ so _ unhappy the pitiful tone and look touch sir edward 's heart and on the impulse of the moment he do what he have never as yet attempt -- lift she upon he knee and tell she to proceed with she story and milly after a final struggle with she tear get the better of they and be able to give he a pretty clear account of what have happen i have buy you pen and blotting-paper uncle and be go to a picture-shop to spend the rest of my money when nurse have finish at the grocer 's i be stand outside when i see a man come along he limp and he hat be break in and he be so ragged that i think he must be a probable son and then i think he might be tommy go home and when i think that i could not think of nothing else and i forget all about nurse and i forget she tell I to stay there and i run after he as hard as i could i catch he up and he look very astonished when i ask he be he name tommy he say ` no ' and he laugh at I and then i ask he be he a probable son because he look like one he say he do not know what kind of person that be and then i have to explain it to he he tell I he have never have a home to run away from so that would not do but he really look just like the man i have see in mr maxwell 's picture and i tell he so and then i find out what he be and i be so sorry and yet i be so glad milly pause and she large expressive eye shine as she turn they up to she uncle 's face and she voice drop almost to a whisper as she say -- i find out he be one of god 's probable son when i ask he if he have run away from god he say yes he suppose he have do that so of course he be ragged and unhappy that be not always the case put in sir edward half touch half amuse sometimes it be very rich people who run away from god and they get richer when they be away from he milly look puzzle but they can not be happy uncle oh they never can be perhaps not well i talk to this poor man till we have walk quite away from

with he but he would not because he be too good for he and i ask he why he would not go to he now and he say he could not tramp back again to london it be too far and he have no money so then i open my purse and we count over my money together and he say it be just enough to take he back if i would lend it to he so of course i do and he ask I my name and where i live and i tell he the scoundrel mutter sir edward milly pause why be you look so angry uncle i be so glad to give he the money and then we talk a good deal and i begged he not to be one of god 's probable son any more fancy he would

oblivion he accuse memory it be a cold gray afternoon mr maxwell 's little kitchen be in perfect order the fire shed flicker light on the bright dish-cover on the wall and the blue and white china on the old-fashioned dresser be touch with a ruddy glow mr maxwell herself seat in a wooden rocking-chair in spotless white apron be knit busily as she talk and milly on a low stool the tabby in she arm with she golden-brown curl in pretty disorder and she large dark eye gaze earnestly into the fire complete the picture do you like winter mr maxwell she be ask well my dear i can not say as i do not prefer the summer but there -- the almighty send it and it must be right and i do not think folk have a right to grumble and go rush off to they foreign part a-leave they own country and the weather

this morning they be really i tell they they would be happy when next summer come but they sigh and shake they head it be such a long time to wait and they have nothing to do -- they can only stand still i be very sad this morning after i have talk to they i go down to the plantation at the bottom of the lawn and on the way i come to a poor dead frog fritz sniff at he but he do not seem to be sorry i do not know how he die i think perhaps he have stay out in the cold and get freeze he feel so very cold i take he up and bury he and i wonder if he mother would miss he and then i go on a little farther and there be some little bird 's feather all in a heap on the ground i feel sure a cruel cat have be eat it up and i could not help cry for everything seem to be die and when i get to the plantation i be a little comfort for the fir-tree look so comfortable and warm -- they have not lose they leaf like the other tree -- but do you know in the middle of they all be a tall thin bare tree -- he look so lonely and unhappy and he be the only one without any leave one of those birch i expect my man he say the other day that the fir plantation yonder want weed out well i could not bear to see he so sad so i creep right in amongst the fir until i get to he and then i put my arm right round he and cuddle he tight i tell he god would take care of he and give he a beautiful new green dress next summer but he seem to feel the cold and i expect the other tree be not very kind to he i always think the fir be very stiff and proud i -- i kiss he before i come away it be a sad morning milly 's tone be truly pathetic and mr maxwell who love to hear she childish fancy and never laugh at they now look up from she knitting sympathetically -- you be sad yourself dear be you uncle pretty well to-day i think he be get better but he must not talk and nurse will not let I see he i think it be winter make I sad mr maxwell there be silence for a few moment milly stroke she cat

little apple dumple as i put in the oven for some one be smell as if it want to come out be mrs maxwell 's brisk response as she bustle out of she chair she old eye moist with feeling in a instant milly 's pensiveness have disappear a baked apple dumpling have great charm for she and no one would have believe that the light-hearted child with the merry laugh now dance around the room and climb up to the dresser for a plate be the same as the one who have so sadly discourse a few moment before on the mournfulness of winter and of she orphan state do you make such nice apple dumpling for tommy she ask presently busy with she fork and spoon and look supremely content with herself and surroundings ah do not i i mind when he use to come in on saturday from the forge i always have a hot

to I milly 's little face glow with pleasure at the thought and she turn she expressive eye toward she uncle who lay with knit brow listen to she and suppose if god would not receive you suppose you

will have to say ' _ put a ring on he hand and shoe on he foot _ ' mr maxwell have get a pair of carpet slipper i could not bear she not have any shoe ready for he so we look about and find a pair that be just too small for maxwell and i put they in the drawer my own self mr maxwell say he will not want a ring and that she think the bible people dress differently and she say tommy be a poor man 's son : it be not as if he be rich but i do not know i do not like to think we have no ring for he i suppose you have not one uncle that you would like to give he sir edward put he head back on he cushion and laugh aloud then note milly 's troubled face he say : wait till tommy come back little woman and then it will be time enough to see about he ring though i quite agree with he mother that it would be most unfitting you have have the picture i give you take away uncle say milly presently she quick eye rove round the room ah you have have it hang up on the wall that be nice there you can see it from you bed do not you like look at it do not it make you feel happy i can not say it do reply sir edward glancing at the picture in question why ought it to make I feel happy oh it be so nice to think he be just get home after be away so long i wonder if he be a great time walk back how long do you think it take one of god 's prodigal son to get back to he uncle i should say a very long time indeed say sir edward slowly but how long two day or six hour or a week it would depend perhaps on how long they have be away from he it be rather hard to understand say milly wrinkle she little brow perplexedly because god be everywhere be not he and i should have think he would have be close by they all the time i be ask nurse about it and she say that god be near they only they would not have anything to say to he and do bad thing and shut the lord jesus out of they heart and let satan in and then god have to leave they till they say they say they be sorry i suppose directly they say : ' _ father i have sin against heaven and in thy sight and be no more worthy to be call thy son _ ' then god just fold they in he arm and forgive they and take they back again be not that it look here i think we have have enough of this subject talk about something else sir edward 's tone be irritable milly 's ready tongue obey nurse say it be so cold to-day that she think it will snow do you think it will it be quite smoky by the river nurse say it be a fog i wonder where it all come from do you think it might be god 's breath uncle as she be chat on suddenly there come a sharp knock at the door and a visitor appear think i would look you up for i hear you be on the sick list good gracious you have be pretty bad have not you will you put I up for a night or two i expect you want a little cheerful company talk volubly major lovell -- for it be he -- come forward and look with real concern on sir edward 's altered face i be very glad to see you say the latter heartily hold out he hand come and stay for as long as you like i be sick to death of my own society and be this the small party that arrive so unexpectedly when i be here before inquire major lovell look down at milly who still sit in the big chair regard the new-comer with she large brown eye yes say sir edward a faint smile hover about he lip as he remember he horror of she advent she be take charge of I this afternoon milly hold out she little hand with all the grace of a duchess i remember you she say you be one of the gentleman that laugh at I i do not think i could have be guilty of such rudeness surely now i think you may run away sir edward say and tell nurse i will ring when i want she milly obey and confide to nurse that she hope the new gentleman would not keep she away from she uncle for do you know nurse i like uncle edward so much better when he be in bed he look so sad and speak so softly i wish i could sit with he every day major lovell be a distant cousin of sir edward and there exist a warm friendship between they the very brightness of he tone seem to do the invalid good and milly be quite delighted to find that she uncle 's visitor not only listen with interest to the account of she favorite game and pastime but insist upon join she in they and the wall of the quiet old house ring again with merry mirth and laughter such as they have not know for year upstairs in the sick room major lovell prove a wonderfully patient and skillful nurse but there be time when all he bright cheeriness could not smooth the furrow in the invalid 's brow or take away the fretfulness of tone one morning major lovell come down from a interview with he with a puzzle expression of face catch sight of milly in the hall equip in hat and jacket he ask -- be you go out with nurse no nurse be busy -- just by my own self in the avenue with fritz do come with I the major consent but with a graver face than usual and then suddenly very full of he own thought say to the child -- i believe you uncle have something on he mind it strike I from different thing he have let drop that he be turn pious what be pious inquire milly instantly what be it a pious person think every one wicked but themselves and condemn everybody and everything all round they they be most objectionable people little woman so mind you never take up that line and the worst of it be that they be so satisfied with they own goodness that you can not crush they try as much as you may and be uncle edward go to be like they ask the child with a perplexed face i devoutly hope not i shall do all in my power to prevent it what do pious people do question milly do they give tract away and sing hymn and pull long face over very well-bound bible i like singing hymn assert milly very emphatically everybody sing hymn to god do not they i listen to the bird sometimes and wish i could sing like they and the tree sing and the bee and fly everything seem to sing out of door in the summer time but they have nearly all drop asleep now till next year what hymn do you sing major lovell bless the child what do you take I for and the major laugh heartily as he speak then with a twinkle in he eye he go on gravely -- i shall begin to think that you be pious if you do not take care what else do you do besides sing hymn i have a bible say milly solemnly and i just love it and what make you love such a dry book as the bible you can not understand a word of it oh i can major lovell it be beautiful i love nurse to read and read it to I it tell about jesus you know and i love jesus and he love I and it have such nice story in it major lovell give a long low whistle ah he say shake he head comically at the little figure walking by he side i be very much afraid you may be at the bottom of it all do you read the bible to you uncle do you tell he that he have be waste he life and not fulfil the end for which he be create in fact that he be a wicked sinner for that have be the substance of he talk with I this morning uncle edward be a very good man milly reply warmly i do not know what you mean major lovell do not you read the bible what will you think of I if i tell you i do not perhaps you know it all by heart i expect that be why i rather think i do not you must not begin to catechise I too severely who have bring you up in this pious fashion i be not pious you say they be horrid people but i think all the grown-up people read the bible except people like jack who be jack he be a prodigal son one of god 's prodigal son and what be they may i ask milly do not answer for a minute then she stop short and say very solemnly raise she large dark eye to the major 's face -- i wonder if you be a prodigal son uncle edward say there be some rich one have you run away from god major lovell oh come now say the major pinch she cheek good-naturedly i do not bargain for this when i come out with you you must keep you sermon for some one else come along to the stable with I and i will give you a ride in a instant milly 's gravity disappear and a little time afterwards she be laugh gleefully as she be be trot round the stable-yard on a large bay mare but she say to she nurse when she come in -- major lovell be very nice but very funny and i can not always understand he talk he say such difficult thing chapter viii he arise and come to he father major lovell stay a week and sir edward seem the better for he company as far as he bodily health be concerned but at heart he be very wretched and he cousin 's influence be not the sort to help he now old chap make haste and

sir edward respond -- no thanks i prefer be at home this christmas why i doubt if i shall leave my room by that time i be as weak as a baby the week before christmas sir edward be in a easy chair in the library and though still a invalid be now make rapid progress towards recovery he be con over a article he have just write before a blaze fire when there be a knock at the door a frown come to he

a large piece of holly in she arm -rrb- most certainly not it be much too late in the afternoon for you to be go down there it be get quite dark and as to one of my cattle be dispose of in that way i should not dream of allow it for one moment milly 's eye fill with tear which she vainly try to restrain when she uncle speak to she in that tone she know it be useless to remonstrate they 'll be have the feast without I she say with a little sob in she voice mr maxwell promise I i should be there when they have it and i be longing to see tommy then if mr maxwell promise you that she will put off she feast till to-morrow say sir edward in a softer tone and now be a sensible little woman and wait patiently till the time come you may be sure he parent will like to have he to themselves the first night run away now i do not want to be disturbed poor little milly creep out of the room feeling very crestfallen and a short time after be lie on the hearth-rug before the nursery fire she arm wound round fritz 's neck confide to he the whole story and comforting herself by conjecture how and where the meeting have take place she little mind be so full of the subject that it be long before nurse could get she to sleep that night she last word before she drop off be -- i wonder who will do the music and dance the next morning the instant she breakfast be over milly obtain nurse 's permission to go down to the keeper 's cottage under charge of sarah the nursery maid she be away the whole morning and about one o'clock a message come from mr maxwell to ask if she might stay to dinner with they so that it be not till nearly four in the afternoon that she be bring up to the house and then flush and excite she pour into she nurse 's ear a long account of all that she have be hear and do now come my dear you must not talk forever be nurse 's remonstrance at last sir edward tell I i could send you to he for a little when you come in and i must make you tidy first it be quite dusk when milly enter the library but the bright firelight show she the figure of she uncle lean back in he easy chair and indulge in a reverie well he say look round where have you be all day down at maxwell 's i suppose yes say milly sedately and i 'll tell you all about it if you like may i make myself comfortable first and after a minute 's hesitation she climb into the heavy armchair on the opposite side of the fireplace make a pretty picture as she lean she curly head back on the cushion and gaze earnestly into she uncle 's face we will have a crack together uncle that be what maxwell call it when mr maxwell and i talk over the fire may i tell you all about tommy now you may be the amuse reply well you know i run as fast as i could down to the wood this morning and sarah run after I and mr maxwell see I come and she run to the door i be rather out of breath you see so she just smooth I down a little and we kiss each other and she cry a tiny bit for i feel she tear on my face then she take I in to see tommy -- maxwell be out and tommy be in the kitchen in one of maxwell 's great-coat and he be eat some bacon at the table for he breakfast he get up when he see I -- he be a nice big man uncle but i think he hair want cut we shake hand and i tell he i would be expect he ever so long he look rather shy but after he have quite finish he breakfast we have a very nice talk and mr maxwell go bustling about get dinner ready tommy tell I all about himself from the very begin but i really quite forget some of it he never keep any pig at all but he keep some sheep instead -- he go out to america and do it -- and then he be a railway man and then he have a fever and then he get into bad company and at last he come to london and he be a omnibus man there and then a cabman and then he drink too much beer and he money all go away and he be ashamed of himself and so he would not write home and then he smash he cab against the lamp-post and then he drink too much again i do not think you need tell I any more of he misdoing say sir edward drily but you see he have to get very bad before he get good because he be a prodigal son and he be sorry now he say he never never would have come home until he be a good man only one day he listen to a man preach a sermon in the middle of a street on a Sunday night and he feel uncomfortable and then he be speak to after by -- now guess uncle who do you think sir edward could not guess so milly go on triumphantly : why it be my jack and he begin to talk to he and tell he he be like he once and he say he be look out for a tommy maxwell now be not that wonderful when it be tommy himself he speak to well tommy say he have not the face to go home till he be better but jack tell he not to wait a day longer for he father and mother be wait for he but the strange thing be that even then tommy wait a whole two week before he make up he mind to come now do not you think he be foolish uncle very foolish i could not quite understand it but nurse say there be lot of people like that wait to make themselves better instead of run home just as they be she say some of god 's prodigal son do that do you think many do uncle i daresay and tommy say though he want to see he home again dreadfully he have a great fight with himself to come at all i do not know prodigal son find it so difficult -- the one in the bible do not not when he once make up he mind well and so tommy get out at the station -- i be sorry he come by train but jack 's uncle pay for he ticket -- i would rather he have run the whole way why would you ask sir edward with a smile i think it would have be more proper if he have say the child slowly she head a little on one side as she gaze thoughtfully into the fire i always run or walk the whole way when i play the prodigal son i begin rather slowly because it look a long way off but when i come near i hurry i be want to be there when i see my home the prodigal son do not have a train in the bible and i think tommy might have try to do without it the tone of reproach at the end of she speech be too much for she uncle 's gravity and he laugh aloud i be afraid tommy have sadly disappointed you do he take a cab from the station no he do not do that he get home in the afternoon and maxwell be clean he gun on the doorstep when he see a shadow and he look up and there he be oh i should like to have be there but i be sorry to say maxwell do not fall on he neck and kiss he i ask tommy very carefully about it and he say he take hold of both he hand and squeeze they tight and he give a shout and mr maxwell be do she wash in the back yard and she hear it and she shake all over so that she could hardly walk she cry so much when she see tommy that maxwell have to pat she on the back and give she a glass of water and tommy he sit down on the little seat inside the porch and he say -- these be he very word uncle -- ' i be not fit to come home father i be a disgrace to you name ' and mr maxwell -- tommy tell I -- she just take he head between she two hand and draw it to rest on she shoulder and then she bent down and kiss he all over and she say : -- ` my boy who should you come to when you be in disgrace and trouble but you own father and mother ' tommy say when he tell I this ` it fair break my heart miss ' and then he give a great sob and i begin to cry and then mr maxwell come up and she hand be all floury for she be make a apple pudding and she cry too and then we all cry together -- at least tommy turn he head away and pretend he do not but i see he do milly pause for breath and she eye look wistfully into the glowing coal before she i do not know prodigal son be sad when they come back but tommy seem so sad that he make I sad too why do you think tommy cry uncle sir edward do not reply he be gaze dreamily into the fire and something of the wistfulness in he little niece 's face seem to be reflect in he he give a start after a moment 's silence eh child what be you say have you finish you story why no uncle not nearly be you tired nurse say i must not tire you too much sir edward laugh but it be not a happy laugh oh finish you story by all means little woman he say and milly continue : -- we all cheer up when mr maxwell ask I if i would like to stay to dinner i ask if it be the feast and she laugh and say ` yes ' she have a roast leg of pork in the oven with some stuffing and apple sauce and uncle it be lovely maxwell come in just in time and he look so happy and then we all sit down to dinner but i ask maxwell to say first before we begin : ' _ let we eat and be merry for this my son be dead and be alive again he be lose and be find _ ' he fold he hand and say it like grace and mr maxwell say ` aman ' when he have finish and wipe she eye with she apron i tell they we must all be very merry but tommy be not i be afraid he keep look first at mr maxwell and then all round the kitchen and then at maxwell and then he sigh very big sigh he say he could not believe he be at home but he tell I when i ask he quietly afterwards that he be really very happy he only sigh and look sad because he think how foolish he have be to stay away so long i be very sorry for one thing about he uncle he be not in he best clothes they be all too small for he and the slipper would not fit he but maxwell say he will buy he some new one to-morrow and tommy tell I he would not wear a ring if he have one he ask I why he should so i tell he about the prodigal son in the bible -- he seem to like hear about it and he say he think he be very like he and then i ask about the music and dancing i want to have that but we could not manage it mr maxwell say we have music in we heart how can we have that uncle i do not hear any in mine for i keep silent and listen for it i expect she mean you be so happy that you do not want any music to make you happier i be very happy oh uncle edward why will not all the prodigal son go home i can not think why they like stay away it be so lovely to think of tommy now and every one would be just as happy would not they i do not think all young man have such fond parent as you friend tommy have say sir edward gravely have not they well god 's prodigal son could not have a nicer father i lie and think of they when i be in bed sometimes and i talk to god about they i be so glad when jack go back to he i think it be worst of all to stay a long way off from god because he do love they so i wonder if it be that they do not know whether god will take they back tommy seem half afraid till he come that he father would be angry with he i should like to see a prodigal son run back into god 's arm so much but i suppose he do it very quietly and only the angel look down and see it and what be this young scapegrace go to do now live on he father and mother or be he go to try and do some honest work sir edward 's tone be rather impatient milly look up surprised do you mean tommy uncle be you angry with he he tell I he be go to look for work directly and maxwell be come up to speak to you about he to-morrow ah i daresay -- want he to take the place of under-keeper i suppose and sir edward give a little grunt of dissatisfaction at the think chapter ix a little child shall lead they when sir edward retire to he room that night he pace up and down for some time in front of he little niece 's picture that she have give he he brow be knit and he be think deeply i be longing to have peace he mutter why can not i make up my mind to seek it ' _ i will arise _ ' -- ay easy to say it be a hard and bitter thing for a backslider to retrace he step how the child stab I sometimes and how little she know my past he stop and gaze at the picture and the lord himself use this as a illustration i could not want anything stronger a deep-drawn sigh follow then a heartfelt cry rise to heaven may god have mercy on I and bring I back for i can not bring myself the next morning sir edward have a interview with he keeper who bring he son up with he and as the tall broad-shouldered young fellow stand before the squire and in earnest humble tone ask if he could be give a chance of redeem he character by be employ on the estate sir edward 's severity relax and after a long conversation with he he promise he would give he a trial he smile grimly to himself as father and son leave he with warm expression of gratitude so that be the child 's hero one whose example i might well follow he have have the courage at last to take the step from which i be still shrink why should i fear that my welcome home would be less full of love and forgiveness than he it be christmas eve a wild and stormy day the wind rage ceaselessly round the old house howl down the chimney and beat the branch of the tree outside against the window pane milly have be very busy for some hour help ford to decorate the hall and room with holly and evergreen though ford would every now and then pause in he work say : there miss milly i be sure we be overdo it if the house be full of company now i would take a pride in it but i do not believe the master will notice whether it be do or not it seem to I as he be get more and more shut up into hisself lately christma be a dull time with we all be finish at last and milly go up to the nursery and stand at the window she bright brown eye eagerly scanning and take note of every object out of door it be a perfect hurricane say nurse presently as she sit with she work in a comfortable chair by the fire if we feel it inland like this what must it be at sea i should like to be on the sea say milly i love the wind but i think it be get a little bit too rough this afternoon i be rather afraid it will hurt the little tree ford say if i go out i should be blow away do you think nurse if the wind be very very strong it would ever be able to blow I up to heaven i be afraid not say nurse gravely and i do not think we could spare you my dear you would not like to leave this world yet awhile sometimes i think i should and sometimes i think i should not i think i should like to be blow up to spend a day there and then come back again oh nurse goliath be scream and crack so i wish the wind would knock he over he be a horrid old tree i always think he be make face at I when i run past he would not it be nice to see he blow down you must not wish that say nurse get up from she chair and move towards the door it be a dangerous thing for a old tree to be blow down now i be go downstairs for a short time so be a good child and do not get into mischief while i be away milly remain at the window for some minute after nurse 's departure then she quick eye notice a poor wretched little kitten mew pitifully as she vainly try to shelter herself from the violent blast by crouch close to a tree in a instant without thought of consequence the child dart to the nursery door and down the broad oak staircase poor pussy i will run and fetch she in i expect she have run away from the kitchen sir edward be write at he study table when a unusually violent gust of wind cause he to raise he eye and glance out of the window there to he amazement he see under the old oak tree on the lawn he little niece she golden brown curl fly as she battle with the element and struggle vainly to stoop and take the kitten in she arm he start up from he seat but as he do so a blast that shake the house sweep by there be a awful crack then a crash and to he horror a huge limb of the old oak come with a awful thud upon the very spot where he little niece be stand my god save she be he agonized cry as he see at the same moment the little figure stagger and fall then forget he weakness and lack of physical strength he dash out of the house and in another instant be stand over she he first feeling be one of intense thankfulness to find that the branch in fall could have only slightly graze she as she be lie on the ground untouched by it but as he raise the motionless figure and note a red mark on she forehead which be swell rapidly he heart sink within he it do not take he long to carry she into she house and he be meet at the door by nurse who wisely waste no time in useless lamentation but set to work at once to restore animation to she little charge she effort be successful milly be only slightly stunned but it have be a miraculous escape and have the blow be a inch nearer she temple it might have be fatal as it be the child be more frightened than hurt and when a little time after she uncle take she in he arm with unwonted tenderness she cling to he and burst into passionate sob take care of I uncle that nasty old goliath he try to kill I he do i see he come on the top of I god only just save I in time do not he when the bruise have be bath and dress by nurse sir edward still keep she on he knee and after nurse have leave the room and the child rest she little head on he shoulder in a very subdue frame of mind he do what he have never do yet -- stoop over she and kiss she saying : you have be very near death this afternoon little one and i could ill have spare you milly raise she large dark eye to he if i have die i should have go straight up to god should not i yes you would i should have like that i suppose he do not want I yet or he would have send for I when she come down to she uncle that evening she raise a very sad little face to he from the opposite side of the table uncle edward have you hear who goliath really do kill do you mean the tree that come on you no one else be hurt i hope and sir edward 's tone be a little anxious she be kill dead -- quite dead and mangled nurse say it be the poor little kitten uncle that i run out to fetch the brown eye be swim with tear and milly could not understand the smile that come to sir edward 's lip only a kitten well it be sad i daresay but there be plenty of kitten about the place but uncle i have be think so much about this one ford say she have run away from the stable i expect she be go to be a prodigal kitten perhaps and now she 'll never run away any more it be so sad about she and i think why it be sad be because nobody care not even nurse she say she would rather it have be the kitten than I poor little kitty she mother will be miss she so to-night do you think uncle the wind or goliath kill she i think it be goliath i just look out of my window on the stair before i come down the wind have stop now and the tree seem to be cry and sob together i be sure they be sorry for kitty i think they be tire out themselves too they have be so knock about to-day i wish so much i have be just in time to save the dear little kitten we will not talk about she any more say sir edward cheerfully have you see tom maxwell lately milly 's little tongue be only too ready to talk of he he help nurse and I to get some holly in the wood yesterday i have nice talk with he often he say he be very happy and this will be the best christmas he have spend in he life uncle i want to ask you something i have be think of it a great deal to-day only since i be knock down this afternoon i have have such a pain in my head i leave off thinking but i

make nurse a kettleholder and cook a needlebook and i have buy a penknife for ford and a thimble for sarah and some handkerchief for maxwell and mr maxwell and some woolen glove for tommy and i have nothing -- no nothing for he if i only know something he would like she pause and a soft wistfulness come into she eye i be think she go on that perhaps i could put my present for he outside the nursery window on the ledge and then when we be all in bed and it be very quiet i expect he might send a angel down to bring it up to he i think he might do that because he know how much i want to give he something but then i do not know what to give he could you tell I uncle i think say sir edward gravely the only way you can give he a christmas present be to give something to the poor he would rather have that i will give you this to put in the plate to-morrow in church and sir edward put he hand in he pocket and roll a coin across the table to he little niece but milly be not satisfy this be you present she say doubtfully what will you give he this christmas besides be money the only thing you can give he uncle sir edward push back he chair and rise from the table he feeling be almost get beyond he control with the one subject that be now always foremost in he thought the child 's question ring again in he ear be money the only thing you can give he uncle and like a flash of light come a reply : no i can give myself back to he my soul and body that have now be so long in the keep of he enemy after a few minute ' silence he say in a strangely quiet voice : come little one it be bedtime say ` good-night ' and run up to nurse milly come up to he and as he stand with he back to the fire warm he hand she take hold of the end of he coat in she little hand and look up at he say : uncle edward you give I a kiss like a father might have do this afternoon would you mind very much give I another sir edward look down at the sweet little face raise so coaxingly to he and then take she up in he arm but after he have give she the desire kiss he say with some effort -- i want you to do something to-night little one when you say you prayer ask that one of god 's prodigal son may be bring back this christmas time it be one who want to return will you pray for he yes uncle reply the child softly and will you tell I he name no i can not do that something in he face make he little niece refrain from ask further question she leave he a moment later and sir edward go to the smoking-room and seat himself in a chair by the fire the chime of the village church be ring out merrily and presently outside in the avenue a little company of carol singer be sing the sweet old christmas truth that none can hear untouched _ glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward man _ a sense of the love of god seem to surround he soul and this verse come into he mind as he muse : -- _ i have love thee with a everlasting love therefore with loving-kindness have i draw thee _ could he not trace in the event of the last few month the hand of a loving father gently call he wanderer home stricken down himself place on a sick bed for reflection bring to the edge of the valley of the shadow of death and then tenderly restore to life and health the gentle voice and life of a little child plead with he day by day and that life have so lately be miraculously preserve from a great danger -- all this fill he heart with the realization of the mercy and loving-kindness of god and when again the past come up before he and the tempter draw near again with the old refrain you have wander too long you have harden you heart and god have shut he ear to you cry sir edward by the help and power of the divine spirit be able to look up and say from the depths of he heart -- _ father i have sin against heaven and in thy sight and be no more worthy to be call thy son _ they be sit in the study the next afternoon the child upon he knee when sir edward say suddenly -- do you know that i have receive a letter to-day about you who from ask milly with interest from my sister you aunt in australium i write to she when you come and she want to have you out there and bring you up among she own child she say a friend of hers will take charge of you and take you to she next month i must talk to nurse about it the little hand clutch hold of he coat sleeve tightly but not a word do milly say sir edward note a slight quivering of the lip and a piteous gleam in the soft brown eye he wait in silence for a moment then say cheerfully -- will not you be glad to have a lot of boy and girl to play with instead of stay here with a lonely old man still the child say nothing but suddenly down go the curly head upon he arm and the tear come thick and fast sir edward raise the little face to he -- we must not have tear on christmas day he say what be the matter do not you want to go i suppose i must sob milly ford tell nurse the day i come that you hate

when i get there i wish god want I but i be afraid he do not nurse say she think he want I to work for he when i grow up i think -- i think i be rather like the little kitten yesterday that nobody be sorry for when she die you say there be plenty more kitten do not you i do not think there be plenty of small millicent in this world and sir edward 's voice be husky now listen little woman i have be
