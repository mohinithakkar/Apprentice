vision i come here eight year ago as the renter of this farm of which soon afterward i become the owner the time before that i like to forget the chief impression it leave upon my memory now happily grow indistinct be of be hurry faster than i could well travel from the moment as a boy of seventeen i first begin to pay my own way my day be order by a inscrutable power which drive I hourly to my task i be rarely allow to look up or down but always forward toward that vague success which we american love to glorify my sens my nerve even my muscle be continually strain to the utmost of attainment if i loitered or pause by the wayside as it seem natural for I to do i soon hear the sharp crack of the lash for many year and i can say it truthfully i never rest i neither think nor reflect i have no pleasure even though i pursue it fiercely during the brief respite of vacation through many feverish year i do not work : i merely produce the only real thing i do be to hurry as though every moment be my last as though the world which now seem so rich in everything hold only one prize which might be seize upon before i arrive since then i have try to recall like one who struggle to restore the vision of a fever what it be that i run to attain or why i should have bear without rebellion such indignity to soul and body that life seem now of all illusion the most distant and unreal it be like the unguessed eternity before we be bear : not of concern compare with that eternity upon which we be now embark all these thing happen in city and among crowd i like to forget they they smack of that slavery of the spirit which be so much worse than any mere slavery of the body one day -- it be in April i remember and the soft maple in the city park be just begin to blossom -- i stop suddenly i do not intend to stop i confess in humiliation that it be no courage no will of my own i intend to go on toward success : but fate stop I it be as if i have be throw violently from a move planet : all the universe stream around I and past I it seem to I that of all animate creation i be the only thing that be still or silent until i stop i have not know the pace i run and i have a vague sympathy and understanding never feel before for those who leave the run i lay prostrate with fever and close to death for week and watch the world go by : the dust the noise the very color of haste the only sharp pang that i suffer be the feeling that i should be broken-hearted and that i be not that i should care and that i do not it be as though i have die and escape all further responsibility i even watch with dim equanimity my friend race past I pant as they run some of they pause a instant to comfort I where i lay but i could see that they mind be still upon the running and i be glad when they go away i can not tell with what weariness they haste oppress I as for they they somehow blame I for drop out i know until we ourselves understand we accept no excuse from the man who stop while i feel it all i be not bitter i do not seem to care i say to myself : this be unfitness i survive no longer so be it thus i lay and presently i begin to hunger and thirst desire rise within I : the indescribable longing of the convalescent for the food of recovery so i lay question wearily what it be that i require one morning i waken with a strange new joy in my soul it come to I at that moment with indescribable poignancy the thought of walk barefoot in cool fresh plow furrow as i have once do when a boy so vividly the memory come to I -- the high airy world as it be at that moment and the boy i be walk free in the furrow -- that the weak tear fill my eye the first i have shed in many year then i thought of sit in quiet thicket in old fence corner the wood behind I rise still cool mysterious and the field in front stretch away in illimitable pleasantness i thought of the good smell of cow at milk -- you do not know if you do not know -- i thought of the sight and sound the heat and sweat of the hay field i thought of a certain brook i know when a boy that flow among alder and wild parsnip where i wade with a three-foot rod for trout i thought of all these thing as a man think of he first love oh i crave the soil i hunger and thirst for the earth i be greedy for grow thing and thus eight year ago i come here like one sore-wounded creep from the field of battle i remember walk in the sunshine weak yet but curiously satisfied i that be dead live again it come to I then with a curious certainty not since so assure that i understand the chief marvel of nature hide within the story of the resurrection the marvel of plant and seed father and son the wonder of the season the miracle of life i too have die : i have lie long in darkness and now i have rise again upon the sweet earth and i possess beyond other a knowledge of a former existence which i know even then i could never return to for a time in the new life i be happy to drunkenness -- work eat sleep i be a animal again let out to run in green pasture i be glad of the sunrise and the sunset i be glad at noon it delight I when my muscle ache with work and when after supper i could not keep my eye open for sheer weariness and sometimes i be awaken in the night out of a sound sleep -- seemingly by the very silence -- and lay in a sort of bodily comfort impossible to describe i do not want to feel or to think : i merely want to live in the sun or the rain i want to go out and come in and never again know the pain of the unquiet spirit i look forward to a awakening not without dread for we be as helpless before birth as in the presence of death but like all birth it come at last suddenly all that summer i have work in a sort of animal content autumn have now come late autumn with coolness in the evening air i be plow in my upper field -- not then mine in fact -- and it be a soft afternoon with the earth turn up moist and fragrant i have be walk the furrow all day long i have take note as though my life depend upon it of the occasional stone or root in my field i make sure of the adjustment of the harness i drive with peculiar care to save the horse with such simple detail of the work in hand i have find it my joy to occupy my mind up to that moment the most important thing in the world have seem a straight furrow and well-turned corner -- to I then a profound accomplishment i can not well describe it save by the analogy of a opening door somewhere within the house of my consciousness i have be in the dark : i seem to emerge i have be bind down : i seem to leap up -- and with a marvellous sudden sense of freedom and joy i stop there in my field and look up and it be as if i have never look up before i discover another world it have be there before for long and long but i have never see nor feel it all discovery be make in that way : a man find the new thing not in nature but in himself it be as though concern with plow and harness and furrow i have never know that the world have height or color or sweet sound or that there be _ feeling _ in a hillside i forget myself or where i be i stand a long time motionless my dominant feeling if i can at all express it be of a strange new friendliness a warmth as though these hill this field about I the wood have suddenly speak to I and caress I it be as though i have be accept in membership as though i be now recognize after long trial as belong here across the town road which separate my farm from my nearest neighbor 's i see a field familiar yet strangely new and unfamiliar lie up to the setting sun all red with autumn above it the incalculable height of the sky blue but not quite clear owe to the indian summer haze i can not convey the sweetness and softness of that landscape the airiness of it the mystery of it as it come to I at that moment it be as though look at a acquaintance long know i should discover that i love he as i stand there i be conscious of the cool tang of burn leaf and brush heap the lazy smoke of which float down the long valley and find I in my field and finally i hear as though the sound be then make for the first time all the vague murmur of the country side -- a cow-bell somewhere in the distance the creak of a wagon the blur evening hum of bird insect frog so much it mean for a man to stop and look up from he task so i stand and i look up and down with a glow and a thrill which i can not now look back upon without some envy and a little amusement at the very grandness and seriousness of it all and i say aloud to myself : i will be as broad as the earth i will not be limit thus i be bear into the present world and here i continue not know what other world i may yet achieve i do not know but i wait in expectancy keep my furrow straight and my corner well turn since that day in the field though my fence include no more acre and i still plow my own field my real domain have expand until i crop wide field and take the profit of many curious pasture from my farm i can see most of the world and if i wait here long enough all people pass this way and i look out upon they not in the surroundings which they have choose for themselves but from the vantage ground of my familiar world the symbol which mean so much in city mean little here sometimes it seem to I as though i see man naked they come and stand beside my oak and the oak pass solemn judgment they tread my furrow and the clod give silent evidence they touch the green blade of my corn the corn whisper its sure conclusion stern judgment that will be deceive by no symbol thus i have delighted secretly in call myself a unlimited farmer and i make this confession in answer to the inner and truthful demand of the soul that we be not after all the slave of thing whether corn or banknote or spindle that we be not the use but the user that life be more than profit and loss and so i shall expect that while i be talk farm some of you may be think dry goods bank literature carpentry or what-not but if you can say : i be a unlimited dry goods merchant i be a unlimited carpenter i will give you a old-fashioned country hand-shake strong and warm we be friend we orbit coincide ii i buy a farm as i have say when i come here i come as a renter work all of the first summer without that open vision of which the prophet samuel speak i have no memory of the past and no hope of the future i feed upon the moment my sister harriet keep the house and i look after the farm and the field in all those month i hardly know that i have neighbor although horace from whom i rent my place be not infrequently a visitor he have since say that i look at he as though he be a statute i be citified horace say and citify with we here in the country be nearly the limit of invective though not violent enough to discourage such a gift of sociability as he the scotch preacher the rarest kindest man i know call once or twice wear the air of formality which so ill become he i see nothing in he : it be my fault not he that i miss so many week of he friendship once in that time the professor cross my field with he tin box sling from he shoulder and the only feeling i have bear of crowded city be that this be a intrusion upon my property intrusion : and the professor it be now unthinkable i often pass the carpentry shop on my way to town i see baxter many time at he bench even then baxter 's eye attract I : he always glance up at I as i pass and he look have in it something of a caress so the home of starkweather standing aloof among its broad lawn and tall tree carry no meaning for I of all my neighbor horace be the nearest from the back door of my house look over the hill i can see the two red chimney of he home and the top of the windmill horace 's barn and corn silo be more pretentious by far than he house but fortunately they stand on lower ground where they be not visible from my side of the hill five minute ' walk in a straight line across the field bring I to horace 's door by the road it take at least ten minute in the fall after my arrival i have come to love the farm and its surroundings so much that i decide to have it for my own i do not look ahead to be a farmer i do not ask harriet 's advice i find myself sit one day in the justice 's office the justice be bald and as dry as corn fodder in march he sit with spectacled impressiveness behind he ink-stained table horace hitch he heel on the round of he chair and put he hat on he knee he wear he best coat and he hair be brush in deference to the occasion he look uncomfortable but important i sit opposite he somewhat overwhelm by the business in hand i feel like a inadequate boy measure against solemnity too large for he the process seem curiously unconvincing like a game in which the important part be to keep from laugh and yet when i thought of laugh i feel cold chill of horror if i have laugh at that moment i can not think what that justice would have say but it be a pleasure to have the old man read the deed look at I over he spectacles from time to time to make sure i be not play truant there be good and great word in a deed one of they i bring away with I from the conference a very fine big one which i love to have out now and again to remind I of the really serious thing of life it give I a peculiar dry legal feeling if i be about to enter upon a serious bargain like the sale of a cow i be more avaricious if i work with it under my tongue hereditament hereditament some word need to be fence in pig-tight so that they can not escape we other we prefer to have run at large indefinite but inclusive i would not look up that word for anything : i might find it fence in so that it could not mean to I all that it do now hereditament may there be many of they -- or it be it not a fine providence that give we different thing to love in the purchase of my farm both horace and i get the better of the bargain -- and yet neither be cheat in reality a fairly strong lantern light will shine through horace and i could see that he be hug himself with the joy of he bargain but i be content i have some money leave -- what more do anyone want after a bargain -- and i have come into possession of the thing i desire most of all look at bargain from a purely commercial point of view someone be always cheat but look at with the simple eye both seller and buyer always win we come away from the gravity of that bargaining in horace 's wagon on we way home horace give I fatherly advice about use my farm he speak from the height of he knowledge to I a humble beginner the conversation run something like this : horace : thar 's a clump of plum tree along the lower pasture fence perhaps you see be -- myself : i see they : that be one reason i buy the back pasture in may they will be full of blossom horace : they be _ wild _ plum : they be not good for nothing myself : but think how fine they will be all the year round horace : fine they take up a quarter-acre of good land i have be go to cut 'em myself this ten year myself : i do not think i shall want they cut out horace : humph after a pause : horace : there be a lot of good body cord-wood in that oak on the knoll myself : cord-wood why that oak be the treasure of the whole farm i have never see a finer one i could not think of cut it horace : it will bring you fifteen or twenty dollar cash in hand myself : but i rather have the oak horace : humph so we conversation continue for some time i let horace know that i prefer rail fence even old one to a wire fence and that i think a farm should not be too large else it might keep one away from he friend and what i ask be corn compare with a friend oh i grow really oratorical i give it as my opinion that there should be vine around the house -lrb- waste of time say horace -rrb- and that no farmer should permit anyone to paint medicine advertisement on he barn -lrb- bring you ten dollar a year say horace -rrb- and that i propose to fix the bridge on the lower road -lrb- what be a path-master for ask horace -rrb- i say that a town be a useful adjunct for a farm but i lay it down as a principle that no town should be too near a farm i finally become so enthusiastic in set forth my conception of a true farm that i reduce horace to a series of humph the early humph be incredulous but as i proceed with some joy they become humorously contemptuous and finally begin to voice a large comfortable condescend tolerance i could fairly feel horace grow superior as he sit there beside I oh he have everything in he favor he could prove what he say : one tree + one thicket = twenty dollar one landscape = ten cord of wood = a quarter-acre of corn = twenty dollar these equation prove themselves moreover be not horace the best off of any farmer in the country do he not have the largest barn and the best corn silo and be there better argument have you ever have anyone give you up as hopeless and be it not a pleasure it be only after people resign you to you fate that you really make friend of they for how can you win the friendship of one who be try to convert you to he superior belief as we talk then horace and i i begin to have hope of he there be no joy comparable to the making of a friend and the more resistant the material the greater the triumph baxter the carpenter say that when he work for enjoyment he choose curly maple when horace set I down at my gate that afternoon he give I he hand and tell I that he would look in on I occasionally and that if i have any trouble to let he know a few day later i hear by the roundabout telegraph common in country neighborhood that horace have find a good deal of fun in report what i say about farming and that he have call I by a highly humorous but disparage name horace have a vein of humor all he own i have catch he alone in he field chuckle to himself and even break out in a loud laugh at the memory of some amusing incident that happen ten year ago one day a month or more after we bargain horace come down across he field and hitch he jean-clad leg over my fence with the intent i be sure of delving a little more in the same rich mine of humor horace i say look he straight in the eye do you call I a -- agriculturist i have rarely see a man so pitifully confuse as horace be at that moment he flush he stammer he cough the perspiration break out on he forehead he try to speak and could not i be sorry for he horace i say you be a farmer we look at each other a moment with dreadful seriousness and then both of we laugh to the point of hold we side we slap we knee we shout we wriggle we almost roll with merriment horace put out he hand and we shake heartily in five minute i have the whole story of he humorous report out of he no real friendship be ever make without a initial clashing which disclose the metal of each to each since that day horace 's jean-clad leg have rest many a time on my fence and we have talk crop and calf we have be the best of friend in the way of whiffle-trees butter tub and pig killing -- but never once look up together at the sky the chief objection to a joke in the country be that it be so imperishable there be so much room for joke and so few joke to fill it when i see horace approach with a peculiar friendly reminiscent smile on he face i hasten with all ardor to anticipate he : horace i exclaim you be a farmer -lrb- illustration : the heat and sweat of the hay field -rrb- iii the joy of possession how sweet the west wind sound in my own tree : how graceful climb these shadow on my hill always as i travel i think here i be let anything happen i do not want to know the future knowledge be too certain too cold too real it be true that i have not always meet the fine adventure nor win the friend but if i have what should i have more to look for at other turning and other hilltop the afternoon of my purchase be one of the great afternoon of my life when horace put I down at my gate i do not go at once to the house i do not wish then to talk with harriet the thing i have with myself be too important i skulk toward my barn compelling myself to walk slowly until i reach the corner where i break into a eager run as though the old nick himself be after I behind the barn i drop down on the grass pant with laughter and not without some of the shame a man feel at be a boy close along the side of the barn as i sit there in the cool of the shade i could see a tangled mat of smartweed and catnip and the board of the barn brown and weather-beaten and the gable above with mud swallow ' nest now desert and it strike I suddenly as i observe these homely pleasant thing : all this be mine i spring up and draw a long breath mine i say it come to I then like a inspiration that i might now go out and take formal possession of my farm i might experience the emotion of a landowner i might swell with dignity and importance -- for once at least so i start at the fence corner back of the barn and walk straight up through the pasture keep close to my boundary that i might not miss a single rod of my acre and oh it be a prime afternoon the lord make it sunshine -- and autumn haze -- and red tree -- and yellow field -- and blue distance above the far-away town and the air have a tang which get into a man 's blood and set he chant all the poetry he ever know i climb that be a clod i run whose step be slow i reap the very wheat of god that once have none to sow so i walk up the margin of my field look broadly about I : and presently i begin to examine my fence -- _ my _ fence -- with a critical eye i consider the quality of the soil though in truth i be not much of a judge of such matter i gloat over my plow land lie there open and passive in the sunshine i say of this tree : it be mine and of its companion beyond the fence : it be my neighbor 's deeply and sharply within myself i draw the line between _ meum _ and _ tuum _ : for only thus by compare ourselves with we neighbor can we come to the true realisation of property occasionally i stop to pick up a stone and cast it over the fence think with some truculence that my neighbor would probably throw it back again never mind i have it out of _ my _ field once with eager surplusage of energy i pull down a dead and partly rotten oak stub long a eye-sore with a important feeling of proprietorship i could do anything i like the farm be _ mine _ how sweet a emotion be possession what charm be inherent in ownership what a foundation for vanity even for the greater quality of self-respect lie in a little property i fall to thinking of the excellent wording of the old book in which land be call real property or real estate money we may possess or goods or chattel but they give no such impression of mineness as the feeling that one 's foot rest upon soil that be he : that part of the deep earth be he with all the water upon it all small animal that creep or crawl in the hole of it all bird or insect that fly in the air above it all tree shrub flower and grass that grow upon it all house barn and fence -- all he as i stride along that afternoon i feed upon possession i roll the sweet morsel of ownership under my tongue i seem to set my foot down more firmly on the good earth i straighten my shoulder : _ this land be mine _ i pick up a clod of earth and let it crumble and drop through my finger : it give I a peculiar and poignant feeling of possession i can understand why the miser enjoy the very physical contact of he gold every sense i possess sight hearing smell touch lead upon the new joy at one corner of my upper field the fence cross a abrupt ravine upon leggy stilt my line skirt the slope halfway up my neighbor own the crown of the hill which he have shear until it resemble the tonsured pate of a monk every rain bring the light soil down the ravine and lay it like a hand of infertility upon my farm it have always bother I this wastage and as i look across my fence i think to myself : i must have that hill i will buy it i will set the fence farther up i will plant the slope it be no age of tonsure either in religion or agriculture the very vision of widen acre set my thought on fire in imagination i extend my farm upon all side think how much better i could handle my land than my neighbor i dwelt avariciously upon more possession : i think with discontent of my poverty more land i want i be envelop in cloud of envy i coveted my neighbor 's land : i feel myself superior and horace inferior : i be consume with black vanity so i deal hotly with these thought until i reach the top of the ridge at the farther corner of my land it be the highest point on the farm for a moment i stand look about I on a wonderful prospect of serene beauty as it come to I -- hill field wood -- the fever which have be consume I die down i think how the world stretch away from my fence -- just such field -- for a thousand mile and in each small enclosure a man as hot as i with the passion of possession how they all envy and hate in they longing for more land how property keep they apart prevent the close confident touch of friendship how it separated lover and ruin family of all obstacle to that complete democracy of which we dream be there a greater than property i be ashamed deep shame cover I how little of the earth after all i say lie within the limit of my fence and i look out upon the perfect beauty of the world around I and i see how little excited it be how placid how undemanding i have come here to be free and already this farm which i thought of so fondly as my possession be come to possess I ownership be a appetite like hunger or thirst and as we may eat to gluttony and drink to drunkenness so we may possess to avarice how many man have i see who though they regard themselves as model of temperance wear the mark of unbridled indulgence of the passion of possession and how like gluttony or licentiousness it set its sure sign upon they face i say to myself why should any man fence himself in and why hope to enlarge one 's world by the creep acquisition of a few acre to he farm i thought of the old scientist who lay he hand upon the grass remark : everything under my hand be a miracle -- forget that everything outside be also a miracle -lrb- illustration : how graceful climb these shadow on my hill -rrb- as i stand there i glance across the broad valley wherein lie the most of my farm to a field of buckwheat which belong to horace for a instant it give I the illusion of a hill on fire : for the late sun shone full on the thick ripe stalk of the buckwheat give forth a abundant red glory that bless the eye horace have be proud of he crop smack he lip at the prospect of winter pancake and here i be enter he field and take without hindrance another crop a crop gather not with hand nor store in granary : a wonderful crop which once gather may long be feed upon and yet remain unconsumed so i look across the countryside a group of elm here a tufted hilltop there the smooth verdure of pasture the rich brown of new-plowed field -- and the odour and the sound of the country -- all crop by I how little the fence keep I out : i do not regard title nor consider boundary i enter either by day or by night but not secretly take my fill i leave as much as i find and thus stand upon the highest hill in my upper pasture i thought of the quote say of a certain old abbot of the middle age -- he that be a true monk consider nothing as belong to he except a lyre what finer spirit who shall step forth freer than he who go with nothing save he lyre he shall sing as he go : he shall not be hold down nor fenced in with a lifting of the soul i thought of that old abbot how smooth he brow how catholic he interest how serene he outlook how free he friendship how unlimited he whole life nothing but a lyre so i make a covenant there with myself i say : i shall use not be use i do not limit myself here i shall not allow possession to come between I and my life or my friend for a time -- how long i do not know -- i stand think presently i discover move slowly along the margin of the field below I the old professor with he tin botany box and somehow i have no feeling that he be intrude upon my new land he walk be slow and methodical he head and even he shoulder be bent -- almost habitually -- from look close upon the earth and from time to time he stoop and once he kneel to examine some object that attract he eye it seem appropriate that he should thus kneel to the earth so he gather _ he _ crop and fence do not keep he out nor title disturb he he also be free it give I at that moment a peculiar pleasure to have he on my land to know that i be if unconsciously raise other crop than i know i feel friendship for this old professor : i could understand he i think and i say aloud but in a low tone as though i be address he : -- do not apologise friend when you come into my field you do not interrupt I what you have come for be of more importance at this moment than corn who be it that say i must plow so many furrow this day come in friend and sit here on these clod : we will sweeten the evening with fine word we will invest we time not in corn or in cash but in life -- i walk with confidence down the hill toward the professor so engross be he with he employment that he do not see I until i be within a few pace of he when he look up at I it be as though he eye return from some far journey i feel at first out of focus unplaced and only gradually come into view in he hand he hold a lump of earth contain a thrifty young plant of the purple cone-flower have several blossom he work at the lump deftly delicately so that the earth pinch powdered and shake out fall between he finger leave the knotty yellow root in he hand i marked how firm slow brown the old man be how little obtrusive in my field one foot rest in a furrow the other be set among the grass of the margin near the fence -- he place i think he first word though of little moment in themselves give I a curious satisfaction as when a coin test ring true gold or a hero try be heroic i have rarely he say see a finer display of rudbeckium than this along these old fence if he have refer to I or question or apologise i should have be disappoint he do not say you fence he say these fence as though they be as much he as mine and he speak in he own world know that if i could enter i would but that if i could not no stoop to I would avail either of we it have be a good autumn for flower i say inanely for so many thing be fly through my mind that i could not at once think of the great particular word which should bring we together at first i think my chance have pass but he seem to see something in I after all for he say : here be a peculiarly large specimen of the rudbeckium observe the deep purple of the cone and the bright yellow of the petal here be another that grow hardly two foot away in the grass near the fence where the rail and the blackberry bush have shaded it how small and undeveloped it be they crowd up to the plow land i observe yes they reach out for a better chance in life -- like man with more room better food freer air you see how much finer they grow it be curious to I have hitherto barely observe the cone-flower along my fence save as a color of beauty how simply we fall to talk of they as though in truth they be people like ourselves have we desire and possess of we capability it give I then for the first time the feeling which have since mean such varied enjoyment of the peopling of the wood see here he say how different the character of these individual they be all of the same species they all grow along this fence within two or three rod but observe the difference not only in size but in color in the shape of the petal in the proportion of the cone what do it all mean why nature try one of she endless experiment she sow here broadly try to produce better cone-flower a few she plant on the edge of the field in the hope that they may escape the plow if they grow better food and more sunshine produce more and larger flower so we talk or rather he talk finding in I a eager listener and what he call botany seem to I to be life of birth of growth of reproduction of death he speak and he flower become sentient creature under my eye and thus the sun go down and the purple mist creep silently along the distant low spot and all the great great mystery come and stand before I beckon and question they come and they stand and out of the cone-flower as the old professor speak i seem to catch a glimmer of the true light i reflect how truly everything be in anything if one could really understand a cone-flower he could understand this earth botany be only one road toward the explanation always i hope that some traveller may have more news of the way than i and sooner or later i find i must make inquiry of the direction of every thoughtful man i meet and i have always have especial hope of those who study the science : they ask such intimate question of nature theology possess a vain-gloriousness which place its faith in human theory but science at its best be humble before nature herself it have no thesis to defend : it be content to kneel upon the earth in the way of my friend the old professor and ask the simplest question hope for some true reply i wonder then what the professor think after he year of work of the mystery and finally not without confusion i ask he he listen for the first time cease to dig shake out and arrange he specimen when i have stop speak he remain for a moment silent then he look at I with a new regard finally he quote quietly but with a deep note in he voice : canst thou by search find god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection it be as high as heaven : what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know when the professor have speak we stand for a moment silent then he smile and say briskly : i have be a botanist for fifty-four year when i be a boy i believe implicitly in god i pray to he have a vision of he -- a person -- before my eye as i grow older i conclude that there be no god i dismiss he from the universe i believe only in what i could see or hear or feel i talk about nature and reality he pause the smile still light he face evidently recall to himself the old day i do not interrupt he finally he turn to I and say abruptly and now -- it seem to I -- there be nothing but god as he say this he lift he arm with a peculiar gesture that seem to take in the whole world for a time we be both silent when i leave he i offer my hand and tell he i hope i might become he friend so i turn my face toward home evening be fall and as i walk i hear the crow call and the air be keen and cool and i think deep thought and so i step into the darkened stable i could not see the outline of the horse or the cow but know the place so well i could easily get about i hear the horse step aside with a soft expectant whinny i smell the smell of milk the musty sharp odour of dry hay the pungent smell of manure not unpleasant and the stable be warm after the cool of the field with a sort of animal warmth that strike into I soothingly i speak in a low voice and lay my hand on the horse 's flank the flesh quiver and shrink away from my touch -- come back confidently warmly i run my hand along he back and up he hairy neck i feel he sensitive nose in my hand you shall have you oats i say and i give he to eat then i speak as gently to the cow and she stand aside to be milk and afterward i come out into the clear bright night and the air be sweet and cool and my dog come bound to meet I -- so i carry the milk into the house and harriet say in she heartiest tone : you be late david but sit up i have keep the biscuit warm and that night my sleep be sound iv entertain a agent unaware with the come of winter i think the life of a farmer might lose something of its charm so much interest lie in the growth not only of crop but of tree vine flower sentiment and emotion in the summer the world be busy concern with many thing and full of gossip : in the winter i anticipate a cessation of many active interest and enthusiasm i look forward to have time for my book and for the quiet contemplation of the life around I summer indeed be for activity winter for reflection but when winter really come every day discover some new work to do or some new adventure to enjoy it be surprising how many thing happen on a small farm examine the book which account for that winter i find the history of part of a forenoon which will illustrate one of the curious adventure of a farmer 's life it be date January 5 \* \* \* \* \* i go out this morning with my axe and hammer to mend the fence along the public road a heavy frost fall last night and the brown grass and the dry rut of the road be powdered white even the air which be perfectly still seem full of frost crystal so that when the sun come up one seem to walk in a magic world i draw in a long breath and look out across the wonderful shine country and i say to myself : surely there be nowhere i would rather be than here for i could have travel nowhere to find greater beauty or a better enjoyment of it than i have here at home as i work with my axe and hammer i hear a light wagon come rattle up the road across the valley a man have begin to chop a tree i could see the axe steel flash brilliantly in the sunshine before i hear the sound of the blow the man in the wagon have a round face and a sharp blue eye i think he seem a businesslike young man say there he shout draw up at my gate would you mind hold my horse a minute it be a cold morning and he be restless certainly not i say and i put down my tool and hold he horse he walk up to my door with a brisk step and a certain jaunty poise of the head he be well contented with himself i say it be a great blessing for any man to be satisfy with what he have get i hear harriet open the door -- how every sound ring through the still morning air the young man ask some question and i distinctly hear harriet 's answer : he be down there the young man come back : he hat be tip up he quick eye dart over my grounds as though in a single instant he have appraise everything and pass judgment upon the cash value of the inhabitant he whistle a lively little tune say he say when he reach the gate not at all disconcerted i think you be the hire man you name 's grayson be not it well i want to talk with you after tie and blanket he horse and take a black satchel from he buggy he lead I up to my house i have a pleasurable sense of excitement and adventure here be a new character come to my farm who know i think what he may bring with he : who know what i may send away by he here in the country we must set we little ship afloat on small stream hope that somehow some day they will reach the sea it be interesting to see the busy young man sit down so confidently in we best chair he say he name be dixon and he take out from he satchel a book with a fine showy cover he say it be call live selection from poet sage and humourist this he tell I be only the first of the series we publish six volume full of literchoor you see what a heavy book this be i test it in my hand : it be a heavy book the entire set he say weigh over ten pound there be 1162 page enough paper if lay down flat end to end to reach half a mile i can not quote he exact language : there be too much of it but he make a impressive showing of the amount of literature that could be have at a very low price per pound mr dixon be a hypnotist he fix I with he glittering eye and he talk so fast and he idea upon the subject be so original that he hold I spellbound at first i be incline to be provoke : one do not like to be forcibly hypnotise but gradually the situation begin to amuse I the more so when harriet come in do you ever see a more beautiful binding ask the agent hold he book admiringly at arm 's length this up here he say point to the illuminate cover be the muse of poetry she be scatter flower -- poem you know fine idea be not it color fine too he jump up quickly and lay the book on my table to the evident distress of harriet trim up the room do not it he exclaim turn he head a little to one side and observe the effect with a expression of affectionate admiration how much i ask will you sell the cover for without the inside without the inside yes i say the binding will trim up my table just as well without the inside i think he look at I a little suspiciously but he be evidently satisfy by my expression of countenance for he answer promptly : oh but you want the inside that be what the book be for the binding be never sell alone he then go on to tell I the price and term of payment until it really seem that it would be cheaper to buy the book than to let he carry they away again harriet stand in the doorway behind he frown and evidently try to catch my eye but i keep my face turn aside so that i could not see she signal of distress and my eye fix on the young man dixon it be as good as a play harriet there serious-minded thinking i be be befooled and the agent think he be befool I and i think i be befool both of they -- and all of we wrong it be very like life wherever you find it finally i take the book which he have be urge upon I at which harriet cough meaningly to attract my attention she know the danger when i really get my hand on a book but i make up as innocent as a child i open the book almost at random -- and it be as though walk down a strange road i have come upon a old try friend not see before in year for there on the page before I i read : the world be too much with we late and soon get and spend we lay waste we power : little we see in nature that be ours we have give we heart away a sordid boon the sea that bare she bosom to the moon the wind that will be howl at all hour but be up-gathered now like sleep flower for this for everything we be out of tune it move we not and as i read it come back to I -- a scene like a picture -- the place the time the very feel of the hour when i first see those line who shall say that the past do not live a odour will sometimes set the blood coursing in a old emotion and a line of poetry be the resurrection and the life for a moment i forget harriet and the agent i forget myself i even forget the book on my knee -- everything but that hour in the past -- a view of shimmering hot housetops the heat and dust and noise of a August evening in the city the dumb weariness of it all the loneliness the longing for green field and then these great line of wordsworth read for the first time flooding in upon I : great god i would rather be a pagan suckle in a creed outworn : so might i stand on this pleasant lea have glimpse that would make I less forlorn have sight of proteus rise from the sea and hear old triton blow he wreathèd horn when i have finish i find myself stand in my own room with one arm raise and i suspect a trace of tear in my eye -- there before the agent and harriet i see harriet lift one hand and drop it hopelessly she think i be capture at last i be past saving and as i look at the agent i see grim conquest glowing in he eye so i sit down not a little embarrassed by my exhibition -- when i have intend to be self-poised you like it do not you say mr dixon unctuously i do not see i say earnestly how you can afford to sell such thing as this so cheap they _ be _ cheap he admit regretfully i suppose he wish he have try I with the half-morocco they be priceless i say absolutely priceless if you be the only man in the world who have that poem i think i would deed you my farm for it mr dixon proceed as though it be all settle to get out he black order book and open it briskly for business he draw he fountain pen cap it and look up at I expectantly my foot actually seem slip into some irresistible whirlpool how well he understand practical psychology i struggle within myself fear engulfment : i be all but lose shall i deliver the set at once he say or can you wait until the first of February at that critical moment a float spar of a idea sweep my way and i seize upon it as the last hope of the lose -lrb- illustration : ` do you ever see a more beautiful binding ' -rrb- i do not understand i say as though i have not hear he last question how you dare go about with all this treasure upon you be you not afraid of be stop in the road and rob why i have see the time when if i have know you carry such thing as these such cure for sick heart i think i should have stop you myself say you _ be _ a odd one say mr dixon why do you sell such priceless thing as these i ask look at he sharply why do i sell they and he look still more perplexed to make money of course same reason you raise corn but here be wealth i say pursue my advantage if you have these you have something more valuable than money mr dixon politely say nothing like a wise angler have fail to land I at the first rush he let I have line then i thought of ruskin 's word nor can any noble thing be wealth except to a noble person and that prompt I to say to mr dixon : these thing be not yours they be mine you never own they but i will sell they to you he look at I in amazement and then glance around -- evidently to discover if there be a convenient way of escape you be all straight be you he ask tap he forehead do not anybody ever try to take you up the cover be yours i continue as though i have not hear he the inside be mine and have be for a long time : that be why i propose buy the cover separately i open he book again i think i would see what have be choose for its page and i find there many fine and great thing let I read you this i say to mr dixon it have be mine for a long time i will not sell it to you i will give it to you outright the best thing be always give have some gift in imitate the scotch dialect i read : November chill blaw loud wus ' angry sugh the shorten winter day be near a close the miry beast retreat frae the pleugh the black ` ning train o ' craw to they repose : the toil-worn cotter fra he labor go this night he weekly moil be at a end collect he spade he mattock and he hoe hope the morn in ease and rest to spend and weary o'er the moor he course do hameward bend so i read the cotter 's Saturday night i love the poem very much myself sometimes read it aloud not so much for the tenderness of its message though i prize that too as for the wonder of its music : compare with these italian trill be tame the tickl have ear no heart-felt rapture raise i suppose i show my feeling in my voice as i glance up from time to time i see the agent 's face change and he look deepen and the lip usually so energetically tense loosen with emotion surely no poem in all the language convey so perfectly the simple love of the home the quiet joy hope pathos of those who live close to the soil when i have finish -- i stop with the stanza beginning : then homeward all take off they sev ` ral way the agent turn away he head try to brave out he emotion most of we anglo-saxon tremble before a tear when we might fearlessly beard a tiger i move up nearer to the agent and put my hand on he knee then i read two or three of the other thing i find in he wonderful book and once i have he laugh and once again i have the tear in he eye oh a simple young man a little crusty without but soft inside -- like the rest of we well it be amazing once we begin talk not of book but of life how really eloquent and human he become from be a distant and uncomfortable person he become at once like a near neighbor and friend it be strange to I -- as i have think since -- how he convey to we in few word the essential emotional note of he life it be no violin tone beautifully complex with harmonic but the clear simple voice of the flute it speak of he wife and he baby girl and he home the very incongruity of detail -- he tell we how he grow onion in he back yard -- add somehow to the homely glamour of the vision which he give we the number of he house the fact that he have a new cottage organ and that the baby run away and lose herself in seventeenth street -- be all curiously fabric of he emotion it be beautiful to see commonplace fact grow phosphorescent in the heat of true feeling how little we may come to know romance by the cloak she wear and how humble must be he who would surprise the heart of she it be indeed with a indescribable thrill that i hear he add the detail one by one -- the mortgage on he place now rapidly be pay off the brother who be a plumber the mother-in-law who be not a mother-in-law of the comic papers and finally he show we the picture of the wife and baby that he have in the cover of he watch a fat baby with its head rest on its mother 's shoulder mister he say p ` rap you think it be fun to ride around the country like i do and be away from home most of the time but it be not when i think of minnie and the kid -- he break off sharply as if he have suddenly remember the shame of such confidence say he ask what page be that poem on i tell he one forty-six he say when i get home i be go to read that to minnie she like poetry and all such thing and where 's that other piece that tell how a man feel when he be lonesome say that fellow know we have a genuinely good time the agent and i and when he finally rise to go i say : well i have sell you a new book i see now mister what you mean i go down the path with he and begin to unhitch he horse let I let I he say eagerly then he shake hand pause a moment awkwardly as if about to say something then spring into he buggy without say it when he have take up he rein he remark : say but you would make a agent you would hypnotise 'em i recognize it as the greatest compliment he could pay I : the craft compliment then he drive off but pull up before he have go five yard he turn in he seat one hand on the back of it he whip raise say he shout and when i walk up he look at I with fine embarrassment mister perhaps you would accept one of these set from dixon free grati for nothing i understand i say but you know i be give the book to you -- and i could not take they back again well he say you be a good one anyhow good-bye again and then suddenly business naturally come uppermost he remark with great enthusiasm : you have give I a new idea _ say _ i 'll sell 'em carry they carefully man i call after he they be precious so i go back to my work think how many fine people there be in this world -- if you scratch 'em deep enough -lrb- illustration : horace ` heft ' it -rrb- v the axe-helve _ April the 15th _ this morning i break my old axe handle i go out early while the fog still fill the valley and the air be cool and moist as it have come fresh from the filter of the night i draw a long breath and let my axe fall with all the force i could give it upon a new oak log i swing it unnecessarily high for the joy of do it and when it strike it communicate a sharp yet not unpleasant sting to the palm of my hand the handle break short off at the point where the helve meet the steel the blade be drive deep in the oak wood i suppose i should have regret my foolishness but i do not the handle be old and somewhat worn and the accident give I a indefinable satisfaction : the culmination of use that final destruction which be the complement of great effort this feeling be also partly prompt by the thought of the new helve i already have in store await just such a catastrophe have come somewhat painfully by that helve i really want to see it in use last spring walk in my field i look out along the fence for a well-fitted young hickory tree of thrifty second growth bare of knot at least head high without the crack or fissure of too rapid growth or the doziness of early transgression what i desire be a fine healthy tree fit for a great purpose and i look for it as i would look for a perfect man to save a fail cause at last i find a sapling grow in one of the sheltered angle of my rail fence it be set about by dry grass overhang by a much larger cherry tree and bearing still its wither last year 's leave worn diaphanous but curl delicately and of a most beautiful ash gray color something like the fabric of a wasp 's nest only yellower i give it a shake and it spring quickly under my hand like the muscle of a good horse its bark be smooth and trim its bole well set and solid a perfect tree so i come up again with my short axe and after clear away the grass and leave with which the wind have mulch it i cut into the clean white root i have no twinge of compunction for be this not fulfillment nothing come of sorrow for worthy sacrifice when i have lay the tree low i clip off the lower branch snap off the top with a single clean stroke of the axe and shoulder as pretty a second-growth sapling stick as anyone ever lay he eye upon i carry it down to my barn and put it on the open rafter over the cow stall a cow stable be warm and not too dry so that a hickory log cure slowly without crack or check there it lay for many week often i cast my eye up at it with satisfaction watch the bark shrink and slightly deepen in color and once i climb up where i could see the minute seam make way in the end of the stick in the summer i bring the stick into the house and put it in the dry warm storeroom over the kitchen where i keep my seed corn i do not suppose it really need further attention but sometimes when i chance to go into the storeroom i turn it over with my foot i feel a sort of satisfaction in know that it be in preparation for service : good material for useful work so it lay during the autumn and far into the winter one cold night when i sit comfortably at my fireplace listen to the wind outside and feel all the ease of a man at peace with himself my mind take flight to my snowy field side and i think of the tree there wait and rest through the winter so i come in imagination to the particular corner in the fence where i have cut my hickory saple instantly i start up much to harriet 's astonishment and make my way mysteriously up the kitchen stair i would not tell what i be after : i feel it a sort of adventure almost like the joy of see a friend long forget it be as if my hickory stick have cry out at last after long chrysalishood : i be ready i stand it on end and strike it sharply with my knuckle : it ring out with a certain clear resonance i be ready i sniff at the end of it it exhale a peculiar good smell as of old field in the autumn i be ready so i take it under my arm and carry it down mercy what be you go to do exclaimed harriet deliberately and with malice aforethought i respond i be go to litter up you floor i have decide to be reckless i do not care what happen have make this declaration which harriet receive with become disdain i lay the log by the fireplace -- not too near -- and go to fetch a saw a hammer a small wedge and a draw-shave i split my log into as fine white section as a man ever see -- every piece as straight as morality and without so much as a sliver to mar it nothing be so satisfactory as to have a task come out in perfect time and in good order the little piece of bark and sawdust i sweep scrupulously into the fireplace look up from time to time to see how harriet be take it harriet be still disdainful make a axe-helve be like write a poem -lrb- though i never write one -rrb- the material be free enough but it take a poet to use it some people imagine that any fine thought be poetry but there be never a greater mistake a fine thought to become poetry must be seasoned in the upper warm garret of the mind for long and long then it must be bring down and slowly carve into word shape with emotion polish with love else it be no true poem some people imagine that any hickory stick will make a axe-helve but this be far from the truth when i have whittle away for several evening with my draw-shave and jack-knife both of which i keep sharpen to the keenest edge i find that my work be not progress as well as i have hope this be more of a task i remark one evening than i have imagine harriet rock placidly in she arm-chair be mend a number of pair of new sock poor harriet lack enough old hole to occupy she energy she mend hole that may possibly appear a frugal person well david she say i warn you that you could buy a helve cheaper than you could make it so i can buy a book cheaper than i can write it i respond i feel somewhat pleased with my return shot though i take pain not to show it i squint along my hickory stick which be even then begin to assume rudely the outline of a axe-handle i have make a prodigious pile of fine white shaving and i be tired but quite suddenly there come over I a sort of love for that length of wood i spring it affectionately over my knee i rub it up and down with my hand and then i set it in the corner behind the fireplace after all i say for i have really be disturb by harriet 's remark -- after all power over one thing give we power over everything when you mend sock prospectively -- into futurity -- harriet that be a evidence of true greatness sometimes i think it do not pay remark harriet though she be plainly pleased pretty good sock i say can be buy for fifteen cent a pair harriet look at I suspiciously but i be as sober as the face of nature for the next two or three evening i let the axe-helve stand alone in the corner i hardly look at it though once in a while when occupy with some other work i would remember or rather half remember that i have a pleasure in store for the evening the very think of sharp tool and something to make with they act upon the imagination with peculiar zest so we love to employ the keen edge of the mind upon a knotty and difficult subject one evening the scotch preacher come in we love he very much though he sometimes make we laugh -- perhaps in part because he make we laugh externally he be a sort of human cocoanut rough brown shaggy but within he have the true milk of human kindness some of he quality touch greatness he youth be spend in stony place where strong wind blow the tree where he grow bear thorn the soil where he dig be full of root but the crop be human love he possess that quality unusual in one breed exclusively in the country of magnanimity toward the unlike in the country we be tempt to throw stone at strange hat but to the scotch preacher every man in one way seem transparent to the soul he see the man himself not he profession any more than he clothes and i never know anyone who have such a abide disbelief in the wickedness of the human soul weakness he see and comfort wickedness he can not see when he come in i be busy whittle my axe-helve it be my pleasure at that moment to make long thin curly shaving so light that many of they be catch on the hearth and bowl by the draught straight to fiery destruction there be a noisy zest about the scotch preacher : he come in stomp as we say he must clear he throat he must strike he hand together he even seem noisy when he unwind the thick red tippet which he wear wound many time around he neck it take he a long time to unwind it and he accomplish the task with many slow gyration of he enormous rough head when he sit down he take merely the edge of the chair spread he stout leg apart sit as straight as a post and blow he nose with a noise like the fall of a tree he interest in everything be prodigious when he see what i be do he launch at once upon a account of the method of axe-helving ancient and modern with true incident of he childhood man he exclaim you have clean forget one of the preenciple refinement of the art when you chop which hand do you hold down at the moment i could not have tell to save my life so we both get up on we foot and try it be the right hand down i decide that be natural to I you be a normal right-handed chopper then say the scotch preacher as i be think now let I instruct you in the art be right-handed you helve must bow out -- so no first-class chopper use a straight handle he fall to explain with gusto the mystery of the bow handle and as i listen i feel a new and peculiar interest in my task this be a final perfection to be accomplish the finality of technique so we sit with we head together talk helve and axis axis with single blade and axis with double blade and hand axis and great chopper ' axis and the science of fell tree with the true philosophy of the last chip and argument as to the best procedure when a log begin to pinch -- until a listener would have think that the art of the chopper include the whole philosophy of existence -- as indeed it do if you look at it in that way finally i rush out and bring in my old axe-handle and we set upon it like true artist with critical proscription for be a trivial product of machinery man exclaim the preacher it have no character now you helve here be the vision of you brain and work of you hand will interpret the thought of you heart before the scotch preacher have finish he disquisition upon the art of helve-making and its relation with all other art i feel like peary discover the pole in the midst of the discourse while i be soar high the scotch preacher suddenly stop sit up and strike he knee with a tremendous resounding smack spoon he exclaim harriet and i stop and look at he in astonishment spoon repeat harriet spoon say the scotch preacher i have not once think of my errand and my wife tell I to come straight home i be more thoughtless every day then he turn to harriet : i have be send to borrow some spoon he say spoon exclaim harriet spoon answer the scotch preacher we have invite friend for dinner to-morrow and we must have spoon but why -- how -- i think -- begin harriet still in astonishment the scotch preacher square around toward she and clear he throat it be the baptism he say : when a baby be bring for baptism of course it must have a baptismal gift what be the best gift for a baby a spoon so we present it with a spoon to-day we discover we have only three spoon leave and company come man ` tis a proleefic neighborhood -lrb- illustration : let my axe fall -rrb- he heave a great sigh harriet rush out and make up a package when she come in i think it seem suspiciously large for spoon but the scotch preacher have again launch into the lore of the chopper take it without at first perceive anything strange five minute after we have close the door upon he he suddenly return hold up the package this be a uncommonly heavy package he remark do i say table-spoon go on command harriet you wife will understand all right -- good-bye again and he sturdy figure soon disappear in the dark the impractical man exclaim harriet people impose on he what be in that package harriet oh i put in a few jar of jelly and a cake of honey after a moment harriet look up from she work do you know the greatest sorrow of the scotch preacher and he wife what be it i ask they have no chick nor child of they own say harriet it be prodigious the amount of work require to make a good axe-helve -- i mean to make it accord to one 's standard i have time of humorous discouragement and time of high elation when it seem to I i could not work fast enough week pass when i do not touch the helve but leave it stand quietly in the corner once or twice i take it out and walk about with it as a sort of cane much to the secret amusement i think of harriet at time harriet take a really wicked delight in she superiority early one morning in march the dawn come with a roar wind sleety snow drive down over the hill the house creak and complain in every clapboard a blind of one of the upper window wrench loose from its fastening be drive shut with such force that it break a window pane when i rush up to discover the meaning of the clatter and to repair the damage i find the floor cover with peculiar long fragment of glass -- the pane have be break inward from the center just what i have want i say to myself i select a few of the best piece and so eager be i to try they that i get out my axe-helve before breakfast and sit scratch away when harriet come down nothing equal a bit of broken glass for put on the final perfect touch to a work of art like a axe-helve nothing will so beautifully and delicately trim out the curve of the throat or give a smoother turn to the waist so with care and a indescribable affection i add the final touch trim the helve until it exactly fit my hand often and often i try it in pantomime swing nobly in the center of the sitting-room -lrb- avoid the lamp -rrb- attentive to the feel of my hand as it run along the helve i rub it down with fine sandpaper until it fairly shine with whiteness then i borrow a red flannel cloth of harriet and have add a few drop -- not too much -- of boil oil i rub the helve for all i be worth this i continue for upward of a hour at that time the axe-helve have take on a yellowish shade very clear and beautiful i do not think i could have be prouder if i have carve a statue or build a parthenon i be consume with vanity but i set the new helve in the corner with the appearance of utter unconcern there i remark it be finish i watch harriet out of the corner of my eye : she make as if to speak and then hold silent that evening friend horace come in i be glad to see he horace be or be a famous chopper i place he at the fireplace where he eye sooner or later must fall upon my axe-helve oh i work out my design presently he see the helve pick it up at once and turn it over in he hand i have a suffocating not unhumorous sense of self-consciousness i know how a poet must feel at hear he first poem read aloud by some other person who do not know its authorship i suffer and thrill with the novelist who see a stranger purchase he book in a book-shop i feel as though i stand that moment before the great judge horace heft it and balanced it and squint along it he rub it with he thumb he rest one end of it on the floor and spring it roughly david he say severely where do you git this once when i be a boy i come home with my hair wet my father ask : david have you be swim i have exactly the same feeling when horace ask he question now i be generally speak a truthful man i have write a good deal about the immorality the unwisdom the short-sightedness the sinful wastefulness of a lie but at that moment if harriet have not be present -- and that illustrate one of the purpose of society to bolster up a man 's moral -- i should have evolve as large and perfect a prevarication as it lay within I to do -- cheerfully but i feel harriet 's moral eye upon I : i be a coward as well as a sinner i falter so long that horace finally look around at I horace have no poetry in he soul neither do he understand the philosophy of imperfection nor the art of irregularity it be a tender shoot easily blast by cold wind the creative instinct : but persistent it have many adventitious bud a late frost destroy the freshness of its early verdure may be the means of a richer growth in later and more favourable day \* \* \* \* \* for a week i leave my helve standing there in the corner i do not even look at it i be slay i even think of get up in the night and put the helve on the coal -- secretly then suddenly one morning i take it up not at all tenderly indeed with a humorous appreciation of my own absurdity and carry it out into the yard a axe-helve be not a mere ornament but a thing of sober purpose the test after all of axe-helve be not sublime perfection but service we may easily find flaw in the verse of the master -- how far the rhythm fail of the final perfect music how often uncertain the rhyme -- but it bear within it hide yet evident that certain incalculable fire which kindle and will continue to kindle the soul of man the final test be not the perfection of precedent not regularity but life spirit it be one of those perfect sunny calm morning that sometimes come in early April : the zest of winter yet in the air but a promise of summer i build a fire of oak chip in the middle of the yard between two flat stone i bring out my old axe and when the fire have burn down somewhat leave a foundation of hot coal i thrust the eye of the axe into the fire the blade rest on one of the flat stone and i keep it cover with wet rag in order that it might not heat sufficiently to destroy the temper of the steel harriet 's old gray hen a garrulous fowl come and stand on one leg and look at I first with one eye and then with the other she ask innumerable impertinent question and be generally disagreeable i be sorry madam i say finally but i have grow adamant to criticism i have do my work as well as it lie in I to do it it be the part of sanity to throw it aside without compunction a work must prove itself shoo i say this with such conclusiveness and vigor that the critical old hen depart hastily with ruffle feather so i sit there in the glorious perfection of the forenoon the great day open around I a few small cloud abroad in the highest sky and all the earth radiant with sunshine the last snow of winter be go the sap run in the tree the cow feed further afield when the eye of the axe be sufficiently expand by the heat i draw it quickly from the fire and drive home the helve which i have already whittle down to the exact size i have a hickory wedge prepared and it be the work of ten seconds to drive it into the cleft at the lower end of the helve until the eye of the axe be completely and perfectly fill upon cool the steel shrink upon the wood clasp it with such firmness that nothing short of fire could ever dislodge it then carefully with knife and sandpaper i polish off the wood around the steel of the axe until i have make as good a job of it as lay within my power so i carry the axe to my log-pile i swing it above my head and the feel of it be good in my hand the blade strike deep into the oak wood and i say to myself with satisfaction : it serve the purpose vi the marsh ditch if the day and the night be such that you greet they with joy and life emit a fragrance like flower and sweet-smelling herb -- be more elastic more starry more immortal -- that be you success in all the day of my life i have never be so well content as i be this spring last summer i think i be happy the fall give I a finality of satisfaction the winter impart perspective but spring convey a wholly new sense of life a quicken the like of which i never before experienced it seem to I that everything in the world be more interesting more vital more significant i feel like wave aside all roof in the way of le sage 's asmodeus i even cease to fear mr horace who be quite the most formidable person in this neighborhood she be so avaricious in the saving of soul -- and so covetous of mine which i wish especially to retain when i see she come across the hill i feel like run and hide and if i be as bold as a boy i should do it but be a grown-up coward i remain and dissemble she come over this morning when i beheld she afar off i draw a long breath : one thousand i quote to myself shall flee at the rebuke of one in calmness i wait she come with color fly and hurl she biblical lance when i withstand the shock with unexpected jauntiness for i usually fall dead at once she look at I with severity and say : mr grayson you be a materialist you have shoot I with a name i reply i be unhurt it would be impossible to slay I on a day like this on a day like this i be immortal it come to I as the wonder of wonder these spring day how surely everything spiritual as well as material proceed out of the earth i have time of sheer paganism when i could bow and touch my face to the warm bare soil we be so often ashamed of the earth -- the soil of it the sweat of it the good common coarseness of it to we in we fine raiment and soft manners it seem indelicate instead of seek that association with the earth which be the renewal of life we devise ourselves distant palace and seek strange pleasure how often and sadly we repeat the life story of the yellow dodder of the moist lane of my lower farm it spring up fresh and clean from the earth itself and spread its clinging viny stem over the hospitable wild balsam and golden rod in a week 's time have reach the warm sunshine of the upper air it forget its humble beginning its root wither swiftly and die out but the sickly yellow stem continue to flourish and spread draw they nourishment not from the soil itself but by strangle and suck the life juice of the host on which it feed i have see whole byway cover thus with yellow dodder -- rootless leafless parasitic -- reach up to the sunlight quite cut off and smother the plant which give it life a week or two it flourish and then most of it perish miserably so many of we come to be like that : so much of we civilization be like that man and woman there be -- the pity of it -- who eat plentifully have never themselves take a mouthful from the earth they have never know a moment 's real life of they own lie up to the sun in warmth and comfort -- but leafless -- they do not think of the host under they smother strangle starve they take _ nothing _ at first hand they experience describe emotion and think prepared thought they live not in life but in print report of life they gather the odour of odour not the odour itself : they do not hear they overhear a poor sad second-rate existence bring out you social remedy they will fail they will fail every one until each man have he foot somewhere upon the soil my wild plum tree grow in the coarse earth among excrementitious mould a physical life which finally blossom and exhale its perfect odour : which ultimately bear the seed of its immortality human happiness be the true odour of growth the sweet exhalation of work : and the seed of human immortality be bear secretly within the coarse and mortal husk so many of we crave the odour without cultivate the earthly growth from which it proceed : so many waste mortality expect immortality -- why ask charle baxter do you always put the end of you story first you may be thankful i reply that i do not make my remark all ending ending be so much more interesting than beginning without look up from the buggy he be mend charle baxter intimate that my way have at least one advantage : one always know he say that i really have a end in view -- and hope defer he say -- -- how surely soundly deeply the physical underlie the spiritual this morning i be up and out at half-past four as perfect a morning as i ever see : mist yet huddle in the low spot the sun come up over the hill and all the earth fresh with moisture sweet with good odour and musical with early bird-note it be the time of the spring just after the last seeding and before the early haying : a catch-breath in the farmer 's year i have be utilise it in digging a drainage ditch at the lower end of my farm a spot of marsh grass and blue flag occupy nearly half a acre of good land and i have be plan ever since i buy the place to open a drain from its lower edge to the creek supplement it in the field above if necessary with submerged tiling i survey it carefully several week ago and draw plan and contour of the work as though it be a inter-oceanic canal i find it a real delight to work out in the earth itself the detail of the draw this morning after hasten with the chore i take my bag and my spade on my shoulder and set off -lrb- in rubber boot -rrb- for the ditch my way lay along the margin of my cornfield in the deep grass on my right as i walk be the old rail fence full of thrifty young hickory and cherry tree with here and there a clump of blackberry bush the tree beyond the fence cut off the sunrise so that i walk in the cool broad shadow on my left stretch the cornfield of my plant the young corn well up very attractive and hopeful my really frightful scarecrow standing guard on the knoll a wisp of straw stick up through a hole in he hat and he crooked thumb turn down -- no mercy surely no corn ever before grow like this i say to myself to-morrow i must begin cultivate again so i look up and about I -- not to miss anything of the morning -- and i draw in a good big breath and i think the world have never be so open to my sens i wonder why it be that the sense of smell be so commonly under-regarded to I it be the source of some of my greatest pleasure no one of the sens be more often ally with robustity of physical health a man who smell acutely may be set down as enjoy that which be normal plain wholesome he do not require seasoning : the ordinary earth be good enough for he he be likely to be sane -- which mean sound healthy -- in he outlook upon life of all hour of the day there be none like the early morning for downright good odour -- the morning before eat fresh from sleep and unclogged with food a man 's sens cut like knife the whole world come in upon he a still morning be best for the mist and the moisture seem to retain the odour which they have distil through the night upon a breezy morning one be likely to get a single predominant odour as of clover when the wind blow across a hay field or of apple blossom when the wind come through the orchard but upon a perfectly still morning it be wonderful how the odour arrange themselves in upright stratum so that one walk pass through they as from room to room in a marvellous temple of fragrance -lrb- i should have say i think if i have not be on my way to dig a ditch that it be like turn the leaf of some delicate volume of lyric -rrb- so it be this morning as i walk along the margin of my field i be conscious at first come within the shadow of the wood of the cool heavy aroma which one associate with the night : as of moist wood and earth mould the penetrate scent of the night remain long after the sight and sound of it have disappear in sunny spot i have the fragrance of the open cornfield the aromatic breath of the brown earth give curiously the sense of fecundity -- a warm generous odour of daylight and sunshine down the field toward the corner cut in sharply as though a door open -lrb- or a page turn to another lyric -rrb- come the cloying sweet fragrance of wild crab-apple blossom almost tropical in they richness and below that as i come to my work the thin acrid smell of the marsh the place of the rush and the flag and the frog how few of we really use we sens i mean give ourselves fully at any time to the occupation of the sens we do not expect to understand a treatise on economics without apply we mind to it nor can we really smell or hear or see or feel without every faculty alert through sheer indolence we miss half the joy of the world often as i work i stop to see : really see : see everything or to listen and it be the wonder of wonder how much there be in this old world which we never dream of how many beautiful curious interesting sight and sound there be which ordinarily make no impression upon we clogged overfed and preoccupy mind i have also have the feeling -- it may be unscientific but it be comforting -- that any man might see like a indian or smell like a hound if he give to the sens the brain which the indian and the hound apply to they and i be pretty sure about the indian it be marvellous what a man can do when he put he entire mind upon one faculty and bear down hard so i walk this morning not hear nor see but smell without desire to stir up strife among the peaceful sens there be this further marvel of the sense of smell no other possess such a after-call sight preserve picture : the complete view of the aspect of object but it be photographic and external hearing deal in echo but the sense of smell while save no vision of a place or a person will re-create in a way almost miraculous the inner _ emotion _ of a particular time or place i know of nothing that will so create a appetite under the rib of death only a short time ago i pass a open doorway in the town i be busy with errand my mind fully engage but suddenly i catch a odour from somewhere within the building i be pass i stop it be as if in that moment i lose twenty year of my life : i be a boy again live and feel a particular instant at the time of my father 's death every emotion of that occasion not recall in year return to I sharply and clearly as though i experience it for the first time it be a peculiar emotion : the first time i have ever feel the oppression of space -- can i describe it -- the utter bigness of the world and the aloofness of myself a little boy within it -- now that my father be go it be not at that moment sorrow nor remorse nor love : it be a inexpressible cold terror -- that anywhere i might go in the world i should still be alone and there i stand a man grow shake in the sunshine with that old boyish emotion bring back to I by a odour often and often have i know this strange rekindle of dead fire and i have think how if we sens be really perfect we might lose nothing out of we life : neither sight nor sound nor emotion : a sort of mortal immortality be not shakespeare great because he lose less of the savings of he sens than other man what a wonderful seer hearer smeller taster feeler he must have be -- and how all the time he mind must have play upon the gathering of he sens all scene all man the very turn of a head the exact sound of a voice the taste of food the feel of the world -- all the emotion of he life must he have have there before he as he write he great mind play upon they reconstruct re-creating and put they down hot upon he page there be nothing strange about great man they be like we only deeper higher broader : they think as we do but with more intensity : they suffer as we do more keenly : they love as we do more tenderly i may be over-glorify the sense of smell but it be only because i walk this morning in a world of odour the greatest of the sens of course be not smell or hearing but sight what would not any man exchange for that : for the face one love for the scene one hold most dear for all that be beautiful and changeable and beyond description the scotch preacher say that the saddest line in all literature be those of milton writing of he blindness season return but not to I return day or the sweet approach of even or morn or sight of vernal bloom or summer 's rise or flock or herd or human face divine -- i have wander a long way from ditch-digging but not wholly without intention sooner or later i try to get back into the main road i throw down my spade in the wet trampled grass at the edge of the ditch i take off my coat and hang it over a limb of the little hawthorn tree i put my bag near it i roll up the sleeve of my flannel shirt : i give my hat a twirl i be ready for work -- the sens be the tool by which we lay hold upon the world : they be the implement of consciousness and growth so long as they be use upon the good earth -- use to wholesome weariness -- they remain healthy they yield enjoyment they nourish growth but let they once be remove from they natural employment and they turn and feed upon themselves they seek the stimulation of luxury they wallow in they own corruption and finally wear out perish from off the earth which they have not appreciate vice be ever the sens go astray -- so i dig there be something fine in hard physical labor straight ahead : no brain use just muscle i stand ankle-deep in the cool water : every spadeful come out with a smack and as i turn it over at the edge of the ditch small turgid rivulet course back again i do not think of anything in particular i dig a peculiar joy attend the very pull of the muscle i drive the spade home with one foot then i bent and lift and turn with a sort of physical satisfaction difficult to describe at first i have the cool of the morning but by seven o'clock the day be hot enough i open the breast of my shirt give my sleeve another roll and go at it again for half a hour until i dripped with perspiration i will knock off i say so i use my spade as a ladder and climb out of the ditch be very thirsty i walk down through the marshy valley to the clump of alder which grow along the creek i follow a cow-path through the thicket and come to the creek side where i knelt on a log and take a good long drink then i soused my head in the cool stream dash the water upon my arm and come up drip and gasp oh but it be fine so i come back to the hawthorn tree where i sit down comfortably and stretch my leg there be a poem in stretch leg -- after hard digging -- but i can not write it though i can feel it i get my bag and take out a half loaf of harriet 's bread break off big crude piece i eat it there in the shade how rarely we taste the real taste of bread we disguise it with butter we toast it we eat it with milk or fruit we even soak it with gravy -lrb- here in the country where we be not at all polite -- but very comfortable -rrb- so that we never get the downright delicious taste of the bread itself i be hungry this morning and i eat my half loaf to the last crumb -- and want more then i lay down for a moment in the shade and look up into the sky through the thin outer branch of the hawthorn a turkey buzzard be lazily circle cloud-high above I : a frog boom intermittently from the little marsh and there be bee at work in the blossom -- i have another drink at the creek and go back somewhat reluctantly i confess to the work it be hot and the first joy of effort have wear off but the ditch be to be dig and i go at it again one become a sort of machine -- unthinking mechanical : and yet intense physical work though make no immediate impression on the mind often linger in the consciousness i find that sometimes i can remember and enjoy for long afterward every separate step in a task it be curious hard physical labor one actually stop think i often work long without any thought whatever so far as i know save that connect with the monotonous repetition of the labor itself -- down with the spade out with it up with it over with it -- and repeat and yet sometimes -- mostly in the forenoon when i be not at all tired -- i will suddenly have a sense as of the world open around I -- a sense of its beauty and its meaning -- give I a peculiar deep happiness that be near complete content -- happiness i have discover be nearly always a rebound from hard work it be one of the folly of man to imagine that they can enjoy mere thought or emotion or sentiment as well try to eat beauty for happiness must be trick she love to see man at work she love sweat weariness self-sacrifice she will be find not in palace but lurk in cornfield and factory and hover over litter desk : she crown the unconscious head of the busy child if you look up suddenly from hard work you will see she but if you look too long she fade sorrowfully away -- down toward the town there be a little factory for barrel hoop and stave it have one of the most musical whistle i ever hear in my life it toot at exactly twelve o'clock : bless sound the last half-hour at ditch-digging be a hard slow pull i be warm and tired but i stick down to it and wait with strain ear for the music at the very first note of that whistle i drop my spade i will even empty out a load of dirt half way up rather than expend another ounce of energy and i spring out of the ditch and start for home with a single desire in my heart -- or possibly lower down and harriet standing in the doorway seem to I a sort of angel -- a culinary angel talk of joy : there may be thing better than beef stew and baked potato and home-made bread -- there may be -- vii a argument with a millionnaire let the mighty and great roll in splendor and state i envy they not i declare it i eat my own lamb my own chicken and ham i shear my own sheep and wear it i have lawn i have bower i have fruit i have flower the lark be my morning charmer so you jolly dog now here 's god bless the plow -- long life and content to the farmer -- _ rhyme on a old pitcher of english pottery _ i have be hear of john starkweather ever since i come here he be a most important personage in this community he be rich horace especially love to talk about he give horace half a chance whether the subject be pig or church and he will break in somewhere with the remark : as i be say to mr starkweather -- or mr starkweather say to I -- how we love to shine by reflect glory even harriet have not go unscathed she too have be affect by the bacillus of admiration she have want to know several time if i see john starkweather drive by : the finest span of horse in this country she say and _ do _ you see he daughter much other information concern the starkweather household culinary and otherwise be current among we hill we know accurately the number of mr starkweather 's bedroom we can tell how much coal he use in winter and how many ton of ice in summer and upon such important premise we argue he riches several time i have pass john starkweather 's home it lie between my farm and the town though not on the direct road and it be really beautiful with the groom and guide beauty possible to wealth a stately old house with a huge end chimney of red brick stand with dignity well back from the road round about lie pleasant lawn that once be cornfield : and there be drive and walk and exotic shrub at first loving my own hill so well i be puzzle to understand why i should also enjoy starkweather 's groomed surroundings but it come to I that after all much as we may love wildness we be not wild nor we work what more artificial than a house or a barn or a fence and the greater and more formal the house the more formal indeed must be the nearer natural environment perhaps the hand of man might well have be less evident in develop the surroundings of the starkweather home -- for art deal with nature be so often too accomplished but i enjoy the starkweather place and as i look in from the road i sometimes think to myself with satisfaction : here be this rich man who have pay he thousand to make the beauty which i pass and take for nothing -- and have take leave as much behind and i wonder sometimes whether he inside he fence get more joy of it than i who walk the road outside anyway i be grateful to he for use he riches so much to my advantage on fine morning john starkweather sometimes come out in he slipper bare-head he white vest gleam in the sunshine and walk slowly around he garden charle baxter say that on these occasion he be ask he gardener the name of the vegetable however that may be he have seem to we community the very incarnation of contentment and prosperity -- he position the acme of desirability what be my astonishment then the other morning to see john starkweather come down the pasture lane through my farm i know he afar off though i have never meet he may i express the inexpressible when i say he have a rich look he walk rich there be richness in the confident crook of he elbow and in the positive twitch of the stick he carry : a man accustom to have door open before he knock i stand there a moment and look up the hill at he and i feel that profound curiosity which every one of we feel every day of he life to know something of the inner impulse which stir he nearest neighbor i should have like to know john starkweather but i think to myself as i have think so many time how surely one come finally to imitate he surroundings a farmer grow to be a part of he farm the sawdust on he coat be not the most distinctive insignia of the carpenter the poet write he truest line upon he own countenance people pass in my road take I to be a part of this natural scene i suppose i seem to they as a partridge squatting among dry grass and leave so like the grass and leave as to be invisible we all come to be mark upon by nature and dismiss -- how carelessly -- as genus or species and be it not the primal struggle of man to escape classification to form new differentiation sometimes -- i confess it -- when i see one pass in my road i feel like hail he and say : friend i be not all farmer i too be a person i be different and curious i be full of red blood i like people all sort of people if you be not interested in I at least i be intensely interested in you come over now and let 's talk so we be all of we call and call across the incalculable gulf which separate we even from we nearest friend once or twice this feeling have be so real to I that i have be near to the point of hail utter stranger -- only to be instantly overcome with a sense of the humorous absurdity of such a enterprise so i laugh it off and i say to myself : steady now : the man be go to town to sell a pig he be come back with ten pound of sugar five of salt pork a can of coffee and some new blade for he mow machine he have not time for talk -- and so i come down with a bump to my digging or hoeing or chop or whatever it be -- here i have leave john starkweather in my pasture while i remark to the extent of a page or two that i do not expect he to see I when he go by i assume that he be out for a walk perhaps to enliven a worn appetite -lrb- do you know confidentially i have have some pleasure in time past in reflect upon the jaded appetite of millionnaire -rrb- and that he would pass out by my lane to the country road but instead of that what should he do but climb the yard fence and walk over toward the barn where i be at work perhaps i be not consume with excitement : here be fresh adventure a farmer i say to myself with exultation have only to wait long enough and all the world come he way i have just begin to grease my farm wagon and be experience some difficulty in lifting and steadying the heavy rear axle while i take off the wheel i keep busily at work pretending -lrb- such be the perversity of the human mind -rrb- that i do not see mr starkweather he stand for a moment watch I then he say : good morning sir i look up and say : oh good morning nice little farm you have here it be enough for I i reply i do not especially like the little one be human then i have a absurd inspiration : he stand there so trim and jaunty and prosperous so rich i have a good look at he he be dress in a woollen jacket coat knee-trousers and leggin on he head he wear a jaunty cocky little scotch cap a man i should judge about fifty year old well-fed and hearty in appearance with grayish hair and a good-humoured eye i act on my inspiration : you have arrive i say at the psychological moment how 's that take hold here and help I lift this axle and steady it i be have a hard time of it the look of astonishment in he countenance be beautiful to see for a moment failure stare I in the face he expression say with emphasis : perhaps you do not know who i be but i look at he with the greatest good feeling and my expression say or i mean it to say : to be sure i do not : and what difference do it make anyway you take hold there i say without wait for he to catch he breath and i 'll get hold here together we can easily get the wheel off without a word he set he cane against the barn and bent he back up come the axle and i prop it with a board now i say you hang on there and steady it while i get the wheel off -- though indeed it do not really need much steadying as i straighten up whom should i see but harriet stand transfix in the pathway half way down to the barn transfix with horror she have recognize john starkweather and have hear at least part of what i say to he and the vision of that important man bend he back to help lift the axle of my old wagon be too terrible she catch my eye and point and mouth when i smile and nod john starkweather straighten up and look around do not on you life i warn let go of that axle he hold on and harriet turn and retreat ingloriously john starkweather 's face be a study do you ever grease a wagon i ask he genially never he say there be more of a art in it than you think i say and as i work i talk to he of the lore of axle-grease and show he exactly how to put it on -- neither too much nor too little and so that it would distribute itself evenly when the wheel be replace there be a right way of do everything i observe that be so say john starkweather : if i could only get workman that believe it by that time i could see that he be begin to be interested i put back the wheel give it a light turn and screw on the nut he help I with the other end of the axle with all good humor perhaps i say as engagingly as i know how you would like to try the art yourself you take the grease this time and i 'll steady the wagon all right he say laughing i be in for anything he take the grease box and the paddle -- less gingerly than i think he would be that right he demand and so he put on the grease and oh it be good to see harriet in the doorway steady there i say not so much at the end : now put the box down on the reach and so together we grease the wagon talk all the time in the friendliest way i actually believe that he be have a pretty good time at least it have the virtue of unexpectedness he be not bore when he have finish we both straighten we back and look at each other there be a twinkle in he eye : then we both laugh he be all right i say to myself i hold up my hand then he hold up he : it be hardly necessary to prove that wagon-greasing be not a delicate operation it be a good wholesome sign i say but it 'll come off do you happen to remember a story of tolstous 's call ivan the fool ' -lrb- what be a farmer do quote tolstous remark he countenance -- though he say not a word -rrb- in the kingdom of ivan you remember i say it be the rule that whoever have hard place on he hand come to table but whoever have not must eat what the other leave thus i lead he up to the back step and pour he a basin of hot water -- which i bring myself from the kitchen harriet have marvellously and completely disappear we both wash we hand talk with great good humor when we have finish i say : sit down friend if you have time and let 's talk so he sit down on one of the log of my woodpile : a solid sort of man rather warm after he recent activity he look I over with some interest and i think friendliness why do a man like you he ask finally waste himself on a little farm back here in the country for a single instant i come nearer to be angry than i have be for a long time _ waste _ myself so we be judge without knowledge i have a sudden impulse to demolish he -lrb- if i could -rrb- with the nearest sarcasm i could lay hand to he be so sure of himself oh well i think with vainglorious superiority he do not know so i say : what would you have I be -- a millionnaire he smile but with a sort of sincerity you might be he say : who can tell i laugh outright : the humor of it strike I as delicious here i have be ever since i first hear of john starkweather rather gloat over he as a poor suffering millionnaire -lrb- of course millionnaire _ be _ unhappy -rrb- and there he sit ruddy of face and hearty of body pity _ I _ for a poor unfortunate farmer back here in the country curious this human nature of ours be not it but how infinitely beguiling so i sit down beside mr starkweather on the log and cross my leg i feel as though i have set foot in a new country would you really advise I i ask to start in to be a millionnaire he chuckle : well that be one way of put it hitch you wagon to a star but begin by make a few dollar more a year than you spend when i begin -- he stop short with a amuse smile remember that i do not know who he be of course i say i understand that a man must begin small -- he be on pleasant ground -- and anywhere he like a few dollar here a few there he must work hard he must save he must be both bold and cautious i know a man who begin when he be about you age with total asset of ten dollar and a good digestion he be now consider a fairly wealthy man he have a home in the city a place in the country and he go to europe when he like he have so arrange he affair that young man do most of the work and he draw the dividend -- and all in a little more than twenty year i make every single cent -- but as i say it be a penny business to start with the point be i like to see young man ambitious -lrb- illustration : what would you have I be -- a millionaire -rrb- ambitious i ask for what why to rise in the world to get ahead i know you 'll pardon I i say for appear to cross-examine you but i be tremendously interested in these thing what do you mean by rise and who be i to get ahead of he look at I in astonishment and with evident impatience at my consummate stupidity i be serious i say i really want to make the best i can of my life it be the only one i have get see here he say : let we say you clear up five hundred a year from this farm -- you exaggerate -- i interrupted do i he laugh that make my case all the better now be not it possible to rise from that could not you make a thousand or five thousand or even fifty thousand a year it seem a unanswerable argument : fifty thousand dollar i suppose i might i say but do you think i would be any better off or happier with fifty thousand a year than i be now you see i like all these surroundings better than any other place i ever know that old green hill over there with the oak on it be a intimate friend of mine i have a good cornfield in which every year i work miracle i have a cow and a horse and a few pig i have a comfortable home my appetite be perfect and i have plenty of food to gratify it i sleep every night like a boy for i have not a trouble in this world to disturb I i enjoy the morning here in the country : and the evening be pleasant some of my neighbor have come to be my good friend i like they and i be pretty sure they like I inside the house there i have the best book ever write and i have time in the evening to read they -- i mean _ really _ read they now the question be would i be any better off or any happier if i have fifty thousand a year john starkweather laugh well sir he say i see i have make the acquaintance of a philosopher let we say i continue that you be willing to invest twenty year of you life in a million dollar -lrb- merely a illustration say john starkweather -rrb- you have it where you can put it in the bank and take it out again or you can give it form in house yacht and other thing now twenty year of my life -- to I -- be worth more than a million dollar i simply can not afford to sell it for that i prefer to invest it as somebody or other have say unearned in life i have always have a liking for intangible property see here say john starkweather you be take a narrow view of life you be make you own pleasure the only standard should not a man make the most of the talent give he have not he a duty to society now you be shift you ground i say from the question of personal satisfaction to that of duty that concern I too let I ask you : be not it important to society that this piece of earth be plow and cultivate yes but -- be not it honest and useful work of course be not it important that it shall not only be do but well do certainly it take all there be in a good man i say to be a good farmer but the point be he argue might not the same faculty apply to other thing yield better and bigger result that be a problem of course i say i try money-making once -- in a city -- and i be unsuccessful and unhappy here i be both successful and happy i suppose i be one of the young man who do the work while some millionnaire draw the dividend -lrb- i be cut close and i do not venture to look at he -rrb- no doubt he have he house and yacht and go to europe when he like i know i live upstairs -- back -- where there be not a tree to be see or a spear of green grass or a hill or a brook : only smoke and chimney and litter roof lord be thank for my escape sometimes i think that success have form a silent conspiracy against youth success hold up a single glittering apple and bid youth strip and run for it and youth run and success still hold the apple john starkweather say nothing yes i say there be duty we realize we farmer that we must produce more than we ourselves can eat or wear or burn we realize that we be the foundation : we connect human life with the earth we dig and plant and produce and have eat at the first table ourselves we pass what be leave to the banker and millionnaire do you ever think stranger that most of the war of the world have be fight for the control of this farmer 's second table have you think that the surplus of wheat and corn and cotton be what the railroad be struggle to carry upon we surplus run all the factory and mill a little of it gather in cash make a millionnaire but we farmer we sit back comfortably after dinner and joke with we wife and play with we baby and let all the rest of you fight for the crumb that fall from we abundant table if once we really care and get up and shake ourselves and say to the maid : ` here child do not waste the crust : gather 'em up and to-morrow we 'll have a cottage pudding ' where in the world would all the millionnaire be oh i tell you i wax eloquent i could not let john starkweather or any other man get away with the conviction that a millionnaire be better than a farmer moreover i say think of the position of the millionnaire he spend he time play not with life but with the symbol of life whether cash or house any day the symbol may change a little war may happen along there may be a defective flue or a western breeze or even a panic because the farmer be not scatter as many crumb as usual -lrb- they call it crop failure but i have notice that the farmer still continue to have plenty to eat -rrb- and then what happen to you millionnaire not know how to produce anything himself he would starve to death if there be not always somewhere a farmer to take he up to the table you be make a strong case laugh john starkweather strong i say it be simply wonderful what a leverage upon society a few acre of land a cow a pig or two and a span of horse give a man i be ridiculously independent i would be the hardest sort of a man to dislodge or crush i tell you my friend a farmer be like a oak he root strike deep in the soil he draw a sufficiency of food from the earth itself he breathe the free air around he he thirst be quench by heaven itself -- and there be no tax on sunshine i pause for very lack of breath john starkweather be laugh when you commiserate I therefore -lrb- i be sure i shall never do it again say john starkweather -rrb- -- when you commiserate I therefore and advise I to rise you must give I really good reason for change my occupation and become a millionnaire you must prove to I that i can be more independent more honest more useful as a millionnaire and that i shall have better and truer friend john starkweather look around at I -lrb- i know i have be absurdly eager and i be rather ashamed of myself -rrb- and put he hand on my knee -lrb- he have a wonderfully fine eye -rrb- i do not believe he say you would have any truer friend anyway i say repentantly i 'll admit that millionnaire have they place -- at present i would not do entirely away with they though i do think they would enjoy farm better and if i be to select a millionnaire for all the best thing i know i should certainly choose you mr starkweather he jump up you know who i be he ask i nod and you know all the time i nod well you be a good one we both laugh and fall to talk with the greatest friendliness i lead he down my garden to show he my prize pie-plant of which i be enormously proud and i pull for he some of the finest stalk i could find take it home i say it make the best pie of any pie-plant in this country he take it under he arm i want you to come over and see I the first chance you get he say i be go to prove to you by physical demonstration that it be better sport to be a millionnaire than a farmer -- not that i be a millionnaire : i be only accept the reputation you give I so i walk with he down to the lane let I know when you grease up again he say and i 'll come over so we shake hand : and he set off sturdily down the road with the pie-plant leaf wave cheerfully over he shoulder -lrb- illustration : somehow and suddenly i be a boy again -rrb- viii a boy and a preacher this morning i go to church with harriet i usually have some excuse for not go but this morning i have they out one by one and they be altogether so shabby that i decide not to use they so i put on my stiff shirt and harriet come out in she best black cape with the silk fringe she look so immaculate so ruddy so cheerfully sober -lrb- for Sunday -rrb- that i be reconcile to the idea of drive she up to the church and i be glad i go for the experience i have it be a ideal summer Sunday : sunshiny clear and still i believe if i have be some rip van winkle wake after twenty year ' sleep i should have know it for Sunday away off over the hill somewhere we could hear a lazy farm boy singing at the top of he voice : the higher cadence of he song reach we pleasantly through the still air the hen sit near the lane fence fluff the dust over they back be hold a small and talkative service of they own as we turn into the main road we see the patterson child on they way to church all the little girl in Sunday ribbon and all the little boy very uncomfortable in knit stocking it seem a pity to go to church on a day like this i say to harriet a pity she exclaim could anything be more appropriate harriet be good because she can not help it poor woman -- but i have not any pity for she it sometimes seem to I the more worshipful i feel the less i want to go to church i do not know why it be but these form simple though they be trouble I the moment a emotion especially a religious emotion become a institution it somehow lose life true emotion be rare and costly and that which be awaken from without never rise to the height of that which spring spontaneously from within back of the church stand a long low shed where we tie we horse a number of other buggy be already there several woman be stand in group preen they feather a neighbor of ours who have a tremendous bass voice be talk to a friend : ya oats be show up well but wheat be backward he voice which he be evidently try to subdue for Sunday boom through the still air so we walk among the tree to the door of the church a smile elder in a unaccustomed long coat bow and greet we as we go in there be a odour of cushion and we footstep on the wooden floor echo in the warm emptiness of the church the scotch preacher be find he place in the big bible he stand solid and shaggy behind the yellow oak pulpit a peculiar professional look on he face in the pulpit the scotch preacher be too much minister too little man he be best down among we with he hand in ours he be a sort of human solvent be there a twisted and hardened heart in the community he beam upon it from he cheerful eye he speak out of he great charity he give the friendly pressure of he large hand and that hardened heart dissolve and its frozen hopelessness lose itself in tear so he go through life seem always to understand he be not surprise by wickedness nor discourage by weakness : he be so sure of a greater strength but i must come to my experience which i be almost tempt to call a resurrection -- the resurrection of a boy long since go away and of a tall lank preacher who in he humility look upon himself as a failure i hardly know how it all come back to I possibly it be the scent-laden breeze that come in from the wood and through the half-open church window perhaps it be a line in one of the old song perhaps it be the droning voice of the scotch preacher -- somehow and suddenly i be a boy again -- to this day i think of death as a valley : a dark shadowy valley : the valley of the shadow of death so persistent be the impression of boyhood as i sit in the church i could see as distinctly as though i be there the church of my boyhood and the tall dyspeptic preacher loom above the pulpit the peculiar way the light come through the coarse color of the window the barrenness and stiffness of the great empty room the raw girder overhead the prim choir there be something in that preacher gaunt worn sodden though he appear : a spark somewhere a little flame mostly smother by the gray dreariness of he surroundings and yet blaze up at time to some warmth as i remember it we church be a church of failure they send we the old gray preacher wear out in other field such a succession of they i remember each with some peculiarity some pathos they be of the old sort indoctrinate presbyterian and they harrow well we barren field with the tooth of they hard creed some thunder the law some plead love but of all of they i remember best the one who think himself the greatest failure i think he have try a hundred church -- a hard life poorly pay unappreciated -- in a new country he have once have a family but one by one they have die no two be bury in the same cemetery and finally before he come to we village he wife too have go and he be old and out of health and discourage : seek some final warmth from he own cold doctrine how i see he a trifle bent in he long worn coat walk in the country road : not know of a boy who love he he tell my father once : i recall he exact word : my day have be long and i have fail it be not give I to reach man 's heart oh gray preacher may i now make amends will you forgive I i be a boy and do not know a boy whose emotion be hide under mountain of reserve : who could have stand up to be shoot more easily than he could have say : i love you of that preacher 's sermon i remember not one word though i must have hear score of they -- only that they be interminably long and dull and that my leg grow weary of sit and that i be often hungry it be no doubt the dreadful old doctrine that he preach thunder the horror of disobedience urge a impossible love through fear and a vain belief without reason all that touch I not at all save with a sort of wonder at the working of he great adam 's apple and the strange rolling of he cavernous eye this he look upon as the work of god thus for year he have seek with self-confessed failure to touch the soul of he people how we travel in darkness and the work we do in all seriousness count for naught and the thing we toss off in play-time unconsciously god use one tow-headed boy sit there in a front row dream dream if the sermon touch he not be yet thrill to the depths of he be by that tall preacher somewhere i say he have a spark within he i think he never know it : or if he know it he regard it as a wayward impulse that might lead he from he god it be a spark of poetry : strange flower in such a husk in time of emotion it bloom but in daily life it emit no fragrance i have wonder what might have be if some one -- some understanding woman -- have recognize he gift or if he himself as a boy have once dare to cut free we do not know : we do not know the tragedy of we nearest friend by some instinct the preacher choose he reading mostly from the old testament -- those splendid march passage full of oriental imagery as he read there would creep into he voice a certain resonance that lift he and he call suddenly above he gray surroundings how vividly i recall he reading of the twenty-third psalm -- a particular reading i suppose i have hear the passage many time before but upon this certain morning -- shall i ever forget the window be open for it be may and a boy could look out on the hillside and see with longing eye the invite grass and tree a soft wind blow in across the church it be full of the very essence of spring i smell it yet on the pulpit stand a bunch of crocus crowd into a vase : some mary 's offer a old man name johnson who sit near we be already begin to breathe heavily preparatory to sink into he regular Sunday snore then those word from the preacher bring I suddenly -- how shall i express it -- out of some formless void to intense consciousness -- a miracle of creation : yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil : for thou art with I thy rod and thy staff they comfort I well i see the way to the place of death that morning far more vividly i see it than any natural scene i know : and myself walk therein i shall know it again when i come to pass that way the tall dark rocky cliff the shadowy path within the overhang dark branch even the whiten dead bone by the way -- and as one of the vivid phantasm of boyhood -- cloak figure i see lurk mysteriously in deep recess fearsome for they very silence and yet i with magic rod and staff walking within -- boldly fear no evil full of faith hope courage love invoke image of terror but for the joy of brave they ah tow-headed boy shall i tread as lightly that dread pathway when i come to it shall i like you fear no evil so that great morning go away i hear nothing of singing or sermon and come not to myself until my mother touch my arm ask I if i have be asleep and i smile and think how little grown people know -- and i look up at the sad sick face of the old preacher with a new interest and friendliness i feel somehow that he too be a familiar of my secret valley i should have like to ask he but i do not dare so i follow my mother when she go to speak to he and when he do not see i touch he coat after that how i watch when he come to the reading and one great Sunday he choose a chapter from ecclesiaste the one that begin sonorously : remember now thy creator in the day of thy youth surely that gaunt preacher have the true fire in he gray soul how he voice dwelt and quiver and soften upon the word while the sun or the light or the moon or the star be not darken nor the cloud return after the rain -- thus he bring in the universe to that small church and fill the heart of a boy in the day when the keeper of the house shall tremble and the strong man shall bow themselves and the grinder cease because they be few and those that look out of the window be darken and the door shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grind be low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughter of music shall be bring low do not think that i understand the meaning of those passage : i be not vain enough to think i know even now -- but the _ sound _ of they the roll of they the beautiful word and above all the picture those daughter of music how i live for day imagine they they be of the tree and the hill and they be very beautiful but elusive one see they as he hear singing afar off sweet strain fading often into silence daughter of music daughter of music and why should they be bring low door shut in the street -- how i _ see _ they -- a long long street silent full of sunshine and the door shut and no sound anywhere but the low sound of the grind : and the mill with the wheel drowsily turn and no one there at all save one boy with flutter heart tiptoeing in the sunlit doorway and the voice of the bird not the song but the _ voice _ yes a bird have a voice i have know it always and yet somehow i have not dare to say it i feel that they would look at I with that question incredulous look which i dread beyond belief they might laugh but here it be in the book -- the voice of a bird how my appreciation of that book increase and what a new confidence it give I in my own image i go about for day listen listen listen -- and interpret so the word of the preacher and the fire in they : and when they shall be afraid of that which be high and fear shall be in the way -- i know the fear of that which be high : i have dream of it commonly and i know also the fear that stand in the way : he i have see in a myriad of form loom black by darkness in every lane i trod and yet with what defiance i meet and slew he and then more thrilling than all else the word of the preacher : or ever the silver cord be loose or the golden bowl be break or the pitcher be break at the fountain or the wheel break at the cistern such picture : that silver cord that golden bowl and why and wherefore a thousand way i turn they in my mind -- and always with the sound of the preacher 's voice in my ear -- the resonance of the word convey a indescribable fire of inspiration vaguely and yet with certainty i know the preacher speak out of some unfathomable emotion which i do not understand -- which i do not care to understand since then i have think what those word must have mean to he ah that tall lank preacher who think himself a failure : how long i shall remember he and the word he read and the mournful yet resonant cadence of he voice -- and the barren church and the stony religion heaven he give I unknow while he preach a ineffectual hell as we ride home harriet look into my face you have enjoy the service she say softly yes i say it _ be _ a good sermon she say be it i reply ix the tramp i have have a new and strange experience -- droll in one way grotesque in another and when everything be say tragic : at least a adventure harriet look at I accusingly and i have have to preserve the air of one deeply contrite now for two day -lrb- no easy accomplishment for I -rrb- even though in secret i have smile and ponder how we life have be warped by book we be not contented with reality : we crave conclusion with what ardor we mind respond to real event with literary deduction upon a train of incident as unconnected as life itself we be wont to clap a booky end a instinctive desire for completeness animate the human mind -lrb- a struggle to circumscribe the infinite -rrb- we would like to have life turn out -- but it do not -- it do not each event be the beginning of a whole new genealogy of event in boyhood i remember ask after every story i hear : what happen next for no conclusion ever quite satisfied I -- even when the hero die in he own gore i always know there be something yet remain to be tell the only sure conclusion we can reach be this : life change and what be more enthralling to the human mind than this splendid boundless color mutability -- life in the make how strange it be then that we should be contented to take such small part of it as we can grasp and to say this be the true explanation by such device we seek to bring infinite existence within we finite egoistic grasp we solidify and define where solidification mean loss of interest and loss of interest not year be old age so i have muse since my tramp come in for a moment out of the mystery -lrb- as we all do -rrb- and go away again into the mystery -lrb- in we way too -rrb- there be strange thing in this world \* \* \* \* \* as i come around the corner i see sit there on my step the very personification of ruin a tumble-down dilapidated wreck of manhood he give one the impression of have be drop where he sit all in a heap my first instinctive feeling be not one of recoil or even of hostility but rather a sudden desire to pick he up and put he where he belong the instinct i should say of the normal man who hang he axe always on the same nail when he see I he gather himself together with reluctance and stand fully reveal it be a curious attitude of mingled effrontery and apology hit I if you dare bluster he outward personality for god 's sake do not hit I cry the innate fear in he eye i stop and look at he sharply he eye drop he look slide away so that i experience a sense of shame as though i have trample upon he a damp rag of humanity i confess that my first impulse and a strong one be to kick he for the good of the human race no man have a right to be like that and then quite suddenly i have a great revulsion of feel what be i that i should judge without knowledge perhaps after all here be one bearing treasure so i say : you be the man i have be expect he do not reply only flash he eye up at I wherein fear deepen i have be save up a coat for you i say and a pair of shoe they be not much worn i say but a little too small for I i think they will fit you he look at I again not sharply but with a sort of weak cunning so far he have not say a word i think we supper be nearly ready i say : let we go in no mister he mumble a bite out here -- no mister -- and then as though the sound of he own voice inspire he he grow declamatory i be a respectable man mister plumber by trade but -- but i interrupt you can not get any work you be cold and you have not have anything to eat for two day so you be walk out here in the country where we farmer have no plumbing to do at home you have a starve wife and three small child -- six mister -- well six -- and now we will go in to supper i lead he into the entry way and pour for he a big basin of hot water as i step out again with a comb he be slink toward the doorway here i say be a comb we be have supper now in a few minute i wish i could picture harriet 's face when i bring he into she immaculate kitchen but i give she a look one of the commanding sort that i can put on in time of great emergency and she silently lay another place at the table when i come to look at we ruin by the full lamplight i be surprise to see what a change a little warm water and a comb have work in he he come to the table uncertain blinking apologetic he forehead i saw be really impressive -- high narrow and thin-skinned he face give one somehow the impression of a carve once full of significant line now blur and worn as though time have first marked it with the line of character have grow discourage and brush the hand of forgetfulness over she work he have peculiar thin silky hair of no particular color with a certain almost childish pathetic waviness around the ear and at the back of the neck something after all about the man arouse one 's compassion i do not know that he look dissipate and surely he be not as dirty as i have at first suppose something remain that suggest a care for himself in the past it be not dissipation i decide it be rather a indefinable looseness and weakness that give one alternately the feeling i have first experience that of anger succeed by the compassion that one feel for a child to harriet when she have once see he he be all child and she all compassion we disturb he with no question harriet 's fundamental quality be homeliness comfortableness she tea-kettle seem always sing a indefinable tabbiness as of feather cushion lurk in she dining-room a right warmth of table and chair indescribably comfortable at the end of a chilly day a busy good-smelling steam arise from all she dish at once and the light in the middle of the table be of a redness that enthrall the human soul as for harriet herself she be the personification of comfort airy clean warm inexpressibly wholesome and never in the world be she so engaging as when she minister to a man 's hunger truthfully sometimes when she come to I out of the dimmer light of the kitchen to the radiance of the table with a plate of muffin it be as though she and the muffin be a part of each other and that she be really offer some of herself and down in my heart i know she be do just that well it be wonderful to see we ruin expand in the warmth of harriet 's presence he have be doubtful of I of harriet i could see he be absolutely sure and how he do eat say nothing at all while harriet ply he with food and talk to I of the most disarm commonplace i think it do she heart good to see the way he eat : as though he have have nothing before in day as he butter he muffin not without some refinement i could see that he hand be long a curious lean ineffectual hand with a curve little finger with the drinking of the hot coffee color begin to steal up into he face and when harriet bring out a quarter of pie save over from we dinner and place it before he -- a fine brown pie with small hieroglyphic in the top from whence rise sugary bubble -- he seem almost to escape himself and harriet fairly purr with hospitality the more he eat the more of a man he become he manners improve he back straighten up he acquire a not unimpressive poise of the head such be the miraculous power of hot muffin and pie as you come down i ask finally do you happen to see old man masterson 's threshing machine a big red one with a yellow blow-off that be the one i say well it be just turn into a field about two mile above here he reply big gray banked barn i ask yes and a little unpainted house say we friend that be parson ' put in harriet with a mellow laugh i wonder if he ever _ will _ paint that house he build bigger barn every year and do not touch the house poor mr parson -- and so we talk of barn and threshing machine in the way we farmer love to do and i lure we friend slowly into talk about himself at first he be non-committal enough and what he say seem curiously make to order he use certain set phrase with which to explain simply what be not easy to explain -- a device not uncommon to all of we i be fearful of not get within this outward armouring but gradually as we talk and harriet pour he a third cup of hot coffee he drop into a more familiar tone he tell with some sprightliness of have see threshing in mexico how the grain be beat out with flail in the patio and afterwards throw up in the wind to winnow out you must have see a good deal of life remark harriet sympathetically at this remark i see one of we ruin 's long hand draw up and clinch he turn he head toward harriet he face be partly in the shadow but there be something striking and strange in the way he look at she and a deepness in he voice when he speak : too much i have see too much of life he throw out one arm and bring it back with a shudder you see what it have leave I he say i be a example of too much life in response to harriet 's melting compassion he have speak with unfathomable bitterness suddenly he lean forward toward I with a pierce gaze as though he would look into my soul he face have change completely from the loose and vacant mask of the early evening it have take on the utmost tensity of emotion you do not know he say what it be to live too much -- and to be afraid live too much i ask yes live too much that be what i do -- and i be afraid he pause a moment and then break out in a higher key : you think i be a tramp yes -- you do i know -- a worthless fellow lie beg steal when he can not beg you have take I in and feed I you have say the first kind word i have hear it seem to I in year i do not know who you be i shall never see you again i can not well describe the intensity of the passion with which he speak he face shake with emotion he hand tremble oh yes i say easily we be comfortable people here -- and it be a good place to live no no he return i know i have get my call -- then lean forward he say in a lower even more intense voice -- i live everything beforehand i be startle by the look of he eye : the abject terror of it : and i think to myself the man be not right in he mind and yet i long to know of the life within this strange husk of manhood i know he say as if read my thought you think -- and he tap he forehead with one finger -- but i be not i be as sane as you be it be a strange story he tell it seem almost unbelievable to I as i set it down here until i reflect how little any one of we know of the deep life within he nearest neighbor -- what story there be what tragedy enact under a calm exterior what a drama there _ may _ be in this commonplace man buying ten pound of sugar at the grocery store or this other one drive he two old horse in the town road we do not know and how rarely be the man of inner adventure articulate therefore i treasure the curious story the tramp tell I i do not question its truth it come as all truth do through a clouded and unclean medium : and any judgment of the story itself must be base upon a knowledge of the personal equation of the ruin who tell it i be no tramp he say in reality i be no tramp i begin as well as anyone -- it do not matter now only i will not have any of the sympathy that people give to the man who have see better day i hate sentiment _ i hate it _ -- i can not attempt to set down the story in he own word it be break with exclamation and involve with wander sophistry and diatribe of self-blame he mind have trample upon itself in throe of introspection until it be often difficult to say which way the path of the narrative really lead he have think so much and act so little that he travel in a veritable bog of indecision and yet withal some idea by constant attrition have acquire a really striking form i be afraid before life he say it make I dizzy with think at another time he say if i be a tramp at all i be a mental tramp i have a unanchored mind it seem that he come to a realisation that there be something peculiar about he at a very early age he say they would look at he and whisper to one another and that he saying be much repeat often in he hearing he know that he be consider a extraordinary child : they bait he with question that they might laugh at he quaint reply he say that as early as he could remember he use to plan situation so that he might say thing that be strange and even shocking in a child he father be a small professor in a small college -- a worm he call he bitterly -- one of those worm that bore in book and finally dry up and blow off but he mother -- he say she be a angel i recall he exact expression about she eye that when she look at one it make he better he speak of she with a softening of the voice look often at harriet he talk a good deal about he mother try to account for himself through she she be not strong he say and very sensitive to the contact of either friend or enemy -- evidently a nervous high-strung woman you have know such people he say everything hurt she he say she starve to death she starve for affection and understand one of the first thing he recall of he boyhood be he passionate love for he mother i can remember he say lie awake in my bed and think how i would love she and serve she -- and i could see myself in all sort of impossible place save she from danger when she come to my room to bid I good night i imagine how i should look -- for i have always be able to see myself do thing -- when i throw my arm around she neck to kiss she here he reach a strange part of he story i have be watch harriet out of the corner of my eye at first she face be tearful with compassion but as the ruin proceed it become a study in wonder and finally in outright alarm he say that when he mother come in to bid he good night he see himself so plainly beforehand -lrb- more vividly than i see you at this moment -rrb- and feel he emotion so keenly that when he mother actually stoop to kiss he somehow he could not respond he could not throw he arm around she neck he say he often lay quiet in wait tremble all over until she have go not only suffer himself but pity she because he understand how she must feel then he would follow she he say in imagination through the long hall see himself steal behind she just touch she hand wistfully hope that she might turn to he again -- and yet fear he say no one know the agony he suffer at see he mother 's disappointment over he apparent coldness and unresponsiveness i think he say it hasten she death he would not go to the funeral he do not dare he say he cry and fight when they come to take he away and when the house be silent he run up to she room and bury he head in she pillow and run in swift imagination to she funeral he say he could see himself in the country road hurry in the cold rain -- for it seem rain -- he say he could actually feel the stone and rut although he could not tell how it be possible that he should have see himself at a distance and _ feel _ in he own foot the stone of the road he say he see the box take from the wagon -- _ see _ it -- and that he hear the sound of the clod throw in and it make he shriek until they come run and hold he as he grow older he say he come to live everything beforehand and that the event as imagine be so far more vivid and affect that he have no heart for the reality itself it seem strange to you he say but i be tell you exactly what my experience be it be curious he say when he father tell he he must not do a thing how he go on and imagine in how many different way he could do it -- and how afterward he imagine he be punish by that worm he father whom he seem to hate bitterly of those early day in which he suffer acutely -- in idleness apparently -- and perhaps that be one of the cause of he disorder -- he tell we at length but many of the incident be so evidently worn by the constant handling of he mind that they give no clear impression finally he run away from home he say at first he find that a wholly new place and new people take he out of himself -lrb- surprised I he say so that i could not live everything beforehand -rrb- thus he flee the slang he use chase himself all over the country seem peculiarly expressive he have be in foreign country he have herd sheep in australium -lrb- so he say -rrb- and certainly from he knowledge of the country he have wander with the gambolero of south america he have go for gold to alaska and work in the lumber camp of the pacific northwest but he could not escape he say in a short time he be no longer surprise he account of he travels while fragmentary have a peculiar vividness he _ saw _ what he describe and he see it so plainly that he mind run off into curious detail that make he word strike sometimes like flash of lightning a strange and wonderful mind -- uncontrolled how that man need the discipline of common work i have rarely listen to a story with such rapt interest it be not only what he say nor how he say it but how he let I see the strange workings of he mind it be continuously a story of a story when he voice finally die down i draw a long breath and be astonish to perceive that it be nearly midnight -- and harriet speechless with she emotion for a moment he sit quiet and then burst out : i can not get away : i can not escape and the veritable look of some trap creature come into he eye fear so abject that i reach over and lay my hand on he arm : friend i say stop here we have a good country you have travel far enough i know from experience what a cornfield will do for a man i have live all sort of life he continue as if he have not hear a word i say and i have live it all twice and i be afraid face it i say grip he arm longing for some power to blow grit into he face it he exclaim do not you suppose i have try if i could do a thing -- anything -- a few time without think -- _ once _ would be enough -- i might be all right i should be all right he bring he fist down on the table and there be a note of resolution in he voice i move my chair nearer to he feel as though i be save a immortal soul from destruction i tell he of we life how the quiet and the work of it would solve he problem i sketch with enthusiasm my own experience and i plan swiftly how he could live absorb in simple work -- and in book try it i say eagerly i will he say rise from the table and grasp my hand i 'll stay here i have a peculiar thrill of exultation and triumph i know how the priest must feel have win a soul from torment he be tremble with excitement and pale with emotion and weariness one must begin the quiet life with rest so i get he off to bed first pour he a bathtub of warm water i lay out clean clothes by he bedside and take away he old one talk to he cheerfully all the time about common thing when i finally leave he and come downstairs i find harriet standing with frightened eye in the middle of the kitchen i be afraid to have he sleep in this house she say but i reassure she you do not understand i say owing to the excitement of the evening i spend a restless night before daylight while i be dream a strange dream of two man run the one who pursue be the exact counterpart of the one who flee i hear my name call aloud : david david i spring out of bed the tramp have go call harriet he have not even sleep in he bed he have raise the window drop out on the ground and vanish x the infidel i find that we have a infidel in this community i do not know that i should set down the fact here on good white paper the wall they say have eye the stone have ear but consider these word write in bated breath the worst of it be -- i gather from common report -- this infidel be a cheerful infidel whereas a true infidel should bear upon he face the living mark of he infamy we be all tolerant enough of those who do not agree with we provide only they be sufficiently miserable i confess when i first hear of he -- through mr horace -lrb- with shudder -rrb- -- i be possess of a consuming secret desire to see he i even think of climb a tree somewhere along the public road -- like zaccheus be not it -- and watch he go by if by any chance he should look my way i could easily avoid discovery by crouching among the leave it show how pleasant must be the path of unrighteousness that we be tempt to climb tree to see those who walk therein my imagination busy itself with the infidel i picture he as a sort of moloch tread we pleasant countryside flame and smoke proceeding from he nostril he foot striking fire he voice like the sound of a great wind at least that be the picture i form of he from common report and yesterday afternoon i meet the infidel and i must here set down a true account of the adventure it be surely a little new door open in the house of my understanding i might travel a whole year in a city brushing man 's elbow and not once have such a experience in country space man develop sensitive surface not callouse by too frequent contact accept the new impression vividly and keep it bright to think upon i meet the infidel as the result of a rather unexpected series of incident i do not think i have say before that we have for some time be expect a great event on this farm we have raise corn and buckwheat we have a fertile asparagus bed and onion and pie-plant -lrb- enough to supply the entire population of this community -rrb- and i can not tell how many other vegetable we have have plenty of chicken hatch out -lrb- i do not like chicken especially hen especially a certain gaunt and predatory hen name -lrb- so harriet say -rrb- evangeline who belong to a neighbor of ours -rrb- and we have have two litter of pig but until this bright moment of expectancy we never have have a calf upon the advice of horace which i often lean upon as upon a staff i have be keep my young heifer shut up in the cow-yard now for a week or two but yesterday toward the middle of the afternoon i find the fence break down and the cow-yard empty from what harriet say the brown cow must have be go since early morning i know of course what that mean and straightway i take a stout stick and set off over the hill trace the brown cow as far as i could by she track she have make way toward a clump of tree near horace 's wood lot where i confidently expect to find she but as fate would have it the pasture gate which be rarely use stand open and the track lead outward into a old road i follow rapidly half pleased that i have not find she within the wood it be a promise of new adventure which i come to with downright enjoyment -lrb- confidentially -- i should have be cultivate corn -rrb- i peer into every thicket as i pass : once i climb a old fence and standing on the top rail intently survey my neighbor 's pasture no brown cow be to be see at the cross of the brook i shoulder my way from the road down a path among the alder think the brown cow might have go that way to obscurity it be curious how in spite of domestication and training nature in she great moment return to the primitive and instinctive my brown cow never have have anything but the kindest treatment be as gentle a animal as could be imagine but she have follow the nameless ages-old law of she breed : she have escape in she great moment to the most secret place she know it do not matter that she would have be safer in my yard -- both she and she calf -- that she would have be surer of she food she could only obey the old wild law so turkey will hide they nest so the tame duck tame for unnumbered generation hear from afar the shrill cry of the wild drake will desert she quiet surroundings spread she little-used wing and become for a time the wildest of the wild so we think -- you and i -- that we be civilised but how often how often have we feel that old wildness which be we common heritage scarce shackled clamouring in we blood i stand listening among the alder in the deep cool shade here and there a ray of sunshine come through the thick foliage : i could see it where it silver the cobweb ladder of those moist space somewhere in the thicket i hear a unalarmed catbird trill she exquisite song a startled frog leap with a splash into the water faint odour of some blossom growth not distinguishable fill the still air it be one of those rare moment when one seem to have catch nature unaware i linger a full minute listen look but my brown cow have not go that way so i turn and go up rapidly to the road and there i find myself almost face to face with a ruddy little man whose countenance bear a look of round astonishment we be both surprised i recover first have you see a brown cow i ask he be still so astonished that he begin to look around he he thrust he hand nervously into he coat pocket and pull they out again i think you will not find she in there i say seek to relieve he embarrassment but i do not know then how very serious a person i have encounter no -- no he stammer i have not see you cow so i explain to he with sobriety and at some length the problem i have to solve he be greatly interested and inasmuch as he be go my way he offer at once to assist I in my search so we set off together he be rather stocky of build and decidedly short of breath so that i regulate my customary stride to suit he deliberation at first be fill with the spirit of my adventure i be not altogether please with this arrangement we conversation run something like this : stranger : have she any spot or mark on she myself : no she be plain brown stranger : how old a cow be she myself : this be she first calf stranger : valuable animal myself : _ -lrb- fencing -rrb- : _ i have never put a price on she she be a promising young heifer stranger : pure blood myself : no grade after a pause : stranger : live around here myself : yes half a mile below here do you stranger : yes three mile above here my name 's purdy myself : mine be grayson he turn to I solemnly and hold out he hand _ i be _ glad to meet you mr grayson he say and i be glad i say to meet you mr purdy i will not attempt to put down all we say : i could not but by such device be the truth in the country make manifest so we continue to walk and look occasionally i would unconsciously increase my pace until i be warn to desist by the puffing of mr purdy he give a essential impression of genial timidity : and how he _ do _ love to talk we come at last to a rough bit of land grow up to scrubby oak and hazel brush this say mr purdy look hopeful we follow the old road examine every bare spot of earth for some evidence of the cow 's track but without find so much as a sign i be for push onward but mr purdy insist that this clump of wood be exactly such a place as a cow would like he develop such a capacity for argumentation and seem so sure of what he be talk about that i yield and we enter the wood we 'll part here he say : you keep over there about fifty yard and i 'll go straight ahead in that way we 'll cover the ground keep a-shoutin ' so we start and i keep a-shoutin ' he would answer from time to time : hulloo hulloo it be a wild and beautiful bit of forest the ground under the tree be thickly cover with enormous fern or bracken with here and there patch of light where the sun come through the foliage the low spot be fill with the coarse green verdure of skunk cabbage i be so sceptical about find the cow in a wood where concealment be so easy that i confess i rather idle and enjoy the surroundings suddenly however i hear mr purdy 's voice with a new note in it : hulloo hulloo -- what luck hulloo hulloo -- i be come -- and i turn and run as rapidly as i could through the tree jump over log and dodge low branch wonder what new thing my friend have discover so i come to he side have you get trace of she i question eagerly sh he say over there do not you see she where where he point but for a moment i could see nothing but the tree and the bracken then all at once like the puzzle in a picture i see she plainly she be stand perfectly motionless she head lower and in such a peculiar clump of bush and fern that she be all but indistinguishable it be wonderful the perfection with which she instinct have lead she to conceal herself all excitement i start toward she at once but mr purdy put he hand on my arm wait he say do not frighten she she have she calf there no i exclaimed for i could see nothing of it we go cautiously a few step nearer she throw up she head and look at we so wildly for a moment that i should hardly have know she for my cow she be indeed for the time be a wild creature of the wood she make a low sound and advance a step threateningly steady say mr purdy this be she first calf stop a minute and keep quiet she 'll soon get use to we move to one side cautiously we sit down on a old log the brown heifer pause every muscle tense she eye literally blaze we sit perfectly still after a minute or two she lower she head and with curious guttural sound she begin to lick she calf which lay quite hide in the bracken she have choose a perfect spot i think to myself for it be the wildest bit of forest i have see anywhere in this neighborhood at one side not far off rise a huge gray rock partly cover on one side with moss and round about be oak and a few ash tree of a poor scrubby sort -lrb- else they would long ago have be cut out -rrb- the earth underneath be soft and springy with leaf mould -- mr purdy be one to whom silence be painful he fidget about evidently burst with talk and yet feel compel to follow he own injunction of silence presently he reach into he capacious pocket and hand I a little paper-covered booklet i take it curious and read the title : be there a hell it strike I humorously in the country we be always -- at least some of we be -- more or less in a religious ferment the city may distract itself to the point where faith be unnecessary but in the country we must perforce have something to believe in and we talk about it too i read the title aloud but in a low voice : be there a hell then i ask : do you really want to know the argument be all there he reply well i say i can tell you off-hand out of my own experience that there certainly be a hell -- he turn toward I with evident astonishment but i proceed with tranquillity : yes sir there be no doubt about it i have be near enough myself several time to smell the smoke it be not around here i say as he look at I he china-blue eye grow larger if that be possible and he serious gentle face take on a look of pained surprise before you say such thing he say i beg you to read my book he take the tract from my hand and open it on he knee the bible tell we he say that in the begin god create the heaven and the earth he make the firmament and divide the water but do the bible say that he create a hell or a devil do it i shake my head well then he say triumphantly and that be not all either the historian mose give in detail a full account of what be make in six day he tell how day and night be create how the sun and the moon and the star be make he tell how god create the flower of the field and the insect and the bird and the great whale and say ` be fruitful and multiply ' he account for every minute of the time in the entire six day -- and of course god rest on the seventh -- and there be not one word about hell be there i shake my head well then -- exultantly where be it i would like to have any man no matter how wise he be answer that where be it that i say have trouble I too we do not always know just where we hell be if we do we might avoid they we be not so sensitive to they as we should be -- do you think he look at I intently : i go on before he could answer : why i have see man in my time live from day to day in the very atmosphere of perpetual torment and actually argue that there be no hell it be a strange sight i assure you and one that will trouble you afterwards from what i know of hell it be a place of very loose boundary sometimes i have think we could not be quite sure when we be in it and when we be not i do not tell my friend but i be think of the remark of old swedenborg : the trouble with hell be we shall not know it when we arrive at this point mr purdy burst out again have open he little book at another page when adam and eve have sin he say and the god of heaven walk in the garden in the cool of the evening and call for they and they have hide themselves on account of they disobedience do god say to they : unless you repent of you sin and get forgiveness i will shut you up in yon dark and dismal hell and torment you -lrb- or have the devil do it -rrb- for ever and ever be there such a word i shake my head -lrb- illustration : he reach into he pocket and hand I a little paper-covered booklet -rrb- no sir he say vehemently there be not but do it say i ask that adam and eve have not themselves be use they best wit in create a hell that point have occur to I in my experience i have know both adam and eve who be most adroit in they capacity for make place of torment -- and afterwards of get into they just watch yourself some day after you have sow a crop of desire and you 'll see promising little hell start up within you like pigweed and pusley after a warm rain in you garden and we heaven too for that matter -- they grow to we own planting : and how sensitive they be too how soon the hot wind of a passion wither they away how surely the fire of selfishness blacken they perfection i would almost forget mr purdy -- and when i look around he face wear a peculiar puzzle expression not unmixed with alarm he hold up he little book eagerly almost in my face if god have intend to create a hell he say i assert without fear of successful contradiction that when god be there in the garden of eden it be the time for he to have put adam and eve and all they posterity on notice that there be a place of everlasting torment it would have be only a square deal for he to do so but do he i shake my head he do not if he have mention hell on that occasion i should not now dispute its existence but he do not this be what he say to adam -- the very word : ` in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground : for out of it thou wast take : for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return ' you see he do not say ` unto hell shalt thou return ' he say ` unto dust ' that be not hell be it well i say there be in my experience a great many different kind of hell there be almost as many kind of hell as there be man and woman upon this earth now you hell would not terrify I in the least my own make I no end of trouble talk about burn pitch and brimstone : how futile be the imagination of the old fellow who conjure up such puerile torment why i can tell you of no end of hell that be worse -- and not half try once i remember when i be younger -- i happen to glance around at my companion he sit there look at I with horror -- fascinate horror well i will not disturb you peace of mind by tell _ that _ story i say do you believe that we shall go to hell he ask in a low voice that depend i say let 's leave out the question of ` we ' let 's be more comfortably general in we discussion i think we can safely say that some go and some do not it be a curious and noteworthy thing i say but i have know of case -- there be some people who be not really worth good honest torment -- let alone the reward of heavenly bliss they just have not anything to torment what be go to become of such folk i confess i do not know you remember when dante begin he journey into the infernal region -- i do not believe a word of that dante he interrupt excitedly it be all a make up story there be not a word of truth in it it be a blasphemous book let I read you what i say about it in here i will agree with you without argument i say that it be not _ all _ true i merely want to speak of one of dante 's experience as a illustration of the point i be make you remember that almost the first spirit he meet on he journey be those who have never do anything in this life to merit either heaven or hell that always strike I as be about the worst plight imaginable for a human be think of a creature not even worth good honest brimstone since i come home i have look up the passage and it be a wonderful one dante hear wailing and groan and terrible thing say in many tongue yet these be not the soul of the wicked they be only those who have live without praise or blame thinking of nothing but themselves heaven would not dull its brightness with those nor would lower hell receive they and what be it ask dante that make they so grievously suffer hopelessness of death say virgil they blind existence here and immemorable former life make they so wretched that they envy every other lot mercy and justice alike disdain they let we speak of they no more look and pass but mr purdy in spite of he timidity be a man of much persistence they tell I he say when they try to prove the reasonableness of hell that unless you show sinner how they be goin ' to be torment they would never repent now i say that if a man have to be scare into religion he religion be not much good there i say i agree with you completely he face light up and he continue eagerly : and i tell 'em : you just go ahead and try for heaven do not pay any attention to all this talk about everlasting punishment good advice i say it have begin to grow dark the brown cow be quiet at last we could hear small faint sound from the calf i start slowly through the bracken mr purdy hang at my elbow stumble sideways as he walk but continue to talk eagerly so we come to the place where the calf lay i speak in a low voice : so boss so boss i would have lay my hand on she neck but she start back with a wild toss of she horn it be a beautiful calf i look at it with a peculiar feeling of exultation pride ownership it be red-brown with a round curly pate and one white leg as it lay curl there among the fern it be really beautiful to look at when we approach it do not so much as stir i lift it to its leg upon which the cow utter a strange half-wild cry and run a few step off she head throw in the air the calf fall back as though it have no leg she be tell it not to stand up say mr purdy i have be afraid at first that something be the matter some be like that he say some call they calf to run other will not let you come near 'em at all and i have even know of a case where a cow gore its calf to death rather than let anyone touch it i look at mr purdy not without a feeling of admiration this be a thing he know : a language not teach in the university how well it become he to know it how simply he express it i think to myself : there be not many man in this world after all that it will not pay we to go to school to -- for something or other i should never have be able indeed to get the cow and calf home last night at least if it have not be for my chance friend he know exactly what to do and how to do it he wear a stout coat of denim rather long in the skirt this he slip off while i look on in some astonishment and spread it out on the ground he place my staff under one side of it and find another stick nearly the same size for the other side these he wind into the coat until he have make a sort of stretcher upon this we place the unresisting calf what a fine one it be then he in front and i behind we carry the stretcher and its burden out of the wood the cow follow sometimes threatening sometimes bellow sometimes start off wildly head and tail in the air only to rush back and venture up with tremble muscle touch she tongue to the calf utter low maternal sound keep steady say mr purdy and everything 'll be all right when we come to the brook we stop to rest i think my companion would have like to start he argument again but he be too short of breath it be a prime spring evening the frog be tuning up i hear a drowsy cowbell somewhere over the hill in the pasture the brown cow with eager outstretched neck be lick she calf as it lay there on the improvise stretcher i look up at the sky a blue avenue of heaven between the tree top i feel the peculiar sense of mystery which nature so commonly convey i have be too sure i say what do we know after all why may there not be future heaven and hell -- ` other heaven for other earth ' we do not know -- we do not _ know _ -- so carry the calf in the cool of the evening we come at last to my yard we have no sooner put the calf down than it jump nimbly to its foot and run wobble absurdly to meet its mother the rascal i say after all we work it be the nature of the animal say mr purdy as he put on he coat i could not thank he enough i invite he to stay with we to supper but he say he must hurry home then come down soon to see I i say and we will settle this question as to the existence of a hell he step up close to I and say with a appealing note in he voice : you do not really believe in a hell do you how human nature love collusiveness : nothing short of the categorical will satisfy we what i say to mr purdy evidently appease he for he seize my hand and shake and shake we have not understand each other he say eagerly you do not believe in eternal damnation any more than i do then he add as though some new uncertainty puzzle he do you at supper i be tell harriet with gusto of my experience suddenly she break out : what be he name purdy why he be the infidel that mr horace tell about be that possible i say and i drop my knife and fork the strangest sensation come over I why i say then i be a infidel too so i laugh and i have be laugh gloriously ever since -- at myself at the infidel at the entire neighborhood i recall that delightful character in the vicar of wakefield -lrb- my friend the scotch preacher love to tell about he -rrb- who season error by cry out fudge fudge i say we be all poor sinner xi the country doctor _ Sunday afternoon June 9 _ we have a funeral to-day in this community and the longest funeral procession charle baxter say he have see in all the year of he memory among these hill a good man have go away -- and yet remain in the comparatively short time i have be here i never come to know he well personally though i see he often in the country road a ruddy old gentleman with thick coarse iron-gray hair somewhat stern of countenance somewhat shabby of attire sit as erect as a trooper in he open buggy one muscular hand rest on he knee the other hold the rein of he familiar old white horse i say i do not come to know he well personally and yet no one who know this community can help know doctor john north i never so desire the gift of move expression as i do at this moment on my return from he funeral that i may give some faint idea of what a good man mean to a community like ours -- as the more complete knowledge of it have come to I to-day in the district school that i attend when a boy we use to love to leave we mark as we call it wherever we roving lead we it be a bit of boyish mysticism unaccountable now that we have grow older and wiser -lrb- perhaps -rrb- but it have its meaning it be a instinctive outreaching of the young soul to perpetuate the knowledge of its existence upon this forgetful earth my mark i remember be a notch and a cross with what secret fond diligence i carve it in the gray bark of beech tree on fence post or on barn door and once i remember on the roof-ridge of we home and once with high imagining of how long it would remain i spend hour chisel it deep in a hard-headed old boulder in the pasture where if man have be as kind as nature it remain to this day if you should chance to see it you would not know of the boy who carve it there so doctor north leave he secret mark upon the neighborhood -- as all of we do for good or for ill upon _ we _ neighborhood in accordance with the strength of that character which abide within we for a long time i do not know that it be he though it be not difficult to see that some strong good man have often pass this way i see the mystic sign of he deep-lettered in the hearthstone of a home i hear it speak bravely from the weak lip of a friend it be carve in the plastic heart of many a boy no i do not doubt the immortality of the soul in this community which i have come to love so much dwell more than one of john north 's immortality -- and will continue to dwell i too live more deeply because john north be here he be in no outward way a extraordinary man nor be he life eventful he be bear in this neighborhood : i see he lie quite still this morning in the same sunny room of the same house where he first see the light of day here among these common hill he grow up and save for the few year he spend at school or in the army he live here all he life long in old neighborhood and especially farm neighborhood people come to know one another -- not clothes knowledge or money knowledge -- but that sort of knowledge which reach down into the hidden spring of human character a country community may be deceive by a stranger too easily deceive but not by one of its own people for it be not a study knowledge it resemble that slow geologic uncover before which not even the deep bury bone of the prehistoric saurian remain finally hide i never fully realize until this morning what a supreme triumph it be have grow old to merit the respect of those who know we best mere greatness offer no reward to compare with it for greatness compel that homage which we freely bestow upon goodness so long as i live i shall never forget this morning i stand in the door-yard outside of the open window of the old doctor 's home it be soft and warm and very still -- a June Sunday morning a apple tree not far off be still in blossom and across the road on a grassy hillside sheep feed unconcernedly occasionally from the roadway where the horse of the countryside be wait i hear the clink of a bit-ring or the low voice of some new-comer seek a place to hitch not half those who come could find room in the house : they stand uncovered among the tree from within waft through the window come the faint odour of flower and the occasional minor intonation of someone speaking -- and finally we own scotch preacher i could not see he but there lay in the cadence of he voice a peculiar note of peacefulness of finality the day before he die dr north have say : i want mcalway to conduct my funeral not as a minister but as a man he have be my friend for forty year he will know what i mean the scotch preacher do not say much why should he everyone there _ know _ : and speech would only have cheapen what we know and i do not now recall even the little he say for there be so much all about I that speak not of the death of a good man but of he life a boy who stand near I -- a boy no longer for he be as tall as a man -- give a more eloquent tribute than any preacher could have do i see he stand he ground for a time with that grim courage of youth which dread emotion more than a battle : and then i see he cry behind a tree he be not a relative of the old doctor 's he be only one of many into whose deep life the doctor have enter they sing lead kindly light and come out through the narrow doorway into the sunshine with the coffin the hat of the pallbearer in a row on top and there be hardly a dry eye among we and as they come out through the narrow doorway i think how the doctor must have look out daily through so many many year upon this beauty of hill and field and of sky above grow dearer from long familiarity -- which he would know no more and kate north the doctor 's sister he only relative follow behind she fine old face gray and set but without a tear in she eye how like the doctor she look : the same stern control in the hour which follow on the pleasant wind way to the cemetery in the group under the tree on the way homeward again the community speak its true heart and i have come back with the feeling that human nature at bottom be sound and sweet i know a great deal before about doctor north but i know it as knowledge not as emotion and therefore it be not really a part of my life i hear again the story of how he drive the country road winter and summer how he have see most of the population into the world and have hold the hand of many who go out it be the plain hard life of a country doctor and yet it seem to rise in we community like some great tree its root deep bury in the soil of we common life its branch close to the sky to those accustom to the outward excitement of city life it would have seem barren and uneventful it be significant that the talk be not so much of what the doctor do as of _ how _ he do it not so much of he action as of the natural expression of he character and when we come to think of it goodness _ be _ uneventful it do not flash it glow it be deep quiet and very simple it pass not with oratory it be commonly foreign to riches nor do it often sit in the place of the mighty : but may be feel in the touch of a friendly hand or the look of a kindly eye outwardly john north often give the impression of brusqueness many a woman go to he for the first time and until she learn that he be in reality as gentle as a girl be frighten by he manner the country be full of story of such encounter we laugh yet over the adventure of a woman who formerly come to spend she summer here she dress very beautifully and be nervous one day she go to call on the doctor he make a careful examination and ask many question finally he say with portentous solemnity : madam you be suffer from a very common complaint the doctor pause then continue impressively : you have not enough work to do this be what i would advise go home discharge you servant do you own cooking wash you own clothes and make you own bed you 'll get well she be report to have be much offended and yet to-day there be a wreath of white rose in doctor north 's room send from the city by that woman if he really hate anything in this world the doctor hate whimperer he have a deep sense of the purpose and need of punishment and he despise those who flee from wholesome discipline a young fellow once go to the doctor -- so they tell the story -- and ask for something to stop he pain stop it exclaim the doctor : why it be good for you you have do wrong have not you well you be be punish take it like a man there be nothing more wholesome than good honest pain and yet how much pain he alleviate in this community -- in forty year the deep sense that a man should stand up to he fate be one of the key-note of he character and the way he teach it not only by word but by every action of he life put heart into many a weak man and woman mr patterson a friend of ours tell of a reply she once have from the doctor to whom she have go with a new trouble after tell he about it she say : i have leave it all with the lord you would have do better say the doctor to keep it yourself trouble be for you discipline : the lord do not need it it be thus out of he wisdom that he be always tell people what they know deep down in they heart to be true it sometimes hurt at first but sooner or later if the man have a spark of real manhood in he he come back and give the doctor a abide affection there be those who though they love he call he intolerant i never could look at it that way he _ do _ have the only kind of intolerance which be at all tolerable and that be the intolerance of intolerance he always set himself with vigor against that unreason and lack of sympathy which be the essence of intolerance and yet there be a rock of conviction on many subject behind which he could not be drive it be not intolerance : it be with he a reason certainty of belief he have a phrase to express that not uncommon state of mind in this age particularly which be politely willing to yield its foothold within this universe to almost any reasoner who suggest some other universe however shadowy to stand upon he call it a mush of concession he might have be wrong in he conviction but he at least never flounder in a mush of concession i hear he say once : there be some thing a man can not concede and one be that a man who have break a law like a man who have break a leg have get to suffer for it it be only with the greatest difficulty that he could be prevail upon to present a bill it be not because the community be poor though some of we people be poor and it be certainly not because the doctor be rich and could afford such philanthropy for save a rather unproductive farm which during the last ten year of he life lay wholly uncultivated he be as poor as any man in the community he simply seem to forget that people owe he it come to be a common and humorous experience for people to go to the doctor and say : now doctor north how much do i owe you you remember you attend my wife two year ago when the baby come -- and john when he have the diphtheria -- yes yes say the doctor i remember i think i ought to pay you well i 'll look it up when i get time but he would not the only way be to go to he and say : doctor i want to pay ten dollar on account all right he would answer and take the money to the credit of the community i may say with truthfulness that the doctor never suffer he be even able to supply himself with the best instrument that money could buy to he nothing be too good for we neighborhood this morning i saw in a case at he home a complete set of oculist 's instrument say to be the best in the county -- a very unusual equipment for a country doctor indeed he assume that the responsibility for the health of the community rest upon he he be a sort of self-constituted health officer he be always sniff about for old well and damp cellar -- and somehow with he crisp humor and sound sense get they clean in he old age he even grow querulously particular about these thing -- ask a little more of human nature than it could quite accomplish there be innumerable other way -- how they come out to-day all glorified now that he be go -- in which he serve the community horace tell how he once meet the doctor drive he old white horse in the town road horace call the doctor why do not you paint you barn well say horace it _ be _ begin to look a bit shabby horace say the doctor you be a prominent citizen we look to you to keep up the credit of the neighborhood horace paint he barn i think doctor north be fonder of charle baxter than of anyone else save he sister he hate sham and cant : if a man have a single _ reality _ in he the old doctor find it and charle baxter in many way exceed any man i ever know in the downright quality of genuineness the doctor be never tire of tell -- and with humor -- how he once go to baxter to have a table make for he office when he come to get it he find the table upside clown and baxter on he knee finish off the under part of the drawer slide baxter look up and smile in the engaging way he have and continue he work after watch he for some time the doctor say : baxter why do you spend so much time on that table who be go to know whether or not the last touch have be put on the under side of it baxter straighten up and look at the doctor in surprise why i will he say how the doctor love to tell that story i warrant there be no boy who ever grow up in this country who have not hear it it be a part of he pride in finding reality that make the doctor such a lover of true sentiment and such a hater of sentimentality i prize one memory of he which illustrate this point the district school give a speaking and we all go one boy with a fresh young voice speak a soldier piece -- the soliloquy of a one-armed veteran who sit at a window and see the troops go by with dancing banner and glitter bayonet and the people cheer and shout and the refrain go something like this : never again call ` comrade ' to the man who be comrade for year never again call ` brother ' to the man we think of with tear i happen to look around while the boy be speak and there sit the old doctor with the tear roll unheed down he ruddy face he be think no doubt of _ he _ war time and the comrade _ he _ know on the other hand how he despise fustian and bombast he bah deliver explosively be often like a breath of fresh air in a stuffy room several year ago before i come here -- and it be one of the historic story of the county -- there be a semi-political fourth of July celebration with a number of ambitious orator one of they a young fellow of small worth who want to be elect to the legislature make a impassioned address on patriotism the doctor be present for he like gathering : he like people but he do not like the young orator and do not want he to be elect in the midst of the speech while the audience be be carry through the cloud of oratory the doctor be see to be grow more and more uneasy finally he burst out : bah the orator catch himself and then sweep on again bah say the doctor by this time the audience be really interested the orator stop he know the doctor and he should have know better than to say what he do but he be very young and he know the doctor be oppose he perhaps he remark sarcastically the doctor can make a better speech than i can the doctor rise instantly to he full height -- and he be a impressive-looking man perhaps he say i can and what be more i will he stand up on a chair and give they a talk on patriotism -- real patriotism -- the patriotism of duty do in the small concern of life that speech which end the political career of the orator be not forget to-day one thing i hear to-day about the old doctor impress I deeply i have be think about it ever since : it illuminate he character more than anything i have hear it be singular too that i should not have know the story before i do not believe it be because it all happen so long ago it rather remain untold out of deference to a sort of neighborhood delicacy i have indeed wonder why a man of such capacity so many quality of real greatness and power should have escape a city career i say something to this effect to a group of man with whom i be talk this morning i think they exchange glance one say : when he first come out of the army he have make such a fine record as a surgeon that everyone-urge he to go to the city and practice -- a pause follow which no one seem inclined to fill but he do not go i say no he do not go he be a brilliant young fellow he _ know _ a lot and he be popular too he would have have a great success -- another pause but he do not go i ask promptingly no he staid here he be better educate than any man in this county why i have see he more 'n once pick up a book of latin and read it _ for pleasure _ i could see that all this be purposely irrelevant and i like they for it but walk home from the cemetery horace give I the story the community know it to the last detail i suppose it be a story not uncommon among man but this morning tell of the old doctor we have just lay away it strike I with a tragic poignancy difficult to describe yes say horace he be to have be marry forty year ago and the match be break off because he be a drunkard a drunkard i exclaimed with a shock i can not convey yes sir say horace one o ' the worst you ever see he get it in the army handsome wild brilliant -- that be the doctor i be a little boy but i remember it mighty well he tell I the whole distressing story it be all a long time ago and the detail do not matter now it be to be expect that a man like the old doctor should love love once and love as few man do and that be what he do -- and the girl leave he because he be a drunkard they all think say horace that he have up a ' kill himself he say he would but he do not instid o ' that he put a open bottle on he table and he look at it and say : ` which be stronger now you or john north we 'll make that the test ' he say ` we 'll live or die by that ' they be he exact word he could not sleep night and he get haggard like a sick man but he leave the bottle there and never touch it how my heart throb with the thought of that old silent struggle how much it explain how near it bring all these people around he it make he so human it be the tragic necessity -lrb- but the salvation -rrb- of many a man that he should come finally to a irretrievable experience to the assurance that everything be lose for with that moment if he be strong he be save i wonder if anyone ever attain real human sympathy who have not pass through the fire of some such experience or to humor either for in the best laughter do we not hear constantly that deep minor note which speak of the ache in the human heart it seem to I i can understand doctor north he die Friday morning he have be lie very quiet all night suddenly he open he eye and say to he sister : good-bye kate and shut they again that be all the last call have come and he be ready for it i look at he face after death i see the iron line of that old struggle in he mouth and chin and the humor that it bring he in the line around he deep-set eye -- and as i think of he this afternoon i can see he -- curiously for i can hardly explain it -- carry a banner as in battle right here among we quiet hill and those he lead seem to be the people we know the man and the woman and the boy he be the hero of a new age in olden day he might have be a pioneer carry the light of civilisation to a new land here he have be a sort of moral pioneer -- a pioneering far more difficult than any we have ever know there be no heroics connect with it the name of the pioneer will not go ring down the age for it be a silent leadership and its success be measure by victory in other life we see it now only too dimly when he be go we reflect sadly that we do not stop to thank he how busy we be with we own affair when he be among we i wonder be there anyone here to take up the banner he have lay down -- i forget to say that the scotch preacher choose the most impressive text in the bible for he talk at the funeral : he that be greatest among you let he be as he that doth serve and we come away with a nameless ache sense of loss think how perhaps in a small way we might do something for somebody else -- as the old doctor do xii a evening at home how calm and quiet a delight be it alone to read and meditate and write by none offend and offend none to walk ride sit or sleep at one 's own ease and please a man 's self none other to displease -- _ charle cotton a friend of izaak walton _ 1650 during the last few month so many of the real adventure of life have be out of door and so much of the beauty too that i have scarcely write a word about my book in the summer the day be so long and the work so engross that a farmer be quite willing to sit quietly on he porch after supper and watch the long evening fall -- and rest he tired back and go to bed early but the winter be the true time for indoor enjoyment day like these a cold night after a cold day well wrap you have make arctic exploration to the stable the chicken-yard and the pig-pen you have dig you way energetically to the front gate stop every few minute to beat you arm around you shoulder and watch the white plume of you breath in the still air -- and you have rush in gladly to the warmth of the dining-room and the lamp-lit supper after such a day how sharp you appetite how good the taste of food harriet 's brown bread -lrb- moist with thick sweet dark crust -rrb- be never quite so delicious and when the meal be finish you push back you chair feeling like a sort of lord that be a good supper harriet you say expansively be it she ask modestly but with evident pleasure cookery you remark be the greatest art in the world -- oh you be hungry next to poetry you conclude and much better appreciate think how easy it be to find a poet who will turn you a presentable sonnet and how very difficult it be to find a cook who will turn you a edible beefsteak -- i say a good deal more on this subject which i shall not attempt to repeat harriet do not listen through it all she know what i be capable of when i really get start and she have she well-defined limit a practical person harriet when i have go about so far she begin clear the table or take up she mending -- but i do not mind it at all have begin talk it be wonderful how pleasant one 's own voice become and think of have a clear field -- and no interruption my own particular room where i be permit to revel in the desert of my own disorder open comfortably off the sitting-room a lamp with a green shade stand invitingly on the table shed a circle of light on the book and papers underneath but leave all the remainder of the room in dim pleasantness at one side stand a comfortable big chair with everything in arm 's reach include my note book and ink bottle where i sit i can look out through the open doorway and see harriet near the fireplace rock and sew sometimes she hum a little tune which i never confess to hear lest i miss some of the unconscious cadence let the wind blow outside and the snow drift in pile around the doorway and the blind rattle -- i have before I a whole long pleasant evening \* \* \* \* \* what a convenient and delightful world be this world of book -- if you bring to it not the obligation of the student or look upon it as a opiate for idleness but enter it rather with the enthusiasm of the adventurer it have vast advantage over the ordinary world of daylight of barter and trade of work and worry in this world every man be he own king -- the sort of king one love to imagine not concern in such petty matter as war and parliament and tax but a mellow and moderate despot who be a true patron of genius -- a mild old chap who have in he court the greatest man and woman in the world -- and all of they vie to please the most vagrant of he mood invite any one of they to talk and if you highness be not please with he you have only to put he back in he corner -- and bring some jester to sharpen the laughter of you highness or some poet to set you faintest emotion to music i have mark a certain servility in book they entreat you for a hearing : they cry out from they case -- like man in a eternal struggle for survival for immortality take I plead this one i be responsive to every mood you will find in I love and hate virtue and vice i do not preach : i give you life as it be you will find here adventure cunningly link with romance and seasoned to suit the most fastidious taste try _ I _ hear such talk cry he neighbor he be fiction what he say never happen at all he try hard to make you believe it but it be not true not a word of it now i be fact everything you find in I can be depend upon yes respond the other but who care nobody want to read you you be dull you be false as they voice grow shriller with argument you highness listen with the indulgent smile of royalty when its courtier contend for its favor know that they very life depend upon a wrinkle in you August brow \* \* \* \* \* as for I i confess to be a rather crusty despot when horace be over here the other evening talk learnedly about silo and ensilage i admit that i become the very pattern of humility but when i take my place in the throne of my arm-chair with the light from the green-shaded lamp fall on the open page of my book i assure you i be decidedly a autocratic person my retainer must distinctly keep they place i have my court favorite upon whom i lavish the richest gift of my attention i reserve for they a special place in the worn case nearest my person where at the mere outreaching of a idle hand i can summon they to beguile my mood the necessary slavy of literature i have arrange in indistinct row at the farther end of the room where they can be have if i require they special accomplishment \* \* \* \* \* how little after all learn count in this world either in book or in man i have often be awed by the wealth of information i have discover in a man or a book : i have be awed and depressed how wonderful i have think that one brain should hold so much should be so infallible in a world of fallibility but i have observe how soon and completely such a fount of information dissipate itself have only thing to give it come finally to the end of its thing : it be empty what it have hive up so painfully through many a studious year come now to be common property we pass that way take we share and do not even say thank you learn be like money it be of prodigious satisfaction to the possessor thereof but once give forth it diffuse itself swiftly what have you we be ever ask of those we meet information learn money we take it cruelly and pass onward for such be the law of material possession what have you we ask charm personality character the great gift of unexpectedness how we draw you to we we take you in poor or ignorant though you may be we link arm and loiter we love you not for what you have or what you give we but for what you be i have several good friend -lrb- excellent people -rrb- who act always as i expect they to act there be no flight more than once i have listen to the edifying conversation of a certain sturdy old gentleman whom i know and i be ashamed to say that i have think : lord if he would jump up now and turn a intellectual handspring or slap I on the back -lrb- figuratively of course : the other would be unthinkable -rrb- or -- yes swear i -- think i could love he but he never do -- and i be afraid he never will when i speak then of my book you will know what i mean the chief charm of literature old or new lie in its high quality of surprise unexpectedness spontaneity : high spirit apply to life we can fairly hear some of the old chap you and i know laugh down through the century how we love 'em they laugh for themselves not for we yes there must be surprise in the book that i keep in the worn case at my elbow the surprise of a new personality perceive for the first time the beauty the wonder the humor the tragedy the greatness of truth it do not matter at all whether the writer be a poet a scientist a traveller a essayist or a mere daily space-maker if he have the god-given grace of wonder what on _ earth _ be you laugh about cry harriet from the sitting-room when i have catch my breath i say hold up my book : this absurd man here be tell of the adventure of a certain chivalrous knight but i can not see how you can laugh out like that sit all alone there why it be uncanny you do not know the knight harriet nor he squire sancho you talk of they just as though they be real person real i exclaim real why they be much more real than most of the people we know horace be a mere wraith compare with sancho and then i rush out let I read you this i say and i read that matchless chapter wherein the knight have clap on he head the helmet which sancho have inadvertently use as a receptacle for a dinner of curd and sweating whey profusely go forth to fight two fierce lion as i proceed with that prodigious story i can see harriet gradually forget she sewing and i read on the more furiously until come to the point of the conflict wherein the generous and gentle lion have yawn throw out some half yard of tongue wherewith he lick and wash he face harriet begin to laugh there i say triumphantly harriet look at I accusingly such foolishness she say why should any man in he sens try to fight caged lion harriet i say you be incorrigible she do not deign to reply so i return with meekness to my room \* \* \* \* \* the most distressing thing about the ordinary fact writer be he cock-sureness why here be a man -lrb- i have not yet drop he out of the window -rrb- who have write a large and sober book explain life and do you know when he get through he be apparently much discourage about this universe this be the veritable moment when i be in love with my occupation as a despot at this moment i will exercise the prerogative of tyranny : off with he head i do not believe this person though he have ever so many title to jingle after he name nor in the college which give they if they stand sponsor for that which he write i do not believe he have compass this universe i believe he to be a inconsequent be like myself -- oh much more learn of course -- and yet only upon the threshold of these wonder it go too deep -- life -- to be solve by fifty year of live there be far too much in the blue firmament too many star to be dissolve in the feeble logic of a single brain we be not yet great enough even this explanatory person to grasp the scheme of thing entire this be no place for weak pessimism -- this universe this be mystery and out of mystery spring the fine adventure what we have see or feel what we think we know be insignificant compare with that which may be know what this person explain be not after all the universe -- but himself he own limited faithless personality i shall not accept he explanation i escape he utterly not long ago come in from my field i fall to thinking of the supreme wonder of a tree and as i walk i meet the professor how i ask do the sap get up to the top of these great maple and elm what power be there that should draw it upward against the force of gravity he look at I a moment with he peculiar slow smile i do not know he say what i exclaimed do you mean to tell I that science have not solve this simplest of natural phenomenon we do not know he say we explain but we do not know no my explanatory friend we do not know -- we do not know the why of the flower or the tree or the sun we do not even know why in we own heart we should be ask this curious question -- and other deeper question \* \* \* \* \* no man become a great writer unless he possess a highly develop sense of mystery of wonder a great writer be never _ blasé _ everything to he happen not longer ago than this forenoon the other night the professor and the scotch preacher happen in here together and we fall to discuss i hardly know how for we usually talk the neighborhood chat of the starkweather of horace and of charle baxter we fall to discuss old izaak walton -- and the nonsense -lrb- as a scientific age know it to be -rrb- which he sometimes talk with such delightful sobriety how superior it make one feel in behalf of the enlightenment and progress of he age say the professor when he read izaak 's extraordinary natural history do it make you feel that way ask the scotch preacher it make I want to go fishing and he take the old book and turn the leaf until he come to page 54 let I read you he say what the old fellow say about the ` fearfulest of fish ' ' get secretly behind a tree and stand as free from motion as possible then put a grasshopper on you hook and let you hook hang a quarter of a yard short of the water to which end you must rest you rod on some bough of a tree but it be likely that the chub will sink down towards the bottom of the water at the first shadow of you rod for a chub be the fearfulest of fish and will do so if but a bird fly over he and make the least shadow on the water but they will presently rise up to the top again and there lie soar until some shadow affright they again i say when they lie upon the top of the water look at the best chub which you get yourself in a fit place may very easily see and move you rod as slowly as a snail move to that chub you intend to catch let you bait fall gently upon the water three or four inch before he and he will infallibly take the bait and you will be as sure to catch he go you way presently take my rod and do as i bid you and i will sit down and mend my tackle till you return back -- ' now i say say the scotch preacher that it make I want to go fishing that i say be true of every great book : it either make we want to do thing to go fishing or fight harder or endure more patiently -- or it take we out of ourselves and beguile we for a time with the friendship of completer life than we own the great book indeed have in they the burning fire of life nay they do preserve as in a violl the purest efficacie and extraction of that living intellect that breed they i know they be as lively and as vigorously productive as those fabulous dragon 's tooth which be sow up and down may chance to spring up armed man how soon we come to distinguish the book of the mere writer from the book of real man for true literature like happiness be ever a by-product it be the half-conscious expression of a man greatly engage in some other undertake it be the song of one work there be something inevitable unrestrainable about the great book they seem to come despite the author i could not sleep say the poet horace for the pressure of unwritten poetry dante say of he book that they make he lean for many day i have hear people say of a writer in explanation of he success : oh well he have the literary knack it be not so nothing be further from the truth he write well not chiefly because he be interested in write or because he possess any especial knack but because he be more profoundly vividly interested in the activity of life and he tell about they -- over he shoulder for write like farming be ever a tool not a end how the great one-book man remain with we i can see marcus aurelius sit in he camp among the far barbarian write out the reflection of a busy life i see william penn engage in great undertaking set down some of the fruit of solitude and abraham lincoln striking in the hasty paragraph write for he speech one of the highest note in we american literature \* \* \* \* \* david yes harriet i be go up now it be very late yes you will bank the fire and see that the door be lock yes after a pause : and david i do not mean -- about the story you read do the knight finally kill the lion no i say with sobriety it be not finally necessary but i think he set out to kill they he do but he prove he valor without do it harriet pause make as if to speak again but do not do so valor -- i begin in my hortatory tone see a fair opening but at the look in she eye i immediately desist you will not stay up late she warn n-o i say take john bunyan as a pattern of the man who forget himself into immortality how seriously he write sermon and pamphlet now happily forget but it be not until he be shut up in jail -lrb- some writer i know might profit by he example -rrb- that he put aside as he say a more serious and important work and write pilgrim 's progress it be the strangest thing in the world -- the judgment of man as to what be important and serious bunyan say in he rhymed introduction : i only think to make i know not what : nor do i undertake thereby to please my neighbor no not i : i do it my own self to gratify another man i love to have at hand be he who write of blaze bosville the flaming tinman and of the hairy one how borrow escape through he book he object be not to produce literature but to display he erudition as a master of language and of outlandish custom and he go about the task in all seriousness of demolish the roman catholic church we be not now so impressed with he erudition that we do not smile at he vanity and we be quite contented even after read he book to let the church survive but how shall we spare we friend with he inextinguishable love of life he pugilist he gypsy he horse trader we be even willing to plow through arid desert of dissertation in order that we may enjoy the perfect oasis in which the man forget himself read such book as these and a hundred other the book of the worn case at my elbow the bulge and the bruised octavo the dear and the dumpy twelve -- i become like those initiate in the eleusinian mystery who as cicero tell we have attain the art of live joyfully and of die with a fairer hope \* \* \* \* \* it be late and the house be still a few bright ember glow in the fireplace you look up and around you as though come back to the world from some far-off place the clock in the dining-room tick with solemn precision you do not recall that it have so loud a tone it have be a great evening in this quiet room on you farm you have be able to entertain the worthy of all the past you walk out resoundingly to the kitchen and open the door you look across the still white field you barn loom black in the near distance the white mound close at hand be you wood-pile the great tree stand like sentinel in the moonlight snow have drift upon the doorstep and lie there untrack it be indeed a dim and untracked world : coldly beautiful but silent -- and of a strange unreality you close the door with half a shiver and take the real world with you up to bed for it be past one o'clock -lrb- illustration : the beauty the wonder the humor the tragedy the greatness of truth -rrb- xiii the politician in the city as i now recall it -lrb- have escape -rrb- it seem to be the instinctive purpose of every citizen i know not to get into politics but to keep out we sedulously avoid caucus and school-meeting we time be far too precious to be squander in jury service we forget to register for election we neglect to vote we observe a sort of aristocratic contempt for political activity and then fret and fume over the low estate to which we government have fall -- and never see the humor of it all at one time i experience a sort of political awakening : a boss we have be more than ordinarily piratical i think he have a scheme to steal the city hall and sell the monument in the park -lrb- something of that sort -rrb- and i for one be disturb for a time i really want to bear a man 's part in help to correct the abuse only i do not know how and could not find out in the city when one would learn anything about public matter he turn not to life but to book or newspaper what we get in the city be not life but what someone else tell we about life so i acquire a really formidable row of work on political economy and government -lrb- i admire the word work in that application -rrb- where i find society lay out for I in the most perfect order -- with penny on its eye how often look back i see myself as in those day read my learn book with a sort of fury of interest -- from the reading of book i acquire a sham comfort dwelling upon the excellent theory of we institution i be content to disregard the reality of daily practice i acquire a mock assurance under which i proceed complacently to the poll and cast my vote without know a single man on the ticket what he stand for or what he really intend to do the ceremony of the ballot bear to politics much the relationship that the sacrament bear to religion : how often observe the formality we yet depart wholly from the spirit of the institution it be good to escape that place of hurry stranger it be good to get one 's foot down into the soil it be good to be in a place where thing _ be _ because they _ grow _ and politics not less than corn oh my friend say what you please argue how you like this crowd together of man and woman in unnatural surroundings this haste to be rich in material thing this attempt to enjoy without production this removal from first-hand life be irrational and the end of it be ruin if we city be not recruit constantly with the fresh clean blood of the country with boy who still retain some of the power and the vision draw from the soil where would they be we be a great people say charle baxter but we do not always work at it but we talk about it say the scotch preacher by the way say charle baxter have you see george warren he be up for supervisor i have not yet well go around and see he we must find out exactly what he intend to do with the summit hill road if he be weak on that we would better look to matt devine at least matt be safe the scotch preacher look at charle baxter and say to I with a note of admiration in he voice : be not this man baxter get to be intolerable as a political boss \* \* \* \* \* baxter 's shop baxter 's shop stand close to the road and just in the edge of a grassy old apple orchard it be a low unpainted building with generous double door in front standing irresistibly open as you go by even as a stranger come here first from the city i feel the call of baxter 's shop shall i ever forget it be a still morning -- one of those day of warm sunshine -- and perfect quiet in the country -- and bird in the branch -- and apple tree all in bloom baxter whistle at he work in the sunlit doorway of he shop in he long fade apron much worn at the knee he be bend to the rhythmic movement of he plane and all around he as he work rise billow of shaving and oh the odour of that shop the fragrant resinous odour of new-cut pine the pungent smell of black walnut the dull odour of oak wood -- how they steal out in the sunshine waylay you as you come far up the road beguiling you as you pass the shop and steal reproachfully after you as you go onward down the road never shall i forget that grateful moment when i first pass baxter 's shop -- a failure from the city -- and baxter look out at I from he deep quiet gray eye -- eye that be almost a caress my wayward foot soon take I unintroduced within the door of that shop the first of many visit and i can say no more in appreciation of my venture there than that i come out always with more than i have when i go in the wonder there the long bench with its huge-jawed wooden vise and the little dusty window above look out into the orchard and the brown plane and the row of shiny saw and the most wonderful pattern square and triangle and curve each hanging on its own peg and above in the rafter every sort and size of curious wood and oh the old bureau and whatnot and high-boy in the corner wait they turn to be mend and the sticky glue-pot wait too on the end of the sawhorse there be family history here in this shop -- no end of it -- the small and yet great -lrb- because intensely human -rrb- tragedy and humor of the long quiet year among these sunny hill that whatnot there the one of black walnut with the top knock off that belong in the old day to -- charle baxter call my friend patterson from the roadway can you fix my cupboard bring it in say charle baxter hospitably and patterson bring it in and stop to talk -- and stop -- and stop -- there be great talk in baxter 's shop -- the slow-gathered wisdom of the country the lore of crop and calf and cabinet in baxter 's shop we choose the next president of these unite state you laugh but we do -- exactly that it be in the baxter ' shop -lrb- not in broadway not in state street -rrb- where the president be decide upon in the little grocery store you and i know in the blacksmithy in the schoolhouse back in the country \* \* \* \* \* forgive I i do not intend to wander away i mean to keep to my subject -- but the moment i begin to talk of politics in the country i be beset by a compelling vision of charle baxter come out of he shop in the dusk of the evening carry he curious old reflector lamp and lead the way down the road to the schoolhouse and thinking of the lamp bring a vision of the joy of baxter 's shop and thinking of the shop bring I naturally around to politics and president and here i be again where i start baxter 's lamp be somehow inextricably associate in my mind with politics be busy farmer we hold we caucus and other meeting in the evening and usually in the schoolhouse the schoolhouse be conveniently near to baxter 's shop so we gather at baxter 's shop baxter take he lamp down from the bracket above he bench reflector and all and you will see we a row of dusky figure baxter in the lead proceed down the roadway to the schoolhouse have arrive some one scratch a match shield it with he hand -lrb- i see yet the sudden fitful illumination of the brown-bearded watchful face of my neighbor -rrb- and baxter guide we into the schoolhouse -- with its shut-in dusty odour of chalk and varnished desk and -- yes leftover lunch baxter 's lamp stand on the table cast a vast shadow of the chairman on the wall come to order say the chairman and we have here at this moment in operation the greatest institution in this round world : the institution of free self-government great in its simplicity great in its unselfishness and baxter 's old lamp with its smoky tin reflector be not that the veritable torch of we liberty this i forget to say though it make no special difference -- a caucus would be the same -- be a school meeting you see ours be a prolific community when a young man and a young woman be marry they think about baby they want baby and what be more they have they and love they afterward it be a part of the complete life and have baby there must be a place to teach they to live without more explanation you will understand that we need a addition to we schoolhouse a committee report that the amount require would be $ 800 we talk it over the scotch preacher be there with a plan which he tack up on the blackboard and explain to we he tell we of see the stone-mason and the carpenter he tell we what the seat would cost and the door knob and the hook in the closet we be a careful people we want to know where every penny go if we put it all in the budget this year what will that make the rate inquire a voice from the end of the room we do not look around we know the voice and when the secretary have compute the rate if you listen closely you can almost hear the buzz of multiplication and addition which be go on in each man 's head as he calculate exactly how much the addition will mean to he in tax on he farm he daughter 's piano he wife 's top-buggy and many a man be say to himself : if we build this addition to the schoolhouse i shall have to give up the new overcoat i have count upon or amanda will not be able to get the new cooking-range that be _ real _ politics : the voluntary surrender of some private good for the upbuilding of some community good it be in such exercise that the fiber of democracy grow sound and strong there be after all in this world no real good for which we do not have to surrender something in the city the average voter be never conscious of any surrender he never realize that he be give anything himself for good school or good street under such condition how can you expect self-government no service no reward the first meeting that i sit through watch those bronze farmer at work give I such a conception of the true meaning of self-government as i never hope to have this be the place where i belong i say to myself it be wonderful in that school meeting to see how every essential element of we government be bring into play finance we discuss whether we should put the entire $ 800 into the next year 's budget or divide it pay part in cash and bonding the district for the remainder the question of credit of interest of the obligation of this generation and the next be all discuss at one time long ago i be amaze when i hear my neighbor argue in baxter 's shop about the issuance of certain bond by the united state government : how completely they understand it i know now where they get that understand right in the school meeting and town caucus where they raise money yearly for the expense of we small government there be nothing like it in the city the progress of a people can best be judge by those thing which they accept as matters-of-fact it be amazing to I come from the city and before i understand to see how ingrain have become some of the principle which only a few year ago be fiercely-mooted problem it give I a new pride in my country a new appreciation of the step in civilisation which we have already permanently gain not a question have i ever hear in any school meeting of the necessity of educate every american child -- at any cost think of it think how far we have come in that respect in seventy -- yes fifty -- year universal education have become a settle axiom of we life and there be another point -- so common now that we do not appreciate the significance of it i refer to majority rule in we school meeting we be vote money out of man 's pocket -- money that we all need for private expense -- and yet the moment the minority after full and honest discussion fail to maintain its contention in opposition to the new building it yield with perfect good humor and go on with the discussion of other question when you come to think of it in the light of history be not that a wonderful thing one of the chief property owner in we neighborhood be a rather crabbed old bachelor have no child and heavy tax to pay he look with jaundiced eye on addition to schoolhouse he will object and growl and growl and object and yet pin he down as i have see the scotch preacher pin he more than once he will admit that child -lrb- of course he will say certainly of course -rrb- must be educate for the good of bachelor as well as other people the scotch preacher will press it home certainly of course and when the final issue come after full discussion after he have try to lop off a few yard of blackboard or order cheaper desk or dispense with the clothes-closet he vote for the addition with the rest of we it be simply amazing to see how much grow out of these discussion -- how much of that social sympathy and understanding which be the very tap-root of democracy it be cheaper to put up a miserable shack of a addition why not do it so we discuss architecture -- blindly it be true we do not know the book on the subject -- but we grope for the big true thing and by we own discussion we educate ourselves to know why a good building be better than a bad one heating and ventilation in they relation to health the use of fad study -- how i have hear those thing discuss how dr north who have now leave we forever shone in those meeting and charle baxter and the scotch preacher -- broad man every one -- how they have explain and argue with what patience have they bring into that small schoolhouse light by charle baxter 's lamp the grandest conception of human society -- not in the big word of the book but in the simple concrete language of we common life why teach physiology what a talk dr north once give we on that why pay a teacher $ 40 a month when one can be have for $ 30 you should have hear the scotch preacher answer that question many a one of we go away with some of the education which we have come somewhat grudgingly to buy for we child these be we political boss : these unknown patriot who preach the invisible patriotism which express itself not in flag and oratory but in the quiet daily surrender of private advantage to the public good there be after all no such thing as perfect equality there must be leader flag-bearer boss -- whatever you call they some man have a genius for lead other for follow each be necessary and dependent upon the other in city that leadership be often perverted and use to evil end neither leader nor follower seem to understand in its essence politics be merely a mode of express human sympathy in the country many and many a leader like baxter work faithfully year in and year out post notice of caucus school meeting and election open cold schoolhouse talk to candidate prod selfish voter -- and mostly without reward occasionally they be elect to petty office where they do far more work than they be pay for -lrb- we have we eye on 'em -rrb- often they be reward by the power and place which leadership give they among they neighbor and sometimes -- and that be charles baxter 's case -- they simply like it baxter be of the social temperament : it be the natural expression of he personality as for thinking of himself as a patriot he would never dream of it work with the hand close touch with the common life of the soil have give he much of the true wisdom of experience he know we and we know he he carry the banner hold it as high as he know how and we follow whether there can be a real democracy -lrb- as in a city -rrb- where there be not that elbow knowledge that close neighborhood sympathy that conscious surrender of little personal goods for bigger public one i do not know we have not many foreigner in we district but all three be there on the night we vote for the addition they be polish each have a farm where the whole family work -- and put on a little more americanism each year they be good people it be surprising how much all these pole italian german and other be like we how perfectly human they be when we know they personally one pole here name kausky i have come to know pretty well and i declare i have forget that he _ be _ a pole there be nothing like the rub of democracy the reason why we be so suspicious of the foreigner in we city be that they be crowd together in such vast unknown undigested mass we have swallow they too fast and we suffer from a sort of national dyspepsia here in the country we promptly digest we foreigner and they make as good american as anybody catch a foreigner when he first come here say charle baxter and he take to we politics like a fish to water the scotch preacher say they gape for education and when i see kausky 's six child go by in the morning to school all they round sleepy fat face shine with soap i believe it baxter tell with humor how he persuade kausky to vote for the addition to the schoolhouse it be a pretty stiff tax for the poor fellow to pay but baxter figgered child with he as he say with six to educate baxter show he that he be actually get a good deal more than he pay for be it far from I to pretend that we be always right or that we have arrive in we country at the perfection of self-government i do not wish to imply that all of we people be interested that all attend the caucus and school-meeting -lrb- some of the most prominent never come near -- they stay away and if thing do not go right they blame charle baxter -rrb- nor must i over-emphasise the seriousness of we public interest but we certainly have here if anywhere in this nation real self-government growth be a slow process we often fail in we election of delegate to state convention we sometimes vote wrong in national affair it be a easy thing to think school district difficult indeed to think state or nation but we grow when we make mistake it be not because we be evil but because we do not know once we get a clear understanding of the right or wrong of any question you can depend upon we -- absolutely -- to vote for what be right with more education we shall be able to think in larger and larger circle -- until we become finally really national in we interest and sympathy whenever a man come along who know how simple we be and how much we really want to do right if we can be convince that a thing _ be _ right -- who explain how the railroad question for example affect we in we intimate daily life what the rights and wrong of it be why we can understand and do understand -- and we be ready to act it be easy to rally to a flag in time of excitement the patriotism of drum and march regiment be cheap blood be material and cheap physical weariness and hunger be cheap but the struggle i speak of be not cheap it be dramatise by few symbol it deal with hidden spiritual quality within the conscience of man its hero be yet unsung and unhonoured no combat in all the world 's history be ever fight so high upward in the spiritual air as these and surely not for nothing and so out of my experience both in city and country i feel -- yes i _ know _ -- that the real motive power of this democracy lie back in the little country neighborhood like ours where man gather in dim schoolhouse and practice the invisible patriotism of surrender and service xiv the harvest oh universe what thou wishest i wish -- _ marcus aurelius _ i come to the end of these adventure with a regret i can scarcely express i at least have enjoy they i begin set they down with no thought of publication but for my own enjoyment the possibility of a book do not suggest itself until afterwards i have try to relate the experience of that secret elusive invisible life which in every man be so far more real so far more important than he visible activity -- the real expression of a life much occupy in other employment when i first come to this farm i come empty-handed i be the veritable pattern of the city-made failure i believe that life have nothing more in store for I i be wear out physically mentally and indeed morally i have diligently plan for success and i have reap defeat i come here without plan i plow and harrow and plant expect nothing in due time i begin to reap and it have be a grow marvel to I the diverse and unexpected crop that i have produce within these uneven acre of earth with sweat i plant corn and i have here a crop not only of corn but of happiness and hope my till field have miraculously spring up to friend this book be one of the unexpected product of my farm it be this way with the farmer after the work of plant and cultivate after the rain have fall in he field after the sun have warm they after the new green leaf have break the earth -- one day he stand look out with a certain new joy across he acre -lrb- the wind bend and half turn the long blade of the corn -rrb- and there spring up within he a song of the field no matter how little poetic how little articulate he be the song rise irrepressibly in he heart and he turn aside from he task with a new glow of fulfillment and contentment at harvest time in we country i hear or i imagine i hear a sort of chorus rise over all the hill and i meet no man who be not deep down within he a singer so song follow work : so art grow out of life and the friend i have make they have come to I naturally as the corn grow in my field or the wind blow in my tree some strange potency abide within the soil of this earth when two man stoop -lrb- there must be stoop -rrb- and touch it together a magnetic current be set up between they : a flow of common understanding and confidence i would call the attention of all great scientist philosopher and theologian to this phenomenon : it will repay investigation it be at once the rarest and the commonest thing i know it show that down deep within we where we really live we be all a good deal alike we have much the same instinct hope joy sorrow if only it be not for the outward thing that we commonly look upon as important -lrb- which be in reality not at all important -rrb- we might come together without fear vanity envy or prejudice and be friend and what a world it would be if civilisation mean anything at all it mean the increase ability of man to look through material possession through clothing through difference of speech and color of skin and to see the genuine man that abide within each of we it mean a escape from symbol i tell this merely to show what surprising and unexpected thing have grow out of my farm all along i have have more than i bargain for from now on i shall marvel at nothing when i order my own life i fail now that i work from day to day do that which i can do best and which most delight I i be reward in way that i could not have imagine why it would not surprise I if heaven be at the end of all this now i be not so foolish as to imagine that a farm be a perfect place in these adventure i have emphasise perhaps too forcibly the joyful and pleasant feature of my life in what i have write i have naturally choose only those thing which be most interesting and charming my life have not be without discouragement and loss and loneliness -lrb- loneliness most of all -rrb- i have enjoy the hard work the little trouble have trouble I more than the big one i detest unharness a muddy horse in the rain i do not like chicken in the barn and somehow harriet use a inordinate amount of kindling wood but once in the habit unpleasant thing have a way of fading quickly and quietly from the memory and you see after live so many year in the city the worst experience on the farm be a sort of joy in most man as i come to know they -- i mean man who dare to look themselves in the eye -- i find a deep desire for more naturalness more directness how weary we all grow of this fabric of deception which be call modern life how passionately we desire to escape but can not see the way how we heart beat with sympathy when we find a man who have turn he back upon it all and who say i will live it no longer how we flounder in possession as in a dark and suffocating bog waste we energy not upon life but upon _ thing _ instead of employ we house we city we gold we clothing we let these inanimate thing possess and employ we -- to what utter weariness bless be nothing sigh a dear old lady of my knowledge of all way of escape i know the best though it be far from perfection be the farm there a man may yield himself most nearly to the quiet and orderly process of nature he may attain most nearly to that equilibrium between the material and spiritual with time for the exaction of the first and leisure for the growth of the second which be the ideal of life in time past most farm region in this country have suffer the disadvantage of isolation the people have dwell far distant from one another and from market they have have little to stimulate they intellectually or socially strong and peculiar individual and family be often develop at the expense of a friendly community life : neighborhood feud be common country life be mark with the rigidity of a hard provincialism all this however be rapidly change the closer settlement of the land the rural delivery of mail -lrb- the morning newspaper reach the tin box at the end of my lane at noon -rrb- the farmer 's telephone the spread country trolley more school and church and cheaper railroad rate have all help to bring the farmer 's life well within the stimulate current of world think without rob it of its ancient advantage and those advantage be incalculable : time first for thought and reflection -lrb- narrow stream cut deep -rrb- lead to the growth of a sturdy freedom of action -- which be indeed a natural characteristic of the man who have he foot firmly plant upon he own land a city hammer and polish its denizen into a define model : it worship standardisation but the country encourage differentiation it love new type thus it be that so many great and original man have live they youth upon the land it would be impossible to imagine abraham lincoln bring up in a street of tenement family life on the farm be highly educative there be more discipline for a boy in the continuous care of a cow or a horse than in many a term of school industry patience perseverance be quality inherent in the very atmosphere of country life the so-called manual training of city school be only a poor makeshift for develop in the city boy those habit which the country boy acquire naturally in he daily life a honest hard-working country training be the best inheritance a father can leave he son and yet a farm be only a opportunity a tool a cornfield a plow a woodpile a oak tree will cure no man unless he have it in himself to be cure the truth be that no life and least of all a farmer 's life be simple -- unless it be simple i know a man and he wife who come out here to the country with the avowed purpose of become forthwith simple they be unable to keep the chicken out of they summer kitchen they discover microbe in the well and mosquito in the cistern and wasp in the garret owe to the resemblance of the seed they radish turn out to be turnip the last i hear of they they be live snugly in a flat in sixteenth street -- all they trouble solve by a dumb-waiter the great point of advantage in the life of the country be that if a man be in reality simple if he love true contentment it be the place of all place where he can live he life most freely and fully where he can _ grow _ the city afford no such opportunity indeed it often destroy by the seductiveness with which it flaunt its carnal grace the desire for the higher life which animate every good man while on the subject of simplicity it may be well to observe that simplicity do not necessarily as some of those who escape from the city seem to think consist in do without thing but rather in the proper use of thing one can not return unless with affectation to the crudity of a former existence we do not believe in diogene and he tub do you not think the good lord have give we the telephone -lrb- that we may better reach that elbow-rub of brotherhood which be the highest of human ideal -rrb- and the railroad -lrb- that we may widen we human knowledge and sympathy -rrb- -- and even the motor-car -lrb- though indeed i have sometimes imagine that the motor-car pass this way have a different origin -rrb- he may have give these thing to we too fast faster than we can bear but be that any reason why we should denounce they all and return to the old crude time-consuming way of we ancestor i be no reactionary i do not go back i neglect no tool of progress i be too eager to know every wonder in this universe the motor-car if i have one could not carry I fast enough i must yet fly after my experience in the country if i be to be cross-examine as to the requisite of a farm i should say that the chief thing to be desire in any sort of agriculture be good health in the farmer what after all can touch that how many of we joy that we think intellectual be purely physical this joy of the morning that the poet carol about so cheerfully be often nothing more than the exuberance produce by a good hot breakfast go out of my kitchen door some morning and stand for a moment while i survey the green and spread field of my farm it seem to I truly as if all nature be make a bow to I it seem to I that there never be a better cow than mine never a more really perfect horse and as for pig could any in this world herald my approach with more cheerful grunting and squealing but there be other requisite for a farm it must not be too large else it will keep you away from you friend provide a town not too far off -lrb- and yet not too near -rrb- where you can buy you flour and sell you grain if there be a railroad convenient -lrb- though not so near that the whistling of the engine reach you -rrb- that be a add advantage demand a few good old oak tree or walnut or even elm will do no well-regulated farm should be without tree and have secure the oak -- buy you fuel of you neighbor thus you will be bless with beauty both summer and winter as for neighbor accept those nearest at hand you will find they surprisingly human like yourself if you like they you will be surprise to find how much they all like you -lrb- and will upon occasion lend you a spring-tooth harrow or a butter tub or help you with you plowing -rrb- but if you hate they they will return you hatred with interest i have discover that those who travel in pursuit of better neighbor never find they somewhere on every farm along with the other implement there should be a row of good book which should not be allow to rust with disuse : a book like a hoe grow brighter with employment and no farm even in this country where we enjoy the even balance of the season rain and shine shine and rain should be devoid of that irrigation from the current of the world 's thought which be so essential to the complete life from the papers which the postman put in the box flow the true water of civilisation you will find within they column how to be good or how to make pie : you will get out of they what you look for and finally down the road from you farm so that you can hear the bell on Sunday morning there should be a little church it will do you good even though like I you do not often attend it be a sort of ark of the covenant and when you get to it you will find therein the true spirit -- if you take it with you when you leave home of course you will look for good land and comfortable building when you buy you farm : they be indeed prime requisite i have put they last for the reason that they be so often first i have observe however that the joy of the farmer be by no means in proportion to the area of he arable land it be often a nice matter to decide between acre and contentment : man perish from too much as well as from too little and if it be possible there should be a long table in the dining-room and little chair around it and small bed upstairs and young voice call at they play in the field -- if it be possible sometimes i say to myself : i have grasp happiness here it be i have it and yet it always seem at that moment of complete fulfillment as though my hand tremble that i might not take it i wonder if you recall the story of christian and hopeful how standing on the hill clear -lrb- as we do sometimes -- at we best -rrb- they look for the gate of the celestial city -lrb- as we look -- how fondly -rrb- : then they essay to look but the remembrance of that last thing that the shepherd have show they make they hand shake by means of which impediment they could not look steadily through the glass : yet they think they see something like the gate and also some of the glory of the place how often i have think that i see some of the glory of the place -lrb- look from the hill clear -rrb- and how often lift the glass my hand have tremble end of
