and believe there be comparatively few people who will deny that athletics have do much for the health and mind of the modern girl exercise in some form or other be essential and although i be quite ready to admit that game of the strenuous type such as hockey and lawn tennis can be and sometimes be overdo yet the girl of to-day who enter into and enjoy she game with scarcely less zest than she brother be i be convinced better in health and happier in herself than the girl of the past generation what be the objection to game for girl it seem to I the chief argument against they be -lrb- 1 -rrb- that they be injurious to health -lrb- 2 -rrb- that they impair the womanliness of woman -lrb- 3 -rrb- that they mar she appearance there may be something to be say for these contention but to my mind the _ pro _ materially outweigh the _ con _ as to the injury to health i deny that the case be prove indeed evidence be rarely forthcoming a delicate girl would probably become more delicate if she do not play game in moderation and take exercise a friend of mine a old doctor tell I the other day that in he youth the great plague of he life be the hysterical female she would put in a appearance obtrusively at critical moment and the anticipation of a scene always shadow he arrangement we rarely see this type now game have drive she away the woman of the present generation be calm collect and free from emotional outburst and i believe that invigorating outdoor exercise be the chief cause as to the second objection the injury to the womanliness of woman the answer depend on what be mean by the essential feature of womanliness i be afraid most people include most man say with hamlet frailty thy name be woman womanliness to most man imply just frailty they may perhaps call it delicacy and refer to the weaker sex but they mean that just as a man 's glory be he strength so a woman 's glory be she weakness they argue that you must impair this weakness by strenuous game be this true be the essential feature of a woman she weakness just as the essential feature of a man be he strength not merely physical but mental and moral strength i do not think so woman be a second edition of man if you will therefore like most second edition a improvement on the first as lessing put it nature mean to make woman its masterpiece i well remember reading in a stir narrative of the indian mutiny how a small party of english man and woman be besiege in they quarter by a body of rebel and while the man fight at the window and door the woman be busy prepare ammunition loading gun bandage wound and zealously cheer they war-worn defender when victory be at length achieve the man ask themselves what would have happen but for the woman that to my mind be a picture of true womanliness inferior in neither moral strength nor brain-power the true woman be a helpmeet or man 's complement give he just the special form of strength in body and soul that he need for the special experience if this then be womanliness can athletic game injure it do they spoil woman 's usefulness as a woman do they damage she specific excellence do they tend to give she less endurance and nerve at critical time i do not think so certainly lawn tennis do not it be undoubtedly a strenuous game there be more energy of physical frame more brain-tax and will-discipline demand in one hardly contest match than would suffice for a whole day 's devotion to many other game these requirement must help a woman and in the possession of the quality that game bestow athletic girl have a great pull over they sister if you be skilled and well drill in discipline and sportsmanship you be bind to benefit in the strife of the world you be the better able to face disappointment and sorrow for what do these strenuous game mean exercise in the open air and exercise of a thorough and engrossing character carry out with cheerful and stimulating surroundings with scientific method rational aim and absorb chance surely that be the foundation of health culture the truth be game have do for woman what the dervish 's subtle prescription do for the sick sultan you perhaps remember the story the sultan have very bad health from over-feeding sedentary habit and luxurious ease consult the clever dervish the dervish know that it would be useless to recommend the sultan simply to take exercise he therefore say to he here be a ball which i have stuff with certain rare and costly medicinal herb and here be a bat the handle of which i have also stuff with similar herb you highness must take this bat and with it beat about this ball until you perspire freely you must do this every day he highness acquiesce and in a short time the exercise of play bat and ball with the dervish greatly improve he health and by degree cure he of he ailment now the tennis ball to my mind be stuff with medicinal herb which impart vigor and health to the player the racket be possess with a magic handle that have the power of quicken all the pulse of life in the plenitude of healthy vigor and wholesome excitement in a medical book now before I the subject be put tersely thus : health and strength depend on rapid disorganisation and rapid disorganisation depend on rapid exertion now if this be true what better and more interesting method of rapid exertion could be devise than a game of lawn tennis body and mind alike be wholly absorb with the utmost rapidity and there be no doubt the sense of refreshment be largely due to the rapid exertion demand for the proper playing of the game the medical book go on to say during exertion we drink as it be oxygen from the air this oxygen be the only stimulating drink we can take with lasting advantage to ourselves for the purpose of invigorating we strength it be the wine and spirit of life a abundance of which nature have supply we with ready-made if you be low-spirited drink oxygen take active exercise in the open air and inhale it when next you see a lawn tennis player hard at a strenuous game remember he or she be not necessarily overstrain or injure health but take long deep draught of oxygen imbibe the wine and spirit of life and lay up a store of vigor in readiness for the varied experience of life of all game lawn tennis be the one most suit to girl its claim be many and potent it be strenuous and very hard work but if not overdo it be not too tax for the average girl the exercise depend naturally upon the nature of the game play and the player engage from the championship to the garden-party patball game the greater the knowledge of the game the greater the enjoyment and benefit derive from it and there be really no reason why a girl should not excel at the game and therefore thoroughly appreciate and enjoy it it be not physical and brute strength that be want so much as scientific application -- finesse skill and delicacy of touch all of which woman be just as capable of exercise as man i be well aware that if you compare the lady champion of any year with any first-class man of the same year you will find a great disparity between they actual play that be to say the first-class man would be able to give the lady champion thirty or even more in order to have a close struggle i have often play mr rf doherty at the tremendous odds of receive half-forty and have not always be return the winner at that i wonder sometimes why there be this pronounced discrepancy garment may make a little difference but they do not account for it all i think perhaps that man 's stronger physique naturally greater activity and severer stroke prevent the girl from play she own game she have to be nearly always on the defensive and thus play with less accuracy and power another claim lawn tennis have for girl be that it be not a expensive game it be more or less within the reach of all rich or poor it can be play on one 's own lawn or at any of the numerous club situate all over the world or even nowadays in some of the public park the time require to play a game be not excessive the implement racket ball net etc be neither numerous nor prohibitive in price the club subscription be moderate and the actual expense of pursue the game be small as compare with golf -lrb- illustration : wimbledon 1905 : miss may sutton win the lady ' championship for the first time she beat miss douglass in the challenge round -rrb- then again lawn tennis be not difficult to learn although of course by this i do not mean that it be a easy game to play well -- far from it but a rudimentary idea of it suffice to give any one a good deal of healthy exercise and enjoyment and provide that one be keen and wish to improve and possess what be know as a good game ' eye there be no reason why advance should not be rapid it be also a pastime in which woman can combine with and compete against man without in any way spoil the game and mixed double to which i refer be perhaps the most popular department with the average spectator i think i be not wrong in say that there be no other game at the present time in which this combination of the sex do not tend to minimize the enjoyment of the player and the interest of the spectator a mixed foursome at golf be poor sort of fun for the man unless the lady be quite first-class the game be rather spoil for he mixed hockey be a abomination splendid sport absolutely spoil for both sex but a mixed double at lawn tennis seem like a distinct game so different be it to the other form of lawn tennis and so well adapt to the combination of both sex then it be assert that strenuous game mar the appearance of girl this charge be very deliberately bring against hockey for woman some little time ago in a influential london journal and be rightly and promptly answer by a spirited article with illustration of some well-known lady hockey player -- proof positive of the fallacy that hockey damage they appearance i be afraid most of these contortion be the product of the snapshot camera it must be remember that instantaneous photograph show player of game as they be really never see girl be doubtless in the ungraceful position represent for a fraction of a second but the time be too short for the eye to see although the camera worse luck catch the view and what be more register it for ever though a girl should always try to be as neat and look as nice as she possibly can even when play a strenuous game it be hardly possible or natural to be just so every second of a long struggle in fact i think it be more interesting to see a girl not absolutely immobile i prefer that she should show some sign of excitement that she muscle should be strain and she face set this have a very real pleasure of its own and i do not think it unsightly public speaking and singing may distort the mouth and disturb the facial muscle to a most ludicrous extent and give the eye quite a unnatural appearance but i have never yet hear it say that a man or woman should give up either because of its effect upon the appearance why then should woman abandon athletic exercise which they enjoy so much and which do they so much good merely because just for a moment or two perhaps they appearance be distorted chapter ii practice and how to improve player even tournament player often ask how they can improve i have be at the same stage so long what can i do to play a better game that be not infrequently the question now i think many who be very anxious to advance go to work in the wrong way to my mind the great point to remember when you be practise be not that the match must be win but that all you weak stroke must be improve we all know we special failure if not some kind friend will soon point they out to we tackle these doggedly in practice stroke naturally avoid in a match should be give as much experience as possible in a knock-up game it be the only way many player make the cardinal mistake of play day after day in the same way they starve all they weak stroke and overdo all they best one in fact they play in precisely the same manner as if the occasion be a important match if you do this you must always preserve those weak stroke they be not even give a chance to develop i once ask a girl whom i notice continually run round she back-hand in a practice game why she do this the characteristic answer come back : i can not take a back hand i should be hopelessly beat if i do not run round the ball but what do it matter if you be beat fifty time in a practice game if you be improve you stroke that girl 's back-hand could never improve she make absolutely no distinction between a practice game and a match in fact it be very little of a _ practice _ game to she how can you game improve or move forward if you make no effort to strengthen what be feeble practice then conscientiously and with infinite patience never mind who beat you take each weak stroke in turn and determine to master it and i think you will find that you will be amply reward for all you painstaking work by a vast improvement and keener enjoyment in you game what greater delight than to feel a stroke you have always dread become easier and less embarrassing each time you use it to know that you be genuinely advance instead of make no progress and play the same old bad shot time after time i be sure you will say such a sense of achievement be worth all the trouble which must be face and all the patience which must be exercise of course in match play it be quite different you avoid you weak stroke as much as you can you object then be to win the game but after discriminate practice you will find probably to you surprise that there be not so many weak spot after all to remove that you game be open out and steadily advance do not get easily dishearten if you find improvement slow for a game that be worth play at all be worth play well and to play lawn tennis well you must go through a stiff apprenticeship you must school yourself to meet disappointment and failure you must cultivate a philosophic spirit or you will never reach the goal of perfection i need not say that if you wish to go forward enthusiasm be essential lawn tennis player never seem to I to be nearly so keen on they game as golfer so many of they appear quite satisfied to remain at a fixed stage they will certainly not get they handicap reduce unless there be a ardent desire to become better acquaint with the science of the game a struggle golfer be never tire of learn talk about he pastime -- often i admit to the annoyance of people who be not so obsess nevertheless he be on the right track and be so thoroughly absorb and in earnest he ought to improve you will find he buy every new book that come out and pore over its page he may play in a few competition but he time be more seriously occupy with practice and improvement he wisely deprecate the continuous strain of match play he prefer to acquire a work knowledge of the game to make the various stroke with some degree of accuracy before he pit he skill against other i think this lack of adequate practice be one of the reason why there be such a dearth of rise talent among lawn tennis player some of the competitor one meet at tournament have be for year at exactly the same stage they never pause to take stock of they game they never advance or cultivate a new stroke they go from one tournament to another struggle to win by hook or by crook assist by a generous handicap they may win a prize and apparently they be satisfied let I say in regard to tournament that when you be take you stroke correctly and be really add to you knowledge of the game open competition be admirable and be essential if the highest honor be to be achieve but tournament can very easily be overdo especially by young player who have not complete what i may call stroke-education when you be practise remember to practice head-work as well as stroke cultivate think about the game never mind ask a experienced player for advice most people who play the game well be anxious that every one should improve they want they to get more enjoyment out of the game and they want the general standard of play to advance as a rule they never mind give a helpful hint do not hesitate therefore to ask for that help discuss the game with you friend and find out all you can about it read all the excellent book that have be write on the game from time to time i have often notice that beginner will willingly pay they entrance fee for open event at tournament when they know very well that nothing but a miracle will take they through the first round yet the same player grumble at the expense of purchase book deal with the game the book would most probably help they a great deal whereas the one solitary match do they no good it be over so quickly the difference in the class of play be so great that the beginner hardly hit the ball at all a good way of practise be to play up against a brick wall in my own case i find the method very useful it help one to keep the eye on the ball to time well and place with accuracy another good way of practise be not to score but to get some friend to hit or even throw the ball where you want it systematic stroke-play like this for half a hour a day finish up with a game which bring into play the stroke you have be develop be bind to improve you game i know of one champion of england who always practice in this way any new stroke that have to be master be pass through the mill and assiduously exercise until perfection come if no friend be available for the purpose the butler have to devote a hour a day to throw the ball in the give direction to come to the various stroke i do not mean to enter into these elaborately there be now so many good book in the market that deal exhaustively with this subject such as the complete lawn-tennis player by a walli myer that i shall not aim at cover old ground the first and foremost stroke to be learn be _ the fore-hand drive _ a good fore-hand be one of the chief asset of the game a good length must be one of the first thing to cultivate the ball must be send as near the base line as possible do not at first try to get a severe shot but practice get a good-length slow ball until you be very accurate at that you will find that pace and direction will come afterwards when make a fore-hand drive stand sideways to the net you left shoulder should face the net you left foot should be in front of you right wait as long as possible for the ball by this i mean do not rush in to it wait for it to come to you stand well away from it sideways and lengthway swing you racket slowly back to about the level of you shoulder then bring it slowly forward and simultaneously transfer you weight from you right foot to you leave this transference of weight let I add be most important and can only be achieve by careful practice if it be transfer too soon or too late the whole power of the stroke be lose -lrb- illustration : the fore-hand drive begin middle finish -rrb- the ball must be hit firmly and cleanly with the center of the racket feel as if you be literally sweeping it along -- you movement must be so perfectly time -- to the place you wish it to go not forget to follow well through with you arm and shoulder in a line with the flight of the ball great muscular strength be not need to play well _ time you stroke transfer you weight at the right moment and follow well through at the finish _ -- these be the chief secret of good and powerful stroke do not be content merely to watch the ball but keep you eye fix on it until the last possible moment follow it right on to the center of you racket until you have try this you can not realize how difficult it be or how greatly it will improve you stroke and it help to complete concentration which to my mind be one of the chief attribute of success _ the back-hand drive _ be take in the same way as the fore-hand only with you position reverse here too you must not face the net but stand sideways this time you right shoulder must face the net the position of you foot for a back-hand stroke be most important it be where so many beginner go wrong take a step towards the ball with you right foot in front of you left and with you weight at the start of the stroke on the ball of you left foot swing you racket well back with its head raise above you wrist and hit the ball firmly with the center of you racket be transfer you weight all the time from you left foot to you right and follow well through in the direction of the flight of the ball when play a back-hand across the court from corner to corner let you arm and shoulder on the follow through be extend as far as they will go and you body bring round to face the net -lrb- illustration : the back-hand drive begin middle finish -rrb- _ the lob _ be a most important and useful stroke and should be constantly practice it be by no mean a easy stroke to play really well and accurately it be generally a defensive shot and make you opponent move from the net unless she intend to be beat by it i be speaking of course of the singles game it be a useful stroke for give you breathing time if you be make to run about much or for enable you to get back into position if you have be force out of it it be nearly always best to lob to you opponent 's back-hand since the majority of player be weaker there there be three kind of lob : -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ the high lob _ send well out of reach of you opponent 's racket but with the disadvantage of take some time to reach the ground although it move you opponent out of she dangerous position right up at the net there be time for she to run back and return it -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ the low lob _ which only just pass over you opponent 's racket -- a much more risky shot than the high lob but with the advantage of fall much quicker if you succeed in get the ball out of she reach it be almost certain to be a win shot because she will not have time to turn and go after what be a very fast-dropping ball -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ the lob-volley _ be one of the prettiest stroke and a most effective one it be very difficult to accomplish with success there be always great risk of not get it out of you opponent 's reach and have it kill outright it be generally play with a under-hand stroke by hit the ball before it have reach the ground and lift it well over you opponent 's head it should be a high lob the racket must be grasp firmly and hold nearly horizontal for this stroke in play lob the racket must come well underneath the ball which should be strike very truly in the center of the racket _ the half volley _ -- this stroke have great possibility and be efficacious both in attack and defense although chiefly use for defense the ball must be hit immediately after it have bounce in fact within a few inch after its impact with the ground for attack it can easily be see how useful this stroke can become the time gain as compare to wait for the ground stroke be invaluable but it want a perfect eye to play it with any facility the majority of player do not watch the ball long enough lack of confidence be another reason why this stroke be not use more on the offensive _ a short drop shoot _ from the back of the court or in fact from any position in the court -lrb- but i think more effectively use from the back of the court -rrb- be a very pay stroke to have at you command it be difficult to be accurate with this shot and it need much patient practice yet it be one on which trouble may very profitably be expend for it often turn the tide at a critical moment i remember play one match where i use this stroke a great deal owe to its success -- my opponent never even attempt to reach it -- i win ace after ace at the end of the match my opponent indignantly upbraid I i can not admire you length she protest neither do she think it be fair to play sneak add anybody could win if they care to play like that in she opinion it be not tennis i be afraid i do not take this censure very seriously as the object of the game be to put the ball as far out of reach of you opponent as possible i could not see what difference there be between make she run from side to side of the base-line or to the net and back again both method as regard place be just as good tennis and should be use judiciously in turn but this sort of argument do not appeal to my opponent she still think any one could win who care to play that unsporting game perhaps the incident cause she to think a little and it may be she try the stroke in she next match if so i be quite sure she do not find it so easy to play accurately as she have imagine the danger of this stroke be that unless it be just in the right spot instead of give you a advantage it will be a very easy ball for you opponent to score off if it be short it will find the net if hit too far it become a bad-length ball and will get the punishment it deserve it be difficult to explain how this stroke should be play i think it be best to stand very close to the ball and get rather in front of it draw the racket across it from right to leave -- stroke the ball as it be rather than hit it it require a delicate touch and can be very deceptively play you opponent be keep in the dark until the last moment when the ace have probably be win _ the service _ -- i should as a rule advise a overhead service at the same time a underhand cut service be very useful as a change variety of stroke and tactic should always be encourage for a _ overhead service _ stand sideways to the net with you left foot just behind the base-line the left shoulder face the net and the right foot a little to the right of and behind the left throw the ball high up over you right ear bend you body well back and you right shoulder down raise the racket at the same time as you throw up the ball hit it with the center of you racket bring you body forward with all its weight on to the ball and transfer you weight from the right foot to the leave at the moment of impact bring you racket right through and finish a little to the left of you left knee at the time you throw the ball into the air the left shoulder must be face the net and as you racket hit the ball and follow through to you left knee you body should be bring round to face the net -lrb- illustration : beginning of service middle of service -rrb- do not at first attempt a fast service keep you ardor down until you have gain a mastery of the ball and can vary its direction place be always better than pace this apply generally speak to other stroke besides the service try to cultivate a second service which bear a likeness to the first that be to say if you have serve a fault -lrb- and the best player in the world can not be absolutely sure that they first delivery will not pitch just over the side-line or service-line or hit the top of the net -rrb- do not be contented with a soft and guileless second which have no length and which give you opponent a excellent chance of make a win drive most player be weaker on they backhand remember that fact and place you ball accordingly it be a good plan when serve from the right-hand court to aim for the spot where the center line bisect the service-line length and direction will both be good and in nine case out of ten you opponent will be require to move to make the return -- always a point in you favor remember that variety in service as in tactic and general play be essential however fast you service may be if its pace and place be stereotyped a good deal of its efficacy be lose since you adversary know what to expect where to stand and the kind of stroke suitable for return it be better to possess a variety of slow service if they have good length than to own one fast service which have no particular merit except speed and of course the faster the ball come off the racket the more liable be it to go astray another reason why you should temper zeal with discretion be that a vigorous service will tire you out like nothing else and in a long match stamen should be judiciously preserve you never know when a extra spurt may not be require to turn the scale in you favor i have often notice the difference in length and sting between the service of some player at the beginning of the match and in the third set and i be sure that one of the reason why so many match be ultimately lose after a promising start be the decline in the service in its sustained vigor and in its length by the way why do many lady player even those who compete at open tournament stand several foot behind the base-line when serve be they aware that the length of they service be probably just so many foot short of what it ought to be and that they voluntarily give themselves a extra journey to recover short return even if they reach they at all you will never find expert player who appreciate what i may call the geometry of the court penalize themselves in this manner yet the habit for some reason or other would appear to be on the increase _ low volley _ -- for these stroke the head of you racket should be above you wrist you elbow low down and you knee slightly bent you should in fact stoop so that you eye be level with the flight of the ball the late mr h mahony use to say that if girl would only bend down more to the ball they would be able to volley much better you should not swing back as far for a volley as for a ground stroke nor relax a firm grip of you racket remember to follow through to the place you wish the ball to go in overhead work it be most important to remember the oft-repeated maxim : keep you eye on the ball watch it up to the moment of striking do not always smash every overhead ball when a well-placed volley will win the ace just as well it be a waste of much-needed strength and there be a greater risk of make a mistake for a _ smash _ the right shoulder should be down and well under the ball the head and weight well back the weight transfer at the moment of striking from the right to the left leg the body balance with extended left arm and the body-weight bring right on to the ball as it be hit finish to the left of you left knee as in the service chapter iii match and tournament play when you have acquire a certain knowledge of the game and can play the various stroke in the correct way then as i have say tournament and match play be the very best method of improvement i would emphasize the need for a certain standard of efficiency because i be convince that at the present time there be too many weak player compete at open meeting the style of these player have only to be watch to be condemn and they knowledge of the game be hopelessly limited invariably make stroke in a wrong way tournament play only serve to consolidate weakness and check advance but assume you have practice on sound line and be fit to take part in what after all should be a test of trained skill tournament will then be a great help to you you will more often than not play against better player than yourself -- a advantage deny you in practice -- and against all variety of attack and defense you have the chance of watch first-class match and learn at first hand how the different stroke should be play you should be careful however to limit the number of you tournament especially when the excitement and strain be new to you otherwise you will do much more harm than good i be convince that generally speak player attend too many meeting instead of they play improve it may deteriorate they run the fearful risk of staleness -- one of the greatest danger to a lawn tennis player -- and they become physically wear out as soon as you find you be lose interest in the game when it become a effort to go into court give the game a rest it be clear you have overdo it and need a period of recuperation one or two tournament at a time and then a rest to practice the new stroke and tactical move you have learn and see would i feel sure be much more helpful to you game than tournament tour week-in and week-out some people advise you to dismiss the come match entirely from you mind before go into court personally i find this physically impossible and i do not commend the suggestion i think it be much better to study you opponent 's game before pit you own against it many match may be lose while you be find out the right line of attack therefore i advise you to think about the match you be go to play mentally rehearse you mode of campaign but do not worry over the possible result at all cost it must not be allow to disturb you sleep the night before -- there be nothing put I off my game so much as a sleepless night as soon as you know who you opponent be seize every opportunity to watch she play get to know she strong and she weak point and map out you plan of campaign then come the first preliminary the toss for choice of side or service in choose you side you must take into consideration the position of the sun the wind the slope of the court -lrb- if any -rrb- and the background if you have win the toss and do not mind on which side you start play and also have a good service elect to begin the service if you have win the toss and for some good reason do not wish to serve first you can make you opponent serve but remember that you also give she choice of court one of the great thing to remember in match play be this -- do not strive to win outright with every stroke especially do this maxim apply to the return of the service so many player be inaccurate with this important stroke simply because they sole ambition be to make it end the rest much better to work for you opening try to imagine where you opponent will be after take a certain stroke and then accord to this position determine which be the best stroke to play next it be similar to play chess you should think a move or sometimes two move in advance length variety of stroke and direction be the chief factor in success when play a single very often when the place to send the ball be obvious even to the spectator it be just as obvious to you opponent and she will probably be make for that place before you have even hit the ball then be the time to return the ball not where every one you opponent include anticipate but straight back to the original place -- that be the spot you opponent be just hurriedly leave she will most probably be beat by this simple device trite though the hint may appear always try to send the ball where it will be least expect -lrb- illustration : two well-known pair who compete in a private mixed double tournament at thorpe satchville mr cw hillyard and mr norman brooke miss pinckney and mr gwhillyard -rrb- again i would urge the importance of keep you whole attention absorb on the game complete concentration be absolutely essential you _ must _ lose yourself in the game -- eye mind and hand all work together if you find that event transpire outside the court be attract you attention you can not be watch the ball many player even when concentrate take they eye off the ball too soon with the result that it be not properly time and not hit cleanly in the center of the racket in match play remember that a game be never lose until it be win never give up try match have be win -lrb- you have only to read the experience relate in the final chapter of this book -rrb- after a player have have a set and five game to love call against she therefore unless the game be over it be never too far go to be pull out of the fire even if you opponent require only one more stroke to win the match remember how difficult it often be to make that one -lrb- illustration : miss dk douglass and mr af wilding miss eastlake smith and mr rf dougherty two well-known pair who compete in a private mixed double tournament at thorpe 's satchville -rrb- the same apply if you have a good lead play hard the whole time never for one moment slack off for if you do it be very hard to get go again and you may find yourself catch up and pass at the post before you have a chance of get back into you stride i well remember be a set up and five game to one against miss cm wilson -lrb- now mr luard -rrb- one year at newcastle when victory for I mean permanent possession of the challenge cup this cup be very valuable for it have a splendid list of name inscribe upon it it have be go for very many year miss wilson seem so off she game and i be win so comfortably that i could almost see that cup on my sideboard but it be not to be -lrb- at any rate not that year i be lucky enough to win the cup outright in 1908 when it be even more valuable as miss sutton 's name have be add -rrb- whether i unconsciously slack off think the match be mine -lrb- which be a fatal thing to do at any time -rrb- or whether miss wilson suddenly find she game be impossible for I to say but she eventually win that match and the cup and championship for the year she never give in but play most pluckily right up to the end i remember another match where the result hang in the balance for some time i be play miss ang greene at eastbourne in 1907 again the cup would be my own property if i win it i meet miss greene in the second round she win the first set and be five game to four in the second set and seven time she only want one point to win that match i be able to make it five game all it be very bad luck for miss greene as the moral effect after have have seven chance of win the match be so great that it completely put she off she game and i win that set and the third quite easily be careful also when you be behind and be slowly but surely catch up you opponent that when you do draw level _ you do not relax you effort _ this danger be most insidious and must be fight against the strain and anxiety involve in catch up and the great relief when you be game all provoke a reaction unless you be on you guard a rest be take often involuntarily it be fatal because before you realize it and can get go again you opponent have run out a winner this happen to I at wimbledon in 1908 against mr sterry i be behind the whole time and it be a great relief in the second set to hear the score at last call five game all but i have hardly take a breather when mr sterry secure the set by seven game to five the eleventh game i play almost unconsciously so relieved be i at get on even term when i ought to have spare no effort to win that critical game even if i have fail these three match -- and i could mention many other -- show how important it be to play hard right up to the last stroke of the match let nothing put you off never lose you temper take umpire 's bad decision and all the little annoyance that may disturb you in a sportsmanlike manner -- keep you whole attention in fact absolutely concentrate on the game -lrb- illustration : miss may sutton who win the lady ' championship at wimbledon 1905 1907 -rrb- in a single it be best when serve to stand as near the center of the base-line as possible in this position you have greater command of you court and there be not so much scope for you opponent to put the ball out of you reach miss may sutton the american lady champion and ex-champion of england in she desire to stand as near the center of the court as she possibly can get so close that umpire find it very difficult to tell whether she be serve from the right court or the wrong in fact i think i be right in say she have actually be pull up for step over the center line of the base-line if you stand as close as she do you be liable to step over the line unconsciously stand as near the center line as possible but without any risk of step over it on the other hand there be player who prefer to serve from the other extreme end mr aw gore the present champion of england be one of these but personally i can not see any advantage in this position it seem to leave so much open court of which you adversary will not be slow to make use use the overhead service for choice but have a underhand service ready at you command -- it may come in very useful for a change remember that a good-length well-placed service be better than a very fast one and much less tiring in a long match keep you opponent wonder where the service will come next vary it as much as you possibly can both as to pace and direction be sure to make you opponent move to take it i have try the american service but i think the strain be too severe for the average girl and the advantage gain would be very slight for the rest of you game would deteriorate owe to fatigue it place so much tension on all the muscle of the body and i do not think it would do a girl 's health any good to cultivate it of course if she be abnormally strong and do not feel the effect of the physical effort she would be a tower of strength in the land and she service would be a invaluable one i be not a advocate of persistent volleying in a lady 's single i think it be too great a tax on the physique nor do i think it pay in the long-run a volleyer to my mind be much easier to play against than a base-liner and most of the first-class base-line player agree with I the great physical exertion entail in run continually to the net will after a time make the ground stroke weaker and weaker and you _ must _ have good length to be able to come up and volley with any success miss ew thomson -lrb- now mr larcombe -rrb- one of we best lady volleyer put up a magnificent game in the first set against miss sutton at wimbledon in the championship singles of 1905 she have carefully watch miss sutton 's game and think out the best way to play she volleying most judiciously she would force miss sutton up to the net with a short drop stroke and then lob over she head nearly on to the base-line take up a position at the net win the ace with a neat cross volley these tactic she repeat again and again and actually lead by five game to two if she could have last she must have win that match but she could not keep it up she become obviously exhaust do not get up to the net quickly enough and she length get shorter and shorter miss sutton eventually win that set and the next easily i do not know what would have happen if miss thomson when she find she be tire have stay back for a little while and then resume she tactic at the net perhaps she would have come much nearer to victory a very large majority of non-volleyer in singles have win the lady ' championship and i think that fact help to prove my argument miss maud watson miss rice mr hillyard the late miss robb miss sutton miss boothby and myself be base-liner miss dod and mr sterry be the only two volleyer every girl however should learn how to volley you may be inveigle up to the net and you should then know how to play and place a volley and you should go up now and then on a good-length ball in _ double _ of course it be different i think then a girl should volley it will greatly improve she play all round and will also make the game so much more attractive i think it would be a excellent plan if lady ' double be always play like man 's double both player move together and keep parallel with one another go up to the net together and retire to the back of the court together competitor would improve they volleying and the double instead of be the dreary monotonous affair it be now especially for the base-liner would be vary and instructive i be sure referee would welcome the change with avidity the much-dreaded interminable lady ' double event would be a thing of the past if we play the double with the new formation perhaps we should succeed in re-establish the event at wimbledon but it be very difficult to get lady to volley at a tournament they think they have more chance of win from the back of the court perhaps they have but they have much less chance of improve they game and learn a variety of stroke miss v pinckney start a great work in 1908 organize a lady ' volley league in which all lady who enter a lady ' double event at any tournament be oblige to volley a most successful experiment take place at the beckenham tournament miss pinckney and i play together at the reading tournament and although we be both base-liner we determine to go to the net we find at the end of the event -lrb- which we win owe fifteen -rrb- that we have both much improve we volleying of course we make endless mistake and be frequently in the wrong place but it be experience so badly require unfortunately miss pinckney the pioneer do not play much last season and i think the lady have rather go back to they old way it seem a thousand pity in _ mixed double _ a girl have a very important part to play practically speak she have to work for all the opening for she partner who come in and kill and very often if in watch a mixed double you be incline to think the man be do little work or that he be play badly it be because he partner be get he no plum she be play a poor length or not keep the ball out of the reach of the oppose man it be a good plan to keep you head well down and of course you eye glue on the ball until the very last moment so that it make it difficult for the oppose man at the net to tell in which direction you be go to hit the ball the late miss robb who be a magnificent mixed double player use to play in this way man have tell I it be impossible to anticipate she return keep you head down will also help you from get flurry or put off however jumpy the oppose man be or however much he be run across you can always have a mental vision of he to tell you where he be without look at he to play a mixed double you must be able to lob it be really the most necessary stroke to cultivate a very good return of the oppose lady 's service when both man be at the net be a lob back to the server it be much safer than lob over the man 's head -- if at all short you ball will be instantly kill -- and it also give you partner at the net plenty of time to anticipate any kind of return it will be difficult for the server to return a good-length lob out of you partner 's reach the oppose man at the net will not be able to do anything with this lob -- it be quite out of he reach -- and it would be useless for he to run across as he might do for a cross drive it be usually best i think for a lady to serve down the center of the court in a mixed double it shut up the angle of the court more and there be less risk of she partner be pass down he side line do not enter for too many event in a tournament you may get thoroughly wear out and not able to do yourself justice in any and you would probably have to play when you be very tired -- bad for you game and worse still for you partner 's chance in a double remember that before play a important match it be very injudicious to watch another game it be likely to put you eye out if possible do not travel by train just before play or carry anything heavy such as you tennis bag for this will make you hand shaky and unsteady to sum up there be five golden rule which i have find very helpful to I when play a important match i give they to you in the hope that they may prove equally valuable always remember that constant practice of these rule will make they pursuit natural in a match i keep you eye on the ball you have so often be tell this i know and perhaps the familiar ring about the advice may evoke contempt yet unless this rule be implicitly obey you can not expect much success at lawn tennis take you eye off the ball be the secret of every mis-hit and mis-timed stroke you must not be content merely to look at the ball but follow it right on to you racket watch it up to the actual moment of strike the court and the position of you opponent must be mentally engraved at the same time how frequently attentive observation will reveal a player lift he or she eye from the ball a fraction too soon always be on you guard against this inclination it be at first do almost unconsciously but it soon become a habit ii keep you mind on the game this be a most important rule as i have remark before complete concentration be absolutely necessary to success if you be worry about anything business or home affair it be bind to affect you game think of absolutely nothing but the game you be at the moment play you whole personality must be absorb to play the game well demand the use not only of limb and muscle but heart eye and brain the first rule will help the second because you attention must be more or less fix on the game if you be carefully watch the ball the whole time iii keep perfect control of the temper this rule some player will find much more difficult than other you hear of a person have the right temperament for game of be naturally imperturbable it be a priceless quality for to my mind it be half the battle if nothing can disturb you equanimity to be calm and placid at critical moment never to get excite or flurry or in any way put out whatever little worry may turn up -- and sometimes these worry seem endless and try one to the uttermost limit -- that be one of the key to fame on court i think if a good game ' temperament be not natural to you it can to a great extent be cultivate but it require much practice and a abundance of will-power and self-control it be a very important quality to possess because to lose you temper or to be upset over any trifle not only put you off you game but help you opponent to take a new lease of life and encourage she to play up harder than ever she naturally think that if you be so upset at something or other you game be bind to deteriorate and she will have a much better chance of win the match iv keep you heart in the game by this i mean do not get easily downheart and discourage fight pluckily to the end however thing be go against you courage and pluck be want above all thing to carry you successfully through you match never say die however hopeless the score may sound against you if you be very do up try not to make it too obvious you opponent may be just as play out as you be see you signal of distress she will buoy herself up and continue the struggle with renew hope and vigor v keep you method on the move this maxim be rather difficult to explain what i mean be you should vary you manner of play and re-adapt it in order to counteract you opponent upset she usual game by you tactic it be always a great mistake to keep up a method of attack or defense if it be prove unavailing if necessary keep you own method of play continually on the change a change of tactic have often mean a change of fortune in the game never let you opponent know what you be go to do next do what she would least expect always try to make a stroke give she plenty of the stroke you know she do not like i have often feel myself improve a opponent 's weak stroke by peg away at it it give she plenty of excellent practice of course and when you find she be begin not to mind it so much give it a rest when you go back to it you will probably find it successful again use you brain and always know what you be try to do play with a object of attack and defense do not merely return the ball aimlessly let each stroke have its little work to do to complete the whole victory this be difficult i know but it be so much more fascinating and be i be sure the way the game be mean to be play there be much science that can be bring into lawn tennis always something new to learn and that be the reason why we never tire of play it chapter iv racket court dress and training a good lawn tennis racket be indispensable indeed to use a weapon of inferior make be to court failure from the start you can not be too particular to have a really well-made racket fortunately there be now so many good maker that it be a player 's own fault if she be not suitably equip it may be a little more expensive to buy a really first-class racket but the few extra shilling be well worth while if you mean to take up the game seriously and to get out of it all the enjoyment you can personally i always play with a slazenger racket prefer they make to any other but there be many other good manufacturer the weight of you racket should vary accord to you strength of wrist and should depend on whether you volley or play entirely from the back of the court i be incline to think there be a tendency on the part of lady player to use too light a racket i have often see they with a 12-1\/2 - oz or 13-oz these be too light and may be condemn if you use a racket that be too light it mean that the maker have not be able to string it as tightly as it ought to be string -- the frame would not stand the tension i do not think a racket should be lighter than 13-1\/2 oz which be the normal weight for lady myself i prefer and always play with a 14-oz and hold that unless there be a weakness of the wrist or some personal reason why the player should knock off the extra half-ounce this weight be the best for lady to use i like my racket slightly weighted in the head but i think most player prefer one evenly balanced the latter may be recommend to a beginner the handle should be about five inch in circumference -- at least that be what i use and recommend for a natural and easy grip of course the circumference must vary a little accord to the size of the player 's hand or length of she finger but i counsel all lady to fight shy of the handle that be abnormally large i be quite sure it be a mistake it tend to tire and stiffen the hand endeavor to standardize you requirement find out by careful trial what weight what size of handle and what string suit you game best and then you will find when you use a new racket for the first time that the tool be familiar and have a friendly influence over you stroke what more embarrassing experience than to play a match with a racket you can not recognize you should always take a wet-weather racket with you when you go to tournament it be like a pair of steel-pointed shoe a necessary item in you tennis bag in england with such variable weather it be necessary to play in the rain or at any rate on a wet ground and with sodden ball and the very best gut in the world can not stand rough usage it be a good plan too to take to tournament at least two racket as much alike as possible if anything go wrong with one you will have a good substitute one that be not strange to you always take great care of you racket they be very susceptible both to damp and excessive dry heat and should always be keep in a press when not in use a warped frame be fatal if you do not use a tennis bag you racket should be protect in a waterproof case it be a good plan after use in the wet to rub the surface of the string with a little beeswax or varnish most maker keep a special preservative in stock and now for a few remark on dress there have be a great improvement during the last few year in the costume worn by those who take part in tournament hold all over the country first-class player know from experience how to dress to be most comfortable and least hamper by they clothing but the less experienced be wont to appear in a garden-party trail skirt trim hat and dressy blouse -- a most unbusiness-like costume for the game it be essential to remember that you want above everything else free use of all you limb physical action must not be impede in any way by you clothing a overhead ball which may require you arm to be extend as far as it will go a low volley at the net where you must bend down a run across the court or up to the net -- all these stroke you must be able to perform with freedom and facility -lrb- illustration : on tour : the late miss c meyer miss pinckney and miss ew thompson -lrb- mr larcombe -rrb- -rrb- i advise a plain gore skirt -- not pleated i think these most unsuitable on court -- about four or five inch from the ground it should just clear you ankle and have plenty of fullness round the hem always be careful that the hem be quite level all round nothing be more untidy than a skirt that dip down at the back or side -- drop at the back be a little trick a cotton skirt cultivate when it come home from the laundry a plain shirt without frill or furbelow -- if any trim at all tuck be the neatest -- a collar tie and waistband go to make a outfit as comfortable and suitable as you could possibly desire the material that this plain shirt and skirt be make of do not so much matter and must be accord to the taste of the wearer serge flannel and cotton be the most popular and the last predominate white be undoubtedly the best color to wear it wash well and do not fade and look very much neater on the court than a color material i prefer white shoe and stocking for i think it look nicer to be in one uniform color but this be a matter of taste some people urge that white shoe make you foot appear much bigger than black or brown i do not agree if you be wear a white skirt the black or brown shoe must show up more distinctly against it than a shoe of the same color i have also hear it decide that when girl be compel to play in the rain or on dreadfully muddy court as unfortunately they often be it be better for they to don a dark skirt of thicker material this seem to I a great mistake a white skirt will wash well and it do not matter how dirty it get so long as you do not have it trail in the mud it can not come to much harm it look as neat as anything can look that be surround by rain and mud a dark stuff skirt on the other hand which many player use in wet weather do not wash and be absolutely ruin after a soak moreover it be twice as heavy to drag about the court if you do not happen to have steel-pointed shoe with you and be call upon to play in the wet it be a good plan to wear a pair of man 's thick shooting stocking or sock over you tennis shoe it be wonderful what a firm grip they give without in any way impede you movement i find after have try nearly every sort of shoe for tennis that the simple white gymnasium shoe suit I best most player use a proper tennis shoe or boot with a thick sole i have try these but find they make I much slower in court and be not as comfortable as the gym shoe some people say the thicker sole be less tire to the foot but i find i be much less foot-weary after a match when play in the thin shoe -- there be less weight to carry about of course thin sole soon wear through but then they have the advantage of be very cheap i pay half a crown a pair for mine and one can have several pair in use and can always replace they without any great expense i think it be best if you can to play without any hat at all there be not the bother of keep it on and it be much cooler nor be it easy to find a suitable hat for lawn tennis a girl 's hair be generally a good safeguard against sunstroke a long warm coat be a very necessary article of wear apparel especially for girl who be play in tournament it should be put on immediately after a strenuous match however hot the day there be the great danger when overheate of contract a chill the coat should be of a thick warm material -- blanket be very popular and serviceable -- and it should reach to the end of you skirt if not beyond i do not think it be wise to wear bracelet when play unless they be plain and tight to the wrist although you might not think it ornament however small can and do get in you way i remember one match that be entirely lose because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain attach put up she hand to adjust a hairpin the owner do not know that the chain have catch on to she fringe-net and bring she hand down quickly the fringe-net and most of the hairpin be drag from she hair the result be that the player who might easily have leave the court and fix up she hair again firmly adjust it as best she could she hair blow about in all direction in between every stroke she have to clutch wildly at stray portion that blow across she face and into she eye this diversion naturally upset she game and i think that be the last time she wear a bracelet in court _ training for match play _ be rather a difficult subject for I to write about for i have never go in for proper training the great secret be to keep perennially fit remember that a important match be a great strain a challenging test of stamen to come through the ordeal successfully you must be in a good condition of health if you be not you ought not to be play personally i know what it mean to play a important match when feel really ill honestly it be not worth it it be no enjoyment to yourself and it be no pleasure to you opponent to beat you when she know you be unfit besides it be very injurious to you own health on the other hand if you be in good condition and lead a healthy outdoor life a well-contested match can not harm you it be most beneficial in every way therefore i think the best training for a important match be to be always in training not to have to alter you habit before a match be the secret to change you diet and mode of live suddenly as some player do be more calculate to upset you than to make you fitter for the ordeal common sense must of course be use for instance you should not eat a heavy meal just before play i generally prefer bread-and-cheese a milk pudding of some sort and perhaps a little fruit for lunch if i have a match in the afternoon i find this diet very satisfying and sustain and of course much lighter than meat banana or apple go very well with the cheese as i like this sort of lunch at any time i do not have to change my diet materially before a match after the day 's play be over i make absolutely no difference eating for dinner in the evening whatever be go lunch be the chief meal over which care should be exercise for important match generally begin about two o'clock a heavy meal would make I slow and sleepy i know of one well-known player who never have any breakfast at all she may play hard match all the morning and when the luncheon interval arrive she have only bread-and-cheese and fruit of course this be a very exceptional case and i should not care to try it myself i find a good breakfast a necessity before a long and hard day at a tournament but the no-breakfast regime certainly suit the player in question she be always fit and have great stamen come through exhausting match without show the slightest sign of distress i need not add that sleep be one of the chief factor for make you feel buoyant and well if you have not have you right measure of sleep the night before a important contest you be greatly handicapped remember too how necessary it be to sleep in a well-ventilated room with the window open as to _ court _ there be so many surface now use for the game such as grass wood asphalt cement gravel and sand that it be possible to play the game all the year round under cover or out in the open i think however most player will agree with I that a good grass court be the ideal surface for lawn tennis the sensation of play a genuinely hard match with evenly balanced player on a _ good _ grass court under ideal weather condition have only to be experience to be appreciate it be then you realize what great enjoyment this game give to any one who love it alas the really good grass court and ideal weather be very hard to get in england i suppose there be scarcely a day in 1909 that could be describe as perfect for lawn tennis and we good grass court be few and far between the climate we can not control but i often wonder why there should be such a dearth of true grass court at open meeting of course maintenance involve a certain amount of expense but surely many club be quite well enough off to command at least one or two really good court can it be ignorance or be it a want of necessary energy and constant attention lawn tennis seem to suffer in this respect more than most game there be hundred of splendid golf green and cricket pitch all over the country but for some inexplicable reason a good grass lawn tennis court be as mr gw hillyard have remark almost as rare a sight as a dead donkey happily we get this rare spectacle at wimbledon under mr hillyard 's able care and management -lrb- illustration : group of player at the newcastle tournament 1902 -rrb- what a difference a general improvement in surface would mean i be convince that if court be better the standard of play would advance more rapidly it be marvellous what beneficial effect a good court have on play i have see a average player who have always play on bad court with cramped surroundings and poor background put up a really good game the very first time he play on a first-class court -- i refer to a well-known private court at thorpe satchville perhaps the best in the country that player surprise himself and every one else present he perform about half-thirty better than he usual game the moral be that if other player have the opportunity of play regularly on a true and fast court they must essentially improve on bad court you can never be sure what the ball will do it be a toss-up whether you get a false bind or not a player once tell I that he think it a good thing to have these bad court at you house or club to practice upon when you go to tournament he argue you would not mind what you find there as the condition could not be worse and might be better and you would always be in the happy frame of mind of not expect too much and never be disappointed you game would not be put off by depressing condition -- you be so use to they but that be poor logic after all we play the game for pleasure and there can be no enjoyment in play on wretched court many unfortunate player if they wish to play the game at all be force to play on what mr mahony use to call cabbage patch -- -lrb- sorry partner it hop on a cabbage be he favorite expression after miss a ball in a double -rrb- but i can not understand any one voluntarily choose such a surface a wood floor have such a absolutely true bind that it must provide very good practice and one winter 's play on the indoor court at queen 's club be to my mind a quicker way of improve you game than two or three season on grass court which be not of the best these cover wood court be very scarce and it be a thousand pity there be so few of they would that this winter game be in the reach of everybody on the other hand you can overdo the game by play continuously and if you have be play all through the summer with scarcely a break it be a good plan to rest during the winter month take up some other game to keep you eye in and you condition fit since true grass court be so scarce in this country i sometimes wish we could dispense with turf altogether and have at we tournament the same surface which find favor abroad at place like canne homburg and dinard the bind of the ball on these court be absolutely uniform the surface be hard sand one great advantage they possess -- we should welcome it over here -- be that when it rain play be quite out of the question wade about in the mud and playing in a steady downpour often we lot in england be unknown on the continent and foreign court also dry quickly after rain and often play better for they watering chapter v tournament and club management i wish a order of play could be use more at english tournament that be to say i wish match could be arrange to take place at a certain hour follow the plan adopt at wimbledon and at all the meeting on the continent such a arrangement would greatly add to the comfort and enjoyment of competitor and would i imagine be a great boon to the referee spectator i know would welcome it i think a time-table might prove unworkable where handicap event be concerned but in the case of open event i feel sure it could be introduce with great advantage to all concerned i have so often sit hour after hour at a london tournament -lrb- have only enter for the open event -rrb- perhaps play one match perhaps not play at all if i have be tell overnight that i should not be want or exactly at what hour my match would take place it would have be so much more satisfactory and save so much waste time this wait about take away half the pleasure of play in london meeting even if there be good match go on you do not care to watch they incessantly there may be a chance of you play off a tie and it would tend to put you eye out on one occasion have a long way to go to a tournament in which i be only enter for the open mixed double i telephone to know whether i should be want or not well reply the referee if i call you and you be not on the ground i shall scratch you in you own interest you have better come over for my partner 's sake as well as my own i be bind to go as i expect i sit the whole afternoon and evening do absolutely nothing when i begged to be allow to play as i have come some distance for this one match the referee examine he program and say oh it be quite impossible to-day they have not play the round in front of you yet -lrb- illustration : after the lady ' final at wimbledon : tea on the lawn -rrb- this sort of thing imply gross mismanagement besides result in unnecessary wear and tear for the competitor if there be a order of play arrange for each day all the bother would be obviate i believe that business man who can not get away in the early afternoon have they match time and arrange for they why be not all competitor treat alike while i be on this subject of wait about let I say that i think lady do not take nearly enough care of themselves after play they ought to wrap up well if they have not time to change before they next match man be much more careful they put on they coat immediately they leave the court and change they clothes as soon as they can but you will see girl chat after a match and even have tea without deign to put on a extra wrap it be court disaster the cold and more dangerous ailment that arise from this little want of care naturally afford people a line of attack when they object to girl engage in violent exercise you can not be too careful after strenuous play i be well aware that lady be cater for very badly at most of the tournament in regard to changing-room accommodation some place we have have to put up with be disgraceful i think most lady player will agree with I when i say that wimbledon and queen 's club be about the only two grounds where you can change with any degree of comfort this be not right and i be sure if man have to experience the changing-room accommodation afford for we use there would not be many of they compete at tournament i think the two club i have mention be the only two where we even get a bathroom some tournament provide a draughty tent for we use moreover there be generally only one dressing-room and feminine spectator often crowd round the one looking-glass stare at the player as if they be animal on show it be sometimes even impossible to sit down to rest after a hard and tiring contest i appeal to secretary of tournament for some reform a number of lady player have ask I to use this opportunity to point out some of we most press grievance i hope these remark which be none too strong may bear fruit visitor who come over from other country be always loud in they complaint and i be not surprised i believe the beckenham authority be do all they can to impart a little more comfort to the lady ' change and resting-room and they have greatly improve they accommodation it be time other meeting follow they example at the seaside meeting it do not so much matter most of the player stay near the ground and can go to they own room and be back in time to play again if necessary but in london tournament where there be often a long drive or train journey before one reach home it be most important that there should be a good changing-room -lrb- illustration : a tournament house-party at newcastle _ front row -lrb- leave to right _ -rrb- : the late miss c meyre mr gw hillyard mr hillyard mr lambert chamber mr ne brooke mr aj robert -rrb- there be another improvement which i feel sure would be greatly welcome by competitor and that be a separate tea-tent for they use often a player have only a few minute to get she tea and with the general public engage in the same amiable pursuit she be not able to be serve and have to go away tealess if there be a competitor ' tea-tent a player could obtain she tea in comfort when she want it always bear in mind that a referee at a tournament have a most worrying time of it player can and should help to make he task lighter there be many way in which they can assist to make the tournament as successful as possible one be by be punctual and ready dress to play when want and another be by umpire when they be disengage and have not a important match just come on take the chair may help they not to dispute a umpire 's decision when they be in court themselves they will realize how difficult umpiring be and that bad as umpire often be they be do they best to dispute a decision or to argue with the umpire never help matter it usually make he nervous a bad decision must be take as a fortune of war and bear in a sportsmanlike manner but you must never allow the crowd to influence the umpire it be a hopeless expedient for many people who watch match be ignorant of the rule of the game sometimes -- i suppose it be hobson 's choice -- a umpire be choose from the gate if he know little or nothing of he duty the result be disastrous should there be difficulty in get a umpire who know something of he work i think the match should take care of itself i have experience umpire who do not even know how to score and now a word or two about _ club _ it be very difficult to manage a lawn tennis club successfully much tact be require i think it be almost impossible to prevent a club be cliquey and i should always advise a player who wish to improve she game to join one which be more concerned with its tennis than its social side some club still use the game for a garden-party where long trail skirt sunshade and basket chair predominate perhaps a game or two be play in the cool of the evening that sort of club should be avoid if you be a keen and enthusiastic player the committee of a club should be a small one consist of member who be devote to the best interest of the game they aim should be to keep in touch with all the latest development and above all to keep up to date advance with the time a committee sometimes embrace old supporter of the club who have be member for year and year they have old-fashioned idea be very conservative and do not like innovation of any sort even if change be obviously necessary for the benefit of the game a committee should see that they club have a good match-card for inter-club contest be excellent practice for the member and there be nothing like foster a spirit of friendly rivalry care should be take to choose player who make a good pair and combine well together a committee should do all in its power to improve the standard of play and that can only be accomplish by have well-tended court and good ball many club be not equip with side-post for the single game that be a great mistake because a player will practice without they in she club and then when she enter for a tournament will have to use they it be bind to put she off she game such detail make all the difference between good and bad management of a club -lrb- illustration : my sister and myself _ a picture postcard send to mr lambert-chamber by miss may sutton from she home in californium _ -rrb- it be a excellent plan for member of the committee to drop in at some of the tournament and see how thing be do there development may have occur of which they know nothing and they could pick up many a wrinkle by a tour of inspection before one secretary of a fairly large tournament go to wimbledon he have never see a canvas background chapter vi some personal reminiscence i have be ask to write what i can remember of my earliest tennis day this be rather difficult as it be now thirteen year since i enter for my first tournament in 1896 it be never easy or pleasant to write one 's own biography but i have be assure that reader will be interested to hear something of my career in court i have say that 1896 be the first year i enter for a tournament which be quite true but i always reckon that my tournament experience do not really start until the year 1898 because in the two previous year i only enter for one tournament -lrb- the gipsy -rrb- and only in the handicap at that and i come out first round in 1898 i play in three tournament and in more event at each one my earliest recollection of a racket and tennis ball go back to when i be quite small my greatest amusement be to play up against a brick wall with numerous doll and animal of all kind as spectator -- really as big a gate as we get now at some tournament each toy in turn be choose as my opponent needless to say i always win these match my adversary take very little interest in the proceedings this be some year before i even play in a court and i think it be a very good way of start the game i then play in a court we have at home which be not very good gooseberry bush prevent we run outside the court at all i next join a club at ealing common and at the age of eleven win my first prize the handicap singles at we club tournament of course i be receive enormous point and i remember to this day how bore the best lady player in the club be when they have to play I my game then from all account involve a sequence of very high lob i be now quite envious of the accuracy of my lobbing in those day i have absolutely no pace but be active and very steady and desperately serious and keen about the game at this time also i use to play at college prefer tennis to cricket which be the exception cricket be the great game tennis be push into the background and very little interest be take in it even when the match be play to decide the winner of the racket present each year to the best player in the school by some kind parent i win this racket one year but could never use it as it be heavily weighted with a enormous silver shield on which be a lengthy inscription of course the balance of the racket be absolutely upset there be not much chance of improve at school because nobody take the trouble to have the court or net of the right dimension the rule of the game be not even know every ball that touch the line be give out i remember a very heated argument i have with a mistress who be umpire a match for I the result of which be that i have line to write for impertinence in 1899 i join the ealing lawn tennis club and win the singles championship cup three year in succession thus keep it for my own property at one time mr hillyard and mr sterry have both be member of this same club curiously enough mr hillyard mrs sterry miss sutton and myself have all live at different period of we life very close together -- mr hillyard at greenford mr sterry and myself at ealing and miss sutton at acton i think about this time i very much improve my game by constantly play singles against the best man in the club and also double with three man this be undoubtedly excellent practice for I -lrb- illustration : autograph from my album -rrb- in 1898 i win my first prize in open tournament the handicap singles at chiswick park and queen 's club at chiswick i receive 154 and meet miss c cooper in the semi-final i remember quite well my stage fright when i go into court against this famous player even at the tremendous odds of owe 153 and give 154 i lose the first set easily and the game be then postpone until the next day owe to fail light after that first set a friend say to I if you could only forget it be miss cooper i be certain you could win the next day i try to follow out this advice and eventually win the match with the score of 3\/6 6\/1 6\/4 at queen 's i meet miss c cooper again she be owe 40 and i be receive 2\/6 i again manage to win this time in two set 6\/2 6\/3 at eastbourne the same year my third tournament i be in the second-class handicap owe 15 and survive a few round miss cm wilson be also in the second class at 4\/6 but we do not meet miss be morton miss ang greene miss garfit miss robb mr hillyard miss dya miss austin and miss c cooper be in the first class the classification for that year -lrb- 1898 -rrb- be : miss c cooper scratch miss austin 1\/6 miss dya 1\/6 mr hillyard 1\/6 miss martin 1\/6 miss steedman 2\/6 mr picker 3\/6 miss robb 3\/6 miss garfit 4\/6 mr kirby 4\/6 miss legh 4\/6 the first player of any repute that i beat in open singles be miss er morgan whom i defeat in 1899 at chiswick park i be beat in the next round by miss b tulloch after a severe tussle i again win the handicap singles at queen 's i be on the scratch mark the farthest back i have yet be miss austin be back-marker at owe 303 the classification for 1899 be : mr hillyard scratch miss martin scratch miss c cooper 1\/6 miss austin 1\/6 mr durlacher 2\/6 mr picker 3\/6 miss I robb 4\/6 miss steedman 5\/6 miss bromfield 15 mr kirby 15 miss tulloch 15 in 1900 miss marion jone then american lady champion come over to england i play one of the most exhausting match against she that i have ever experience it be at queen 's club in the handicap singles i be owe 3\/6 and miss jone receive 3\/6 there be a good deal of discussion at the time about this match and in spite of the tremendous heat -lrb- we do not get such summer now -rrb- we be persuade to go into court in truth it be a gruelling day i remember man walk about the street fan themselves we play for hour in a blaze sun and i eventually win the score be 8\/10 6\/2 7\/5 after the match miss jone be take to the dressing-room in a faint condition and when i reach home i have a attack of sunstroke and have my head pack in ice the umpire be also seriously ill for some time it be only the international element in the game and the controversy about the relative point that make we fight it out to the bitter end we both thoroughly agree with the notice of this match which appear in _ lawn tennis _ the follow week : the lady have they example of untiring effort and splendid patience in the second round of the handicap singles when miss marion jone the american champion -lrb- receive 3\/6 -rrb- meet miss dk douglass -lrb- owe 3\/6 -rrb- the tie be play off under exceptionally try circumstance a fiercely hot sun be pour its ray on the court and there be scarcely a breath of air yet for 2-1\/2 hour without hat do these lady strive for mastery the first set fall to miss jone after 18 game have be play the second be secure by miss douglass with comparative ease neither the odds nor the previous exertion appear to affect she the third set bring out a remarkable display of patience determination and cool judgment for when it stand out at 5 game to 1 in miss jone 's favor miss douglass win the next 6 game right off each game be fight out with great resolution it may be doubt whether either for tennis ' sake or ` kudos ' such a contest under such condition be wise i be not surprise to hear it mention that not only have both competitor severely feel the strain but that even the umpire have suffer this year -lrb- 1900 -rrb- it be interesting to note that the champion of to-day miss d boothby win the handicap singles at beckenham receive 154 this year too see my first appearance at wimbledon i be not in the list very long meeting miss l martin first round i do not think the game last long and i have only a very faint recollection of it but i remember think miss martin 's stroke be the finest i have ever see at eastbourne a couple of month later i be lucky enough to meet miss c cooper on a very off day and run she close in the open singles the match cause quite a sensation we start rather late in the tea interval and nobody take the least interest in what be consider a forgone conclusion however when it get abroad that misss cooper have actually lose the first set people come hurry round the court in great consternation lest miss cooper whom they all know so well should go down to a play who be quite unknown i have be in the second class only the year before miss cooper eventually secure the match 3\/6 9\/7 9\/7 i meet mr sterry on many subsequent occasion before i could get anything like so close to she i really use to get quite weary of be beat by she when the handicap singles come out the day after this match i be put to owe 15 in the first class which please I immensely miss robb mr greville and miss c cooper be owe 153 and mr hillyard owe 30 i be in the classification for the first time at the end of this year mr hillyard scratch miss c cooper 1\/6 miss martin 2\/6 mr greville 2\/6 mr picker 3\/6 miss robb 4\/6 miss bromfield 5\/6 mr ever 5\/6 miss c hill 5\/6 miss longhurst 5\/6 mr winch 5\/6 miss lane 15 miss be morton 15 miss tulloch 15 miss dk douglass 15 in 1901 i win my first challenge cup in a open tournament beating mr greville in the challenge round at beckenham mr greville 's defeat come as a great surprise to every one it be she third year for the cup and this may have account for she be much below she usual form i have certainly improve a great deal even in that one week for i have have a hard match every day meeting miss tulloch miss morton and countess schulenberg -lrb- with whom i have a tremendous three-set match -rrb- in the precede round mr greville on the other hand have be stand out -- the custom at beckenham one that i personally always find a great disadvantage i be easily beat this year at wimbledon by mr sterry classification for 1901 : mr sterry scratch mr hillyard 1\/6 miss martin 1\/6 miss dk douglass 2\/6 mr durlacher 3\/6 mr greville 3\/6 mr picker 3\/6 miss robb 3\/6 miss lowther 4\/6 miss be morton 4\/6 miss thomson 5\/6 mr winch 5\/6 mr ever 15 miss lane 15 miss longhurst 15 miss tulloch 15 at wimbledon in 1902 i have two very strenuous match which improve my game immensely the first against mr durlacher i just win the second against the late miss robb i just lose after one of the closest match i have ever play miss robb win the championship this year it be a great fight and though of course it be hard to judge i always feel i play in that game as well as i have ever play the score in miss robb 's favor be 6\/4 2\/5 9\/7 thus we both win seventeen game this year i pay my first visit to newcastle a tournament which i always look forward to and enjoy as much as any meet the management be all one can desire the people so keen and hospitable i have a good hard fight with mr sterry lose 7\/5 7\/5 and win with she the lady ' double cup at brighton i be again beat by mr sterry although manage this time to get a set at eastbourne the follow week i win my first match against mr sterry in open singles the score be 5\/7 6\/2 6\/3 i be simply delight after so many reverse to win a match against this player i have be beat so often by she and sometimes feel as though i never should be reward by a victory to my credit the classification of player for 1902 be as follow : miss robb scratch mr sterry scratch miss dk douglass 1\/6 miss l martin 1\/6 miss longhurst 1\/6 mr hillyard 2\/6 miss h lane 2\/6 miss be morton 3\/6 miss greville 3\/6 miss steedman 3\/6 mr durlacher 3\/6 miss cm wilson 3\/6

championship with mr fl riseley and be beat in the challenge round of the lady ' singles by miss l martin after a very hard struggle : 4\/6 7\/5 6\/4 it seem a great pity that miss martin be not able to play at wimbledon that year it be a lean year and for I a lucky one for with so many of the best player not compete for the championship -lrb- mr hillyard mrs sterry miss robb and miss martin be all absentee -rrb- i be give a chance of win the coveted title i meet miss ew thomson in the final who have beat miss morton and miss wilson in the precede round i have have a good fight against miss lowther before reach the final although i be expect to beat miss thomson and actually do win the match i scarcely deserve my triumph miss thomson play by far the better tennis and it be really very hard luck on she that she do not succeed at one time she be a set up and four game to one and i be force to play on the defensive nearly the whole time miss thomson play beautifully place with great accuracy down the line and across the court indeed she placing be so good that i always seem to be yard away from she return when i have think there be plenty of time to get to the ball it have always be a marvel to I how i win that match but i think it be chiefly condition -- miss thomson be never a very good stayer -lrb- illustration : some of the fruit of victory _ in the center be the all england championship win by mr lambert chamber in 190319041906 _ -rrb- by the way miss thomson and i be introduce to each other at the gipsy tournament -- my first tournament i have no partner for the lady ' double handicap and the secretary put we together on the program little do i dream then that we should one day fight out the final of the championship on the center court at wimbledon or as a pair twice win the all england double championship classification for 1903 : miss dk douglass scratch miss l martin scratch miss ew thomson 1\/6 miss lowther 1\/6 miss c m wilson 2\/6 miss greene 3\/6

miss paterson 15 miss tootell 15 in 1905 i pay my first visit to the south of france i be unlucky enough to sprain my wrist but in spite of this mishap the change of condition court and surroundings be all so novel that i thoroughly enjoy my visit the court at the beau site canne be absolutely perfect both as regard surface and background and when one have get use to the different bind of the ball and the rather try glare of the sun one could not wish for better condition for good tennis many a famous match have be fight out on these court and situate as they be in the beautiful grounds of the hotel beau site where most of the player stay the environment be ideal i be only able to play in the monte carlo tournament after a few day ' practice on the beau site court for it be just at the start of the nice tournament that the accident to my wrist occur it be very disappointing to default after come so far to take part in these tournament several month elapse before i could use my wrist again and i be not able to play in any of the tournament before i defend my title at wimbledon -lrb- illustration : the challenge round at wimbledon 1905 : miss sutton -lrb- america -rrb- _ v _ miss dk douglass -rrb- this year miss may sutton the american lady champion pay she first visit to england and carry all before she win the championship of england and many other event all without the loss of a single set -- truly a wonderful performance if any one have pluck it be miss sutton to come to a strange country practically friendless -lrb- miss sutton make many friend over here but she come over alone -rrb- and to play and defeat one after another of the best player in this country be a feat which fill we all with unbounded admiration -lrb- illustration : motor car wait outside the all-england ground at wimbledon during the lady challenge round 1906 -rrb- i have play miss sutton five time lose three and win two of the match of the three match i lose two be at wimbledon in the challenge round of 1905 and 1907 and the third at beckenham in the challenge round of 1907 my two victory be both gain in 1906 in the challenge round at liverpool and wimbledon certainly the most exciting match i have ever play and the one that give I the most pleasure to win be my match at wimbledon against miss sutton in 1906 the match itself be not exactly enjoyable -- the strain be too great so much seem to depend upon I both for my own reputation and that of my country when mr palmer secretary of the all england club escort we into the center court and leave we with a word of encouragement in my ear i feel helpless and destitute you can not realize what it mean to face four thousand people and know that so much depend on you own exertion and coolness miss sutton i think must have feel this loneliness in a still greater degree for she be away from she country she own people and friend i have never have such a craving to speak to some one as i have in this match -- just one friendly word to tell I whether i be play the right sort of game or not i confess my feeling be very string up i remember in the second set when miss sutton lead at three game to love i say to the umpire as we cross over i wonder have i go off or be she play much better but of course he face be like a mask he do not vouchsafe a word not that i expect he to speak but i feel i simply must say something to some one he tell I afterwards he want to say i do not know but stick to it whatever happen concentration on the game in this match be terribly difficult as the crowd be so huge and seem so excited it be almost impossible to forget the people and lose yourself in the game i can quite well remember a dispute go on in the open stand for quite a long time during the first set i think a lady would not put down she sunshade there be quite a commotion about it and then people near would shout advice to I or scream out it be over run this happen two or three time and although i know they be try to help I which in itself be cheer and encourage it be very distracting and disconcerting but after some time i lose it all and become engross in the game i think in 1907 miss sutton be much steadier and play a better all-round game but i do not think she have quite the same terrific fore-hand drive as in the first two year she be over here she stroke be safer perhaps but not so formidable and powerful -lrb- illustration : wimbledon 1906 : miss douglass -lrb- now mr lambert chamber -rrb- wrest the championship from miss sutton the holder -rrb- one of the great charm of play in various tournament be the mean it afford of visit all the different town and country it may involve considerable travel and expense but the tour abroad be both a education and a delight monte carlo nice canne homburg baden-baden and dinard all bring the pleasantest reminiscence many of we have travel about together which be the jolliest way of do the tournament i remember one most enjoyable trip when miss lowther motor the hillyard and myself through germany -- a ideal way of do tournament the place at which a meeting be hold its surroundings also the facility it offer for amusement in the evening after you day 's tennis be over add to the enjoyment and make a material difference it will always be one of my chief delight in thinking of my tennis career to remember the hospitality and many courtesy i have everywhere receive and the many friend i have make who i trust will remain friend long after my tennis be a thing of the past it be extraordinary how nave the general public sometimes be people will watch first-class tennis sit for hour together perhaps in great discomfort and yet display a lamentable want of knowledge about the game in fact to many its object be a mystery this seem hardly possible but it be quite true i once overhear a lady who be watch a match in the center court at wimbledon remark there that be the very first time that man have hit the net with the ball and he have have hundred of try i think the man mention must be play pretty good tennis one really wonder why these onlooker spend so much time round a court or where the pleasure can come in for they at a garden party not so very long ago where tennis be on the program the visitor arrive on the court find one solitary ball tie round with a long piece of string the other end be attach to the net to a natural inquiry the hostess reply oh they lose so many ball in the shrubbery last year i really could not afford it and thought of this plan it have be most successful this ball have last for age another lady at eastbourne whom i have notice because she never leave she seat bring she lunch with she so as not to lose a moment 's play ask I at the end of the week while watch a double whether the partner be side by side or opposite as in bridge one of the most rooted mistake in the public mind be that the first-class player be a professional many time people have say to I you must be make quite a nice bit of pocket-money from you tennis make i say spending you mean -- which always make they stare in amazement this fallacy annoy I very much and be i find very common let I take the opportunity here of point out that there be no professional lawn tennis player except a few coach at queen 's club london and at some of the club abroad these man of course can not compete in open tournament chapter vii my most memorable match -lrb- by lead player -rrb- _ the follow contribution in response to a request for some account of they most noteworthy encounter on court have be kindly furnish for this volume by lead lady player _ mr gw hillyard -lrb- _ champion _ 1886188918941897 1899 1900 -rrb- one of the most exciting match i remember be the final for the championship at wimbledon play on the center court on July 6 1889 between miss rice and I i start very nervously as miss rice have give I rather a fright in the irish championship the month before when she appear in dublin as a dark horse on that occasion i have only scrape through 7\/5 7\/5 i begin the match at wimbledon by serve a double fault and lose several game by do the same thing in the first set my length be awful and miss rice be play well from the start she have a very fine fore-hand drive but like myself a bad back-hand she lead at 3 game to 1 and take the first set at 6\/4 in the second set i regain my confidence a little win three love game out of the first four but miss rice win the next four game in succession the score be call 5\/3 and 40\/15 against I at this point in my despair i say to mr chipp who be umpire the match what _ can _ i do he grim answer be play better i should think i then fully realize that i have not be play my best game and that to win i must hit harder this i do with the result that my length improve and i snatch this game from the fire -- although miss rice be three time within a stroke of the match -- and i eventually win the set at 8\/6 the last set be well fight out for although i begin well and lead at 3\/1 miss rice win the next three game in succession and reach 40\/30 in the following game this be she last effort as i run out at 6\/4 win the championship for the second time i think it be one of the closest match i ever play and i see by _ pastime _ that i only win 18 game to she 16 and 110 stroke to she 100 and i feel i be most lucky to win at all -lrb- signature : blanche hillyard -rrb- mr sterry -lrb- _ champion _ 1895189618981901 1908 -rrb- of course it go without say that my most memorable and exciting match will all be those in which i have excel or be the most distinguished person at the immediate moment let I just say that i be not go to give detail of any match as that be beyond my power and i assume of little interest to the reader win my first championship of the ealing lawn tennis club at the age of 14 be a very important moment in my life how well i remember bedeck by my proud mother in my best clothes run off to the club on the Saturday afternoon to play in the final without a vestige of nerve -lrb- would that i have none now -rrb- and win -- that be the first really important match of my life another great game will always be imprint on my memory and that be in 1894 the first year that the late mr h mahony and i win the all england mixed championship we beat mr hillyard and mr w baddeley in the final the excitement of the onlooker be intense and never shall i forget the overpowering sensation i feel as we walk after we win past the aigburth cricket ground stand pack to its limit how the people clap and cheer we it be tremendous -lrb- illustration : mr hillyard -rrb- -lrb- illustration : mr sterry -rrb- -lrb- illustration : miss vm pinckney -rrb- -lrb- illustration : miss d boothby -rrb- another memory -- the year 1895 certainly i must be honest and say it be not exactly a good championship win for miss dodd mr hillyard and miss martin be all stand out any of these could have beat I nevertheless it be a delightful feeling to win the blue ribbon of england especially as my opponent in the final miss jackson have lead 5-love in both set by some good fortune i be able to win seven game off the reel in each case one more match -- in 1907 i have hear a great deal about miss may sutton -lrb- who make she first appearance in england in 1905 -rrb- beat everybody without the loss of a set i have also hear she be a giant of strength and that the harder one hit the more she like it the first time i meet she be at liverpool in 1907 -- i do not play the previous season i be determine to introduce unfamiliar tactic give she short ball in order to entice she up to the net the result be that many of she terrific drive go out and i think this be primarily the reason why i be the first lady in england to take a set from she i recollect she tell I after the match be over that my game be very different to any other she have ever play and that she be not anxious to meet I again -- remark i take as a great compliment there be score of game just the reverse of pleasant which be imprint on my memory but i be not go to revive they at my own expense hope they have be forget and

supremacy at one time it really seem as if i must win this match as i lead at 5 game to 1 and be within a stroke of the match but i could not make that one point once when i have the advantage and only want a ace to win the match one of my return run along the top of the net and then unfortunately for I drop my side miss martin stick to she gun persistently and eventually pull the match out of the fire win the next six game straight off and thus become irish champion for 1902 it be very disappointing to lose after be so near victory the score in mis martin 's favor be 6\/8 6\/4 7\/5 -lrb-

give the open mixed double semi-final that take place on the final day of the kent championship meeting at beckenham on June 1 1908 mr roper barrett and i meet mr prebble and miss boothby and the story of the match be one of startling lapse and recovery in the first set mr prebble and miss boothby profit by the combination bear of frequent association in mixed double miss boothby be very good from the back of the court and mr prebble seem to make mincemeat of my return it be they set by 6\/4 in the second set mr roper barrett be quite wonderful and kill every ball that he could possibly reach the result be that the set be easily ours by 6\/1 we opponent however have something in reserve and i play badly they run away to 5\/0 in the third set all seem over my partner and i make a great effort and get one game and we congratulate ourselves on save a love set then the excitement begin and we add game after game to we side i be sure the crowd beame intensely interested and quite work themselves up as we draw to 5 all mr barrett at this time be simply invincible and i manage somehow to keep the ball out of mr prebble 's reach and play everything to miss boothby upon whom devolve the responsibility my partner volley at all kind of remarkable angle and as _ the sportsman _ in describe the match remark sit on the net and be in complete command we take seven game consecutively and win the set at 7\/5 and with it a memorable match -lrb- signature : violet m pinckney -rrb- miss d boothby -lrb- _ champion _ 1909 -rrb- without doubt my most exciting match be the final last year at wimbledon in every player 's heart there must be a faint hope that one day she may win the all england championship at least it have always be in mine from christmas and all through the spring my family and friend have din into my ear that now be my chance and if i do not win this year i never would only when i be lead one set up and 2-love in the second do all these thing flash across my mind i suddenly get nervous oh the misery of it i serve double fault after double fault -lrb- i learn afterwards that i give away sixteen point in this way -rrb- and my friend tell I that it be a relief to they when my service go over the net at all however slowly my opponent miss morton catch up win the set 6\/4 and lead I 4\/2 in the final set all this time i have be fight hard to regain confidence at last my nerve come back -- i be determine to win and only after a very great effort just succeed in capture the championship with the narrow margin of 8\/6 in the final set it be not until i have finish and have come off the court that i realize how very excited i have be and how relieved i be when it be all over only those who have have experience can know how exhausting it be to concentrate one 's whole thought and effort without cessation for a hour or more fortunately you do not feel the strain until afterwards when it do not matter and then you can look back with very great pleasure and satisfaction on a hard-won fight -lrb- signature : dora p boothby -rrb- mr larcombe -lrb- _ double champion _ 1903 1904 _ mixed double champion _ 1904 1905 -rrb- my most memorable match be in the all england mixed double championship at liverpool in 1904 mr sh smith and i be play miss wilson and mr aw gore and we have a great struggle for victory i do not remember the exact score but at one time we opponent be within a ace of the match miss wilson serve to I in the left court -- a good service out on the side line i play a straight back-hand shoot down the line pass mr gore 's forehand -- rather a desperate stroke as if it fail to pass he it mean certain death from one of he straight-arm volley perhaps he be not guard he line so well as usual under the impression that i would not have the courage to try to pass he at such a critical moment -- anyway we win the point and eventually the match and the championship beat the holder miss dk douglass and mr fl riseley in a most exciting match -- almost as memorable to I because i hit mr riseley three time with smash i remember that side-line stroke and those three hit with great joy -lrb- signature : ethel w larcombe -rrb- mr lamplough -lrb- _ cover court champion _ 1907 -rrb- i find it a matter of some difficulty to decide which be the most memorable of the more important match in which i have play four or five as i recall they seem each in turn to have leave a lasting impression on my memory for one reason or another yet none of they appear more worthy of note than the other the match which i think i shall remember long after many other be forget take place last year -lrb- 1909 -rrb- in the comparatively small and little-known tournament at romsey for the first time for some year i have miss winter practice on the covered court at queen 's club and in the south of france and when i start again late in June on moderate club court and against none too keen opponent i find myself look forward with apprehension to my first effort in public in the semi-final of the lady ' open singles at romsey i meet miss sugden whose well-merited reputation as a lawn tennis player be more or less a local one chiefly for the reason that she have not compete in any of the first-class tournament it be a close afternoon and the court be heavy we both feel the heat very much as the game progress i never really look like win the first set my opponent lead 4\/1 and though i manage to equalize she easily run out at 6\/4 it be in the second set that the real struggle take place in spite of all my effort miss sugden win game after game until the game stand at 5\/1 against I and 30 all but by good luck i snatch that game and the two follow at 5\/4 and my service we have deuce quite ten or twelve time but in the end i manage to win and take the set at 7\/5 after that i feel better and with renew confidence and steadier nerve i win the final set at i think 6\/3 there be nothing particularly remarkable in the match but somehow i feel that confidence in myself for the future depend in a great measure on my success in this event and in spite of have a very sport opponent i never feel more relieved in my life than when the last stroke be play -lrb- signature : glady s lamplough -rrb- miss be morton -lrb- _ runner up for the championship _ 1909 -rrb- -lrb- illustration :

match in which i happen to beat she as she be and be then a player altogether a class above I no doubt it become memorable as i certainly never expect to win at the outset and still less so when i be undergo one of those ghastly creep-up in the final set it happen in 1904 at wimbledon on the center court in the semi-final of the championship miss wilson -lrb- as she then be -rrb- start well and win the first set 6\/3 the second go to I at 6\/4 and the third set seem as if it would go to either of we in turn everything go well for I till i actually get to 5\/1 and it be 15\/40 on she service then i lose two point quite easily -- those win shot be so hard to make and at deuce we have a tremendous rally which end in a good side-line shoot by my opponent that i could not get to and do not even try the linesman call out which i contradict and general confusion take place the spectator join in the fray -- and it all arise through the ball be give out in the middle of the long rally when a train be pass and we neither of we hear it i never know the explanation till after the match and be quite convinced i have sneak the point and somehow i go all to piece and everything go as badly as it have go well before till miss wilson creep up to 6\/5 then i make a expire effort just in time i dare say she be tire for i win that game fairly easily we have a great fight for the thirteenth which i fortunately win and finish the match with a love game and no one be more surprised than i -lrb- signature : be morton -rrb- miss ang greene _ -lrb- east of england champion _ 1903 1905 -rrb- it be difficult to decide on the most memorable match one have ever play each in turn seem at the time to be the most important one which i find very exciting at the time be against mr luard in the final for the cup at felixstowe i win the first set 6\/3 and lead 5\/1 and 40\/30 in the next when mr luard send I a short easy ball -- a certain kill at any other time i send it out four time after that i be within a point of the match but could not quite pull it off and mr luard play up brilliantly not only win that set but lead 5\/2 in the third then i make a final effort and though it be always touch-and-go i manage to make it 6\/5 in the next game mr luard be 40-love but after a great struggle i get it and so win the match though it be anybody 's game to the end -lrb- signature : ang
