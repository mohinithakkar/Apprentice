and day and where be there hope or deed as fair caolte toss he burning hair and niamh call away come away this book i i have desire like every artist to create a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant thing of this mar and clumsy world and to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who would look where i bid they i have therefore write down accurately and candidly much that i have hear and see and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagine i have however be at no pain to separate my own belief from those of the peasantry but have rather let my man and woman dhoul and faerie go they way unoffended or defend by any argument of mine the thing a man have hear and see be thread of life and if he pull they carefully from the confused distaff of memory any who will can weave they into whatever garment of belief please they best i too have weave my garment like another but i shall try to keep warm in it and shall be well content if it do not unbecome I hope and memory have one daughter and she name be art and she have build she dwelling far from the desperate field where man hang out they garment upon fork bough to be banner of battle o beloved daughter of hope and memory be with I for a little 1893 ii i have add a few more chapter in the manner of the old one and would have add other but one lose as one grow older something of the lightness of one 's dream one begin to take life up in both hand and to care more for the fruit than the flower and that be no great loss per hap in these new chapter as in the old one i have invent nothing but my comment and one or two deceitful sentence that may keep some poor story-teller 's commerce with the devil and he angel or the like from be know among he neighbor i shall publish in a little while a big book about the commonwealth of faery and shall try to make it systematical and learn enough to buy pardon for this handful of dream 1902 w b yeat a teller of tale many of the tale in this book be tell I by one paddy flynn a little bright-eyed old man who live in a leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which be he be wont to say the most gentle -- whereby he mean faery -- place in the whole of county sligo other hold it however but second to drumcliff and drumahair the first time i see he he be cooking mushroom for himself the next time he be asleep under a hedge smile in he sleep he be indeed always cheerful though i think i could see in he eye -lrb- swift as the eye of a rabbit when they peer out of they wrinkled hole -rrb- a melancholy which be well-nigh a portion of they joy the visionary melancholy of purely instinctive nature and of all animal and yet there be much in he life to depress he for in the triple solitude of age eccentricity and deafness he go about much pester by child it be for this very reason perhaps that he ever recommend mirth and hopefulness he be fond for instance of tell how collumcille cheer up he mother how be you to-day mother say the saint worse reply the mother may you be worse to-morrow say the saint the next day collumcille come again and exactly the same conversation take place but the third day the mother say better thank god and the saint reply may you be better to-morrow he be fond too of tell how the judge smile at the last day alike when he reward the good and condemn the lose to unceasing flame he have many strange sight to keep he cheerful or to make he sad i ask he have he ever see the faerie and get the reply be i not annoy with they i ask too if he have ever see the banshee i have see it he say down there by the water batting the river with its hand i have copy this account of paddy flynn with a few verbal alteration from a note-book which i almost fill with he tale and saying shortly after see he i look now at the note-book regretfully for the blank page at the end will never be fill up paddy flynn be dead a friend of mine give he a large bottle of whiskey and though a sober man at most time the sight of so much liquor fill he with a great enthusiasm and he live upon it for some day and then die he body wear out with old age and hard time could not bear the drink as in he young day he be a great teller of tale and unlike we common romancer know how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people he story he do not live in a shrunken world but know of no less ample circumstance than do homer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by he like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what be literature but the expression of mood by the vehicle of symbol and incident and be there not mood which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for they expression no less than this dilapidated earth nay be there not mood which shall find no expression unless there be man who dare to mix heaven hell purgatory and faeryland together or even to set the head of beast to the body of man or to thrust the soul of man into the heart of rock let we go forth the teller of tale and seize whatever prey the heart long for and have no fear everything exist everything be true and the earth be only a little dust under we foot belief and unbelief there be some doubter even in the western village one woman tell I last christmas that she do not believe either in hell or in ghost hell she think be merely a invention get up by the priest to keep people good and ghost would not be permit she hold to go trapsin about the earth at they own free will but there be faerie she add and little leprechaun and water-horse and fall angel i have meet also a man with a mohawk indian tattoo upon he arm who hold exactly similar belief and unbelief no matter what one doubt one never doubt the faerie for as the man with the mohawk indian on he arm say to I they stand to reason even the official mind do not escape this faith a little girl who be at service in the village of grange close under the seaward slope of ben bulben suddenly disappear one night about three year ago there be at once great excitement in the neighborhood because it be rumor that the faerie have take she a villager be say to have long struggle to hold she from they but at last they prevail and he find nothing in he hand but a broomstick the local constable be apply to and he at once institute a house-to-house search and at the same time advise the people to burn all the bucalaun -lrb- ragweed -rrb- on the field she vanish from because bucalaun be sacred to the faerie they spend the whole night burn they the constable repeat spell the while in the morning the little girl be find the story go wander in the field she say the faerie have take she away a great distance ride on a faery horse at last she see a big river and the man who have try to keep she from be carry off be drift down it -- such be the topsy-turvydom of faery glamour -- in a cockleshell on the way she companion have mention the name of several people who be about to die shortly in the village perhaps the constable be right it be better doubtless to believe much unreason and a little truth than to deny for denial 's sake truth and unreason alike for when we do this we have not even a rush candle to guide we step not even a poor sowlth to dance before we on the marsh and must need fumble we way into the great emptiness where dwell the mis-shapen dhoul and after all can we come to so great evil if we keep a little fire on we hearth and in we soul and welcome with open hand whatever of excellent come to warm itself whether it be man or phantom and do not say too fiercely even to the dhoul themselves be ye go when all be say and do how do we not know but that we own unreason may be better than another 's truth for it have be warm on we hearth and in we soul and be ready for the wild bee of truth to hive in it and make they sweet honey come into the world again wild bee wild bee mortal help one hear in the old poem of man take away to help the god in a battle and cuchullan win the goddess fand for a while by help she married sister and she sister 's husband to overthrow another nation of the land of promise i have be tell too that the people of faery can not even play at hurley unless they have on either side some mortal whose body or whatever have be put in its place as the story-teller would say be asleep at home without mortal help they be shadowy and can not even strike the ball one day i be walk over some marshy land in galway with a friend when we find a old hard-featured man digging a ditch my friend have hear that this man have see a wonderful sight of some kind and at last we get the story out of he when he be a boy he be work one day with about thirty man and woman and boy they be beyond tuam and not far from knock-na-gur presently they see all thirty of they and at a distance of about half-a-mile some hundred and fifty of the people of faery there be two of they he say in dark clothes like people of we own time who stand about a hundred yard from one another but the other wear clothes of all color bracket or chequered and some with red waistcoat he could not see what they be do but all might have be play hurley for they look as if it be that sometimes they would vanish and then he would almost swear they come back out of the body of the two man in dark clothes these two man be of the size of live man but the other be small he see they for about half-an - hour and then the old man he and those about he be work for take up a whip and say get on get on or we will have no work do i ask if he see the faerie too oh yes but he do not want work he be pay wages for to be neglect he make every body work so hard that nobody see what happen to the faerie 1902 a visionary a young man come to see I at my lodgings the other night and begin to talk of the making of the earth and the heaven and much else i question he about he life and he doings he have write many poem and paint many mystical design since we meet last but latterly have neither write nor paint for he whole heart be set upon make he mind strong vigorous and calm and the emotional life of the artist be bad for he he fear he recite he poem readily however he have they all in he memory some indeed have never be write down they with they wild music as of wind blow in the reed -lrb- fn # 1 -rrb- seem to I the very inmost voice of celtic sadness and of celtic longing for infinite thing the world have never see suddenly it seem to I that he be peer about he a little eagerly do you see anything x ----- i say a shine winged woman cover by she long hair be stand near the doorway he answer or some such word be it the influence of some live person who think of we and whose thought appear to we in that symbolic form i say for i be well instruct in the way of the visionary and in the fashion of they speech no he reply for if it be the thought of a person who be alive i should feel the living influence in my living body and my heart would beat and my breath would fail it be a spirit it be some one who be dead or who have never live -lrb- fn # 1 -rrb- i write this sentence long ago this sadness now seem to I a part of all people who preserve the mood of the ancient people of the world i be not so pre-occupied with the mystery of race as i use to be but leave this sentence and other sentence like it unchanged we once believe they and have it may be not grow wiser i ask what he be do and find he be clerk in a large shop he pleasure however be to wander about upon the hill talk to half - mad and visionary peasant or to persuade queer and conscience - stricken person to deliver up the keep of they trouble into he care another night when i be with he in he own lodging more than one turn up to talk over they belief and disbelief and sun they as it be in the subtle light of he mind sometimes vision come to he as he talk with they and he be rumor to have tell diver people true matter of they past day and distant friend and leave they hushed with dread of they strange teacher who seem scarce more than a boy and be so much more subtle than the oldest among they the poetry he recite I be full of he nature and he vision sometimes it tell of other life he believe himself to have live in other century sometimes of people he have talk to reveal they to they own mind i tell he i would write a article upon he and it and be tell in turn that i might do so if i do not mention he name for he wish to be always unknown obscure impersonal next day a bundle of he poem arrive and with they a note in these word : here be copy of verse you say you like i do not think i could ever write or paint any more i prepare myself for a cycle of other activity in some other life i will make rigid my root and branch it be not now my turn to burst into leaf and flower the poem be all endeavor to capture some high impalpable mood in a net of obscure image there be fine passage in all but these be often embedded in thought which have evidently a special value to he mind but be to other man the counter of a unknown coinage to they they seem merely so much brass or copper or tarnish silver at the best at other time the beauty of the thought be obscure by careless writing as though he have suddenly doubt if writing be not a foolish labor he have frequently illustrate he verse with drawing in which a unperfect anatomy do not altogether hide extreme beauty of feel the faerie in whom he believe have give he many subject notably thoma of ercildoune sit motionless in the twilight while a young and beautiful creature lean softly out of the shadow and whisper in he ear he have delight above all in strong effect of color : spirit who have upon they head instead of hair the feather of peacock a phantom reach from a swirl of flame towards a star a spirit pass with a globe of iridescent crystal-symbol of the soul - half shut within he hand but always under this largess of color lay some tender homily address to man 's fragile hope this spiritual eagerness draw to he all those who like himself seek for illumination or else mourn for a joy that have go one of these especially come to mind a winter or two ago he spend much of the night walk up and down upon the mountain talk to a old peasant who dumb to most man pour out he care for he both be unhappy : x ----- because he have then first decide that art and poetry be not for he and the old peasant because he life be ebb out with no achievement remain and no hope leave he both how celtic how full of strive after a something never to be completely express in word or deed the peasant be wander in he mind with prolonged sorrow once he burst out with god possess the heaven -- god possess the heaven -- but he covet the world and once he lament that he old neighbor be go and that all have forget he : they use to draw a chair to the fire for he in every cabin and now they say who be that old fellow there the fret -lrb- irish for doom -rrb- be over I he repeat and then go on to talk once more of god and heaven more than once also he say wave he arm towards the mountain only myself know what happen under the thorn-tree forty year ago and as he say it the tear upon he face glisten in the moonlight this old man always rise before I when i think of x ----- both seek -- one in wander sentence the other in symbolic picture and subtle allegoric poetry-to express a something that lie beyond the range of expression and both if x ----- will forgive I have within they the vast and vague extravagance that lie at the bottom of the celtic heart the peasant visionary that be the landlord duelist that be and the whole hurly-burly of legend -- cuchulain fight the sea for two day until the wave pass over he and he die caolte storm the palace of the god oisin seek in vain for three hundred year to appease he insatiable heart with all the pleasure of faeryland these two mystic walk up and down upon the mountain utter the central dream of they soul in no less dream-laden sentence and this mind that find they so interesting -- all be a portion of that great celtic phantasmagoria whose meaning no man have discover nor any angel reveal village ghost in the great city we see so little of the world we drift into we minority in the little town and village there be no minority people be not numerous enough you must see the world there perforce every man be himself a class every hour carry its new challenge when you pass the inn at the end of the village you leave you favorite whimsy behind you for you will meet no one who can share it we listen to eloquent speaking read book and write they settle all the affair of the universe the dumb village multitude pass on unchanging the feel of the spade in the hand be no different for all we talk : good season and bad follow each other as of old the dumb multitude be no more concerned with we than be the old horse peer through the rusty gate of the village pound the ancient map-maker write across unexplored region here be lion across the village of fisherman and turner of the earth so different be these from we we can write but one line that be certain here be ghost my ghost inhabit the village of h ----- in leinster history have in no manner be burden by this ancient village with its crooked lane its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small fir-tree and its quay where lie a few tarry fishing-lugger in the annals of entomology it be well know for a small bay lie westward a little where he who watch night after night may see a certain rare moth flutter along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred year ago it be carry here from italy by smuggler in a cargo of silk and lace if the moth-hunter would throw down he net and go hunting for ghost tale or tale of the faerie and such-like child of lillith he would have need for far less patience to approach the village at night a timid man require great strategy a man be once hear complain by the cross of jesus how shall i go if i pass by the hill of dunboy old captain burney may look out on I if i go round by the water and up by the step there be the headless one and another on the quay and a new one under the old churchyard wall if i go right round the other way mr stewart be appear at hillside gate and the devil himself be in the hospital lane i never hear which spirit he brave but feel sure it be not the one in the hospital lane in cholera time a shed have be there set up to receive patient when the need have go by it be pull down but ever since the ground where it stand have break out in ghost and demon and faerie there be a farmer at h ----- paddy b

people it be only do a penance upon the earth not far from hillside gate where she haunt appear for a short time a much more remarkable spirit its haunt be the bogeen a green lane lead from the

montgomery would not believe that he wife have appear : she would not show herself to mr kelly he say -- she with respectable people to appear to he be convince by the three mark and the child be take from the workhouse the priest say the mass and the shade must have be at rest for it have not since appear some time afterwards jim montgomery die in the workhouse have come to great poverty through drink i know some who believe they have see the headless ghost upon the quay and one who when he pass the old cemetery wall at night see a woman with white border to she cap -lrb- fn # 2 -rrb- creep out and follow he the apparition only leave he at he own door the villager imagine that she follow he to avenge some wrong i will haunt you when i die be a favorite threat he wife be once half-scared to death by what she consider a demon in the shape of a dog -lrb- fn # 2 -rrb- i wonder why she have white border to she cap the old mayo woman who have tell I so many tale have tell I that she brother-in - law see a woman with white border to she cap go around the stack in a field and soon after he get a hurt and he die in six month these be a few of the open-air spirit the more domestic of they tribe gather within-doors plentiful as swallow under southern eaves one night a mr nolan be watch by she die child in fluddy 's lane suddenly there be a sound of knock hear at the door she do not open fear it be some unhuman thing that knock the knock cease after a little the front-door and then the back-door be burst open and close again she husband go to see what be wrong he find both door bolt the child die the door be again open and close as before then mr nolan remember that she have forget to leave window or door open as the custom be for the departure of the soul these strange opening and closing and knocking be warning and reminder from the spirit who attend the die the house ghost be usually a harmless and well-meaning creature it be put up with as long as possible it bring good luck to those who live with it i remember two child who sleep with they mother and sister and brother in one small room in the room be also a ghost they sell herring in the dublin street and do not mind the ghost much because they know they would always sell they fish easily while they sleep in the ha ` nted room i have some acquaintance among the ghost-seer of western village the connaught tale be very different from those of leinster these h ----- spirit have a gloomy matter-of-fact way with they they come to announce a death to fulfil some obligation to revenge a wrong to pay they bill even -- as do a fisherman 's daughter the other day -- and then hasten to they rest all thing they do decently and in order it be demon and not ghost that transform themselves into white cat or black dog the people who tell the tale be poor serious-minded fishing people who find in the doings of the ghost the fascination of fear in the western tale be a whimsical grace a curious extravagance the people who recount they live in the most wild and beautiful scenery under a sky ever load and fantastic with fly cloud they be farmer and labourer who do a little fishing now and then they do not fear the spirit too much to feel a artistic and humorous pleasure in they doings the ghost themselves share in they quaint hilarity in one western town on whose desert wharf the grass grow these spirit have so much vigor that when a misbeliever venture to sleep in a haunt house i have be tell they fling he through the window and he bed after he in the surround village the creature use the most strange disguise a dead old gentleman rob the cabbage of he own garden in the shape of a large rabbit a wicked sea-captain stay for year inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe make the most horrible noise he be only dislodge when the wall be break down then out of the solid plaster the snipe rush away whistle dust have closed helen 's eye i i have be lately to a little group of house not many enough to be call a village in the barony of kiltartan in county galway whose name ballylee be know through all the west of ireland there be the old square castle ballylee inhabit by a farmer and he wife and a cottage where they daughter and they son-in-law live and a little mill with a old miller and old ash-tree throw green shadow upon a little river and great stepping-stone i go there two or three time last year to talk to the miller about biddy early a wise woman that live in clare some year ago and about she say there be a cure for all evil between the two mill-wheel of ballylee and to find out from he or another whether she mean the moss between the run water or some other herb i have be there this summer and i shall be there again before it be autumn because mary hyne a beautiful woman whose name be still a wonder by turf fire die there sixty year ago for we foot would linger where beauty have live its life of sorrow to make we understand that it be not of the world a old man bring I a little way from the mill and the castle and down a long narrow boreen that be nearly lose in bramble and sloe bush and he say that be the little old foundation of the house but the most of it be take for build wall and the goat have eat those bush that be grow over it till they have get cranky and they will not grow any more they say she be the handsomest girl in ireland she skin be like dribble snow -- he mean drive snow perhaps -- and she have blush in she cheek she have five handsome brother but all be go now i talk to he about a poem in irish raftery a famous poet make about she and how it say there be a strong cellar in ballylee he say the strong cellar be the great hole where the river sink underground and he bring I to a deep pool where a otter hurry away under a gray boulder and tell I that many fish come up out of the dark water at early morning to taste the fresh water come down from the hill i first hear of the poem from a old woman who five about two mile further up the river and who remember raftery and mary hyne she say i never see anybody so handsome as she be and i never will till i die and that he be nearly blind and have no way of living but to go round and to mark some house to go to and then all the neighbor would gather to hear if you treat he well he would praise you but if you do not he would fault you in irish he be the greatest poet in ireland and he would make a song about that bush if he chance to stand under it there be a bush he stand under from the rain and he make verse praise it and then when the water come through he make verse dispraise it she sing the poem to a friend and to myself in irish and every word be audible and expressive as the word in a song be always as i think before music grow too proud to be the garment of word flow and change with the flow and change of they energy the poem be not as natural as the best irish poetry of the last century for the thought be arrange in a too obviously traditional form so the old poor half-blind man who make it have to speak as if he be a rich farmer offer the best of everything to the woman he love but it have naive and tender phrase the friend that be with I have make some of the translation but some of it have be make by the country people themselves i think it have more of the simplicity of the irish verse than one find in most translation go to mass by the will of god the day come wet and the wind rise i meet mary hyne at the cross of kiltartan and i fall in love with she then and there i speak to she kind and mannerly as by report be she own way and she say raftery my mind be easy you may come to-day to ballylee when i hear she offer i do not linger when she talk go to my heart my heart rise we have only to go across the three field we have daylight with we to ballylee the table be lay with glass and a quart measure she have fair hair and she sit beside I and she say drink raftery and a hundred welcome there be a strong cellar in ballylee o star of light and o sun in harvest o amber hair o my share of the world will you come with I upon Sunday till we agree together before all the people i would not grudge you a song every Sunday evening punch on the table or wine if you would drink it but o king of glory dry the road before I till i find the way to ballylee there be sweet air on the side of the hill when you be look down upon ballylee when you be walk in the valley pick nut and blackberry there be music of the bird in it and music of the sidhe what be the worth of greatness till you have the light of the flower of the branch that be by you side there be no god to deny it or to try and hide it she be the sun in the heaven who wound my heart there be no part of ireland i do not travel from the river to the top of the mountain to the edge of lough greine whose mouth be hide and i see no beauty but be behind hers she hair be shine and she brow be shine too she face be like herself she mouth pleasant and sweet she be the pride and i give she the branch she be the shine flower of ballylee it be mary hyne this calm and easy woman have beauty in she mind and in she face if a hundred clerk be gather together they could not write down a half of she way a old weaver whose son be suppose to go away among the sidhe -lrb- the faerie -rrb- at night say mary hyne be the most beautiful thing ever make my mother use to tell I about she for she would be at every hurl and wherever she be she be dress in white as many as eleven man ask she in marriage in one day but she would not have any of they there be a lot of man up beyond kilbecanty one night sit together drinking and talking of she and one of they get up and set out to go to ballylee and see she but cloon bog be open then and when he come to it he fall into the water and they find he dead there in the morning she die of the fever that be before the famine another old man say he be only a child when he see she but he remember that the strongest man that be among we one john madden get he death of the head of she cold he get cross river in the night-time to get to ballylee this be perhaps the man the other remembered for tradition give the one thing many shape there be a old woman who remember she at derrybrien among the echtge hill a vast desolate place which have change little since the old poem say the stag upon the cold summit of echtge hear the cry of the wolf but still mindful of many poem and of the dignity of ancient speech she say the sun and the moon never shine on anybody so handsome and she skin be so white that it look blue and she have two little blush on she cheek and a old wrinkled woman who live close by ballylee and have tell I many tale of the sidhe say i often see mary hyne she be handsome indeed she have two bunch of curl beside she cheek and they be the color of silver i see mary molloy that be drown in the river beyond and mary guthrie that be in ardrahan but she take the sway of they both a very comely creature i be at she wake too -- she have see too much of the world she be a kind creature one day i be come home through that field beyond and i be tired and who should come out but the poisin glegeal -lrb- the shine flower -rrb- and she give I a glass of new milk this old woman mean no more than some beautiful bright color by the color of silver for though i know a old man -- he be dead now -- who think she might know the cure for all the evil in the world that the sidhe know she have see too little gold to know its color but a man by the shore at kinvara who be too young to remember mary hyne say everybody say there be no one at all to be see now so handsome it be say she have beautiful hair the color of gold she be poor but she clothes every day be the same as Sunday she have such neatness and if she go to any kind of a meeting they would all be kill one another for a sight of she and there be a great many in love with she but she die young it be say that no one that have a song make about they will ever live long those who be much admire be it be hold take by the sidhe who can use ungoverned feeling for they own end so that a father as a

beyond and she be say to be the handsomest girl in ireland she die young because the god love she for the sidhe be the god and it may be that the old say which we forget to understand literally mean she manner of death in old time these poor countryman and countrywoman in they belief and in they emotion be many year nearer to that old greek world that set beauty beside the fountain of thing than be we man of learn she have see too much of the world but these old man and woman when they tell of she blame another and not she and though they can be hard they grow gentle as the old man of troy

know more and to feel more and to do more and to guess more than those that have they sight and a certain wit and a certain wisdom be give to they everybody indeed will tell you that he be very wise for be he not only blind but a poet the weaver whose word about mary hyne i have already give say he poetry be the gift of the almighty for there be three thing that be the gift of the almighty -- poetry and dancing and principle that be why in the old time a ignorant man come down from the hillside would be better behave and have better learning than a man with education you would meet now for they get it from god and a man at coole say when he put he finger to one part of he head everything would come to he as if it be write in a book and a old pensioner at kiltartan say he be stand under a bush one time and he talk to it and it answer he back in irish some say it be the bush that speak but it must have be a enchanted voice in it and it give he the knowledge of all the thing of the

streaming up to heaven from the roof of the house where he lay and that be the angel who be with he and all night long there be a great light in the hovel and that be the angel who be wake he they give that honor to he because he be so good a poet and sing such religious song it may be that in a few year fable who change mortality to immortality in she cauldron will have change mary hyne and raftery to perfect symbol of the sorrow of beauty and of the magnificence and penury of dream 1900 ii when i be in a northern town awhile ago i have a long talk with a man who have live in a neighbouring country district when he be a boy he tell I that when a very beautiful girl be bear in a family that have not be note for good look she beauty be think to have come from the sidhe and to bring misfortune with it he go over the name of several beautiful girl that he have know and say that beauty have never bring happiness to anybody it be a thing he say to be proud of and afraid of i

rather older than my friend and very much more feeble and worn and of a very different type he be not like he a robust successful man but rather one of those whose foot find no resting-place upon the earth i recognize one of the child of reverie and say you be doubtless of the stock of the old o'donnell i know well the hole in the river where they treasure lie bury under the guard of a serpent with many head yes sur he reply i be the last of a line of prince we then fall to talk of many commonplace thing and my friend do not once toss up he beard but be very friendly at last the gaunt old tax-gatherer get up to go and my friend say i hope we will have a glass together next year no no be the answer i shall be dead next year i too have lose son say the other in quite a gentle voice but you son be not like my son and then the two man part with a angry flush and bitter heart and have i not cast between they some common word or other might not have part but have fall rather into a angry discussion of the value of they dead son if i have not pity for all the child of reverie i should have let they fight it out and would now have many a wonderful oath to record the knight of the sheep would have have the victory for no soul that wear this garment of blood and clay can surpass he he be but once beat and this be he tale of how it be he and some farm hand be play at card in a small cabin that stand against the end of a big barn a wicked woman have once live in this cabin suddenly one of the player throw down a ace and begin to swear without any cause he swearing be so dreadful that the other stand up and my friend say all be not right here there be a spirit in he they run to the door that lead into the barn to get away as quickly as possible the wooden bolt would not move so the knight of the sheep take a saw which stand against the wall near at hand and saw through the bolt and at once the door fly open with a bang as though some one have be hold it and they flee through a enduring heart one day a friend of mine be make a sketch of my knight of the sheep the old man 's daughter be sit by and when the conversation drift to love and lovemake she say oh father tell he about you love affair the old man take he pipe out of he mouth and say nobody ever marry the woman he love and then with a chuckle there be fifteen of they i like better than the woman

away and doran begin to walk up and down before she say mild weather miss or the like she answer he in a little while and the three begin to talk together the emigrant ship do not arrive for some day and the three drive about on outside car very innocently and happily see everything that be to be see when at last the ship come and doran have to break it to she that he be not go to america she cry more after he than after the first lover doran whisper to byrne as he go aboard ship now byrne i do not grudge she to you but do not marry young when the story get to this the farmer 's daughter join in mockingly with i suppose you say that for byrne 's good father but the old man insist that he have say it for byrne 's good and go on to tell how when he get a letter tell of byrne 's engagement to

afraid she husband might be angry he be afraid to ask what have happen to byrne and left soon after never to see she again when the old man have finish the story he say tell that to mr yeat he will make a poem about it perhaps but the daughter say oh no father nobody could make a poem about a woman like that alas i have never make the poem perhaps because my own heart which have love helen and all the lovely and fickle woman of the world would be too sore there be thing it be well not to ponder over too much thing that bare word be the best suit for 1902 the sorcerer in ireland we hear but little of the darker power -lrb- fn # 4 -rrb- and come across any who have see they even more rarely for the imagination of the people dwell rather upon the fantastic and capricious and fantasy and caprice would lose the freedom which be they breath of life be they to unite they either with evil or with good and yet the wise are of opinion that wherever man be the dark power who would feed he rapacity be there too no less than the bright being who store they honey in the cell of he heart and the twilight being who flit hither and thither and that they encompass he with a passionate and melancholy multitude they hold too that he who by long desire or through accident of birth possess the power of pierce into they hidden abode can see they there those who be once man or woman full of a terrible vehemence and those who have never live upon the earth move slowly and with a subtler malice the dark power cling about we it be say day and night like bat upon a old tree and that we do not hear more of they be merely because the darker kind of magic have be but little practiced i have indeed come across very few person in ireland who try to communicate with evil power and the few i have meet keep they purpose and practice wholly hide from those among whom they live they be mainly small clerk and the like and meet for the purpose of they art in a room hang with black hanging they would not admit I into this room but find I not altogether ignorant of the arcane science show gladly elsewhere what they would do come to we say they leader a clerk in a large flour-mill and we will show you spirit who will talk to you face to face and in shape as solid and heavy as we own -lrb- fn # 4 -rrb- i know better now we have the dark power much more than i thought but not as much as the scottish and yet i think the imagination of the people do dwell chiefly upon the fantastic and capricious i have be talk of the power of communicate in state of trance with the angelical and faery being -- the child of the day and of the twilight -- and he have be contend that we should only believe in what we can see and feel when in we ordinary everyday state of mind yes i say i will come to you or some such word but i will not permit myself to become entranced and will therefore know whether these shape you talk of be any the more to be touch and feel by the ordinary sens than be those i talk of i be not deny the power of other being to take upon themselves a clothing of mortal substance but only that simple invocation such as he speak of seem unlikely to do more than cast the mind into trance and thereby bring it into the presence of the power of day twilight and darkness but he say we have see they move the furniture hither and thither and they go at we bidding and help or harm people who know nothing of they i be not give the exact word but as accurately as i can the substance of we talk on the night arrange i turn up about eight and find the leader sit alone in almost total darkness in a small back room he be dress in a black gown like a inquisitor 's dress in a old drawing that leave nothing of he visible : except he eye which peer out through two small round hole upon the table in front of he be a brass dish of burn herb a large bowl a skull cover with paint symbol two cross dagger and certain implement shape like quern stone which be use to control the elemental power in some fashion i do not discover i also put on a black gown and remember that it do not fit perfectly and that it interfere with my movement considerably the sorcerer then take a black cock out of a basket and cut its throat with one of the dagger let the blood fall into the large bowl he open a book and begin a invocation which be certainly not english and have a deep guttural sound before he have finish another of the sorcerer a man of about twenty-five come in and have put on a black gown also seat himself at my left band i have the invoker directly in front of I and soon begin to find he eye which glitter through the small hole in he hood affect I in a curious way i struggle hard against they influence and my head begin to ache the invocation continue and nothing happen for the first few minute then the invoker get up and extinguish the light in the hall so that no glimmer might come through the slit under the door there be now no light except from the herb on the brass dish and no sound except from the deep guttural murmur of the invocation presently the man at my left sway himself about and cry out o god o god i ask he what ail he but he do not know he have speak a moment after he say he could see a great serpent move about the room and become considerably excited i see nothing with any definite shape but think that black cloud be form about I i feel i must fall into a trance if i do not struggle against it and that the influence which be cause this trance be out of harmony with itself in other word evil after a struggle i get rid of the black cloud and be able to observe with my ordinary sens again the two sorcerer now begin to see black and white column move about the room and finally a man in a monk 's habit and they become greatly puzzle because i do not see these thing also for to they they be as solid as the table before they the invoker appear to be gradually increase in power and i begin to feel as if a tide of darkness be pour from he and concentrate itself about I and now too i notice that the man on my left hand have pass into a death-like trance with a last great effort i drive off the black cloud but feel they to be the only shape i should see without pass into a trance and have no great love for they i ask for light and after the needful exorcism return to the ordinary world i say to the more powerful of the two sorcerer -- what would happen if one of you spirit have overpower I you would go out of this room he answer with he character add to you own i ask about the origin of he sorcery but get little of importance except that he have learn it from he father he would not tell I more for he have it appear take a vow of secrecy for some day i could not get over the feeling of have a number of deform and grotesque figure linger about I the bright power be always beautiful and desirable and the dim power be now beautiful now quaintly grotesque but the dark power express they unbalanced nature in shape of ugliness and horror the devil my old mayo woman tell I one day that something very bad have come down the road and go into the house opposite and though she would not say what it be i know quite well another day she tell I of two friend of hers who have be make love to by one whom they believe to be the devil one of they be stand by the road-side when he come by on horseback and ask she to mount up behind he and go ride when she would not he vanish the other be out on the road late at night wait for she young man when something come flap and roll along the road up to she foot it have the likeness of a newspaper and presently it flap up into she face and she know by the size of it that it be the irish time all of a sudden it change into a young man who ask she to go walk with he she would not and he vanish i know of a old man too on the slope of ben bulben who find the devil ring a bell under he bed and he go off and steal the chapel bell and ring he out it may be that this like the other be not the devil at all but some poor wood spirit whose cloven foot have get he into trouble happy and unhappy theologian i a mayo woman once say to I i know a servant girl who hang herself for the love of god she be lonely for the priest and she society -lrb- fn # 5 -rrb- and hang herself to the banister with a scarf she be no sooner dead than she become white as a lily and if it have be murder or suicide she would have become black as black they give she christian burial and the priest say she be no sooner dead than she be with the lord so nothing matter that you do for the love of god i do not wonder at the pleasure she have in tell this story for she herself love all holy thing with a ardor that bring they quickly to she lip she tell I once that she never hear anything describe in a sermon that she do not afterwards see with she eye she have describe to I the gate of purgatory as they show themselves to she eye but i remember nothing of the description except that she could not see the soul in trouble but only the gate she mind continually dwell on what be pleasant and beautiful one day she ask I what month and what flower be the most beautiful when i answer that i do not know she say the month of may because of the virgin and the lily of the valley because it never sin but come pure out of the rock and then she ask what be the cause of the three cold month of winter i do not know even that and so she say the sin of man and the vengeance of god christ himself be not only bless but perfect in all manly proportion in she eye so much do beauty and holiness go together in she thought he alone of all man be exactly six foot high all other be a little more or a little less -lrb- fn # 5 -rrb- the religious society she have belong to she thought and she sight of the people of faery be pleasant and beautiful too and i have never hear she call they the fall angel they be people like ourselves only better-looking and many and many a time she have go to the window to watch they drive they waggon through the sky waggon behind waggon in long line or to the door to hear they singing and dancing in the forth they sing chiefly it seem a song call the distant waterfall and though they once knock she down she never think badly of they she see they most easily when she be in service in king 's county and one morning a little while ago she say to I last night i be wait up for the master and it be a quarter-past eleven i hear a bang right down on the table ` king 's county all over ' say i and i laugh till i be near dead it be a warning i be stay too long they want the place to themselves i tell she once of somebody who see a faery and faint and she say it could not have be a faery but some bad thing nobody could faint at a faery it be a demon i be not afraid when they near put I and the bed under I out through the roof i be not afraid either when you be at some work and i hear a thing come flop-flop up the stair like a eel and squeal it go to all the door it could not get in where i be i would have send it through the universe like a flash of fire there be a man in my place a tear fellow and he put one of they down he go out to meet it on the road but he must have be tell the word but the faerie be the best neighbor if you do good to they they will do good to you but they do not like you to be on they path another time she say to I they be always good to the poor ii there be however a man in a galway village who can see nothing but wickedness some think he very holy and other think he a little crazed but some of he talk remind one of those old irish vision of the three world which be suppose to have give dante the plan of the divine comedy but i could not imagine this man see paradise he be especially angry with the people of faery and describe the faun - like foot that be so common among they who be indeed child of pan to prove they child of satan he will not grant that they carry away woman though there be many that say so but he be certain that they be as thick as the sand of the sea about we and they tempt poor mortal he say there be a priest i know of be look along the ground like as if he be hunting for something and a voice say to he ` if you want to see they you 'll see enough of they ' and he eye be open and he see the ground thick with they sing they do be sometimes and dancing but all the time they have cloven foot yet he be so scornful of unchristian thing for all they dancing and singing that he think that you have only to bid they begone and they will go it be one night he say after walk back from kinvara and down by the wood beyond i feel one come beside I and i could feel the horse he be ride on and the way he lift he leg but they do not make a sound like the hoof of a horse so i stop and turn around and say very loud ` be off ' and he go and never trouble I after and i know a man who be die and one come on he bed and he cry out to it ` get out of that you unnatural animal ' and it leave he fall angel they be and after the fall god say ` let there be hell ' and there it be in a moment a old woman who be sit by the fire join in as he say this with god save we it be a pity he say the word and there might have be no hell the day but the seer do not notice she word he go on and then he ask the devil what would he take for the soul of all the people and the devil say nothing would satisfy he but the blood of a virgin 's son so he get that and then the gate of hell be open he understand the story it seem as if it be some riddle old folk tale i have see hell myself i have a sight of it one time in a vision it have a very high wall around it all of metal and a archway and a straight walk into it just like what ` ud be lead into a gentleman 's orchard but the edge be not trim with box but with red-hot metal and inside the wall there be cross-walk and i be not sure what there be to the right but to the leave there be five great furnace and they full of soul keep there with great chain so i turn short and go away and in turn i look again at the wall and i could see no end to it and another time i see purgatory it seem to be in a level place and no wall around it but it all one bright blaze and the soul stand in it and they suffer near as much as in hell only there be no devil with they there and they have the hope of heaven and i hear a call to I from there ` help I to come out o ' this ' and when i look it be a man i use to know in the army a irishman and from this county and i believe he to be a descendant of king o'connor of athenry so i stretch out my hand first but then i call out ` i would be burn in the flame before i could get within three yard of you ' so then he say ` well help I with you prayer ' and so i do and father connellan say the same thing to help the dead with you prayer and he be a very clever man to make a sermon and have a great deal of cure make with the holy water he bring back from lourde 1902 the last gleeman michael moran be bear about 1794 off black pitt in the liberty of dublin in faddle alley a fortnight after birth he go stone blind from illness and become thereby a

regina regina pigmeorum venus one night a middle-aged man who have live all he life far from the noise of cab-wheel a young girl a relation of he who be report to be enough of a seer to catch a glimpse of unaccountable light move over the field among the cattle and myself be walk along a far western sandy shore we talk of the forgetful people as the faery people be sometimes call and come in the midst of we talk to a notable haunt of theirs a shallow cave amidst black rock with its reflection under it in the wet sea sand i ask the young girl if she could see anything for i have quite a number of thing to ask the forgetful people she stand still for a few minute and i see that she be pass into a kind of wake trance in which the cold sea breeze no longer trouble she nor the dull boom of the sea distract she attention i then call aloud the name of the great faerie and in a moment or two she say that she could hear music far inside the rock and then a sound of confused talking and of people stamp they foot as if to applaud some unseen performer up to this my other friend have be walk to and fro some yard off but now he pass close to we and as he do so say suddenly that we be go to be interrupt for he hear the laughter of child somewhere beyond the rock we be however quite alone the spirit of the place have begin to cast they influence over he also in a moment he be corroborate by the girl who say that burst of laughter have begin to mingle with the music the confused talking and the noise of foot she next see a bright light streaming out of the cave which seem to have grow much deeper and a quantity of little people -lrb- fn # 6 -rrb- in various color dress red predominate dancing to a tune which she do not recognize -lrb- fn # 6 -rrb- the people and faerie in ireland be sometimes as big as we be sometimes bigger and sometimes as i have be tell about three foot high the old mayo woman i so often quote think that it be something in we eye that make they seem big or little i then bid she call out to the queen of the little people to come and talk with we there be however no answer to she command i therefore repeat the word aloud myself and in a moment a very beautiful tall woman come out of the cave i too have by this time fall into a kind of trance in which what we call the unreal have begin to take upon itself a masterful reality and be able to see the faint gleam of golden ornament the shadowy blossom of dim hair i then bid the girl tell this tall queen to marshal she follower accord to they natural division that we might see they i find as before that i have to repeat the command myself the creature then come out of the cave and draw themselves up if i remember rightly in four band one of these band carry quicken bough in they hand and another have necklace make apparently of serpent ' scale but they dress i can not remember for i be quite absorb in that gleam woman i ask she to tell the seer whether these cave be the greatest faery haunt in the neighborhood she lip move but the answer be inaudible i bade the seer lay she hand upon the breast of the queen and after that she hear every word quite distinctly no this be not the greatest faery haunt for there be a greater one a little further ahead i then ask she whether it be true that she and she people carry away mortal and if so whether they put another soul in the place of the one they have take we change the body be she answer be any of you ever bear into mortal life yes do i know any who be among you people before birth you do who be they it would not be lawful for you to know i then ask whether she and she people be not dramatization of we mood she do not understand say my friend but say that she people be much like human being and do most of the thing human being do i ask she other question as to she nature and she purpose in the universe but only seem to puzzle she at last she appear to lose patience for she write this message for I upon the sand -- the sand of vision not the grating sand under we foot -- be careful and do not seek to know too much about we see that i have offend she i thank she for what she have show and tell and let she depart again into she cave in a little while the young girl awake out of she trance and feel again the cold wind of the world and begin to shiver i tell these thing as accurately as i can and with no theory to blur the history theory be poor thing at the best and the bulk of mine have perish long ago i love better than any theory the sound of the gate of ivory turn upon its hinge and hold that he alone who have pass the rose-strewn threshold can catch the far glimmer of the gate of horn it be perhaps well for we all if we would but raise the cry lilly the astrologer raise in windsor forest regina regina pigmeorum venus and remember with he that god visiteth he child in dream tall glimmer queen come near and let I see again the shadowy blossom of thy dim hair and fair fierce woman one day a woman that i know come face to face with heroic beauty that highest beauty which blake say change least from youth to age a beauty which have be fading out of the art since that decadence we call progress set voluptuous beauty in its place she be stand at the window look over to knocknarea where queen maive be think to be bury when she see as she have tell I the finest woman you ever see travel right across from the mountain and straight to she the woman have a sword by she side and a dagger lift up in she hand and be dress in white with bare arm and foot she look very strong but not wicked that be not cruel the old woman have see the irish giant and though he be a fine man he be nothing to this woman for he be round and could not have step out so soldierly she be like mr ----- a stately lady of the neighborhood but she have no stomach on she and be slight and broad in the shoulder and be handsomer than any one you ever see she look about thirty the old woman cover she eye with she hand and when she uncover they the apparition have vanish the neighbor be wild with she she tell I because she do not wait to find out if there be a message for they be sure it be queen maive who often show herself to the pilot i ask the old woman if she have see other like queen maive and she say some of they have they hair down but they look quite different like the sleepy-looking lady one see in the papers those with they hair up be like this one the other have long white dress but those with they hair up have short dress so that you can see they leg right up to the calf after some careful question i find that they wear what might very well be a kind of buskin she go on they be fine and dashing look like the man one see ride they horse in two and three on the slope of the mountain with they sword swing she repeat over and over there be no such race live now none so finely proportion or the like and then say the present queen -lrb- fn # 7 -rrb- be a nice pleasant - look woman but she be not like she what make I think so little of the lady be that i see none as they be mean as the spirit when i think of she and of the lady now they be like little child run about without know how to put they clothes on right be it the lady why i would not call they woman at all the other day a friend of mine question a old woman in a galway workhouse about queen maive and be tell that queen maive be handsome and overcome all she enemy with a bawl stick for the hazel be bless and the best weapon that can be get you might walk the world with it but she grow very disagreeable in the end -- oh very disagreeable best not to be talk about it best leave it between the book and the hearer my friend think the old woman have get some scandal about fergus son of roy and maive in she head -lrb- fn # 7 -rrb- queen victorium and i myself meet once with a young man in the burren hill who remember a old poet who make he poem in irish and have meet when he be young the young man say one who call herself maive and say she be a queen among they and ask he if he would have money or pleasure he say he would have pleasure and she give he she love for a time and then go from he and ever after he be very mournful the young man have often hear he sing the poem of lamentation that he make but could only remember that it be very mournful and that he call she beauty of all beauty 1902 enchanted wood i last summer whenever i have finish my day 's work i use to go wander in certain roomy wood and there i would often meet a old countryman and talk to he about he work and about the wood and once or twice a friend come with I to whom he would open he heart more readily than to I he have spend all he life lop away the witch elm and the hazel and the privet and the hornbeam from the path and have think much about the natural and supernatural creature of the wood he have hear the hedgehog -- grainne oge he call he -- grunt like a christian and be certain that he steal apple by roll about under a apple tree until there be a apple stick to every quill he be certain too that the cat of whom there be many in the wood have a language of they own -- some kind of old irish he say cat be serpent and they be make into cat at the time of some great change in the world that be why they be hard to kill and why it be dangerous to meddle with they if you annoy a cat it might claw or bite you in a way that would put poison in you and that would be the serpent 's tooth sometimes he think they change into wild cat and then a nail grow on the end of they tail but these wild cat be not the same as the marten cat who have be always in the wood the fox be once tame as the cat be now but they run away and become wild he talk of all wild creature except squirrel -- whom he hate -- with what seem a affectionate interest though at time he eye will twinkle with pleasure as he remember how he make hedgehog unroll themselves when he be a boy by put a wisp of burn straw under they i be not certain that he distinguish between the natural and supernatural very clearly he tell I the other day that fox and cat like above all to be in the forth and liss after nightfall and he will certainly pass from some story about a fox to a story about a spirit with less change of voice than when he be go to speak about a marten cat -- a rare beast now-a-days many year ago he use to work in the garden and once they put he to sleep in a garden-house where there be a loft full of apple and all night he could hear people rattle plate and knife and fork over he head in the loft once at any rate be have see a unearthly sight in the wood he say one time i be out cut timber over in inchy and about eight o'clock one morning when i get there i see a girl pick nut with she hair hang down over she shoulder brown hair and she have a good clean face and she be tall and nothing on she head and she dress no way gaudy but simple and when she feel I come she gather herself up and be go as if the earth have swallow she up and i follow she and look for she but i never could see she again from that day to this never again he use the word clean as we would use word like fresh or comely other too have see spirit in the enchanted wood a labourer tell we of what a friend of he have see in a part of the wood that be call shanwallum from some old village that be before the weed he say one evening i part from lawrence mangan in the yard and he go away through the path in shanwallum a ' bid I goodnight and two hour after there he be back again in the yard a ' bid I light a candle that be in the stable a ' he tell I that when he get into shanwallum a little fellow about as high as he knee but have a head as big as a man 's body come beside he and lead he out of the path a ' round about and at last it bring he to the lime-kiln and then it vanish and leave he a woman tell I of a sight that she and other have see by a certain deep pool in the river she say i come over the stile from the chapel and other along with I and a great blast of wind come and two tree be bent and broken and fall into the river and the splash of water out of it go up to the sky and those that be with I see many figure but myself i only see one sit there by the bank where the tree fall dark clothes he have on and he be headless a man tell I that one day when he be a boy he and another boy go to catch a horse in a certain field full of boulder and bush of hazel and creep juniper and rock-rose that be where the lake side be for a little clear of the wood he say to the boy that be with he i bet a button that if i fling a pebble on to that bush it will stay on it mean that the bush be so mat the pebble would not be able to go through it so he take up a pebble of cow-dung and as soon as it hit the bush there come out of it the most beautiful music that ever be hear they run away and when they have go about two hundred yard they look back and see a woman dress in white walk round and round the bush first it have the form of a woman and then of a man and it be go round the bush ii i often entangle myself in argument more complicated than even those path of inchy as to what be the true nature of apparition but at other time i say as socrate say when they tell he a learn opinion about a nymph of the illissus the common opinion be enough for I i believe when i be in the mood that all nature be full of people whom we can not see and that some of these be ugly or grotesque and some wicked or foolish but very many beautiful beyond any one we have ever see and that these be not far away when we be walk in pleasant and quiet place even when i be a boy i could never walk in a wood without feeling that at any moment i might find before I somebody or something i have long look for without know what i look for and now i will at time explore every little nook of some poor coppice with almost anxious footstep so deep a hold have this imagination upon I you too meet with a like imagination doubtless somewhere wherever you ruling star will have it saturn drive you to the wood or the moon it may be to the edge of the sea i will not of a certainty believe that there be nothing in the sunset where we forefather imagine the dead follow they shepherd the sun or nothing but some vague presence as little move as nothing if beauty be not a gateway out of the net we be take in at we birth it will not long be beauty and we will find it better to sit at home by the fire and fatten a lazy body or to run hither and thither in some foolish sport than to look at the finest show that light and shadow ever make among green leaf i say to myself when i be well out of that thicket of argument that they be surely there the divine people for only we who have neither simplicity nor wisdom have deny they and the simple of all time and the wise man of ancient time have see they and even speak to they they live out they passionate life not far off as i think and we shall be among they when we die if we but keep we nature simple and passionate may it not even be that death shall unite we to all romance and that some day we shall fight dragon among blue hill or come to that whereof all romance be but foreshadowing mingled with the image of man 's misdeed in greater day than these as the old man think in the earthly paradise when they be in good spirit 1902 miraculous creature there be marten cat and badger and fox in the enchanted wood but there be of a certainty mightier creature and the lake hide what neither net nor fine can take these creature be of the race of the white stag that flit in and out of the tale of arthur and of the evil pig that slew diarmuid where ben bulben mix with the sea wind they be the wizard creature of hope and fear they be of they that fly and of they that follow among the thicket that be about the gate of death a man i know remember that he father be one night in the wood of inchy where the lad of gort use to be steal rod he be sit by the wall and the dog beside he and he hear something come run from owbawn weir and he could see nothing but the sound of its foot on the ground be like the sound of the foot of a deer and when it pass he the dog get between he and the wall and scratch at it there as if it be afraid but still he could see nothing but only hear the sound of hoof so when it be pass he turn and come away home another time the man say my father tell I he be in a boat out on the lake with two or three man from gort and one of they have a eel-spear and he thrust it into the water and it hit something and the man faint and they have to carry he out of the boat to land and when he come to himself he say that what he strike be like a calf but whatever it be it be not fish a friend of mine be convince that these terrible creature so common in lake be set there in old time by subtle enchanter to watch over the gate of wisdom he think that if we send we spirit down into the water we would make they of one substance with strange mood of ecstasy and power and go out it may be to the conquest of the world we would however he believe have first to outface and perhaps overthrow strange image full of a more powerful life than if they be really alive it may be that we shall look at they without fear when we have endure the last adventure that be death 1902 aristotle of the book the friend who can get the wood-cutter to talk more readily than he will to anybody else go lately to see he old wife she live in a cottage not far from the edge of the wood and be as full of old talk as she husband this time she begin to talk of goban the legendary mason and he wisdom but say presently aristotle of the book too be very wise and he have a great deal of experience but do not the bee get the better of he in the end he want to know how they pack the comb and he waste the better part of a fortnight watch they and he could not see they do it then he make a hive with a glass cover on it and put it over they and he think to see but when he go and put he eye to the glass they have it all cover with wax so that it be as black as the pot and he be as blind as before he say he be never rightly kilt till then they have he that time surely 1902 the swine of the god a few year ago a friend of mine tell I of something that happen to he when he be a young man and out drilling with some connaught fenian they be but a car-full and drive along a hillside until they come to a quiet place they leave the car and go further up the hill with they rifle and drill for a while as they be come down again they see a very thin long-legged pig of the old irish sort and the pig begin to follow they one of they cry out as a joke that it be a fairy pig and they all begin to run to keep up the joke the pig run too and presently how nobody know this mock terror become real terror and they run as for they life when they get to the car they make the horse gallop as fast as possible but the pig still follow then one of they put up he rifle to fire but when he look along the barrel he could see nothing presently they turn a corner and come to a village they tell the people of the village what have happen and the people of the village take pitchfork and spade and the like and go along the road with they to drive the pig away when they turn the comer they could not find anything 1902 a voice one day i be walk over a bit of marshy ground close to inchy wood when i feel all of a sudden and only for a second a emotion which i say to myself be the root of christian mysticism there have sweep over I a sense of weakness of dependence on a great personal be somewhere far off yet near at hand no thought of mine have prepare I for this emotion for i have be pre-occupied with aengus and edain and with mannanan son of the sea that night i awake lie upon my back and hear a voice speaking above I and say no human soul be like any other human soul and therefore the love of god for any human soul be infinite for no other soul can satisfy the same need in god a few night after this i awake to see the loveliest people i have ever see a young man and a young girl dress in olive-green raiment cut like old greek raiment be stand at my bedside i look at the girl and notice that she dress be gather about she neck into a kind of chain or perhaps into some kind of stiff embroidery which represent ivy-leaf but what fill I with wonder be the miraculous mildness of she face there be no such face now it be beautiful as few face be beautiful but it have neither one would think the light that be in desire or in hope or in fear or in speculation it be peaceful like the face of animal or like mountain pool at evening so peaceful that it be a little sad i think for a moment that she might be the beloved of aengus but how could that hunt alluring happy immortal wretch have a face like this doubtless she be from among the child of the moon but who among they i shall never know 1902 kidnapper a little north of the town of sligo on the southern side of ben bulben some hundred of foot above the plain be a small white square in the limestone no mortal have ever touch it with he hand no sheep or goat have ever browse grass beside it there be no more inaccessible place upon the earth and few more encircle by awe to the deep consider it be the door of faery-land in the middle of night it swing open and the unearthly troop rush out all night the gay rabble sweep to and fro across the land invisible to all unless perhaps where in some more than commonly gentle place -- drumcliff or drum-a-hair -- the nightcapped head of faery-doctor may be thrust from they door to see what mischief the gentry be do to they trained eye and ear the field be cover by red-hatted rider and the air be full of shrill voice -- a sound like whistle as a ancient scottish seer have record and wholly different from the talk of the angel who speak much in the throat like the irish as lilly the astrologer have wisely say if there be a new-born baby or new-wed bride in the neighborhood the nightcapped doctor will peer with more than common care for the unearthly troop do not always return empty-handed sometimes a new-wed bride or a new-born baby go with they into they mountain the door swing to behind and the new-born or the new-wed move henceforth in the bloodless land of faery happy enough but doomed to melt out at the last judgment like bright vapor for the soul can not live without sorrow through this door of white stone and the other door of that land where geabheadh tu a sonas aer pighin -lrb- you can buy joy for a penny -rrb- have go king queen and prince but so greatly have the power of faery dwindle that there be none but peasant in these sad chronicle of mine somewhere about the beginning of last century appear at the western corner of market street sligo where the butcher 's shop now be not a palace as in keat 's lamium but a apothecary 's shop rule over by a certain unaccountable dr opendon where he come from none ever know there also be in sligo in those day a woman ormsby by name whose husband have fall mysteriously sick the doctor could make nothing of he nothing seem wrong with he yet weaker and weaker he grow away go the wife to dr opendon she be show into the shop parlor a black cat be sit straight up before the fire she have just time to see that the side-board be cover with fruit and to say to herself fruit must be wholesome when the doctor have so much before dr opendon come in he be dress all in black the same as the cat and he wife walk behind he dress in black likewise she give he a guinea and get a little bottle in return she husband recover that time meanwhile the black doctor cure many people but one day a rich patient die and cat wife and doctor all vanish the night after in a year the man ormsby fall sick once more now he be a goodlooking man and he wife feel sure the gentry be covet he she go and call on the faery-doctor at cairnsfoot as soon as he have hear she tale he go behind the back door and begin mutter mutter muttering-making spell she husband get well this time also but after a while he sicken again the fatal third time and away go she once more to cairnsfoot and out go the faery-doctor behind he back door and begin mutter but soon he come in and tell she it be no use -- she husband would die and sure enough the man die and ever after when she speak of he mr ormsby shake she head say she know well where he be and it be not in heaven or hell or purgatory either she probably believe that a log of wood be leave behind in he place but so bewitch that it seem the dead body of she husband she be dead now herself but many still live remember she she be i believe for a time a servant or else a kind of pensioner of some relation of my own sometimes those who be carry off be allow after many year -- seven usually -- a final glimpse of they friend many year ago a woman vanish suddenly from a sligo garden where she be walk with she husband when she son who be then a baby have grow up he receive word in some way not hand down that he mother be glamour by faerie and imprison for the time in a house in glasgow and longing to see he glasgow in those day of sailing-ship seem to the peasant mind almost over the edge of the known world yet he be a dutiful son start away for a long time he walk the street of glasgow at last down in a cellar he see he mother work she be happy she say and have the best of good eating and would he not eat and therewith lay all kind of food on the table but he know well that she be try to cast on he the glamour by give he faery food that she might keep he with she refuse and come home to he people in sligo some five mile southward of sligo be a gloomy and tree-bordered pond a great gathering-place of water-fowl call because of its form the heart lake it be haunt by stranger thing than heron snipe or wild duck out of this lake as from the white square stone in ben bulben issue a unearthly troop once man begin to drain it suddenly one of they raise a cry that he see he house in flame they turn round and every man there see he own cottage burn they hurry home to find it be but faery glamour to this hour on the border of the lake be show a half-dug trench -- the signet of they impiety a little way from this lake i hear a beautiful and mournful history of faery kidnapping i hear it from a little old woman in a white cap who sing to herself in gaelic and move from one foot to the other as though she remember the dancing of she youth a young man go at nightfall to the house of he just marry bride meet in the way a jolly company and with they he bride they be faerie and have steal she as a wife for the chief of they band to he they seem only a company of merry mortal he bride when she see she old love bid he welcome but be most fearful lest be should eat the faery food and so be glamour out of the earth into that bloodless dim nation wherefore she set he down to play card with three of the cavalcade and he play on realize nothing until he see the chief of the band carry he bride away in he arm immediately he start up and know that they be faerie for slowly all that jolly company melt into shadow and night he hurry to the house of he beloved as he draw near come to he the cry of the keener she have die

not the kirwan but they predecessor at castle hacket the hacket themselves i think who be descend from a man and a spirit and be notable for beauty i imagine that the mother of lord cloncurry be

live a poor widow with one cow and its calf the cow fall into the river and be wash away there be a man thereabout who go to a red-haired woman -- for such be suppose to be wise in these thing -- and she tell he to take the calf down to the edge of the river and hide himself and watch he do as she have tell he and as evening come on the calf begin to low and after a while the cow come along the edge of the river and commence suckle it then as he have be tell he catch the cow 's tail away they go at a great pace across hedge and ditch till they come to a royalty -lrb- a name for the little

steal away in she youth after seven year she be bring home again for some reason or other but she have no toe leave she have dance they off many near the white stone door in ben bulben have be steal away it be far easier to be sensible in city than in many country place i could tell you of when one walk on those gray road at evening by the scented elder-bush of the white cottage watch the faint mountain gather the cloud upon they head one all too readily discover beyond the thin cobweb veil of the sens those creature the goblin hurry from the white square stone door to the north or from the heart lake in the south the untiring one it be one of the great trouble of life that we can not have any unmixed emotion there be always something in we enemy that we like and something in we sweetheart that we dislike it be this entanglement of mood which make we old and pucker we brow and deepen the furrow about we eye if we could love and hate with as good heart as the faerie do we might grow to be long-lived like they but until that day they untiring joy and sorrow must ever be one - half of they fascination love with they never grow weary nor can the circle of the star tire out they dancing foot the donegal peasant remember this when they bend over the spade or sit full of the heaviness of the field beside the griddle at nightfall and they tell story about it that it may not be forget a short while ago they say two faerie little creature one like a young man one like a young woman come to a farmer 's house and spend the night sweep the hearth and set all tidy the next night they come again and while the farmer be away bring all the furniture up-stair into one room and have arrange it round the wall for the greater grandeur it seem they begin to dance they dance on and on and day and day go by and all the country-side come to look at they but still they foot never tire the farmer do not dare to live at home the while and after three month he make up he mind to stand it no more and go and tell they that the priest be come the little creature when they hear this go back to they own country and there they joy shall last as long as the point of the rush be brown the people say and that be until god shall burn up the world with a kiss but it be not merely faerie who know untiring day for there have be man and woman who fall under they enchantment have attain perhaps by the right of they god-given spirit a even more than faery abundance of life and feeling it seem that when mortal have go amid those poor happy leaf of the imperishable rose of beauty blow hither and thither by the wind that awaken the star the dim kingdom have acknowledge they birthright perhaps a little sadly and give they of its best such a mortal be bear long ago at a village in the south of ireland she lay asleep in a cradle and she mother sit by rock she when a woman of the sidhe -lrb- the faerie -rrb- come in and say that the child be choose to be the bride of the prince of the dim kingdom but that as it would never do for he wife to grow old and die while he be still in the first ardor of he love she would be gifted with a faery life the mother be to take the glowing log out of the fire and bury it in the garden and she child would live as long as it remain unconsumed the mother bury the log and the child grow up become a beauty and marry the prince of the faerie who come to she at nightfall after seven hundred year the prince die and another prince rule in he stead and marry the beautiful peasant girl in he turn and after another seven hundred year he die also and another prince and another husband come in he stead and so on until she have have seven husband at last one day the priest of the parish call upon she and tell she that she be a scandal to the whole neighborhood with she seven husband and she long life she be very sorry she say but she be not to blame and then she tell he about the log and he go straight out and dig until he find it and then they burn it and she die and be bury like a christian and everybody be pleased such a mortal too be clooth-na-bare -lrb- fn # 9 -rrb- who go all over the world seek a lake deep enough to drown she faery life of which she have grow weary leap from hill to lake and lake to hill and set up a cairn of stone wherever she foot light until at last she find the deepest water in the world in little lough ia on the top of the bird ' mountain at sligo -lrb- fn # 9 -rrb- doubtless clooth-na-bare should be cailleac bare which would mean the old woman bare bare or bere or verah or dera or dhera be a very famous person perhaps the mother of the god herself a friend of mine find she as he think frequent lough leath or the gray lake on a mountain of the few perhaps lough ia be my mishearing or the storyteller 's mispronunciation of lough leath for there be many lough leath the two little creature may well dance on and the woman of the log and clooth-na-bare sleep in peace for they have know untrammelled hate and unmixed love and have never wearied themselves with yes and no or entangled they foot with the sorry net of maybe and perhaps the great wind come and take they up into themselves earth fire and water some french writer that i read when i be a boy say that the desert go into the heart of the jew in they wanderings and make they what they be i can not remember by what argument he prove they to be even yet the indestructible child of earth but it may well be that the element have they child if we know the fire worshipper better we might find that they century of pious observance have be reward and that the fire have give they a little of its nature and i be certain that the water the water of the sea and of lake and of mist and rain have all but make the irish after its image image form themselves in we mind perpetually as if they be reflect in some pool we give ourselves up in old time to mythology and see the god everywhere we talk to they face to face and the story of that communion be so many that i think they outnumber all the like story of all the rest of europe even to-day we country people speak with the dead and with some who perhaps have never die as we understand death and even we educate people pass without great difficulty into the condition of quiet that be the condition of vision we can make we mind so like still water that being gather about we that they may see it may be they own image and so live for a moment with a clearer perhaps even with a fiercer life because of we quiet do not the wise porphyry think that all soul come to be bear because of water and that even the generation of image in the mind be from water 1902 the old town i fall one night some fifteen year ago into what seem the power of faery i have go with a young man and he sister -- friend and relation of my own -- to pick story out of a old countryman and we be come home talk over what he have tell we it be dark and we imagination be excite by he story of apparition and this may have bring we unknown to we to the threshold between sleep and wake where sphinx and chimaera sit open-eyed and where there be always murmuring and whispering i can not think that what we see be a imagination of the wake mind we have come under some tree that make the road very dark when the girl see a bright light move slowly across the road she brother and myself see nothing and do not see anything until we have walk for about half-an-hour along the edge of the river and down a narrow lane to some field where there be a ruin church cover with ivy and the foundation of what be call the old town which have be burn down it be say in cromwell 's day we have stand for some few minute so far as i can recollect look over the field full of stone and bramble and elder-bush when i see a small bright light on the horizon as it seem mount up slowly towards the sky then we see other faint light for a minute or two and at last a bright flame like the flame of a torch move rapidly over the river we see it all in such a dream and it seem all so unreal that i have never write of it until now and hardly ever speak of it and even when think because of some unreasoning impulse i have avoid give it weight in the argument perhaps i have feel that my recollection of thing see when the sense of reality be weaken must be untrustworthy a few month ago however i talk it over with my two friend and compare they somewhat meager recollection with my own that sense of unreality be all the more wonderful because the next day i hear sound as unaccountable as be those light and without any emotion of unreality and i remember they with perfect distinctness and confidence the girl be sit reading under a large old-fashioned mirror and i be read and write a couple of yard away when i hear a sound as if a shower of pea have be throw against the mirror and while i be look at it i hear the sound again and presently while i be alone in the room i hear a sound as if something much bigger than a pea have strike the wainscote beside my head and after that for some day come other sight and sound not to I but to the girl she brother and the servant now it be a bright light now it be letter of fire that vanish before they could be read now it be a heavy foot move about in the seemingly empty house one wonder whether creature who live the country people believe wherever man and woman have live in earlier time follow we from the ruin of the old town or do they come from the bank of the river by the tree where the first light have shine for a moment 1902 the man and he boot there be a doubter in donegal and he would not hear of ghost or sheogue and there be a house in donegal that have be haunt as long as man could remember and this be the story of how the house get the better of the man the man come into the house and light a fire in the room under the haunt one and take off he boot and set they on the hearth and stretch out he foot and warm he self for a time he prosper in he unbelief but a little while after the night have fall and everything have get very dark one of he boot begin to move it get up off the floor and give a kind of slow jump towards the door and then the other boot do the same and after that the first boot jump again and thereupon it strike the man that a invisible being have get into he boot and be now go away in they when the boot reach the door they go up-stair slowly and then the man hear they go tramp tramp round the haunted room over he head a few minute pass and he could hear they again upon the stair and after that in the passage outside and then one of they come in at the door and the other give a jump past it and come in too they jump along towards he and then one get up and hit he and afterwards the other hit he and then again the first hit he and so on until they drive he out of the room and finally out of the house in this way he be kick out by he own boot and donegal be avenge upon its doubter it be not record whether the invisible being be a ghost or one of the sidhe but the fantastic nature of the vengeance be like the work of the sidhe who live in the heart of fantasy a coward one day i be at the house of my friend the strong farmer who live beyond ben bulben and cope 's mountain and meet there a young lad who seem to be dislike by the two daughter i ask why they dislike he and be tell he be a coward this interested I for some whom robust child of nature take to be coward be but man and woman with a nervous system too finely make for they life and work i look at the lad but no that pink-and-white face and strong body have nothing of undue sensibility after a little he tell I he story he have live a wild and reckless life until one day two year before he be come home late at night and suddenly fall himself sink in as it be upon the ghostly world for a moment he see the face of a dead brother rise up before he and then he turn and run he do not stop till he come to a cottage nearly a mile down the road he fling himself against the door with so much of violence that he break the thick wooden bolt and fall upon the floor from that day he give up he wild life but be a hopeless coward nothing could ever bring he to look either by day or night upon the spot where he have see the face and he often go two mile round to avoid it nor could he say the prettiest girl in the country persuade he to see she home after a party if he be alone he fear everything for he have look at the face no man can see unchanged-the imponderable face of a spirit the three o'byrne and the evil faerie in the dim kingdom there be a great abundance of all excellent thing there be more love there than upon the earth there be more dancing there than upon the earth and there be more treasure there than upon the earth in the begin the earth be perhaps make to fulfil the desire of man but now it have get old and fall into decay what wonder if we try and pilfer the treasure of that other kingdom a friend be once at a village near sleive league one day he be stray about a rath call cashel nore a man with a haggard face and unkempt hair and clothes fall in piece come into the rath and begin digging my friend turn to a peasant who be work near and ask who the man be that be the third o'byrne be the answer a few day after he learn this story : a great quantity of treasure have be bury in the rath in pagan time and a number of evil faerie set to guard it but some day it be to be find and belong to the family of the o'byrnes before that day three o'byrne must find it and die two have already do so the first have dig and dig until at last he have get a glimpse of the stone coffin that contain it but immediately a thing like a huge hairy dog come down the mountain and tear he to piece the next morning the treasure have again vanish deep into the earth the second o'byrne come and dig and dig until he find the coffer and lift the lid and see the gold shine within he see some horrible sight the next moment and go rave mad and soon die the treasure again sink out of sight the third o'byrne be now digging he believe that he will die in some terrible way the moment he find the treasure but that the spell will be break and the o'byrne family make rich for ever as they be of old a peasant of the neighborhood once see the treasure he find the shin-bone of a hare lie on the grass he take it up there be a hole in it he look through the hole and see the gold heap up under the ground he hurry home to bring a spade but when he get to the rath again he could not find the spot where he have see it drumcliff and ross drumcliff and ross be be and ever shall be please heaven place of unearthly resort i have live near by they and in they time after time and have gather thus many a crumb of faery lore drumcliff be a wide green valley lie at the foot of ben bulben the mountain in whose side the square white door swing open at nightfall to loose the faery rider on the world the great st columba himself the builder of many of the old ruin in the valley climb the mountain on one notable day to get near heaven with he prayer ross be a little sea-dividing sandy plain cover with short grass like a green tablecloth and lie in the foam midway between the round cairn-headed knocknarea and ben bulben famous for hawk : but for benbulben and knocknarea many a poor sailor would be cast away as the rhyme go at the northern corner of ross be a little promontory of sand and rock and grass : a mournful haunted place no wise peasant would fall asleep under its low cliff for he who sleep here may wake silly the good people have carry off he soul there be no more ready shortcut to the dim kingdom than this plovery headland for cover and smother now from sight by mound of sand a long cave go thither full of gold and silver and the most beautiful parlor and drawing-room once before the sand cover it a dog stray in and be hear yelp helplessly deep underground in a fort far inland these fort or rath make before modern history have begin cover all ross and all columkille the one where the dog yelp have like most other a underground beehive chamber in the midst once when i be poke about there a unusually intelligent and reading peasant who have come with I and wait outside kneel down by the opening and whisper in a timid voice be you all right sir i have be some little while underground and he fear i have be carry off like the dog no wonder he be afraid for the fort have long be circle by ill - bode rumor it be on the ridge of a small hill on whose northern slope lie a few stray cottage one night a farmer 's young son come from one of they and see the fort all flaming and run towards it but the glamour fall on he and he spring on to a fence cross-leg and commence beat it with a stick for he imagine the fence be a horse and that all night long he go on the most wonderful ride through the country in the morning he be still beat he fence and they carry he home where he remain a simpleton for three year before he come to himself again a little later a farmer try to level the fort he cow and horse die and a manner of trouble overtake he and finally he himself be lead home and leave useless with he head on he knee by the fire to the day of he death a few hundred yard southwards of the northern angle of ross be another angle have also its cave though this one be not cover with sand about twenty year ago a brig be wreck near by and three or four fisherman be put to watch the desert hulk through the darkness at midnight they see sit on a stone at the cave 's mouth two red-capped fiddler fiddle with all they might the man flee a great crowd of villager rush down to the cave to see the fiddler but the creature have go to the wise peasant the green hill and wood round he be full of never-fading mystery when the aged countrywoman stand at she door in the evening and in she own word look at the mountain and think of the goodness of god god be all the nearer because the pagan power be not far : because northward in ben bulben famous for hawk the white square door swing open at sundown and those wild unchristian rider rush forth upon the field while southward the white lady who be doubtless maive herself wander under the broad cloud nightcap of knocknarea how may she doubt these thing

before a prosperous fishing season a herring-barrel appear in the midst of a storm-cloud and at a place call columkille 's strand a place of marsh and mire a ancient boat with st columba himself come float in from sea on a moonlight night : a portent of a brave harvest they have they dread portent too some few season ago a fisherman see far on the horizon renowned hy brazel where he who touch shall find no more labor or care nor cynic laughter but shall go walk about under shadiest boscage and enjoy the conversation of cuchullin and he hero a vision of hy brazel forebode national trouble drumcliff and ross be chokeful of ghost by bog road rath hillside sea-border they gather in all shape : headless woman man in armor shadow hare fire-tongued hound whistle seal and so on a whistle seal sink a ship the other day at drumcliff there be a very ancient graveyard the annals of the four master have this verse about a soldier name denadhach who die in 871 : a pious soldier of the race of con lie under hazel cross at drumcliff not very long ago a old woman turn to go into the churchyard at night to pray saw standing before she a man in armor who ask she where she be go it be the pious soldier of the race of con say local wisdom still keep watch with he ancient piety over the graveyard again the custom be still common hereabouts of sprinkle the doorstep with the blood of a chicken on the death of a very young child thus -lrb- as belief be -rrb- draw into the blood the evil spirit from the too weak soul blood be a great gatherer of evil spirit to cut you hand on a stone on go into a fort be say to be very dangerous there be no more curious ghost in drumcliff or ross than the snipe - ghost there be a bush behind a house in a village that i know well : for excellent reason i do not say whether in drumcliff or ross or on the slope of ben bulben or even on the plain round knocknarea there be a history concern the house and the bush a man once live there who find on the quay of sligo a package contain three hundred pound in note it be drop by a foreign sea captain this my man know but say nothing it be money for freight and the sea captain not daring to face he owner commit suicide in mid-ocean shortly afterwards my man die he soul could not rest at any rate strange sound be hear round he house though that have grow and prosper since the freight money the wife be often see by those still alive out in the garden pray at the bush i have speak of for the shade of the dead man appear there at time the bush remain to this day : once portion of a hedge it now stand by itself for no one dare put spade or pruning-knife about it as to the strange sound and voice they do not cease till a few year ago when during some repair a snipe fly out of the solid plaster and away the troubled ghost say the neighbor of the note-finder be at last dislodged my forebear and relation have live near ross and drumcliff these many year a few mile northward i be wholly a stranger and can find nothing when i ask for story of the faerie my answer be some such as be give I by a woman who live near a white stone fort -- one of the few stone one in ireland -- under the seaward angle of ben bulben : they always mind they own affair and i always mind mine : for it be dangerous to talk of the creature only friendship for yourself or knowledge of you forebear will loosen these cautious tongue my friend the sweet harp-string -lrb- i give no more than he irish name for fear of gauger -rrb- have the science of unpack the stubbornest heart but then he supply the potheen-maker with grain from he own field besides he be descend from a note gaelic magician who raise the dhoul in great eliza 's century and he have a kind of prescriptive right to hear tell of all kind of other-world creature they be almost relation of he if all people say concern the parentage of magician be true the thick skull of the fortunate i once a number of icelandic peasantry find a very thick skull in the cemetery where the poet egil be bury its great thickness make they feel certain it be the skull of a great man doubtless of egil himself to be doubly sure they put it on a wall and hit it hard blow with a hammer it get white where the blow fall but do not break and they be convince that it be in truth the skull of the poet and worthy of every honor in ireland we have much kinship with the icelander or dane as we call they and all other dweller in the scandinavian country in some of we mountainous and barren place and in we seaboard village we still test each other in much the same way the icelander test the head of egil we may have acquire the custom from those ancient danish pirate whose descendant the people of ross tell I still remember every field and hillock in ireland which once belong to they forebear and be able to describe ross itself as well as any native there be one seaboard district know as roughley where the man be never know to shave or trim they wild red beard and where there be a fight ever on foot i have see they at a boat-race fall foul of each other and after much loud gaelic strike each other with oar the first boat have go aground and by dint of hit out with the long oar keep the second boat from pass only to give the victory to the third one day the sligo people say a man from roughley be try in sligo for break a skull in a row and make the defense not unknown in ireland that some head be so thin you can not be responsible for they have turn with a look of passionate contempt towards the solicitor who be prosecute and cry that little fellow 's skull if ye be to hit it would go like a egg-shell he beam upon the judge and say in a wheedling voice but a man might wallop away at you lordship 's for a fortnight ii i write all this year ago out of what be even then old memory i be in roughley the other day and find it much like other desolate place i may have be think of moughorow a much wilder place for the memory of one 's childhood be brittle thing to lean upon 1902 the religion of a sailor a sea captain when he stand upon the bridge or look out from he deck-house think much about god and about the world away in the valley yonder among the corn and the poppy man may well forget all thing except the warmth of the sun upon the face and the kind shadow under the hedge but he who journey through storm and darkness must need think and think one July a couple of year ago i take my supper with a captain moran on board the ss margaret that have put into a western river from i know not where i find he a man of many notion all flavor with he personality as be the way with sailor he talk in he queer sea manner of god and the world and up through all he word break the hard energy of he call sur say he do you ever hear tell of the sea captain 's prayer no say i what be it it be he reply ' o lord give I a stiff upper lip ' and what do that mean it mean he say that when they come to I some night and wake I up and say ` captain we be go down ' that i will not make a fool o ' meself why sur we war in mid atlantic and i standin ' on the bridge when the third mate come up to I look mortial bad say he ` captain all be up with we ' say i ` do not you know when you join that a certain percentage go down every year ' ` yes sur ' say he and say i ` ar not you pay to go down ' ` yes sur ' say he and say i ` then go down like a man and be damned to you ' concern the nearness together of heaven earth and purgatory in ireland this world and the world we go to after death be not far apart i have hear of a ghost that be many year in a tree and many year in the archway of a bridge and my old mayo woman say there be a bush up at my own place and the people do be say that there be two soul do they penance under it when the wind blow one way the one have shelter and when it blow from the north the other have the shelter it be twist over with the way they be root under it for shelter i do not believe it but there be many a one would not pass by it at night indeed there be time when the world be so near together that it seem as if we earthly chattel be no more than the shadow of thing beyond a lady i know once see a village child run about with a long trail petticoat upon she and ask the creature why she do not have it cut short it be my grandmother 's say the child would you have she go about yonder with she petticoat up to she knee and she dead but four day i have read a story of a woman whose ghost haunt she people because they have make she grave-clothes so short that the fire of purgatory burn she knee the peasantry expect to have beyond the grave house much like they earthly home only there the thatch will never grow leaky nor the white wall lose they lustre nor shall the dairy be at any time empty of good milk and butter but now and then a landlord or a agent or a gauger will go by beg he bread to show how god divide the righteous from the unrighteous 1892 and 1902 the eater of precious stone sometimes when i have be shut off from common interest and have for a little forget to be restless i get wake dream now faint and shadow-like now vivid and solid-looking like the material world under my foot whether they be faint or vivid they be ever beyond the power of my will to alter in any way they have they own will and sweep hither and thither and change accord to its command one day i see faintly a immense pit of blackness round which go a circular parapet and on this parapet sit innumerable ape eat precious stone out of the palm of they hand the stone glitter green and crimson and the ape devour they with a insatiable hunger i know that i see the celtic hell and my own hell the hell of the artist and that all who seek after beautiful and wonderful thing with too avid a thirst lose peace and form and become shapeless and common i have see into other people 's hell also and see in one a infernal peter who have a black face and white lip and who weigh on a curious double scale not only the evil deed commit but the good deed leave undo of certain invisible shades i could see the scale go up and down but i could not see the shades who be i know crowd about he i see on another occasion a quantity of demon of all kind of shape -- fish-like serpent-like ape-like and dog-like -- sit about a black pit such as that in my own hell and look at a moon -- like reflection of the heaven which shine up from the depths of the pit we lady of the hill when we be child we do not say at such a distance from the post - office or so far from the butcher 's or the grocer 's but measure thing by the cover well in the wood or by the burrow of the fox in the hill we belong then to god and to he work and to thing come down from the ancient day we would not have be greatly surprise have we meet the shine foot of a angel among the white mushroom upon the mountain for we know in those day immense despair unfathomed love -- every eternal mood -- but now the draw-net be about we foot a few mile eastward of lough gill a young protestant girl who be both pretty herself and prettily dress in blue and white wander up among those mountain mushroom and i have a letter of hers tell how she meet a troop of child and become a portion of they dream when they first see she they throw themselves face down in a bed of rush as if in a great fear but after a little other child come about they and they get up and follow she almost bravely she notice they fear and presently stand still and hold out she arm a little girl throw herself into they with the cry ah you be the virgin out o ' the picture no say another come near also she be a sky faery for she have the color of the sky no say a third she be the faery out of the foxglove grow big the other child however would have it that she be indeed the virgin for she wear the virgin 's color she good protestant heart be greatly troubled and she get the child to sit down about she and try to explain who she be but they would have none of she explanation find explanation of no avail she ask have they ever hear of christ yes say one but we do not like he for he would kill we if it be not for the virgin tell he to be good to I whisper another into she ear we would not let I near he for dad say i be a divil burst out a third she talk to they a long time about christ and the apostle but be finally interrupt by a elderly woman with a stick who take she to be some adventurous hunter for convert drive the child away despite they explanation that here be the great queen of heaven come to walk upon the mountain and be kind to they when the child have go she go on she way and have walk about half-a-mile when the child who be call a divil jump down from the high ditch by the lane and say she would believe she a ordinary lady if she have two skirt for lady always have two skirt the two skirt be show and the child go away crestfallen but a few minute later jump down again from the ditch and cry angrily dad 's a divil mum 's a divil and i be a divil and you be only a ordinary lady and have fling a handful of mud and pebble run away sob when my pretty protestant have come to she own home she find that she have drop the tassel of she parasol a year later she be by chance upon the mountain but wear now a plain black dress and meet the child who have first call she the virgin out o ' the picture and see the tassel hang about the child 's neck and say i be the lady you meet last year who tell you about christ no you be not no you be not no you be not be the passionate reply and after all it be not my pretty protestant but mary star of the sea still walk in sadness and in beauty upon many a mountain and by many a shore who cast those tassel at the foot of the child it be indeed fitting that man pray to she who be the mother of peace the mother of dream and the mother of purity to leave they yet a little hour to do good and evil in and to watch old time tell the rosary of the star the golden age a while ago i be in the train and get near sligo the last time i have be there something be troubling I and i have long for a message from those being or bodiless mood or whatever they be who inhabit the world of spirit the message come for one night i see with blinding distinctness a black animal half weasel half dog move along the top of a stone wall and presently the black animal vanish and from the other side come a white weasel-like dog he pink flesh shine through he white hair and all in a blaze of light and i remember a pleasant belief about two faery dog who go about represent day and night good and evil and be comfort by the excellent omen but now i long for a message of another kind and chance if chance there be bring it for a man get into the carriage and begin to play on a fiddle make apparently of a old blacking-box and though i be quite unmusical the sound fill I with the strangest emotion i seem to hear a voice of lamentation out of the golden age it tell I that we be imperfect incomplete and no more like a beautiful weave web but like a bundle of cord knot together and fling into a comer it say that the world be once all perfect and kindly and that still the kindly and perfect world exist but bury like a mass of rose under many spadeful of earth the faerie and the more innocent of the spirit dwelt within it and lament over we fallen world in the lamentation of the wind-tossed reed in the song of the bird in the moan of the wave and in the sweet cry of the fiddle it say that with we the beautiful be not clever and the clever be not beautiful and that the best of we moment be mar by a little vulgarity or by a pin-prick out of sad recollection and that the fiddle must ever lament about it all it say that if only they who live in the golden age could die we might be happy for the sad voice would be still but alas alas they must sing and we must weep until the eternal gate swing open we be now get into the big glass-roofed terminus and the fiddler put away he old blacking-box and hold out he hat for a copper and then open the door and be go a remonstrance with scotsman for have sour the disposition of they ghost and faerie not only in ireland be faery belief still extant it be only the other day i hear of a scottish farmer who believe that the lake in front of he house be haunt by a water-horse he be afraid of it and drag the lake with net and then try to pump it empty it would have be a bad thing for the water-horse have he find he a irish peasant would have long since come to term with the creature for in ireland there be something of timid affection between man and spirit they only ill-treat each other in reason each admit the other side to have feeling there be point beyond which neither will go no irish peasant would treat a capture faery as do the man campbell tell of he catch a kelpie and tie she behind he on he horse she be fierce but he keep she quiet by drive a awl and a needle into she they come to a river and she grow very restless fear to cross the water again he drive the awl and needle into she she cry out pierce I with the awl but keep that slender hair - like slave -lrb- the needle -rrb- out of I they come to a inn he turn the light of a lantern on she immediately she drop down like a fall star and change into a lump of jelly she be dead nor would they treat the faerie as one be treat in a old highland poem a faery love a little child who use to cut turf at the side of a faery hill every day the faery put out he hand from the hill with a enchanted knife the child use to cut the turf with the knife it do not take long the knife be charm she brother wonder why she be do so quickly at last they resolve to watch and find out who help she they see the small hand come out of the earth and the little child take from it the knife when the turf be all cut they see she make three tap on the ground with the handle the small hand come out of the hill snatch the knife from the child they cut the hand off with a blow the faery be never again see he draw he bleeding arm into the earth thinking as it be record he have lose he hand through the treachery of the child in scotland you be too theological too gloomy you have make even the devil religious where do you live good-wyf and how be the minister he say to the witch when he meet she on the high-road as it come out in the trial you have burn all the witch in ireland we have leave they alone to be sure the loyal minority knock out the eye of one with a cabbage-stump on the 31st of march 1711 in the town of carrickfergus but then the loyal minority be half scottish you have discover the faerie to be pagan and wicked you would like to have they all up before the magistrate in ireland warlike mortal have go amongst they and help they in they battle and they in turn have teach man great skill with herb and permit some few to hear they tune carolan sleep upon a faery rath ever after they tune run in he head and make he the great musician he be in scotland you have denounce they from the pulpit in ireland they have be permit by the priest to consult they on the state of they soul unhappily the priest have decide that they have no soul that they will dry up like so much bright vapor at the last day but more in sadness than in anger they have say it the catholic religion like to keep on good term with its neighbor these two different way of look at thing have influence in each country the whole world of sprite and goblin for they gay and graceful doings you must go to ireland for they deed of terror to scotland we irish faery terror have about they something of make - believe when a peasant stray into a enchanted hovel and be make to turn a corpse all night on a spit before the fire we do not feel anxious we know he will wake in the midst of a green field the dew on he old coat in scotland it be altogether different you have sour the naturally excellent disposition of ghost and goblin the piper m ` crimmon of the hebride shoulder he pipe and march into a sea cavern play loudly and follow by he dog for a long time the people could hear the pipe he must have go nearly a mile when they hear the sound of a struggle then the piping cease suddenly some time go by and then he dog come out of the cavern completely flay too weak even to howl nothing else ever come out of the cavern then there be the tale of the man who dive into a lake where treasure be think to be he see a great coffer of iron close to the coffer lay a monster who warn he to return whence he come he rise to the surface but the bystander when they hear he have see the treasure persuade he to dive again he dive in a little while he heart and liver float up redden the water no man ever see the rest of he body these water-goblin and water-monster be common in scottish folk - lore we have they too but take they much less dreadfully we tale turn all they doings to favor and to prettiness or hopelessly humorize the creature a hole in the sligo river be haunt by one of these monster he be ardently believe in by many but that do not prevent the peasantry playing with the subject and surround it with conscious fantasy when i be a small boy i fish one day for conger in the monster hole return home a great eel on my shoulder he head flap down in front he tail sweep the ground behind i meet a fisherman of my acquaintance i begin a tale of a immense conger three time larger than the one i carry that have break my line and escape that be he say the fisherman do you ever hear how he make my brother emigrate my brother be a diver you know and grub stone for the harbor board one day the beast come up to he and say ` what be you after ' ` stone sur ' say he ` do not you think you have better be go ' ` yes sur ' say he and that be why my brother emigrate the people say it be because he get poor but that be not true you -- you will make no term with the spirit of fire and earth and air and water you have make the darkness you enemy we -- we exchange civility with the world beyond war when there be a rumor of war with france a while ago i meet a poor sligo woman a soldier 's widow that i know and i read she a sentence out of a letter i have just have from london : the people here be mad for war but france seem incline to take thing peacefully or some like sentence she mind run a good deal on war which she imagine partly from what she have hear from soldier and partly from tradition of the rebellion of '98 but the word london double she interest for she know there be a great many people in london and she herself have once live in a congested district there be too many over one another in london they be get tired of the world it be kill they want to be it will be no matter but sure the french want nothing but peace and quietness the people here do not mind the war come they could not be worse than they be they may as well die soldierly before god sure they will get quarter in heaven then she begin to say that it would be a hard thing to see child toss about on bayonet and i know she mind be run on tradition of the great rebellion she say presently i never know a man that be in a battle that like to speak of it after they would sooner be throw hay down from a hayrick she tell I how she and she neighbor use to be sit over the fire when she be a girl talking of the war that be come and now she be afraid it be come again for she have dream that all the bay be strand and cover with seaweed i ask she if it be in the fenian time that she have be so much afraid of war come but she cry out never have i such fun and pleasure as in the fenian time i be in a house where some of the officer use to be stay and in the daytime i would be walk after the soldier ' band and at night i would be go down to the end of the garden watch a soldier with he red coat on he drill the fenian in the field behind the house one night the boy tie the liver of a old horse that have be dead three week to the knocker and i find it when i open the door in the morning and presently we talk of war shift as it have a way of do to the battle of the black pig which seem to she a battle between ireland and england but to I a armageddon which shall quench all thing in the ancestral darkness again and from this to saying about war and vengeance do you know she say what the curse of the four father be they put the man-child on the spear and somebody say to they ` you will be curse in the fourth generation after you ' and that be why disease or anything always come in the fourth generation 1902 the queen and the fool i have hear one hearne a witch-doctor who be on the border of clare and galway say that in every household of faery there be a queen and a fool and that if you be touch by either you never recover though you may from the touch of any other in faery he say of the fool that he be maybe the wisest of all and speak of he as dress like one of the mummer that use to be go about the country since then a friend have gather I some few story of he and i have hear that he be know too in the highland i remember see a long lank ragged man sit by the hearth in the cottage of a old miller not far from where i be now write and be tell that he be a fool and i find from the story that my friend have gather that he be believe to go to faery in he sleep but whether he become a amadan-na-breena a fool of the forth and be attach to a household there i can not tell it be a old woman that i know well and who have be in faery herself that speak of he she say there be fool amongst they and the fool we see like that amadan of ballylee go away with they at night and so do the woman fool that we call oinseach -lrb- ape -rrb- a woman who be related to the witch-doctor on the border of clare and who can cure people and cattle by spell say there be some cure i can not do i can not help any one that have get a stroke from the queen or the fool of the forth i know of a woman that see the queen one time and she look like any christian i never hear of any that see the fool but one woman that be walk near gort and she call out ` there be the fool of the forth come after I ' so she friend that be with she call out though they could see nothing and i suppose he go away at that for she get no harm he be like a big strong man she say and half naked and that be all she say about he i have never see any myself but i be a cousin of hearne and my uncle be away twenty-one year the wife of the old miller say it be say they be mostly good neighbor but the stroke of the fool be what there be no cure for any one that get that be go the amadan-na-breena we call he and a old woman who live in the bog of kiltartan and be very poor say it be true enough there be no cure for the stroke of the amadan-na-breena there be a old man i know long ago he have a tape and he could tell what disease you have with measure you and he know many thing and he say to I one time ` what month of the year be the worst ' and i say ` the month of may of course ' ` it be not ' he say ` but the month of June for that be the month that the amadan give he stroke ' they say he look like any other man but he be leathan -lrb- wide -rrb- and not smart i know a boy one time get a great fright for a lamb look over the wall at he with a beard on it and he know it be the amadan for it be the month of June and they bring he to that man i be tell about that have the tape and when he see he he say ` send for the priest and get a mass say over he ' and so they do and what would you say but he be live yet and have a family a certain regan say ` they the other sort of people might be pass you close here and they might touch you but any that get the touch of the amadan-na-breena be do for ' it be true enough that it be in the month of June he be most likely to give the touch i know one that get it and he tell I about it himself he be a boy i know well and he tell I that one night a gentleman come to he that have be he land-lord and that be dead and he tell he to come along with he for he want he to fight another man and when he go he find two great troops of they and the other troop have a living man with they too and he be put to fight he and they have a great fight and he get the better of the other man and then the troop on he side give a great shout and he be leave home again but about three year after that he be cut bush in a wood and he see the amadan come at he he have a big vessel in he arm and it be shine so that the boy could see nothing else but he put it behind he back then and come run and the boy say he look wild and wide like the side of the hill and the boy run and he throw the vessel after he and it break with a great noise and whatever come out of it he head be go there and then he live for a while after and use to tell we many thing but he wit be go he think they might not have like he to beat the other man and he use to be afraid something would come on he and a old woman in a galway workhouse who have some little knowledge of queen maive say the other day the amadan-na-breena change he shape every two day sometimes he come like a youngster and then he 'll come like the worst of beast try to give the touch he use to be i hear it say of late he be shoot but i think myself it would be hard to shoot he i know a man who be try to bring before he mind 's eye a image of aengus the old irish god of love and poetry and ecstasy who change four of he kiss into bird and suddenly the image of a man with a cap and bell rush before he mind 's eye and grow vivid and speak and call itself aengus ' messenger and i know another man a truly great seer who see a white fool in a visionary garden where there be a tree with peacock ' feather instead of leaf and flower that open to show little human face when the white fool have touch they with he coxcomb and he see at another time a white fool sit by a pool and smile and watch the image of many fair woman float up from the pool what else can death be but the beginning of wisdom and power and beauty and foolishness may be a kind of death i can not think it wonderful that many should see a fool with a shine vessel of some enchantment or wisdom or dream too powerful for mortal brain in every household of they it be natural too that there should be a queen to every household of they and that one should hear little of they king for woman come more easily than man to that wisdom which ancient people and all wild people even now think the only wisdom the self which be the foundation of we knowledge be break in piece by foolishness and be forget in the sudden emotion of woman and therefore fool may get and woman do get of a certainty glimpse of much that sanctity find at the end of its painful journey the man who see the white fool say of a certain woman not a peasant woman if i have she power of vision i would know all the wisdom of the god and she vision do not interest she and i know of another woman also not a peasant woman who would pass in sleep into country of a unearthly beauty and who never care for anything but to be busy about she house and she child and presently a herb doctor cure she as he call it wisdom and beauty and power may sometimes as i think come to those who die every day they live though they die may not be like the die shakespeare speak of there be a war between the living and the dead and the irish story keep harp upon it they will have it that when the potato or the wheat or any other of the fruit of the earth decay they ripen in faery and that we dream lose they wisdom when the sap rise in the tree and that we dream can make the tree wither and that one hear the bleating of the lamb of faery in November and that blind eye can see more than other eye because the soul always believe in these or in like thing the cell and the wilderness shall never be long empty or lover come into the world who will not understand the verse -- heardst thou not sweet word among that heaven-resounding minstrelsy heardst thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy how love when limb be interwoven and sleep when the night of life be cloven and think to the world 's dim boundary cling and music when one 's beloved be singing be death 1901 the friend of the people of faery those that see the people of faery most often and so have the most of they wisdom be often very poor but often too they be think to have a strength beyond that of man as though one come when one have pass the threshold of trance to those sweet water where maeldun see the dishevelled eagle bathe and become young again there be a old martin roland who live near a bog a little out of gort who see they often from he young day and always towards the end of he life though i would hardly call he they friend he tell I a few month before he death that they would not let he sleep at night with cry thing at he in irish

raftery or callanan be the better poet one have say of raftery he be a big man and he song have go through the whole world i remember he well he have a voice like the wind but the other be certain that you would stand in the snow to listen to callanan presently a old man begin to tell my friend a story and all listen delightedly burst into laughter now and then the story which i be go to tell just as it be tell be one of those old rambling moralless tale which be the delight of the poor and the hard driven wherever life be leave in its natural simplicity they tell of a time when nothing have consequence when even if you be kill if only you have a good heart somebody would bring you to life again with a touch of a rod and when if you be a prince and happen to look exactly like you brother you might go to bed with he queen and have only a little quarrel afterwards we too if we be so weak and poor that everything threaten we with misfortune would remember if foolish people leave we alone every old dream that have be strong enough to fling the weight of the world from its shoulder there be a king one time who be very much put out because he have no son and he go at last to consult he chief adviser and the chief adviser say it be easy enough manage if you do as i tell you let you send some one say he to such a place to catch a fish and when the fish be bring in give it to the queen you wife to eat so the king send as he be tell and the fish be catch and bring in and he give it to the cook and bid she put it before the fire but to be careful with it and not to let any blob or blister rise on it but it be impossible to cook a fish before the fire without the skin of it rise in some place or other and so there come a blob on the skin and the cook put she finger on it to smooth it down and then she put she finger into she mouth to cool it and so she get a taste of the fish and then it be send up to the queen and she eat it and what be leave of it be throw out into the yard and there be a mare in the yard and a greyhound and they eat the bit that be throw out and before a year be out the queen have a young son and the cook have a young son and the mare have two foal and the greyhound have two pup and the two young son be send out for a while to some place to be care and when they come back they adviser and say tell I some way that i can know be so much like one another no person could know which be the queen 's son and which be the cook 's and the queen be vex at that and she go to the chief which be my own son for i do not like to be give the same eating and drinking to the cook 's son as to my own it be easy to know that say the chief adviser if you will do as i tell you go you outside and stand at the door they will be come in by and when they see you you own son will bow he head but the cook 's son will only laugh so she do that and when she own son bow he head she servant put a mark on he that she would know he again and when they be all sit at they dinner after that she say to jack that be the cook 's son it be time for you to go away out of this for you be not my son and she own son that we will call bill say do not send he away be we not brother but jack say i would have be long ago out of this house if i know it be not my own father and mother own it and for all bill could say to he he would not stop but before he go they be by the well that be in the garden and he say to bill if harm ever happen to I that water on the top of the well will be blood and the water below will be honey then he take one of the pup and one of the two horse that be foal after the mare eat the fish and the wind that be after he could not catch he and he catch the wind that be before he and he go on till he come to a weaver 's house and he ask he for a lodging and he give it to he and then he go on till he come to a king 's house and he send in at the door to ask do he want a servant all i want say the king be a boy that will drive out the cow to the field every morning and bring they in at night to be milk i will do that for you say jack so the king engage he in the morning jack be send out with the four-and-twenty cow and the place he be tell to drive they to have not a blade of grass in it for they but be full of stone so jack look about for some place where there would be better grass and after a while he see a field with good green grass in it and it belong to a giant so he knock down a bit of the wall and drive they in and he go up himself into a apple-tree and begin to eat the apple then the giant come into the field fee-faw-fum say he i smell the blood of a irishman i see you where you be up in the tree he say you be too big for one mouthful and too small for two mouthful and i do not know what i 'll do

while i wait for the singer a old man sing about that country beauty who die so many year ago and speak of a singer he have know who sing so beautifully that no horse would pass he but must turn its head and cock its ear to listen presently a score of man and boy and girl with shawl over they bead gather under the tree to listen somebody sing sa muirnin dile and then somebody else jimmy mo milestor mournful song of separation of death and of exile then some of the man stand up and begin to dance while another lilt the measure they dance to and then somebody sing eiblin a ruin that glad song of meeting which have always move I more than other song because the lover who make it sing it to he sweetheart under the shadow of a mountain i look at every day through my childhood the voice melt into the twilight and be mix into the tree and when i thought of the word they too melt away and be mix with the generation of man now it be a phrase now it be a attitude of mind a emotional form that have carry my memory to older verse or even to forget mythology i be carry so far that it be as though i come to one of the four river and follow it under the wall of paradise to the root of the tree of knowledge and of life there be no song or story hand down among the cottage that have not word and thought to carry one as far for though one can know but a little of they ascent one know that they ascend like medieval genealogy through unbroken dignity to the beginning of the world folk art be indeed the oldest of the aristocracy of thought and because it refuse what be pass and trivial the merely clever and pretty as certainly as the vulgar and insincere and because it have gather into itself the simplest and most unforgetable thought of the generation it be the soil where all great art be root wherever it be speak by the fireside or sing by the roadside or carve upon the lintel appreciation of the art that a single mind give unity and design to spread quickly when its hour be come in a society that have cast out imaginative tradition only a few people -- three or four thousand out of million -- favor by they own character and by happy circumstance and only then after much labor have understanding of imaginative thing and yet the imagination be the man himself the church in the middle age win all the art into they service because man understand that when imagination be impoverish a principal voice -- some would say the only voice -- for the awakening of wise hope and durable faith and understanding charity can speak but in broken word if it do not fall silent and so it have always seem to I that we who would re-awaken imaginative tradition by make old song live again or by gather old story into book take part in the quarrel of galilee those who be irish and would spread foreign way which for all but a few be way of spiritual poverty take part also they part be with those who be of jewry and yet cry out if thou let this man go thou art not caesar 's friend 1901
