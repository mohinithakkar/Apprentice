conduct as be not tatcheno when rye and rawny live together in dingle without be certificate i call such behavior be tolerably deep in the roving line everything savor of which i be determine not to sanctify i have suffer too much by my own certificate husband 's outbreak in that line to afford anything of the kind the slightest shadow of countenance it be hard that people may not live in dingle together without be suspect of do wrong say i so it be say mr petulengro interpose i be suspicious of nobody not even of my own husband whom some people would think i have a right to be suspicious of see that on he account i once refuse a lord i always allow he a agreeable latitude to go where he please but i have have the advantage of keep good company and therefore -- mekli say mr chikno pray drop all that sister i believe i have keep as good company as yourself and with respect to that offer with which you frequently fatigue those who keep company with you i believe after all it be something in the roving and uncertificated line _ ii -- the parting of the way _ belle be sit before the fire at which the kettle be boiling be you wait for I i inquire yes say belle that be very kind say i not half so kind say she as it be of you to get everything ready for I in the dead of last night after tea we resume we study of armenian first of all tell I say belle what a verb be a part of speech say i which accord to the dictionary signify some action or passion for example : i command you or i hate you i have give you no cause to hate I say belle look I sorrowfully in the face i be merely give two example say i in armenian there be four conjugation of verb the first end in al the second in yel the third in oul and the fourth in il now have you understand I i be afraid indeed it will all end ill say belle let we have no unprofitable interruption say i come we will begin with the verb hntal a verb of the first conjugation which signify rejoice come along hntam i rejoice hntas thou rejoicest why do not you follow belle i be sure i do not rejoice whatever you may do say belle the chief difficulty belle say i that i find in teaching you the armenian grammar proceeds from you apply to yourself and I every example i give i can not bear this much longer say belle keep yourself quiet say i we will skip hntal and proceed to the second conjugation belle i will now select for you to conjugate the prettiest verb in armenian -- the verb siriel here be the present tense : siriem siry sirè siriemk sirèk sirien come on belle and say ` siriem ' belle hesitate you must admit belle it be much softer than hntam it be so say belle and to oblige you i will say ` siriem ' very well indeed belle say i and now to show you how verb act upon pronoun i will say ` siriem zkiez ' please to repeat ` siriem zkiez ' ` siriem zkiez ' say belle that last word be very hard to say sorry that you think so belle say i now please to say ` siria zis ' belle do so now say ` yerani thè sirèir zi ' say i ` yerani thè sirèir zi ' say belle capital say i you have now say ' i love you -- love I -- ah would that you would love I ' and i have say all these thing you have say they in armenian say i i would have say they in no language that i understand and it be very wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance and make I say such thing why so say i if you say they i say they too you do so say belle but i believe you be merely banter and jeer as i tell you before belle say i the chief difficulty which i find in teaching you armenian proceeds from you persist in apply to yourself and I every example i give then you mean nothing after all say belle raise she voice let we proceed : sirietsus i love you never love anyone but yourself say belle and what be more -- sirietsit i will love say i sirietsies thou wilt love never one so thoroughly heartless i tell you what belle -- you be become intolerable but we will change the verb you would hardly believe belle say i that the armenian be in some respects closely connect with the irish but so it be for example : that word parghatsoutsaniem be evidently derive from the same root as fear-gaim which in irish be as much as to say ' i vex ' you do indeed say belle sob but how do you account for it oh man man cry belle burst into tear for what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a question unless it be to vex and irritate she if you wish to display you learning do so to the wise and instruct and not to I who can scarcely read or write i be sorry to see you take on so dear belle say i i have no idea of make you cry come i beg you pardon what more can i do come cheer up belle you be talk of parting do not let we part but depart and that together we way lie different say belle i do not see why they should say i come let we be off to america together to america together say belle yes say i where we will settle down in some forest and conjugate the verb siriel conjugally conjugally say belle yes as man and wife in america you be jest as usual say belle not i indeed come belle make up you mind and let we be off to america i do not think you be jest say belle but i can hardly entertain you offer however young man i thank you i will say nothing more at present i must have time to consider next day when i get up to go with mr petulengro to the fair on leave my tent i observe belle entirely dress standing close to she own little encampment dear I say i i little expect to find you up so early i merely lay down in my thing say belle i wish to be in readiness to bid you farewell when you depart well god bless you belle say i i shall be home to-night by which time i expect you will have make up you mind on arrive at the extremity of the plain i look towards the dingle isopel berner stand at the mouth the beam of the early morning sun shine full on she noble face and figure i wave my hand towards she she slowly lift up she right arm i turn away and never see isopel berner again the fourth morning afterwards i receive from she a letter in which she send I a lock of she hair and tell I she be just embark for a distant country never expect to see she own again she conclude with this piece of advice : _ fear god _ and take you own part fear god young man and never give in the world can bully and be fond if it see a man in a kind of difficulty of get about he call he coarse name but no sooner see the man take off he coat and offer to fight than it scatter and be always civil to he afterwards _ iii -- horse-keeping and horse-dealing _ after thus lose isopel i decide to leave the dingle and have by mr petulengro 's kind advice become the possessor of a fine horse i give my pony and tinker 's outfit to the gipsy and set out on the road whereupon i be to meet with strange adventure at length await the time when i could take my horse to horncastle fair and sell he i settle at a busy inn on the high-road where in return for board and lodging for myself and horse i have to supervise the distribution of hay and corn in the stable and to keep a account thereof the old ostler with whom i be soon on excellent term be a regular character -- a yorkshireman by birth who have see a great deal of life in the vicinity of london he have serve as ostler at a small inn at hounslow much frequent by highway man jerry abershaw and richard ferguson generally call gallop dick be capital customer then he tell I and he have frequently drunk with they in the corn-room no man could desire jollier companion over a glass of summut but on the road they be terrible cursing and swearing and thrust the muzzle of they pistol into people 's mouth from the old ostler i pick up many valuable hint about horse when you be a gentleman say he should you ever wish to take a journey on a horse of you own follow my advice before you start merely give you horse a couple of handful of corn and a little water -- somewhat under a quart then you may walk and trot for about ten mile till you come to some nice inn where you see you horse lead into a nice stall tell the ostler not to feed he till you come if the ostler happen to have a dog say what a nice one it be if he have not ask he how he be get on and whether he ever know worse time when you back 's turn he 'll say what a nice gentleman you be and how he think he have see you before then go and sit down to breakfast and before you have finish get up and go and give you horse a feed of corn chat with the ostler two or three minute till you horse have take the shine out of he corn which will prevent the ostler take any of it away when you back 's turn then go and finish you breakfast and when you have finish you breakfast when you have call for the newspaper go and water you horse let he have about one pailful then give he another feed of corn and enter into discourse with the ostler about bull-bait the prime minister and the like and when you horse have once more take the shine out of he corn go back to you room and you newspaper then pull the bell-rope and order in you bill which you will pay without count it up -- suppose you to be a gentleman give the waiter sixpence and order out you horse and when you horse be out pay for the corn and give the ostler a shilling then mount you horse and walk he gently for five mile see to you horse at night and have he well rub down next day you may ride you horse forty mile just as you please and those will bring you to you journey 's end unless it be a plaguey long one if so never ride you horse more than five-and-thirty mile a day always see he well fed and take more care of he than yourself see as how he be the best animal of the two the stage-coachman of that time -- low fellow but master of drive -- be make so much fuss of by sprig

great applause and the putney pet be dress out in a gown and mortar-board and the whole party then sally out to battle from time immemorial it have be the custom at oxford for the town-people and the scholar to engage at least once a year in a wild scrimmage and the pitched battle be now due no doubt it be not quite fair for the man of brazenface to bring the putney pet up from london for the occasion but for some year gown have be defeat by town and they be resolve to have they revenge when mr bouncer 's party turn the corner of saint mary 's they find that the town as usual have take the initiative and in a dense body have sweep the high street and drive all the gownsman before they a small knot of ` varsity man be manfully struggle against superior number by st mary 's hall gown to the rescue shout mr bouncer as he dash across the street come on pet here we be in the thick of it just in the nick of time poor mr verdant green have never learn to box he be a lover of peace and quietness and would have prefer to have watch the battle from a college window but he have be draw in the fray against he will by mr bouncer he now rush into the scrimmage with no idea of fight and a valiant bargee single he out as a easy prey and aim a heavy blow at he instinctively double he fist mr verdant green find that necessity be indeed the mother of invention and with a pass thought of what would be he mother 's and he maiden aunt 's feeling could they see he fight with a common bargeman he manage to guard off the blow but he be not so fortunate in the second round for the bargee knock he down but be happily knock down in turn by the putney pet the language of this gentle and refined scholar have become very peculiar there be a squelcher for you my kivey he say to the bargee as he send he sprawl then turn round he ask a townsman : what do you charge for a pint of dutch pink follow up the question by striking he on the nose unused to be question in this violent way the town party at last turn and flee and the gownsman go in search of other foe to conquer even mr verdant green feel desperately courageous when the town take to they heel and vanish at exeter college another town-and-gown fight be rage furiously the town mob have come across the senior proctor the rev thoma tozer and while old towzer as he be call be try to assert he proctorial authority over they they have jeer he and tear he clothes and bespatter he with mud a small group of gownsman rush to he rescue oh this be painful say the rev thoma tozer put the handkerchief to he bleeding nose this be painful this be exceedingly painful gentleman he be at once surround by sympathise undergraduate who beg he to allow they to charge the town at once but the town far outnumber the gown and in spite of the assistance of the reverend proctor the fight be go against they the rev thoma tozer have just be knock down for the first time in he life and the cry of gown to the rescue fall very pleasantly on he ear mr verdant green help he to rise while the putney pet step before he and strike out right and leave ten minute of scientific pugilism and the fate of the battle be decide the town flee every way and the rev thoma tozer be at last able to look calmly about he he at once resume he proctorial duty why have you not on you gown sir he say to the putney pet i ax yer pardon guv ` nor say the pet deferentially i could not get on in it nohow so i pocket it but some cove have go and prigg it i be unable to comprehend the nature of you language sir say the rev thoma tozer angrily think it be a impudent undergraduate i do not understand you sir but i desire at once to know you name and college mr bouncer however succeed in explain matter to the proctor who then congratulate the pet on have display pugilistic power worthy of the xystic of the noblest day of ancient rome both the pet and the undergraduate wonder what a xystic be but instead of inquire further into the matter they go to the roebuck where after a supper of grilled bone and welsh-rabbit mr verdant green give by particular request he now celebrated song the mar-arble hall the forehead of the singer be decorate with a patch of brown paper from which arise a strong smell of vinegar but he be not ashamed of it indeed he wear it all the next day and be sorry when he have to take it off -- for be it not in a way a badge of courage from this time mr verdant green begin to despise mere reading-man who never go in for sport he resolve at once to go in for they all he take to rowing and be rescue from a watery grave by mr bouncer then defeat but undaunt he take to ride and be throw off but what do it matter before the term end he grow more accustomed to the management of oxford tub and oxford hack it be

my soul and in my heart i be convinced i be wrong i have no more business to marry edgar linton than i have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there my brother have not bring heathcliff so low i should not have think of it it would degrade I to marry heathcliff now so he shall never know how i love he and that not because he be handsome nelly but because he be more myself than i be whatever we soul be make of he and mine be the same and linton 's be as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire nelly i dream i be in heaven but heaven do not seem to be my home and i break my heart with weep to come back to earth and the angel be so angry that they fling I out into the middle of the heath on the top of wuther height where i wake sob for joy ere this speech be end

a day and catherine have a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contain in that horse-trough as she whole affection be monopolise by he well i argue and refuse but in the long run he force I to agree to put a missive into mr linton 's hand when he meet she i see that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into she face for he be stricken with the conviction that she be fate to die oh cathy how can i bear it be the first sentence he utter you and edgar have break my heart heathcliff be she reply you have kill I and thriven on it i think be you possess with a devil he

into the darkness _ ii -- in the cathedral of the sea _ along the wild rugged shore a little way from kromlaix be a immense cavern of crimson granite hang with gleam moss and wash by the roar tide of the sea its towering wall have be carve by wind and water into thousand of beautiful fantastical form and a dim religious light fall from above through a long funnel-shaped hole run from the roof of the cavern to the top of the great cliff it be here that rohan gwenfern hide from the band of soldier send in pursuit of he the air be damp and chill but he breathe it with the comfort of a hardy animal he make a bed of dry seaweed on the top of the precipice lead to the hole in the cliff where he mother come and lower food to he every evening and jannedik a pet goat that use to follow he everywhere in the day when he be a free man be he only companion strange and solitary be the life he lead but he sleep as soundly in he bed of seaweed on the wild precipice as he do in he bed at home but one morning when he awake a confused murmur break upon he ear peer over the ledge he see a crowd of soldier stand on the shingle at the mouth of the cavern come down and surrender in the name of the emperor cry the sergeant surrender shout all he man and the vast dim place ring with the echo sound of they voice you can have my dead body if you care to come up here for it cry rohan step into the light that fall from the hole in the cliff the soldier stare up in astonishment when rohan appear on the ledge of the precipice he be now a gaunt forlorn hunt man with a few rag hang about he body and a great shock of yellow hair tumble below he shoulder under the stress of mental suffer he flesh have waste from he bone but he eye flash with a terrible light come down say the sergeant raise he gun or i will pick you off you perch as if you be a crow instead of get behind a rock rohan stand up with a strange smile on he face and say if you want I you must come and fetch I there be a flash a roar -- the sergeant have fire but when the smoke have clear away rohan be still stand on the ledge with the strange smile on he face the shot have go wide you can smile say the sergeant angrily but you can not escape if i can not bring you down i will starve you out my man be watch for you above and below you be surround and so be you say rohan with a laugh point to the mouth of the cavern look behind you the sergeant and he man turn round and give a cry of dismay the tide have turn and the sea be surge fiercely into the mouth of the cavern give he one volley shout the sergeant and then swim for you life but when the man turn to aim at rohan he be no longer visible they fire at random at the hole in the cliff and after fill the great cavern with drift smoke and echo thunder they flee for they life wade swimming through the high spring tide at any rate say the sergeant when they have all get safely back to land we can stop mother gwenfern from bring the mad rebel any more food so a watch be set over the cottage in which rohan 's widow mother live and she be always search whenever she leave she house and band of armed man keep guard night and day by the hole at the top of the cliff and by the seaward entrance to the cavern at the end of two week the sergeant resolve to make another attack the man he think must surely have be starve to death as every avenue of aid have long since be block so one moonlight night at ebb tide the crowd of soldier creep into the cavern and lash two long ladder together and begin to climb up the precipice but a strong arm seize the ladder from above and fling they back on the granite floor of the cave standing like a ghost in the faint silvery radiance fall through the hole in the cliff rohan hurl down upon the dark mass of the besiege crowd great fragment of rock which he have place ready for use along the ledge on which he sleep fire fire shriek the sergeant point at the white figure of rohan but before the command could be obey rohan get under shelter and the bullet rain harmlessly round the spot where he have just stand then under cover of fire some man advance and again place the ladder against the precipice as rohan crouch down on the ledge he be startle by the apparition of a human face with a cry of rage he spring to he foot and heedless of the bullet thud on the rock around he he slowly and painfully lift up a terrible granite boulder poise it for a moment over he head and then hurl it down at the shape dimly struggle below he there be a crash a shriek under the weight of the boulder the ladder break and the man upon they fall down amid horrible cry of agony and terror what happen after this rohan never know for overcome by frenzy and fatigue he swoon away when he open he eye he be lie beneath the hole in the cliff with the moonlight streaming upon he face from below he come the soft sound of lap water and look down he see that the tide have enter the cave and force the besieger to give over they attack yes the battle be over and he have conquer he position indeed be impregnable have he be well supply with food he could have hold it against hundred of man for a long period but as he lay down on he bed of seaweed a rough tongue lick he hand it be he goat jannedik for the last fortnight rohan 's mother have send the goat every day to she son with a basket of food tie round its neck and hide in the long hair of its throat rohan grope in the darkness for the basket and jannedik utter a low cry of pain roll over at he foot into the moonlight reveal a terrible bullet-wound in its side and quiver and die some soldier have shoot it as rohan stare at the dead body of he four-footed friend the strength of mind which have enable he to withstand all the power that napoleon the conqueror of europe could bring against he at last go from he tremble and shiver he look around he overcome by utter desolation and despair he have hold out bravely but he could hold out no longer slowly and laboriously he climb down the dark face of the precipice and reach the narrow strip of shingle below just as the moon get clear from a cloud and light up the cavern its cold ray fall on the white face of the sergeant who lay half on the shingle and half in the water crush by the great boulder with which rohan have break down the ladder rohan gaze for a moment on the feature of the man he have kill and then with a cry of agony and despair he fall upon he knee not on my head o god be the guilt he pray not on my head but on he who hunt I down and make I what i be on he whose red sword shadow all the world and drive on million of innocent man to murder each other ah god god god the man that napoleon have slay be it not high time that some man like I seek he out and kill he and bring peace back once more to this blood-covered earth of ours yes i will do it rise wildly to he foot full of the strange strength and the strange power of madness rohan gwenfern climb up the precipice to he bed of seaweed and then take a path that no man have take and live -- the sheer precipitous path from the roof of the cavern to the top of the cliff _ iii -- rohan meet napoleon _ as the grand army sweep into belgium for the last great battle against the unite power of england germany austrium and russium a strange savage creature follow it -- a gaunt half-naked man with long yellow hair fall almost to he waist and bloodshot eye with a look of madness in they how he live it be difficult to tell he never beg but the soldier throw lump of bread at he as he prowl round they camp-fire ask everyone whom he meet : where be the emperor where be napoleon do you think he will come this way twice he have be arrest as a spy and hastily condemn to be shoot but each time on hear he sentence of death he give so strange a laugh that the officer examine he more closely and then set he free say with scornful pity it be a harmless maniac let he go he always lag in the rear of the advance army and as each fresh regiment arrive he mingle with the soldier and ask they in a fierce whisper be the emperor come now be not he come at last one dark rainy evening the wild outcast see the man for whom he be seek wrap in a old gray overcoat and wear a cocked hat from which the rain drip heavily napoleon stand on a hill with he hand clasp behind he back he head sink deep between he shoulder look towards ligny but he be guard a crowd of officer stand close behind he wait for order suddenly a bareheaded soldier come ride along the road spur and flog he horse as if for dear life gallop wildly up the hill he hand the emperor a dispatch napoleon glance at it and speak to he staff officer with a wild movement of joy they draw they sword and wave they in the air shout _ vive l'empereur _ napoleon smile he star be again in the ascendant the prussian be retreat from ligny he have strike the first blow and it be a victory near the hill on which he be stand be a desert farmhouse he give order that it should be prepare for he reception but as he ride down the hill at the head of he staff the man who have be watch he divine he intention and reach the house before he attendant the soldier who search the place before napoleon enter fail to see the dark figure crouch up in the corner of a loft among the black rafter leave I say napoleon to he man after he have finish the plain meal of bread and wine set before he to-morrow he would meet for the first time on the roll field of waterloo the only captain of a european army whom he have not defeat he want to think he plan of battle over in silence some time he pace up and down the room he chin droop forward on he breast and he hand clasp upon he back through the wide clear space of he mind great army pass in black procession move like storm-cloud over the stricken earth burning city rise in the distance amid the shriek of die man and the thunder of cannon he plan be at last matured victory yes that be certain so he thought run a aide-de-camp enter with a dispatch he tear it open and run he eye over it it be nothing he say do not disturb I for two hour except on a matter of great importance i want to sleep go up to the old armchair of oak that be set before the fire he fall on he knee and cover he eye and pray what say the man who be watch he up in the rafter do cain dare to pray surely god will not answer he prayer he be pray that he may wipe the english to-morrow from the face of the earth and again cement he throne with blood and forge he sceptre of fire that no doubt be what napoleon pray for yet when he rise up he face be wonderfully change and soften by the religious light which have shine on it for a few moment then throw himself into the armchair he close he eye and as the fire burnt low rohan gwenfern silently descend from the loft and something gleam in he hand he creep up to the sleep emperor and stare at he face read it line by line napoleon move uneasily in he sleep and murmur to himself and he hand open and shut as rohan raise he knife to strike home to the heart of the tyrant he see the hand -- white and small like a woman 's or a child 's again he look at the face ah there be no imperial grandeur here only a feeble sallow tired and sickly creature whom a strong man could crush down with one blow of he fist rohan grow weak as he look and the long knife almost fall from he clutch i must kill he -- i must kill he he keep say to himself he one life against the peace and happiness of earth -- the life of a cain if he awaken war will awaken and fire famine and slaughter kill he rohan kill he perhaps if napoleon have not pray before he sleep he enemy would have carry out he purpose but he have pray he face have become beautiful for a moment and he fall asleep as fearlessly as a child no rohan gwenfern be not make of the stuff of which savage assassin be form though there be madness in he brain there be still love in he heart he could not kill even cain when god have sanctify the murderer with sleep god have make napoleon and god have send he bloody as he be he too be god 's child open the great casement window of the room in the farmhouse gwenfern gaze for a moment with wild eye and quiver lip on the pale worn face of the great conqueror and then leap out into the darkness when napoleon awake a long knife be lie at he foot but he heed it not and little dream that a few minute ago it have be point at he heart ah rohan gwenfern have do well to leave the mighty emperor in the hand of god and go back a wild tattered mad beggar to he sweetheart marcelle in the little breton village of kromlaix for as napoleon come out of the farmhouse and look at the dawn sky there rise up clouding the lurid star of he destiny the blood-red shadow -- waterloo \* \* \* \* \* john bunyan the holy war john bunyan be bear at elstow near bedford england in 1628 after receive a scanty education at the village school he work hard at the forge with he father in he sixteenth year he lose he mother and soon after he join the army then engage in the civil war but he military experience last only a few month return to elstow he again work at the forge and marry after various

ultimately he pastoral charge in bedford he take fever when on a visit to london and die on August 31 1688 the holy war be consider by critic even superior to the pilgrim inasmuch as it betray a finer literary workmanship it be write in 1682 after molestation of bunyan as a preacher have cease and when he be know widely as the author of the first part of the pilgrim 's progress the second part of which be publish two year later macaulay hold that if there have be no pilgrim 's progress holy war would have be the first of religious allegory no doubt its popularity have be due in some degree to its kinship to that work but the vigor of its style overcome the minute elaboration of a almost impossible theme and the book live alike as literature and theology by its own vitality a elaborate analysis of it may be find in froude 's volume on bunyan he say of it : ` the holy war ' would have entitle bunyan to a place among the master of english literature _ i -- the founding of mansoul _ in the gallant country of universe there be a fair and delicate town a corporation call mansoul a town for its building so curious for its situation so commodious for its privilege so advantageous that there be not its equal under the whole heaven as to the situation of the town it lieth between two world and the first founder and builder of it be one shaddaus who build it for he own delight and as he make it goodly to behold so also mighty to have dominion over all the country round about there be rear up in the midst of this town a most famous and stately place -- for strength it may be call a castle for pleasantness a paradise this place king shaddaus intend for himself alone and not another with he and of it he make a garrison but commit the keep of it only to the man of the town this famous town of mansoul have five gate -- eargate eyegate mouthgate nosegate and feelgate it have always a sufficiency of provision within its wall and it have the best most wholesome and excellent law that be then extant in the world there be not a rogue rascal or traitorous person within its wall they be all true man and fast join together _ ii -- the plot and capture _ well upon a time there be one diabolus a mighty giant make a assault upon the famous town of mansoul to take it and make it he own habitation this diabolus be first one of the servant of king shaddaus by whom he be raise to a most high and mighty place but he see himself thus exalt to greatness and honor and rage in he mind for higher state and degree what doth he but begin to think with himself how he might set up as lord over all and have the sole power under shaddaus -- but that the king have reserve for he son wherefore diabolus first consult with himself what have best to be do and then break he mind to some other of he companion to which they also agree so they come to the issue that they should make a attempt upon the king 's son to destroy he that the inheritance might be theirs now the king and he son be all and always eye could not but discern all passage in he dominion wherefore what do he but take they in the very nick and the first trip that they make towards they design convict they of the treason horrid rebellion and conspiracy that they have devise and cast they altogether out of all place of trust benefit honor and preferment and this do he banish they the court turn they down into horrid pit never more to expect the least favor at he hand banish from he court you may be sure they would now add to they former pride malice and rage against shaddai wherefore roving and range in much fury from place to place if perhaps they might find something that be the king 's they happen into this spacious country of universe and steer they course to mansoul so when they find the place they shout horribly on it for joy say : now have we find the prize and how to be revenge on king shaddaus so they sit down and call a council of war now with diabolus be among other the fierce alecto and apollyon and the mighty giant beelzebub and lucifer and legion and legion it be whose advice be take that they should assault the town in all pretend fairness cover they intention with lie flattery and delusive word feign thing that will never be and promise that to they which they shall never find it be design also that by a stratagem they should destroy one mr resistance otherwise call captain resistance -- a man that the giant diabolus and he band more fear than they fear the whole town of mansoul besides and they appoint one tisiphone to do it thus have end the council of war they rise up and march towards mansoul but all in a manner invisible save only diabolus who approach the town in the shape and body of a dragon so they draw up and sit down before eargate and lay they ambuscade for mr resistance within a bow shot of the town then diabolus be come to the gate sound he trumpet for audience at which the chief of the town such as my lord innocent my lord will-be-will mr recorder and captain resistance come down to the wall to see who be there and what be the matter diabolus then begin he oration gentleman of the famous town of mansoul i have somewhat of concern to impart unto you and first i will assure you it be not my own but you advantage that i seek i be come to show you how you may obtain ample deliverance from a bondage that unaware to yourselve you be captivate and enslave under at this the town of mansoul begin to prick up its ear and what be it pray what be it think they then diabolus speak on touch you king i know he be great and potent but he law be unreasonable intricate and intolerable there be a great difference and disproportion betwixt the life and a apple yet one must go for the other by the law of you shaddaus why should you be holden in ignorance and blindness o ye inhabitant of mansoul ye be not a free people and be it not grievous to think on that the very thing you be forbid to do might you but do it would yield you both wisdom and honor and just now while diabolus be speak these word to mansoul tisiphone shot at captain resistance where he stand on the gate and mortally wound he in the head so that he to the amazement of the townsman fall down quite dead over the wall now when captain resistance be dead -- and he be the only man of war in the town -- poor mansoul be leave wholly naked of courage then stand forth mr ill-pause that diabolus bring with he as he orator and persuade the townsfolk to take of the tree which king shaddaus have forbid and when they see that the tree be good for food and that it be pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desire to make one wise they take and do eat now even while this ill-pause be make he speech my lord innocent -- whether by a shot from the camp of the giant or from some qualm that suddenly take he or whether by the stink breath of that treacherous villain old ill-pause for so i be most apt to think -- sink down in the place where he stand still nor could he be bring to life again now these brave man be dead what do the rest of the townsfolk but fall down and yield obedience to diabolus and have eat of the forbid fruit they become drunk therewith and so open both eargate and eyegate and let in diabolus and all he band quite forget they good shaddaus and he law diabolus now bethink himself of remodel the town for he greater security set up one and put down another at pleasure wherefore he put out of power and place my lord mayor whose name be my lord understanding and mr recorder whose name be mr conscience but my lord will-be-will a man of great strength resolution and courage resolve to bear office under diabolus who perceive the willingness of my lord to serve he forthwith make he captain of the castle governor of the wall and keeper of the gate of mansoul he also have mr mind for he clerk when the giant have thus engarrison himself in the town of mansoul he betake himself to deface now there be in the market-place and also in the gate of the castle a image of the bless king shaddaus this he command to be deface and it be basely do by the hand of mr no-truth moreover diabolus make havoc of the remains of the law and statute of shaddaus and set up he own vain edict such as give liberty to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life _ iii -- the re-taking of mansoul _ now as you may well think long before this time word be carry to the good king shaddaus that mansoul be lose and it would have amaze one to have see what sorrow and compunction of spirit there be among all sort at the king 's court to think that the place be take but the king and he son foresee all this before yea have sufficiently provide for the relief of mansoul though they tell not everybody thereof wherefore after consultation the son of shaddaus -- a sweet and comely person and one that always have great affection for those that be in affliction -- have strive hard with he father promise that he would be he servant to recover mansoul the purport of this agreement be that at a certain time prefix by both the king 's son should take a journey into the country of universe and there in a way of justice and equity make amends for the folly of mansoul and lay the foundation of she perfect deliverance now king shaddaus think good at the first not to send he army by the hand and conduct of brave emmanuel he son but under the hand of some of he servant to see first by they the temper of mansoul and whether they would be win to the obedience of they king so they come up to mansoul under the conduct of four stout general each man be captain of ten thousand man and have he standard-bearer have travel for many day at the king 's cost not hurt or abuse any they come within sight of mansoul the which when they see the captain could for they heart do no less than bewail the condition of the town for they quickly perceive it be prostrate to the will of diabolus well before the king 's force have set before mansoul three day captain boanerge command he trumpeter to go down to eargate to summon mansoul to give audience to the message he be command to deliver but there be none that appear to give answer or regard again and again be the summons sound till at last the townsman come up -- have first make eargate as sure as they could so my lord incredulity come up and show himself over the wall but when the captain have set eye on he he cry out aloud this be not he where be my lord understand the ancient mayor of the town of mansoul then stand forth the four captain and take no notice of the giant diabolus each address himself to the town of mansoul but they brave speech the town refuse to hear yet the sound thereof beat against eargate though the force thereof could not break it open then diabolus command the lord mayor incredulity to give answer and he oration be second by desperate will-be-will while the recorder whose name be forget-good follow with threat then do the town of mansoul shout for joy as if by diabolus and he crew some great advantage have be obtain over the captain they also ring the bell and sing and make merry and dance for joy upon the wall now when the captain hear the answer of the great one and they could not get a hearing from the old native of the town they resolve to try it out by the power of the arm so with they sling they batter the house and with ram they seek to break eargate open but mansoul stand it out so lustily that after several skirmish and brisk encounter they make a fair retreat and entrenched themselves in they winter quarter but now could not mansoul sleep securely as before nor could they go to they debauchery with quietness as in time past for they have from the camp of shaddaus such frequent warm alarm yea alarm upon alarm first at one gate and then at another and again at all the gate at once that they be break as to former peace yea so distressed be they that i daresay diabolus they king have in these day he rest much broken and by degree new thought possess the mind of the man of the town some would say there be no living thus other would then reply this will be over shortly then a third would answer let we turn to king shaddaus and so put a end to all these trouble the old gentleman too mr conscience the recorder that be so before diabolus take mansoul begin to talk aloud and he word be now like great clap of thunder yea so far as i could gather the town have be surrender before now have it not be for the opposition of old incredulity and the fickleness of my lord will-be-will they of the king 's army this winter send three time to mansoul to submit herself and these summons especially the two last so distressed the town that presently they call a consultation for a parley and offer to come to a agreement on certain term but they be such that the captain jointly and with the highest disdain reject and return to they trench the captain then gather themselves together for a conference and agree that a petition should forthwith be draw up and forward by a fit man to shaddai with speed that more force be send to mansoul now the king at sight of the petition be glad but how much more think you when it be second by he son wherefore the king call to he emmanuel he son and say come now therefore my son and prepare thyself for war for thou shalt go to my camp at mansoul thou shalt also there prosper and prevail the time for the setting forth be expire the king 's son address himself for the march and taketh with he five noble captain and they force so they sit down before the town not now against the gate only but environ it round on every side but first for two day together they hang out the white flag to give the townsfolk time to consider but they as if they be unconcerned make no reply to this favourable signal so they then set the red flag upon the mount call mount justice when emmanuel have put all thing in readiness to bid diabolus battle he send again to know of the town of mansoul if in peaceable manner they would yield themselves they then together with diabolus they king call a council of war and resolve on certain proposition that should be offer to emmanuel now there be in the town of mansoul a old man a diabolonian and he name be mr loath-to-stoop a stiff man in he way and a great doer for diabolus he therefore they send and put into he mouth what he should say but none of he proposal would emmanuel grant -- all he ensnare proposition be reject and mr loath-to-stoop depart then be a alarm sound and the battering-ram be play and the sling whirl stone into the town amain and thus the battle begin and the word be at that time emmanuel first captain boanerge make three assault most fierce one after another upon eargate to the shake of the post thereof captain conviction also make up fast with boanerge and both discover that the gate begin to yield they command that the ram should still be play against it but captain conviction go up very near to the gate be with great force drive back and receive three wound in the mouth nor do captain good-hope nor captain charity come behind in this most desperate fight for they too so behave at eyegate that they have almost break it quite open and this take away the heart of many of the diabolonian as for will-be - will i never see he so daunt in my life and some say he get a wound in the leg when the battle be over diabolus again attempt to make term by propose a surrender on the condition that he should remain in the town as emmanuel 's deputy and press upon the people a reformation accord to law but emmanuel reply that nothing would be regard that he could propose for he have neither conscience to god nor love to the town of mansoul diabolus therefore withdraw himself from the wall to the fort in the heart of the town and fill with despair of retain the town in he hand resolve to do it what mischief he could for say he better demolish the place and leave it a heap of ruin than that it should be a habitation for emmanuel know the next battle would issue in he be master of the place emmanuel give out a royal commandment to all he man of war to show themselves man of war against diabolus and all diabolonian but favourable and meek to the old inhabitant of mansoul then after three or four notable charge eargate be burst open and the bolt and bar break into a thousand piece then do the prince 's trumpet sound the captain shout the town shake and diabolus retreat to he hold and there be a great slaughter till the diabolonian lay dead in every corner -- though too many be yet alive in mansoul now the old recorder and my lord understand with some other of the chief of the town come together and jointly agree to draw up a petition and send it to emmanuel while he sit in the gate of mansoul the contents of the petition be these : that they -- the old inhabitant of the deplorable town of mansoul -- confess they sin and be sorry that they have offend he princely majesty and pray that he would spare they life unto this petition he give no answer after some time and travail the gate of the castle be beat open and so a way be make to go into the hold where diabolus have hide himself now when he be come to the castle gate he command diabolus to surrender himself into he hand but oh how loath be the beast to appear how he stick at it how he shrink how he cringe then emmanuel command and they take diabolus and bind he first in chain and lead he to the market-place and strip he of he armor thus have make diabolus naked in the eye of mansoul the prince command that he shall be bind with chain to he chariot-wheel and he ride in triumph over he quite through the town and have finish this part of he triumph over diabolus he turn he up in the midst of he contempt and shame then go he from emmanuel and out of he camp to inherit parched place in a salt land seek rest but find none now the prince have by special order put my lord understand mr conscience and my lord will-be-will in ward they again draw up a petition and send it to emmanuel by the hand of mr would-live and this be unanswered they use as they messenger mr desires-awake and with he go mr wet-eye a near neighbor then the prisoner be order to go down to the camp and appear before the prince this they do with droop spirit and rope round they neck but the prince give they they pardon embrace they take away they rope and put chain of gold round they neck he also send by the recorder a pardon for all the people of mansoul then the prince command that the image of diabolus should be take down from the place where it be set up and that they should utterly destroy it without the town wall and that the image of shaddai he father should be set up again with he own moreover he renew the charter of the city and bring forth out of he treasury white glittering robe and grant to the people that they should put they on so that they be put into fine linen white and clean then say the prince unto they this o mansoul be my livery and the badge by which mine be know from the servant of other wear they if you would be know by the world to be mine _ iv -- the downfall _ but there be a man in the town name mr carnal-security and he bring this corporation into great grievous bondage when emmanuel perceive that through the policy of mr carnal-security the heart of man be chill and abate in they practical love for he he in private manner withdraw himself first from he palace then to the gate of the town and so away from mansoul till they should more earnestly seek he face then the diabolonian who yet dwell in mansoul send letter to diabolus who promise to come to they assistance for the ruin of the town with twenty thousand doubter diabolus suddenly make a assault on feelgate the gate be force and the prince 's man be compel to betake themselves to the castle as the stronghold of the town leave the townsman open to the ravages of the doubter still the castle hold out and more urgent petition to emmanuel carry by captain credence bring at last the assurance that he would come presently to the relief of the town indeed before that time diabolus have think it wise to withdraw he man from the town to the plain but here the doubter be catch between the defender of the city and the rescue army of emmanuel be slay to the last man and bury in the plain even yet diabolus be not satisfy with he defeat but determine on a last attempt upon the town he army be make up of ten thousand doubter and fifteen thousand blood-man all rugged villain but mr prywell discover they coming and they be put to route by the prince 's captain the blood-man be surround and capture and so mansoul arrive at some degree of peace and quiet and she prince also abode within she border then the prince appoint a day when he should meet the whole of the townsman in the market-place and they be come together he say now my mansoul i have return to thee in peace and thy transgression against I be as if they have not be nor shall it be with thee as in former day but i will do better for thee than at the beginning yet a little while and i will

quickly upon he imaginative brain release at last from gaol he still continue he work acquaint no one with he labor and receive the help of none the pilgrim on its appearance in 1678 be but a moderate success but it be not long before its charm make itself feel and john bunyan count he reader by the thousand in scotland in the colony in holland and among the huguenot of france within ten year 100000 copy be sell with the exception of the bible it be perhaps the most widely-read book in the english language and have be translate into seventy foreign tongue _ i -- the battle with apollyon _ as i walk through the wilderness of this world i light on a certain place where there be a den and lay I down in that place to sleep and as i sleep i dream a dream i dream i see a man clothe with rag stand with he face from he own house a book in he hand and a great burden upon he back o my dear wife and child he say i be inform that we city will be burn with fire from heaven we shall all come to ruin unless we can find a way of escape he relation and friend think that some distemper have get into he head but he keep cry in spite of all that they say to quieten he what shall i do to be save he look this way and that way but could not tell which road to take and a man name evangelist come to he and he say to evangelist whither must i fly do you see yonder wicket gate say evangelist point with he finger over a very wide field go there and knock and you will be tell what to do i saw in my dream that the man begin to run and he wife and child cry after he to return but the man run on cry life life eternal life two of he neighbor pursue he and overtake he they name be obstinate and pliable come come friend christian say obstinate why be you hurry away in this manner from the city of destruction in which you be bear because i have read in my book reply christian that it will be consume with fire from heaven i pray you good neighbor come with I and seek for some way of escape after listen to all that christian say pliable resolve to go with he but obstinate return to the city of destruction in scorn what leave my friend and comfort for such a brain-sick fellow as you no i will go back to my own home christian and pliable walk on together without look whither they be go and in the midst of the plain they fall into a very miry slough which be call the slough of despond here they wallow for a time and christian because of the burden that be on he back begin to sink in the mire be this the happiness you tell I of say pliable if i get out again with my life you shall make you journey alone with a desperate effort he get out of the mire and go back leave christian alone in the slough of despond as christian struggle under he burden towards the wicket gate i saw in my dream that a man come to he whose name be help and draw he out and set he upon sound ground but before christian could get to the wicket gate mr worldly wiseman come and speak to he how now good fellow say mr worldly wiseman where be you go with that heavy burden on you back to yonder wicket gate say christian for there evangelist tell I i shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden evangelist be a dangerous and troublesome fellow say mr worldly wiseman do not follow he counsel hear I : i be older than you i can tell you a easy way to get rid of you burden you see the village on yonder high hill yes say christian i remember the village be call morality it be say mr worldly wiseman there you will find a very judicious gentleman whose name be mr legality if he be not in inquire for he son mr civility both of they have great skill in help man to get burden off they shoulder christian resolve to follow mr worldly wiseman 's advice but as he be painfully climb up the high hill evangelist come up to he and say be you not the man that i find cry in the city of destruction and direct to the little wicket gate how be it that you have go so far out of the way christian blush for shame and say that he have be lead astray by mr worldly wiseman mr worldly wiseman say evangelist be a wicked man mr legality be a cheat and he son mr civility be a hypocrite if you listen to they they will beguile you of you salvation and turn you from the right way evangelist then set christian in the true path which lead to the wicket gate over which be write knock and it shall be open unto you and christian knock and a grave person name goodwill open the gate and let he in i saw in my dream that christian ask he to help he off with the burden that be upon he back and goodwill point to a narrow way run from the wicket gate and say do you see that narrow way that be the way you must go keep to it and do not turn down any of the wide and crooked road and you will soon come to the place of deliverance where you burden will fall from you back of itself christian then take he leave of goodwill and climb up the narrow way till he come to a place upon which stand a cross and i saw in my dream that as christian come to the cross he burden fall from off he back and he become glad and lightsome he give three leap for joy and go on he way singing and at nightfall he come to a very stately palace the name of which be beautiful four grave and lovely damsel name charity discretion prudence and piety meet he at the threshold say come in thou bless of the lord this palace be build on purpose to entertain such pilgrim as thou christian sit talk with the lovely damsel until supper be ready and then they lead he to a table that be furnish with fat thing and excellently fine wine and after christian have refresh himself the damsel show he into a large chamber whose window open towards the sun-rising the name of the chamber be peace and there christian sleep till break of day then he awake singing for joy and the damsel take he into the armoury and dress he for battle they harness he in armor of proof and give he a stout shield and a good sword for they say he would have to fight many a battle before he get to the celestial city and i saw in my dream that christian go down the hill on which the house beautiful stand and come to a valley that be call the valley of humiliation where he be meet by a foul fiend apollyon prepare to die say apollyon straddle over the whole breadth of the narrow way i swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go no further here will i spill thy soul with that he throw a flaming dart at he breast but christian catch it on he shield then apollyon rush upon he throw dart as thick as hail and notwithstanding all that christian could do apollyon wound he and make he draw back the sore combat last for half a day and though christian resist as manfully as he could he grow weaker and weaker by reason of he wound at last apollyon espy he opportunity close in on christian and wrestle with he give he a dreadful fall and christian 's sword fly out of he hand ah cry apollyon i be sure of thee now he press he almost to death and christian begin to despair of life but as god would have it while apollyon be fetch he last blow to make a end of this good man christian nimbly reach out he hand for he sword and catch it and give he a deadly thrust with that apollyon spread forth he wing and speed he away and christian see he no more then with some leaf from the tree of life christian heal he wound and with he sword draw in he hand he march through the valley of humiliation without meet any more enemy but at the end of the valley be another call the valley of the shadow of death on the right hand of this valley be a very deep ditch it be the ditch into which the blind have lead the blind in all age and have there miserably perish and on the left hand be a dangerous quagmire into which if even a good man fall he find no bottom for he foot to stand on the pathway here be exceed narrow and very dark and christian be hard put to it to get through safely and right by the wayside in the midst of the valley be the mouth of hell and out of it come flame and smoke in great abundance with spark and hideous noise but when the host of hell come at he as he travel on through the smoke and flame and dreadful noise he cry out i will walk in the strength of the lord god thereupon the fiend give over and come no further and suddenly the day break and christian turn and see all the hobgoblin satyr and dragon of the pit far behind he and though he be now get into the most dangerous part of the valley of the shadow of death he be no longer afraid the place be so set here with snare trap gin and net and there with pit and hole and shelving that have it be dark he would surely have perish but it be now clear day and by walk warily christian get safely to the end of the valley and at the end of the valley he see another pilgrim march on at some distance before he ho ho shout christian stay and i will be you companion no i can not stay say the other pilgrim whose name be faithful i be upon my life and the avenger of blood be behind I put out all he strength christian quickly get up with faithful then i saw in my dream they go very lovingly on together and have sweet discourse of all thing that have happen to they in they pilgrimage for they have be neighbor in the city of destruction and both of they be bind for the delectable mountain and the celestial city beyond they be now in a great wilderness and they walk on together till they come to the town of vanity at which a fair be keep all the year long call vanity fair _ ii -- vanity fair _ i saw in my dream that christian and faithful try to avoid see vanity fair but this they could not do because the way to the celestial city lie through the town where this lusty fair be keep about 5000 year ago beelzebub apollyon and the rest of the fiend see by the path which the pilgrim make that they way lay through the town of vanity so they set up a fair there in which all sort of vanity should be sell every day in the year among the merchandise sell at this fair be land honor title lust pleasure and preferment delight of all kind as servant gold silver and precious stone murder and theft blood and body yea and life and soul moreover at this fair there be at all time to be see juggling cheat game play fool ape knave and rogue and that of every sort when christian and faithful come through vanity fair everybody begin to stare and mock at they for they be clothe in a raiment different from the raiment of the multitude that trade in the fair and they speech also be different and few could understand what they say but what amuse the townspeople most of all be that the pilgrim set light by all they wares what will ye buy what will ye buy say one merchant to they mockingly we buy the truth say christian and faithful look gravely upon he at this some man begin to taunt the pilgrim and some try to strike they and thing at last come to a hubbub and great stir and all the fair be throw into disorder thereupon christian and faithful be arrest as disturber of the peace after be beat and roll in the dirt they be put into a cage and make a spectacle to all the man of the fair the next day they be again beat and lead up and down the fair in heavy chain for a example and terror to other but some of the better sort be move to take they part and this so angered the chief man in the town that they resolve to put the pilgrim to death they be therefore indict before the lord chief justice hategood with have disturb the trade of vanity fair and win a party over to they own pernicious way of think in contempt of the law of prince beelzebub mr envy mr superstition and mr pickthank bear witness against they and the juryman on hearing faithful affirm that the custom of they town of vanity be oppose to the spirit of christianity bring he in guilty of high treason to beelzebub no doubt they would have condemn christian also but by the mercy of god he escape from prison be assist by one of the man of the town name hopeful who have come over to he way of think faithful be tie to a stake and scourge and stone and burn to death but i saw in my dream that the shine one come with a chariot and horse and make they way through the multitude to the flame in which faithful be burn and put he in the chariot and with the sound of trumpet carry he up through the cloud and on to the gate of the celestial city so christian be leave alone to continue he journey but i saw in my dream that as he be go out of the town of vanity hopeful come up to he and say that he would be he companion and thus it ever be whenever a man die to bear testimony to the truth another rise out of he ash to carry on he work christian be in no wise cast down by the death of faithful but go on he way singing hail faithful hail thy goodly work survive and though they kill thee thou art still alive and he be especially comfort by hopeful tell he that there be a great many man of the better sort in vanity fair who be now resolve to undertake the pilgrimage to the celestial city some way beyond vanity fair be a delicate plain call ease where christian and hopeful go with much content but at the farther side of that plain be a little hill which be name lucre in this hill be a silver-mine which be very dangerous to enter for many man who have go to dig silver there have be smother in the bottom by damp and noisome air four man from vanity fair -- mr money-love mr hold-the-world mr by-end and mr save-all -- be go into the silver-mine as christian and hopeful pass by tarry for we say mr money-love and when we have get a little riches to take we on we journey we will come with you hopeful be willing to wait for he fellow-townsmen but christian tell he that have enter the mine they would never come out and besides that treasure be a snare to they that seek it for it hindereth they pilgrimage and he speak truly for i saw in my dream that some be kill by fall into the mine as they gaze from the brink and the rest who go down to dig be poison by the vapor in the pit in the meantime christian and hopeful come to the river of life and walk along the bank with great delight they drink of the water of the river which be pleasant and enliven to they weary spirit and they eat of the fruit of the green tree that grow by the river side then find a fair meadow cover with lily they lay down and sleep and in the morning they rise up wondrously refresh and continue they journey along the bank of the river but the way soon grow rough and stony and see on they left hand a stile across the meadow call by-path meadow christian leap over it and say to hopeful come good hopeful let we go this way it be much easier i be afraid say hopeful that it will take we out of the right road but christian persuade he to jump over the stile and there they get into a path which be very easy for they foot but they have not go very far when it begin to rain and thunder and lighten in a most dreadful manner and night come on apace and stumble along in the darkness they reach doubt castle and the lord thereof giant despair take they and throw they into a dark and dismal dungeon here they lay for three day without one bit of bread or drop of drink on the third day giant despair come and flog they with a great crabtree cudgel and so disabled they that they be not even able to rise up from the mire of they dungeon floor and indeed they could scarcely keep they head above the mud in which they lay now giant despair have a wife and she name be diffidence and when she find that in spite of they flog christian and hopeful be still alive she advise she husband to kill they outright it happen however to be sunshiny weather and sunshiny weather always make giant despair fall into a helpless fit in which he lose for the time the use of he hand so all he could do be to try and persuade he prisoner to kill themselves with knife or halter why say he to christian and hopeful should you choose to live you know you can never get out of doubt castle what will you slowly starve to death like rat in a hole instead of put a sudden end to you misery like man i tell you again you will never get out but when he be go christian and hopeful go down on they knee in they dungeon and pray long and earnestly then christian suddenly bethought himself and after fumble in he bosom he draw out a key say what a fool be i to lie in a dismal dungeon when i can walk at liberty here be the key that i have be carry in my bosom call promise that will open every lock in doubt castle he at once try it at the dungeon door and turn the bolt with ease he then lead hopeful to the iron gate of the castle and though the lock go desperately hard yet the key open it but as the gate move it make such a creak that giant despair be arouse hastily rise up the giant set out to pursue the prisoner but see that all the land be now flood with sunshine he fall into one of he helpless fit and could not even get as far as the castle gate _ iii -- the celestial city _ have thus get safely out of doubt castle christian and hopeful make they way back to the bank of the river of life and follow the rough and stony way they come at last to the delectable mountain and go up the mountain they behold the garden and orchard the vineyard the fountain of water and here they drink and wash themselves and freely eat of the pleasant grape of the vineyard now on top of the mountain there be four shepherd feed they flock and the pilgrim go to they and lean upon they staff they ask they the way to the celestial city and the shepherd take they by the hand and lead they to the top of clear the highest of all the delectable mountain and the pilgrim look and see faintly and very far off the gate and the glory of the celestial city and i saw in my dream that the two pilgrim go down the delectable mountain along the narrow way and after walk some distance they come to a place where the path branch here they stand still for a while consider which way to take for both way seem right and as they be consider behold a man black of flesh and cover with a white robe come up to they and offer to lead they down the true way but when they have follow he for some time they find that he have lead they into a crooked road and there they be entangled in a net here they lay bewail themselves and at last they espy a shine one come toward they with a whip in he hand we be poor pilgrim go to the celestial city say christian and hopeful a black man clothe in white offer to lead we there but entangled we instead in this net it be flatterer that do this say the shine one he be a false apostle that have transform himself into a angel i saw in my dream that he then rent the net and let the pilgrim out then he command they to lie down and when they do so he chastise they with he whip of cord to teach they to walk in the good way and refrain from follow the advice of evil flatterer and they thank he for he kindness and go softly along the right path singing for very joy and after pass through the enchanted land which be full of vapor that make they dull and sleepy they come to the sweet and pleasant country of beulah in this country the sun shone night and day and the air be so bright and clear that they could see the celestial city to which they be go yea they meet there some of the inhabitant for the shine one often walk in the land of beulah because it be on the border of heaven as christian and hopeful draw near to the city they strength begin to fail it be build of pearl and precious stone and the street be pave with gold and what with the natural glory of the city and the dazzling radiance of the sunbeam that fall upon it christian grow sick with desire as he behold it and hopeful too be stricken with the same malady and walk on very slowly full of the pain of longing they come at last to the gate of the city but between they and the gate there be a river and the river be very deep and no bridge go over it and when christian ask the shine one how he could get to the gate of the city they say to he you must go through the river or you can not come to the gate be the river very deep say christian you will find it deeper or shallower say the shine one accord to the depth or shallowness of you belief in the king of we city the two pilgrim then enter the river christian at once begin to sink and cry out to he good friend hopeful he say i sink in deep water the billow go over my head all the wave go over I be of good cheer my brother say hopeful i feel the bottom and it be good with that a great darkness and horror fall upon christian he could no longer see before he and he be in much fear that he would perish in the river and never enter in at the gate when he recover he find he have get to the other side and hopeful be already there wait for he and i saw in my dream that the city stand upon a mighty hill but the pilgrim go up with ease because they have leave they mortal garment behind they in the river while they be thus draw to the gate behold a company of the heavenly host come out to meet they with they be several of the king 's trumpeter clothe in white and shine raiment who make even the heaven to echo with they shouting and the sound of they trumpet then all the bell in the city begin to ring welcome and the gate be open wide and the two pilgrim enter and lo as they enter they be transfigure and they have raiment put on that shone like gold and shine one give they harp to praise they king with and crown in token of honor and as the gate be open i look in and behold the street be pave with gold and in they walk many man with crown on they head palm in they hand and golden harp to sing praise withal there be also of they that have wing and they answer one another say holy holy holy be the lord and after that they shut up the gate which when i have see i wish myself among they then i awake and behold it be a dream \* \* \* \* \* fanny burney evelina evelina be the first

never before see a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burn with curiosity she run across the field after he and be just in time to see he pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge in another moment down go alice after he never once consider how in the world she be to get out again the rabbit-hole go straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dip suddenly down so suddenly that alice have not a moment to think about stop herself before she find herself fall down what seem to be a very deep well either the well be very deep or she fall very slowly for she have plenty of time as she go down to look about she and to wonder what be go to happen next well think alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumble downstairs down down down would the fall _ never _ come to a end i wonder if i shall fall right _ through _ the earth how funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with they head downward the antipathy i think -lrb- she be rather glad there be no one listen this time as it do not sound at all the right word -rrb- down down down then suddenly thump thump down she come upon a heap of stick and dry leaf and the fall be over alice be not a bit hurt and she jump up on to she foot in a moment she look up but it be all dark overhead before she be another long passage and the white rabbit be still in sight hurry down it there be not a moment to be lose away go alice like the wind and be just in time to hear he say as he turn a corner oh my ear and whisker how late it be get she be close behind he when she turn the corner but the rabbit be no longer to be see she find herself in a long narrow hall which be light up by lamp hang from the roof in the hall she come upon a little three-legged table all make of solid glass there be nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice 's first idea be that this might belong to one of the door of the hall but alas either the lock be too large or the key be too small for at any rate it would not open any of they however on the second time round she come upon a low curtain she have not notice before and behind it be a little door about fifteen inch high she try the little golden key in the lock and to she great delight it fit alice open the door and find that it lead into a small passage not much larger than a rat-hole she kneel down and look along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever see how she long to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those bed of bright flower and those cool fountain but she could not even get she head through the doorway there seem to be no use in wait near the little door so she go back to the table half hope she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rule for shut people up like telescope this time she find a little bottle on it -lrb- which certainly be not here before say alice -rrb- and tie round the neck of the bottle be a paper label with the word drink I beautifully print on it in large letter alice taste it and very soon finish it off what a curious feeling say alice i must be shut up like a telescope and so it be indeed she be now only ten inch high and she face brighten up at the thought that she be now the right size for go through the little door into that lovely garden but alas for poor alice when she get to the door she find she have forget the little golden key and when she go back to the table for it she find she could not possibly reach it soon she eye fall on a little glass box that be lie under the table she open it and find in it a very small cake on which the word eat I be beautifully mark in currant she very soon finish off the cake curiouser and curiouser cry alice -lrb- she be so much surprised that for the moment she quite forget how to speak good english -rrb- now i be open out like the largest telescope that ever be good-by foot -lrb- for when she look down at she foot they seem to be almost out of sight they be get so far off -rrb- oh my poor little foot i wonder who will put on you shoe and stocking for you now dear just at this moment she head strike against the roof of the hall in fact she be now more than nine foot high and she at once take up the little golden key and hurry off to the garden door poor alice it be as much as she could do lie down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through be more hopeless than ever she sit down and begin to cry again shed gallon of tear until there be a large pool all round she about four inch deep and reach half down the hall after a time she hear a little pattering of foot in the distance and she hastily dry she eye to see what be come it be the white rabbit return splendidly dress with a pair of white kid glove in one hand and a large fan in the other he come trot along in a great hurry mutter to himself as he come oh the duchess the duchess or will not she be savage if i have keep she waiting alice feel so desperate that she be ready to ask help of anyone so when the rabbit come near she she begin in a timid voice : if you please sir -- the rabbit start violently drop the glove and the fan and scurry away into the darkness as hard as he could go alice take up the fan and glove and as the hall be very hot she keep fan herself all the time she go on talk dear dear how queer everything be to-day how puzzling it all be i 'll try if i know all the thing i use to know let I see : four time five be twelve and four time six be thirteen and four time seven be -- oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate but presently on look down at she hand she be surprise to see that she have put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid glove while she be talk how _ can _ i have do that she think i must be grow small again she get up and go to the table to measure herself by it and find that as nearly as she could guess she be now about two foot high and be go on shrink rapidly she soon find out that the cause of this be the fan she be hold and she drop it hastily just in time to save herself from shrink away altogether now she hasten to the little door but alas it be shut again i declare it be too bad that it be she say aloud and just as she speak she foot slip and in another moment splash she be up to she chin in salt water it be the pool of tear she have weep when she be nine foot high _ ii -- the pool of tear and the animal ' party _ just then she hear something splash about in the pool a little way off and she swim nearer to make out what it be at first she think it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remember how small she be now and she soon make out that it be only a mouse that have slip in like herself would it be of any use now think alice to speak to this mouse everything be so out-of-the-way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there be no harm in try so she begin o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i be very tired of swim about here o mouse the mouse look at she rather inquisitively and seem to she to wink with one of its little eye but it say nothing perhaps it do not understand english thought alice i daresay it be a french mouse come over with william the conqueror so she begin again _ ou est ma chatte _ which be the first sentence in she french lesson book the mouse give a sudden leap out of the water and seem to quiver all over with fright oh i beg you pardon cry alice hastily afraid that she have hurt the poor animal 's feeling i quite forget you do not like cat not like cat cry the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would _ you _ like cat if you be I the mouse be swim away from she as hard as it could go so she call softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we will not talk about cat or dog either if you do not like they when the mouse hear this it turn round and swam slowly back to she its face be quite pale -lrb- with passion alice thought -rrb- and it say in a low tremble voice let we get to the shore and i 'll tell you my history and you 'll understand why it be i hate cat and dog it be high time to go for the pool be get quite crowd with the bird and animal that have fall into it there be a duck and a dodo a lory and a eaglet and other curious creature alice lead the way and the whole party swam to the shore a very queer-looking party of drip bird and animal now gather on the bank of the pool of tear but they be not so queer as they talk first the mouse who be quite a person of authority among they try to dry they by tell they frightfully dry story from history but alice confess she be as wet as ever after she have listen to the bit of english history so the dodo propose a caucus race they all start off when they like and stop when they like the dodo say everybody have win and alice have to give the prize luckily she have some sweet which be not wet and there be just one for each of they but none for herself the party be anxious she too should have a prize and as she happen to have a thimble the dodo command she to hand it to he and then with great ceremony the dodo present it to she say we beg you acceptance of this elegant thimble and they all cheer of course alice think this all very absurd but they be dry now and begin eat they sweet then the mouse begin to tell alice its history and to explain why it hate c and d -- for it be afraid to say cat and dog but she soon offend the mouse first by mistake its long and sad tale for a long tail and next by think it mean knot when it say not so that it go off in a huff then when she mention dinah to the other and tell they that be the name of she cat the bird get uneasy and one by one the whole party gradually go off and leave she all alone just when she be begin to cry she hear a pattering of little foot and half think it might be the mouse come back to finish its story it be the white rabbit trot slowly back again and look anxiously about as he go as if he have lose something and she hear he mutter to himself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paw oh my fur and whisker she 'll get I execute as sure as ferret be ferret where _ can _ i have drop they i wonder very soon the rabbit notice alice and call out to she in a angry tone why mary ann what _ be _ you do out here run home this moment and fetch I a pair of glove and a fan quick now he take I for he housemaid she say to herself as she run how surprised he 'll be when he find out who i be but i would better take he he fan and glove -- that be if i can find they as she say this she come upon a neat little house on the door of which be a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engrave upon it inside the house she have a strange adventure for she try what the result of drinking from a bottle she find in the room would be and grow so large that the house could hardly hold she the white rabbit and some of he friend include bill the lizard throw a lot of little pebble through the window and these turn into tiny cake so alice eat some and be delighted to find that she begin shrink directly as soon as she be small enough to get through the door she run out of the house and find quite a crowd of little animal and bird wait outside the poor lizard bill be in the middle be hold up by two guinea-pig who be give it something out of a bottle they all make a rush at alice the moment she appear but she run off as hard as she could and soon find herself safe in a thick wood _ iii -- the adventure in the wood _ once in the wood she be anxious to get back to she right size again and then to get into that lovely garden but how peeping over a mushroom she behold a large blue caterpillar sit on the top with its arm fold quietly smoke a long hookah and take not the smallest notice of she or of anything else at length in a sleepy sort of way it begin talk to she and she tell it what she want so much -- to grow to she right size again i should like to be a _ little _ longer she say three inch be such a wretched height to be it be a very good height indeed say the caterpillar angrily rear itself upright as it speak -lrb- it be exactly three inch high -rrb- but i be not use to it plead poor alice in a piteous tone and she think to herself i wish the creature would not be so easily offend you 'll get use to it in time say the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and begin smoking again this time alice wait patiently until it choose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar take the hookah out of its mouth and yawn once or twice and shake itself then it get down off the mushroom and crawl away into the grass merely remark as it go one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of _ what _ the other side of what think alice to herself of the mushroom say the caterpillar just as if she have ask it aloud and in another moment it be out of sight alice remain look thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute try to make out which be the two side of it and as it be perfectly round she find this a very difficult question however at last she stretch she arm round it as far as they would go and break off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which be which she say to herself and nibble a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she feel a violent blow underneath she chin it have strike she foot she be a good deal frighten by this very sudden change but she feel that there be no time to be lose as she be shrink rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit she chin be press so closely against she foot that there be hardly room to open she mouth but she do it at last and manage to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit the next minute she have grow so tall that she neck rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaf and these green leaf be the tree of the wood but by nibble bit of mushroom she at last succeed in bring herself down to she usual height but oh dear in order to get into the first house she see she have to eat some more of the mushroom from she right hand and bring herself down to nine inch outside the house she see the fish-footmen and the frog-footman with invitation from the queen to the duchess ask she to play croquet the duchess live in the house and a terrible noise be go on inside and when the door be open a plate come crash out but alice get in at last and find a strange state of thing the duchess and she cook be quarrel because there be too much pepper in the soup the cook throw everything she could lay hand on at the duchess and nearly knock the baby 's nose off with a saucepan the duchess have the baby in she lap and toss it about ridiculously finally throw it in the most heartless way to alice she take it out of door and behold it turn into a little pig jump out of she arm and run away into the wood if it have grow up she say it would have make a dreadfully ugly child but it make rather a handsome pig i think she be a little startled now by see the cheshire cat -- which she have first see in the house of the duchess -- sit on a bough of a tree the cat only grin when it see alice it look good-natured she think still it have _ very _ long claw and a great many tooth so she feel that it ought to be treat with respect cheshire puss she say what sort of people live about here in _ that _ direction the cat say wave its right paw round live a hatter and in _ that _ direction -- wave the other paw -- live a march hare visit either you like they be both mad she have not go very far before she come in sight of the house of the march hare she think it must be the right house because the chimney be shape like ear and the roof be thatch with fur it be so large a house that she do not like to go nearer till she have nibble some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom and raise herself to about two foot high even then she walk up towards it rather timidly say to herself suppose it

set she down and strike a narrow track between the dark tree we march along silently and quickly stop now and then to listen if we be be follow we hear nothing but the crackle tread of some nocturnal beast of prey or the cry of some animal in the agony of death on come to a opening in the forest i make a shelter for the night atalum then throw herself at my foot and clasp my knee and again beg I

they bind cord around my neck and foot and arm the end of these cord be fasten in the earth by means of peg and a band of warrior set to watch over I lay down on the cord so that i could not make a single movement of which they be not aware the song and dance gradually cease as night come on and the camp fire burnt low and red and in spite of my pain i too fall asleep i dream that someone be set I free and i seem to feel that sharp anguish which shoot along the nerve when rope which be bind so tightly as to stop the flow of blood be suddenly cut from the numbed limb the pain become so keen that it make I open my eye a tall white figure be bend over I silently cut my cord it be atalum i rise up and follow she through the sleep camp when we be out of ear-shot she tell I that she have bribe the medicine man of she tribe and bring some barrel of fire-water into the camp and make all the warrior drunk with it drunkenness no doubt prevent the creek from follow we for a day or two and if afterwards they pursue we they probably turn to the west think that we have set out in the direction of the country of natchez but we have go north track we way by the moss grow on the trunk of the tree _ ii -- the magic of the forest _ the creek have strip I almost naked but atalum make I a dress out of the inner bark of the ash-tree and sew some rat-skin into moccasin i in turn weave garland of flower for she head as we tramp along through the great forest of florida oh how wildly beautiful the scene be through which we pass nearly all the tree in florida be cover with a white moss which hang from they branch to the ground at night-time when the moonlight fall pearly gray on the indeterminate crest of the forest the tree look like a army of phantom in long trail veil in the daytime a crowd of large beautiful butterfly brilliant hum bird and blue-winged jay and parroquet come and cling to the moss which then resemble a white tapestry embroider with splendid and vary hue every evening we make a great fire and build a shelter out of a large hollow piece of bark fix on four stake the forest be full of game which i easily bring down with the bow and arrow i take when we flee from the camp and as it be now autumn the forest be hang with fruit every day i become more and more joyful but atalum be strangely quiet sometimes as i suddenly turn my head to see why she be so silent i would find she gazing at I she eye burn with passion sometimes she would kneel down and clasp she hand in prayer and weep like a woman with a broken heart what frighten I above all be the secret thought that she try to conceal in the depths of she soul but now and then half reveal in she wild sorrowful and lovely eye oh how many time do she tell I : ` yes i love you chactas i love you but i can never be you wife ' i could not understand she one minute she would cling round my neck and kiss I another when i wish in turn to caress she she would repulse I ` but as i intend atalum to become a christian what be there to prevent we marry ' i say again and again and every time i ask this question she burst into tear and would not answer but the wild loneliness the continual presence of my beloved yes even the hardship of we wander life increase the force of my longing a hundred time i be ready to fold atalum to my breast a hundred time i propose to build she a hut in the wide uninhabited wilderness and live my life out there by she side oh rené my son if you heart be ever deeply trouble by love beware of loneliness great passion be wild and solitary thing by transport they into the wilderness you give they full power over you soul but in spite of this atalum and i live together in the great forest like brother and sister on and on we march through vault of flowery smilax where liana with strange and gorgeous blossom snare we foot in they twine ropy stem enormous bat flutter in we face rattlesnake rattle around we and bear and carcajous -- those little tiger that crouch on the branch of tree and leap without warn on they prey -- make the latter part of we journey full of strange peril and difficulty for after travel for twenty-seven day we cross the alleghany mountain and get into a tract of swampy wooded ground at sunset a tempest arise and darken all the heaven then the sky open and the noise of the tempestuous forest be drown in long rolling detonation of thunder and the wild lightning flame down upon we and set the forest on fire crouch down under the bent trunk of a birch-tree with my beloved on my lap i sheltered she from the streaming rain and warm she naked foot in my hand what care i though the very heaven break above I and the earth rock to its foundation the soft warm arm of atalum be around my neck she breast lay against my breast and i feel she heart beat as wildly as my own ' o my beloved ' i say ` open you heart to I and tell I the secret that make you so sorrowful do you weep at leave you native land ' ` no ' she say

on the tombstone two woman approach even as the word sacred to the memory of laura lady glyde swam before my eye one of they lift she veil it be laura in a poor quarter of london i take up my abode with laura and miss halcombe and while my poor laura slowly recover she health and spirit i devoted myself to the support of the little household and to unravel the mystery which surround the event i have here record from mr clement who have befriend poor anne catherick i learn that mr catherick have have secret meeting year before with sir percival glyde in the vestry of the church at welmingham to establish the exact relation between mr catherick and sir percival i visit welmingham pursue by the baronet 's agent my interview with mr catherick satisfy I that sir percival be not the father of anne and that they secret meeting in the vestry have reference to some object other than romance the contemptuous way in which mr catherick speak of sir percival 's mother set I think i visit the vestry where the meeting have take place and examine the register discover at the bottom of one of the page compress into a very small space the entry of sir felix glyde 's marriage with the mother of sir percival hearing from the sexton that a old lawyer in the neighbouring town have a copy of this register i visit he and find that he copy do not contain the entry of this marriage here be the secret at last sir percival be the illegitimate son of he father and have forge this entry of he father 's marriage in order to secure the title and estate mr catherick be the only person who know of the plot in a fit of ill-temper she have tell she daughter anne that she possess a secret that could ruin the baronet anne herself never know the secret but foolishly repeat she mother 's word to sir percival and the price of she temerity be incarceration in a private asylum i return post-haste to welmingham to secure a copy of the forge entry it be night as i approach the church a man stop I mistake I for sir percival glyde a light in the vestry show to I that sir percival have anticipate my discovery and have secretly visit the church for the purpose of destroy the evidence of he crime but a terrible fate await he even as i approach the church a huge tongue of flame shoot up into the night sky as i rush forward i could hear the baronet vainly seek to escape from the vestry the lock be hamper and he could not get out i try to force a entry but by the time the flame be under control the end have come we find the char remains of the man who have walk through life as sir percival clyde lie by the door the mystery be now unravel and i be free to marry my darling the only other point that seem to need clear up be the parentage of the unfortunate anne catherick that be elucidate by mr catherick herself the father of anne be philip fairlie the father of laura -- a fact that account for the extraordinary likeness between the two girl but though we tribulation seem to be at a end we have yet to establish the identity of laura and to deal with count fosco to miss halcombe the count have write a letter expressive of he admiration and beg she for she own sake to let matter be i know the count be a dangerous enemy who would not hesitate to employ murder if necessary to gain he end but i be determine to re-establish the identity of laura miss halcombe 's journal afford I a clue i find there a statement that on the occasion of he first visit to black-water park the count have be very concern to know whether there be any italian in the neighborhood without hope that anything would result from the maneuver i follow the count one night in the company of my friend professor pesca to the theater the professor do not recognize fosco but when the count stare round the theater focus he glass on pesca i see a look of unmistakable terror come over he countenance he at once rise from he seat and leave the place we follow the professor be very grave and it be quite a different man to the light-hearted little italian that i know who related to I a strange chapter in he life as a young man pesca have belong to a secret society for the removal of tyrant he be still a member of the society and could be call upon to act at any time the count have also be a member of the society and have betray its secret hence he terror of see pesca i immediately make use of the weapon that have be place in my hand i go boldly to fosco 's house and offer to effect he escape from england in return for a full confession of he share in the abduction of lady glyde he threaten to kill I but realize that i have he at my mercy consent to my term this confession completely establish the identity of laura and she be publicly acknowledge by mr frederick fairlie laura and i have be marry some time before and we be now able to set off on we honeymoon we visit pari while there i chance to be attract by a large crowd that surge round the door of the morgue force my way through i see lie within the body of count fosco there be a wound exactly over he heart and on he arm be two deep cut in the shape of the letter t -- the symbol of he treason to the secret brotherhood when we return to england we live comfortably on the income i be able to earn by my profession a son be bear to we and when frederick fairlie die it be marion halcombe who have be the good angel of we life

lonely life with no playfellow and no friend of he own age he long to be friend with this strong-looking honest youth who have come so suddenly into he life while john have be so tender in help phinea

to phinea mr fletcher give he a job at the tannery although at first the worthy quaker be not altogether sure of john 's character soon however the two lad be fast friend and spend much of they time together john halifax could read but he have not yet learn to write so phineas become he friendly tutor and repay he devotion by teach he all he know the year wear away john halifax labor faithfully if not always contentedly in the tannery and in time old mr fletcher find he worthy of the highest trust john come to be manager of the business and to live in the house of he master in knowledge too he have grow for phinea have prove a good tutor and john so apt a pupil that before long phinea confess that john know more than himself _ ii -- ursulum march _ it happen that john and phinea be spend the summer day at the rural village of enderley where they live at rise cottage enderley be not far from norton bury and every day john ride there to look after the tannery and the flour-mill which have recently be add to mr fletcher 's now flourish business this rise cottage be really two house in one of which the young man live while a invalid gentleman and he daughter occupy the other john halifax have note this young lady in he walk across the breezy downs and think she the sweetest creature he have see later when he get to know that she name be ursulum he be thrill with happy memory of the little girl who have throw he the slice of bread for he have hear she call by that same name he wonder if this might be she grow into a young woman ere long he come to know he pretty neighbor to companion she in rural walk no artist ever paint a more attractive picture than these two make step briskly across the wind-swept upland she with she sparkling dark eye she great mass of brown curl escape from she hood and john with he frank ruddy face and he fine swinging manly figure ursulum 's father who have come here ail die at the cottage and be bury in enderley churchyard he have be the same henry march whose life john have save year before when the avon be in flood he be cousin to squire brithwood who also owe he life to john on the same occasion unhappily ursulum 's fortune be leave in the keep of that highly undesirable person john be very sad at the thought of ursulum leave the cottage for the squire 's home at mythe house for he know that she have be happier there in the sweet country retreat than she would ever be in the ill-conducted household of she guardian she too have regret at the thought of go as john and she have become fast friend he tell she that mr brithwood would probably deny he right to be consider a friend of hers and would not allow he claim to be think a gentleman though a poor one it be right he pursue on she expression of surprise that you should know who and what i be to whom you be give the honor of you kindness perhaps you ought to have know before but here at enderley we seem to be equal -- friend i have indeed feel it so then you will the sooner pardon my not tell you -- what you never ask and i be only too ready to forget -- that we be _ not _ equal -- that be society would not regard we as such and i doubt if even you yourself would wish we to be friend why not because you be a gentlewoman and i be a tradesman she sit -- the eyelash droop over she flushed cheek -- perfectly silent john 's voice grow firmer prouder there be no hesitation now my calling be as you will hear at norton bury that of a tanner i be apprentice to abel fletcher phinea 's father mr fletcher she look up at he with a mingled look of kindliness and pain ay phinea be a little less beneath you notice than i be he be rich and have be well educate i have have to educate myself i come to norton bury six year ago -- a beggar-boy no not quite so bad as that for i never beg i either work or starve the earnestness the passion of he tone make miss march lift she eye but they fall again yes phinea find I starve in a alley we stand in the rain opposite the mayor 's house a little girl -- you know she miss march -- come to the door and throw out to I a bit of bread now indeed she start you be that you john pause and he whole manner change into softness as he resume i never forget that little girl many a time when i be incline to do wrong she keep I right -- the remembrance of she sweet face and she kindness that face be press against the sofa where she sit miss march be all but weep i be glad to have meet she again he go on and glad to have be able to do she some small good in return for the infinite good she once do I i shall bid she farewell now at once and altogether a quick involuntary turn of the hidden face seem to ask he why because john say the world say we be not equal and it would be neither for miss march 's honor nor mine do i try to force upon it the truth -- which i may prove openly one day -- that we _ be _ equal miss march look up at he -- it be hard to say with what expression of pleasure of pride or simple astonishment perhaps a mingling of all then she eyelid fall she leave arm be hang over the sofa the scar be visible enough john take the hand and press he lip to the place where the wound have be poor little hand -- bless little hand he murmur may god bless it evermore _ iii -- the rise of john halifax _ after john halifax have return to norton bury he be seize with fever and for a time he recovery seem doubtful in he delirium he call aloud for ursulum and dream that she have come to sit with he ask he to live for she sake phinea in he anxiety for he friend bring ursulum to he and the dream come true for she do ask he to live for she sake not long after he recovery john halifax become mr fletcher 's partner go to london on behalf of the business he meet there the great statesman mr pitt who be impress with the natural ability of the young man john 's reputation for honesty and sound commonsense have now grow so great at norton bury that when he return there he find himself one of the most respected man in the town although still far from be rich he be no longer a poor worker and as ursulum be willing to share he life they boldly determine to be marry in spite of she guardian who assert that john would never touch a penny of ursulum 's fortune they contrived however to be happy without it for he refuse to go to law to recover he wife 's money and be determine he would work honestly to support she with the death of old mr fletcher however come misfortune for it be find that the tannery be no longer a pay property and there be only the mill to go on with at this time ursulum 's relative lord luxmore who be anxious to see the catholic emancipation bill pass think he could use john halifax for he purpose by offer to get he return to parliament for the rotten borough of kingswell the member for which be then elect by only fifteen voter twelve of these be tenant of lord luxmore and the other three of phinea but although john would have support the bill he be too honest to let himself be elect for a rotten borough so he decline and luxmore next try to win he over by offer the lease of some important cloth-mill he own but these he would not take on credit and he have no money to pay for they at this juncture ursulum tell luxmore about the behavior of he kinsman brithwood with the result that he lordship go to brithwood and make he turn over the money to she when john now purchase the lease of the mill he lordship think that he have secure he firmly and that halifax would use he great and grow influence with the people of the district to further luxmore 's political scheme while all this be go on young lord ravenel the son and heir of luxmore have be a constant visitor at the halifax home and delighted in the company of john 's daughter halifax have now three child : two boy name guy and edmund and muriel who alas have be bear blind perhaps on account of she infirmity she have be the pet of she parent but she be of a gentle nature and be beautiful to look upon even with she sightless eye the time for the election of the member for kingswell have come round and as luxmore have fail to induce john halifax to stand he put up a pliable nominee but he be greatly mistake in suppose that john would use he influence to make the handful of voter most of whom be employ in he mill vote for luxmore 's man instead of that halifax advise they to be honest and vote as they think right with the result that luxmore promptly evict they from they home but john find new home for they as he riches increase he buy a stately country mansion name beechwood not far from rise cottage ever dear in memory to he another son walter be bear there and everything seem to smile on he in he beautiful country home luxmore now seek to injure he by divert the water from he cloth-mill and leave he great wheel idle halifax could have take he to law but instead of that he set up a strange new-fangled thing call a steam-engine and he mill do better than ever find it useless to fight against the resourceful halifax luxmore go abroad and leave he son lord ravenel alone at luxmore hall the young man despite he father 's unfriendly conduct be still a frequent visitor at beechwood and when poor muriel die he grief at she loss be only less than that of she parent the year pass by and happiness still reign at beechwood but ravenel have desert they until one day john halifax meet he greatly change from the gentle youth of the past at norton bury john invite he to ride over with he to enderley enderly how strange the word sound yet i should like to see the place again say ravenel who decide to accompany john halifax and phinea fletcher in they drive back to beechwood he inquire kindly for all the family and be tell that guy and walter be as tall as himself while the daughter -- you daughter say he lordship with a start oh yes i recollect -- baby maud be she at all like -- like -- no say john halifax neither say more than this but it seem as if they heart warm to one another knit by the same tender remembrance _ iv -- the journey 's end _ lord ravenel have return to reside again at luxmore hall and he visit to beechwood become as regular as they have be in the old day at the halifax home when muriel be alive it be the society of maud in which he lordship now delighted though he never forget the serene and happy day he have spend with she blind sister before long lord ravenel seek to be regard as suitor for the hand of maud who would thus have become the future countess of luxmore he say that he would wait two year for she if she father wish it but john halifax would make he no promise and urge he rather to endeavor first to become a more worthy man so that he might redeem the evil reputation which the conduct of he own father have bring upon the name of luxmore do you recognize what you be bear to be say halifax to he not only a nobleman but a gentleman not only a gentleman but a man -- man make in the image of god would to heaven that any poor word of mine could make you feel all that you be -- and all that you might be you mean mr halifax what i might have be -- now it be too late there be no such word as ` too late ' in the wide world -- nay not in the universe lord ravenel for a time sit silent then he rise to go and thank mr halifax for all she kindness in a voice choke with emotion for you husband i owe he more than kindness as perhaps i may prove some day if not try to believe the best of I you can good-bye it be not many week after this that the old earl of luxmore die in france and it then become know that he son who now succeed to the title have voluntarily give up he claim on the estate in order to pay the heavy debt of he worthless father the home at beechwood have lose another inmate -- for edmund be now marry -- when guy first go to paris have later sail for america year pass by and he become a successful merchant in boston and then one day he write home to say he be come back to the old country and be bring with he he partner the ship in which guy and he friend sail from america be wreck and ursulum in she grief at the suppose loss of she eldest son seem to be wear away when one day a strange gentleman stand in the doorway -- tall brown and bearded -- and ask to see miss halifax maud just glance at he then rise and say somewhat coldly will you be seat maud do not you know I where be my mother the return of the son whom she have give up for dead bring joy again to the heart of ursulum and she health seem to revive but it be clear that she day be now uncertain scarcely less than the delight in guy 's return be the discovery that he partner be none other than the new earl of luxmore who as plain mr william ravenel have by he life in america prove john halifax be right when he say it be not too late for he to model he life on line of true manliness he have indeed become all that john have desire of he -- a man and a gentleman -- so that maud be after all to be the countess of luxmore but the day of john halifax himself be now draw to a close and he be not without premonition of he end for in he talk with phinea fletcher who have remain he faithful companion all these year he speak as one would speak of a new abode a impending journey death come to he very gently one day at sunset just after he have smile to phinea when he old friend look towards lord luxmore and he future bride who be with a group of the young people have say i think sometimes john that william and maud will be the happiest of all the child he smile at this and a little later seem to be asleep but when maud come up and speak to he he be dead while he be sleep thus the master have call he he sudden end be so great a shock to the frail life of ursulum that when they bury john halifax in the pretty enderley churchyard they lay to rest with he he wife of three-and - thirty year who have be a widow but for a few hour \* \* \* \* \* george croly

study a weakness of the eye the vessel get under way early in the afternoon i join the crew and we haul out into the stream and come to anchor for the night the next day we be employ in preparation for sea on the follow night i stand my first watch during the first few day we have bad weather and i begin to feel the discomfort of a sailor 's life but i know that if i show any sign of want of spirit or of backwardness i should be ruin at once so i perform my duty to the best of my ability and after a time i feel somewhat of a man i can not describe the change which half a pound of cold salt beef and a biscuit or two produce in I after have take no sustenance for three day i be a new be as we have now a long spell of fine weather without any incident to break the monotony of we life there can be no better place to describe the duty regulation and custom of a american merchantman of which ours be a fair specimen the captain be lord paramount he stand no watch come and go when he

something when he be up on deck except at night and on sunday no conversation be allow among the crew at they duty when i first left port and find that we be keep regularly employ for a week or two i suppose that we be get the vessel into sea-trim and that it would soon be over and we should have nothing to do but to sail the ship but i find that it continue so for two year and at the end of two year there be as much to be do as ever if after all the labor on sail rig tar grease oiling varnish painting scrape scrub watch steer reefing furling brace make and set sail and pull haul and climb in every direction the merchant and captain think the sailor have not earn they twelve dollar a month they salt beef and hard bread they keep they pick oakum -- _ ad infinitum _ the philadelphium

and not know how to swim and be heavily dress with all those thing around he neck he probably sink immediately we pull astern in the direction in which he fall and though we know that there be no hope of save he yet no one wish to speak of return and we row about for nearly a hour unwilling to acknowledge to ourselves that we must give he up death be at all time solemn but never so much so as at sea and the effect of it remain upon the crew for some time there be more kindness show by the officer and by the crew to one another the lose man be seldom mention or be dismiss with a sailor 's rude eulogy well poor george be go he cruise be up soon he know he work and do he duty and be a good shipmate we have hardly return on board with we sad report before a auction be hold of the poor man 's clothes _ ii -- at the end of the earth _ on Tuesday November 25 we reach the island of juan fernandez we be then probably seventy mile from it and so high do it appear that i take it for a cloud

it be bad for other but worse for I who do not mean to be a sailor for life three or four year would make I a sailor in every respect mind and habit as well as body and would put all my companion so far ahead of I that college and a profession would be in vain to think of we be at the end of the earth in a country where there be neither law nor gospel and where sailor be at they captain 's mercy we lose all interest in the voyage care nothing about the cargo while we be only collect for other begin to patch we clothes and feel as though we be fix beyond hope of change _ iii -- a tyrannical

suffering of that poor class of being of whom i be then one _ iv -- i become a hide-curer _ the comfort of the voyage be evidently at a end though i certainly have some pleasant day on shore and as we be continually engage in transport passenger with they goods to and fro in addition to trade we assorted cargo of spirit tea coffee sugar spice raisin molasses hardware crockery-ware tinware cutlery

four boy regard two of whom a incident may here be chronicle there be a little boxing-match on board while we be at monterey in December a broad-backed big-headed cape cod boy about sixteen have be play the bully over a slender delicate-looking boy from one of the boston school one day george -lrb- the boston boy -rrb- say he would fight nat if he could have fair play the chief mate hear the noise and attempt to make peace but find it useless call all hand up range the crew in the waist mark a line on the deck bring the two boy up to it and make they toe the mark nat put in he double-fister start the blood and bring the black-and-blue spot all over the face and arm of the other whom we expect to see give in every moment but the more he be hurt the better he fight time after time he be knock nearly down but up he come again and face the mark as bold as a lion again to take the heavy blow which sound so as to make one 's heart turn with pity for he at length he come up to the mark the last time he shirt tear from he body he face cover with blood and bruise and he eye flash with fire and swear he would stand there until one or the other be kill and he set to like a young fury hurrah in the bow say the man cheer he on nat try to close with he but the mate stop that nat then come up to the mark but look white about the mouth and he blow be not give with half the spirit of he first he be evidently cow he have always be master and have nothing to gain and everything to lose whilst the other fight for honor and freedom and under a sense of wrong it would not do

have increase the size of my face so that i find it impossible to eat there be no relief to be have from the impoverished medicine-chest and the captain refuse to allow the steward to boil some rice for I tell he to eat salt junk and hard bread like the rest of they he say but the mate who be a man as well as a sailor smuggle a pan of rice into the galley and tell the cook to boil it for I and not to let the old man see it afterwards i be order by the mate to stay in my berth for two or three day it be not until Friday July 22 that have fail to make the passage of the strait of magellan we
