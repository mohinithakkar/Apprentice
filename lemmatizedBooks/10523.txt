produce by ted garvin charle m bidwell and the online distribute proofread team the alcesti of euripide translate into english rhyming verse with explanatory note by gilbert murray ll d d litt fba regius professor of greek in the university of oxford 1915 introduction the _ alcesti _ would hardly confirm its author 's right to be acclaimed the most tragic of the poet it be doubtful whether one can call it a tragedy at all yet it remain one of the most characteristic and delightful of euripidean drama as well as by modern standard the most easily actable and i notice that many judge who display nothing but a fierce satisfaction in send other play of that author to the block or the treadmill show a certain human weakness in sentence the gentle daughter of pelia the play have be interpret in many different way there be the old unsophisticated view well set forth in paley 's preface of 1872 he regard the _ alcesti _ simply as a triumph of pathos especially of that peculiar sort of pathos which come most home to we with we view and partiality for domestic life as for the character that of alcesti must be acknowledge to be pre-eminently beautiful one could almost imagine that euripide have not yet conceive that bad opinion of the sex which so many of the subsequent drama exhibit but the rest be hardly well-drawn or at least pleasingly portray the poet might perhaps have he please have exhibit admetus in a more amiable point of view this criticism be not very trenchant but its weakness be due i think more to timidity of statement than to lack of perception paley do see that a character may be well-drawn without necessarily be pleasing and even that he may be eminently please as a part of the play while very displease in himself he see that euripide may have have he own reason for not make admetus a ideal husband it seem odd that such point should need mention but greek drama have always suffer from a school of critic who approach a play with a greater equipment of aesthetic theory than of dramatic perception this be the characteristic defect of classicism one mark of the school be to demand from dramatist hero and heroine which shall satisfy its own ideal and though there be in the new comedy a mask know to pollux as the entirely-good young man -lrb- -lrb- greek : panchraesto neanisko -rrb- -rrb- such a character be fortunately unknown to classical greek drama the influence of this classicist tradition have lead to a timid and unsatisfying treatment of the _ alcesti _ in which many of the most striking and unconventional feature of the whole composition be either ignore or smooth away as a natural result various lively-minded reader proceed to overemphasize these particular feature and be carry into eccentricity or paradox alfr schöne for instance fix he attention on just those point which the conventional critic pass over decide simply that the _ alcesti _ be a parody and find it very funny -lrb- _ die alkesti von euripide _ kiel 1895 -rrb- i will not dwell on other criticism of this type there be those who have take the play for a criticism of contemporary politics or the current law of inheritance above all there be the late dr verrall 's famous essay in _ euripide the rationalist _ explain it as a psychological criticism of a suppose delphic miracle and argue that alcesti in the play do not rise from the dead at all she have never really die she only have a sort of nervous catalepsy induce by all the suggestion of death by which she be surround now dr verrall 's work as always stand apart even if wrong it have its own excellence its special insight and its extraordinary awakening power but in general the effect of read many criticism on the _ alcesti _ be to make a scholar realize that for all the seeming simplicity of the play competent grecian have be strangely bewilder by it and that after all there be no great reason to suppose that he himself be more sensible than he neighbor this be depressing none the less i can not really believe that if we make patient use of we available knowledge the _ alcesti _ present any startling enigma in the first place it have long be know from the remnant of the ancient didascalium or official notice of production that the _ alcesti _ be produce as the fourth play of a series that be it take the place of a satyr-play it be what we may call pro-satyric -lrb- see the present writer 's introduction to the _ rhesus _ -rrb- and we should note for what it be worth the observation in the ancient greek argument : the play be somewhat satyr-like -lrb- -lrb- greek : saturiphkoteron -rrb- -rrb- it end in rejoice and gladness against the tragic convention now we be of late year begin to understand much better what a satyr-play be satyr have of course nothing to do with satire either etymologically or otherwise satyr be the attendant daemon who form the kômos or revel rout of dionysus they be represent in diver fantastic form the human or divine be mix with that of some animal especially the horse or wild goat like dionysus himself they be connect in ancient religion with the renewal of the earth in spring and the resurrection of the dead a point which student of the _ alcesti _ may well remember but in general they represent mere joyous creature of nature unthwarted by law and unchecked by self-control two note be especially strike by they : the passion and the absurdity of half-drunken reveller and the joy and mystery of the wild thing in the forest the rule be that after three tragedy proper there come a play still in tragic diction with a traditional saga plot and heroic character in which the chorus be form by these satyr there be a deliberate clash a effect of burlesque but of course the clash must not be too brutal certain character of the heroic saga be so to speak at home with satyr and other be not to take we extant specimen of satyr-play for instance : in the _ cyclops _ we have odysseus the heroic trickster in the fragmentary _ ichneuta _ of sophocle we have the nymph cyllene hide the baby herme from the chorus by the most barefaced and pleasant lie later no doubt there be a entrance of the infant thief himself autolycus sisyphus thersite be all satyr-play hero and congenial to the satyr atmosphere but the most congenial of all the one hero who exist always in a atmosphere of satyr and the kômos until euripide make he the central figure of a tragedy be heracle -lrb- footnote : the character of heracle in connexion with the kômos already indicate by wilamowitz and dieterich -lrb- _ herakle _ pp 98 ff _ pulcinellum _ pp 63 ff -rrb- have be illuminatingly develop in a unpublished monograph by mr jak thomson of aberdeen -rrb- the complete satyr-play have a hero of this type and a chorus of satyr but the complete type be refine away during the fifth century and one stage in the process produce a play with a normal chorus but with one figure of the satyric or revelling type one might almost say the comic type if for the moment we may remember that that word be directly derive from ` kômos ' the _ alcesti _ be a very clear instance of this pro-satyric class of play it have the regular tragic diction mark here and there -lrb- 393 756 780 etc -rrb- by slight extravagance and form of word which be sometimes epic and sometimes over-colloquial it have a regular saga plot which have already be treat by the old poet phrynichus in he _ alcesti _ a play which be now lose but seem to have be satyric and it have one character straight from the satyr world the heroic reveller heracle it be all in keep that he should arrive tired should feast and drink and sing should be suddenly sober and should go forth to battle with death it be also in keep that the contest should have a half-grotesque and half-ghastly touch the grapple amid the grave and the crack rib \* \* \* \* \* so much for the traditional form as for the subject euripide receive it from phrynichus and doubtless from other source we can not be sure of the exact form of the story in phrynichus but apparently it tell how admetus king of pherae in thessaly receive from apollo a special privilege which the god have obtain in true satyric style by make the three fate drunk and cajole they this be that when he appoint time for death come he might escape if he could find some volunteer to die for he he father and mother from whom the service might have be expect refuse to perform it he wife alcesti though no blood relation handsomely undertake it and die but it so happen that admetus have entertain in he house the demi-god heracle and when heracle hear what have happen he go out and wrestle with death conquer he and bring alcesti home give this form and this story the next question be : what do euripide make of they the general answer be clear : he have apply he usual method he accept the story as give in the tradition and then represent it in he own way when the tradition in question be really heroic we know what he way be he preserve and even emphasize the stateliness and formality of the attic stage convention but in the meantime he have subject the story and its character to a keener study and a more sensitive psychological judgment than the simple thing be originally mean to bear so that many character which pass as heroic or at least presentable in the kindly remoteness of legend reveal some strange weakness when bring suddenly into the light when the tradition be satyric as here the same process produce almost a opposite effect it be somewhat as though the main plot of a gross and jolly farce be ponder over and make more true to human character till it emerge as a refine and rather pathetic comedy the make drunk of the three gray sister disappear one can only just see the trace of its have once be present the revelling of heracle be touch in with the lightest of hand it be little more than symbolic and all the figure in the story instead of be leave broadly comic or have they psychology neglect be treat delicately sympathetically with just that faint touch of satire or at least of amusement which be almost inseparable from a close interest in character what be admetus really like this gallant prince who have win the affection of such great guest as apollo and heracle and yet go round ask other people to die for he who in particular accept he wife 's monstrous sacrifice with satisfaction and gratitude the play portray he well generous innocent artistic affectionate eloquent impulsive a good deal spoil unconsciously insincere and no doubt fundamentally selfish he hate the thought of die and he hate lose he wife almost as much why need she die why could it not have be some one less important to he he feel with emotion what a beautiful act it would have be for he old father my boy you have a long and happy life before you and for I the sand be well-nigh run out do not seek to dissuade I i will die for you admetus could compose the speech for he a touching scene a noble farewell and all the dreadful trouble solve -- so conveniently solve and the miserable self-blinded old man could not see it euripide seem to have take positive pleasure in admetus much as meredith do in he famous egoist but euripide all through be kinder to he victim than meredith be true admetus be put to obvious shame publicly and helplessly the chorus make discreet comment upon he the handmaid be outspoken about he one feel that alcesti herself for all she tender kindness have see through he finally to make thing quite clear he old father fight he openly tell he home-truth upon home-truth tear away all he protective screen and leave he with he self-respect in tatters it be a fearful ordeal for admetus and after he first fury he take it well he come back from he wife 's burial a changed man he say not much but enough i have do wrong i have only now learn my lesson i imagine i could save my happy life by forfeit my honor and the result be that i have lose both i think that a careful reading of the play will show a almost continuous process of self-discovery and self-judgment in the mind of admetus he be a man who blind himself with word and beautiful sentiment but he be not thick-skinned or thick-witted he be not a brute or a cynic and i think he do learn he lesson not completely and for ever but as well as most of we learn such lesson the beauty of alcesti be quite untouched by the dramatist 's keener analysis the strong light only increase its effect yet she be not by any mean a mere blameless ideal heroine and the character which euripide give she make a admirable foil to that of admetus where he be passionate and romantic she be simple and homely while he be still refuse to admit the fact and beseech she not to desert he she in a gentle but businesslike way make he promise to take care of the child and above all thing not to marry again she could not possibly trust admetus 's choice she be sure that the step-mother would be unkind to the child she might be a horror and beat they -lrb- l 307 -rrb- and when admetus have make a thrilling answer about eternal sorrow and the silencing of lyre and lute and the statue who shall be he only bride alcesti earnestly call the attention of witness to the fact that he have swear not to marry again she be not a artist like admetus there be poetry in she because poetry come unconsciously out of deep feeling but there be no artistic eloquence she love too be quite different from he to he he love for he wife and child be a beautiful thing a subject to speak and sing about as well as a emotion to feel but she love be hardly conscious she do not talk about it at all she be merely wrap up in the welfare of certain people first she husband and then he child to a modern romantic reader she insistence that she husband shall not marry again seem hardly delicate but she do not think about romance or delicacy to she any neglect to ensure due protection for the child would be as unnatural as to refuse to die for she husband indeed professor jl myre have suggest that care for the child 's future be the guide motive of she whole conduct there be first the danger of they be leave fatherless a dire calamity in the heroic age she could meet that danger by die herself then follow the danger of a stepmother she meet that by make admetus swear never to marry in the long run i fancy the effect of gracious loveliness which alcesti certainly make be not so much due to any word of she own as to what the handmaid and the serve man say about she in the final scene she be silent necessarily and rightly silent for all tradition know that those new-risen from the dead must not speak it will need a long _ rite de passage _ before she can freely commune with this world again it be a strange and daring scene between the three of they the humble and broken-hearted husband the triumphant heracle kindly and wise yet still touch by the mocking and blustrous atmosphere from which he spring and the silent woman who have see the other side of the grave it be always she way to know thing but not to speak of they the other character fall easily into they niche we have only to remember the old satyric tradition and to look at they in the light of they historical development heracle indeed half-way on he road from the roar reveller of the satyr-play to the suffering and err deliverer of tragedy be a little foreign to we notion but quite intelligible and strangely attractive the same historical method seem to I to solve most of the difficulty which have be feel about admetus 's hospitality heracle arrive at the castle just at the moment when alcesti be lie dead in she room admetus conceal the death from he and insist on he come in and enjoy himself what be we to think of this behavior be it magnificent hospitality or be it gross want of tact the answer i think be indicate above in the uncritical and boisterous atmosphere of the satyr-play it be natural hospitality not especially laudable or surprising from the analogy of similar story i suspect that admetus originally do not know he guest and receive not so much the reward of exceptional virtue as the blessing naturally due to those who entertain angel unawares if we insist on ask whether euripide himself in real life or in a play of he own free invention would have consider admetus 's conduct to heracle entirely praiseworthy the answer will certainly be no but it will have little bearing on the play in the _ alcesti _ as it stand the famous act of hospitality be a datum of the story its claim be admit on the strength of the tradition it be the act for which admetus be specially and marvellously reward therefore obviously it be a act of exceptional merit and piety yet the admission be make with a smile and more than one suggestion be allow to float across the scene that in real life such conduct would be hardly wise heracle who rise to tragic rank from a very homely cycle of myth be apt to bring other homely character with he he be a great killer not only of malefactor but of kêres or bogey such as old age and ague and the sort of death that we find in this play thanato be not a god not at all a king of terror one may compare he with the dancing skeleton who be call death in mediaeval writings when such a figure appear on the tragic stage one ask at once what relation he bear to hade the great olympian king of the unseen the answer be obvious thanato be the servant of hade a priest or sacrificer who be send to fetch the appoint victim the other character speak for themselves certainly phere can be trust to do so though we must remember that we see he at a unfortunate moment the aged monarch be not at he best except perhaps in mere fight power i doubt if he be really as cynical as he here profess to be \* \* \* \* \* in the above criticism i feel that i may have do what critic be so apt to do i have dwell on question of intellectual interest and perhaps thereby divert attention from that quality in the play which be the most important as well as by far the hardest to convey i mean the sheer beauty and delightfulness of the write it be the earliest dated play of euripide which have come down to we true he be over forty when he produce it but it be noticeably different from the work of he old age the number be smoother the thought less deeply scar the language more charming and less passionate if it be true that poetry be breed out of joy and sorrow one feel as if more enjoyment and less suffering

of mystery and many thing god bring to be past hope or fear and the end man look for cometh not and a path be there where no man think so have it fall here note p 3 prologue asclêpios -lrb- latin aesculapius -rrb- son of apollo the hero-physician by he miraculous skill heal the dead this transgress the divine law so zeus slew he -lrb- the particular dead man raise by he be hippolytus who come to life in italy under the name of virbius and be worship with artemi at aricium -rrb- apollo in revenge not presume to attack zeus himself kill the cyclops and be punish by be exile from heaven and make servant to a mortal there be several such story of god make servant to human being p 3 l 12 beguiling -rrb- -- see preface in the original story he make they drunk with wine -lrb- aesch _ eumenide _ 728 -rrb- as the allusion would doubtless be clear to the greek audience i have add a mention of wine which be not in the greek libation to the elder god such as the fate and eumenide have to be wineless historically this probably mean that the worship date from a time before wine be use in greece p 4 l 22 the stain of death must not come nigh my radiance -rrb- -- compare artemi in the last scene of the _ hippolytus _ the presence of a dead body would be a pollution to apollo though that of thánatos -lrb- death -rrb- himself seem not to be so it be rather thánatos who be dazzle and blind by apollo like a owl or bat in the sunlight p 5 l 43 rob I of my second prey -rrb- -- you first cheat I of admetus and now you cheat I of he substitute p 6 l 59 the rich would buy etc -rrb- -- here and throughout this difficult little dialogue i follow the reading of my own text in the _ bibliotheca oxoniensis _ p 7 l 74 to lay upon she hair my sword -rrb- -- as the sacrifice priest cut off a lock of hair from the victim 's head before the actual sacrifice p 8 l 77 chorus -rrb- -- the chorus consist of citizen probably elder of the city of pherae dr verrall have rightly point out that there be some general dissatisfaction in the town at admetus 's behavior -lrb- l 210 ff -rrb- these citizen come to mourn with admetus out of old friendship though they do not altogether defend he the chorus be very drastically break up into so many separate person converse with one another the treatment in the _ rhesus _ be similar but even bolder see _ rhesus _ pp 28-31 37-42 cf also the entrance-chorus of the _ trojan woman _ -lrb- pp 19-23 -rrb- and the _ medea _ -lrb- pp 10-13 -rrb- and ll 872 ff 889 ff pp 50 51 below instead of assign the various line definitely to first second third citizen and so on i have put a paragraphus -lrb- -- -rrb- the ancient greek sign for indicate a new speaker p 8 l 82 pelia ' daughter -rrb- -- _ ie _ alcestis p 8 l 92 paian -rrb- -- the healer the word survive chiefly as a cry for help and as a epithet or title of apollo or asclepio paian latin paean be also a cry of victory but the relation of the two meaning be not quite make out -lrb- pronounce rather like pah-yan -rrb- cf l 220 p 9 l 112 to wander o'er league of land -rrb- -- you could sometimes save a sick person by appeal to a oracle such as that of apollo in lycium or of zeus ammon in the libyan desert but now no sacrifice will help only asclepio be he still on earth might have help we -lrb- see on the prologue -rrb- p 12 l 150 ` fore god she die high-hearted -rrb- -- what impress the elder be the calm and deliberate way in which alcesti face these preparation p 12 l 162 before the hearth-fire -rrb- -- hestia the hearth-fire be a goddess the latin vesta and be address as mother it be characteristic in alcesti to think chiefly about happy marriage for the child p 12 l 182 happier perhaps more true she can not be -rrb- -- a famous line and open to parody cf aristophane _ knight _ 1251 -lrb- another wear this crown instead of I happier perhaps worse thief he can not be -rrb- and see on l 367 below p 15 l 228 heart have bleed -rrb- -- people have commit suicide for less than this p 16 l 244 o sun -rrb- -- alcesti have come out to see the sun and sky for the last time and say good-bye to they it be a rite or practice often mention in greek poetry she beautiful wander line about charon and he boat be the more natural because she be not die from any disease but be be mysteriously draw away by the power of death p 16 l 252 a boat two-oared -rrb- -- she see charon the boatman who ferry the soul of the dead across the river styx p 17 l 259 draw drawing -rrb- -- the creature whom she see draw she to the palace of the dead be certainly not charon who have no wing but be like a old boatman in a peasant 's cap and sleeveless tunic nor can he be hade the throned king to whose presence she must eventually go apparently therefore he must be thanato whom we have just see on the stage he be evidently suppose to be invisible to ordinary human eye p 18 l 280 alcesti 's speech -rrb- -- great simplicity and sincerity be the keynote of this fine speech alcesti do not make light of she sacrifice : she enjoy she life and value it she wish one of the old people have die instead she be very earnest that admetus shall not marry again chiefly for the child 's sake but possibly also from some little shadow of jealousy a modern dramatist would express all this if at all by a scene or a series of scene of conversation euripide always use the long self-revealing speech observe how little romantic love there be in alcesti though admetus be full of it see preface pp xiii xiv pp 19 20 l 328 ff admetus 's speech -rrb- -- if the last speech make we know alcestis this make we know admetus fully as well at one time the beauty and passion of it almost make we forget its ultimate hollowness at another this hollowness almost make we lose patience with its beautiful language in this state of balance the touch of satire in l 338 f -lrb- my mother i will know no more etc -rrb- and the fact that he speak immediately after the complete sincerity of alcesti conspire to weigh down the scale against admetus there can be no doubt that he mean and mean passionately all that he say only he could not quite manage to die when it be not strictly necessary p 20 l 355 if orpheus ' voice be mine -rrb- -- the bard and prophet orpheus go down to the dead to win back he wife eurydice hade and persephonê spell-bound by he music grant he prayer that eurydicê should return to the light on condition that he should go before she harping and should never look back to see if she be follow just at the end of the journey he look back and she vanish the story be tell with overpowering beauty in vergil 's fourth georgic p 21 l 367 oh not in death from thee divide -rrb- -- parody in aristophane ' _ archarnian _ 894 where it be address to a eel and the second line end in a beet-root fricassee see on l 182 p 23 l 393 ff the little boy 's speech -rrb- -- classical greek sculpture and vase-painting tend to represent child not like child but like diminutive man and something of the sort be true of greek tragedy the stately tragic convention have in the main to be maintain the child must speak a language suit for hero or at least for high poetry the quality of childishness have to be indicate by a word or so of child-language delicately admit amid the stateliness here we have -lrb- greek : maium -rrb- something like mummy at the beginning and -lrb- greek : neosso -rrb- chicken or little bird at the end otherwise most of the language be in the regular tragic diction and some of it doubtless seem to we unsuitable for a child if milton have have to make a child speak in _ paradise lose _ what sort of diction would he have give it the success or ill-success of such a attempt as this to combine the two style the heroic and the childlike depend on question of linguistic tact and can hardly be judge with any confidence by foreigner but i think we can see euripide here as in other place reach out at a effect which be really beyond the resource of he art and attain a result which though clearly imperfect be strangely move he get great effect from the use of child in several tragedy though he seldom let they speak they speak in the _ medea _ the _ andromache _ and _ suppliant _ and be mute figure in the _ trojan woman hecuba heracle _ and _ iphigenia in aulis _ we may notice that where he child do speak they speak only in lyric never in ordinary dialogue this be very significant and clearly right the breaking-down of the child seem to string admetus to self-control again p 25 l 428 ye chariot-lord -rrb- -- the plain of thessaly be famous for its cavalry p 25 l 436 ff chorus -rrb- -- the king black-browed be of course hade the gray hand at the helm and oar charon the tear that well the more that spread out from acheron the river of _ achê _ or sorrow p 25 l 445 ff alcesti shall be celebrate -- and no doubt worship -- at certain full-moon feast in athen and sparta especially at the carneium a great spartan festival hold at the full moon in the month carneio -lrb- august-september -rrb- who the ancient hero carno or carneio be be not very clearly state by the tradition but at any rate he be kill and the feast be mean to placate and perhaps to revive he resurrection be apt to be a feature of both moon-goddess and vegetation spirit p 27 l 476 entrance of heracle -rrb- -- generally in the tragic convention each character that enter either announce himself or be announce by some one on the stage but the figure of heracle with he club and lion-skin be so well know that he identity could be take for grant the leader at once address he by name p 27 l 481 the argive king -rrb- -- it be the doom of heracle from before he birth to be the servant of a worser man he master prove to be eurystheus king of tiryn or argo who be he kinsman and older by a day see _ iliad _ t 95 ff note the heroic quality of heracle 's answer in l 491 it do not occur to he to think of reward for himself p 27 l 483 diomede of thrace -rrb- -- this man distinguish in legend from the diomede of the _ iliad _ be a savage king who throw wayfarer to he man-eating horse such horse be not mere myth horse have often be train to fight with they tooth like carnivora for war purpose diomêdes be a son of arês the war-god or slayer as be the other wild tyrant mention just below lycâon the wolf-hero and cycnus the swan p 30 l 511 right welcome be she : _ ie _ joy -rrb- -- joy would be a strange visitor to I but i know you mean kindly p 30 l 518 ff not thy wife ` tis not alcesti -rrb- -- the rather elaborate misleading of heracle without any direct lie depend partly on the fact that the greek word -lrb- greek : gyna -rrb- mean both woman and wife -- the woman not of kin with admetus but much loved in the house who have live there since she father 's death leave she a orphan be of course alcesti but heracle mislead by admetus 's first answer suppose it be some dependant to whom the king happen to be attach he naturally propose to go away but with much reluctance allow himself to be over-persuade by admetus he have other friend in thessaly but the next castle would probably be several mile off the guest-chamber of the castle be apparently in a separate building with a connect passage as to admetus 's motive we must remember that the entertaining of heracle be a datum of the story in its simplest form see preface pp xiv xv in euripide admetus be perhaps actuate by a mixture of motive real kindness pride in he ancestral hospitality and a little vanity he like have the great son of zeus for a friend and he have never yet turn any one from he door euripide pass no distinct judgment on this act of admetus the leader in the dialogue blame he -lrb- art thou mad -rrb- and so do heracle hereafter p 56 but the chorus glorify he deed in a very delightful lyric perhaps this indicate the judgment we be mean to pass upon it on the plane of common sense it be doubtless all wrong but on that of imaginative poetry it be magnificent p 35 11 569-605 chorus -rrb- -- apollo worship as a shepherd god and a singer harper piper etc -lrb- song-changer -rrb- have be himself a stranger in this house that love the stranger : hence its great reward othry be the end of the mountain range to the south of pherae lake boibeïs be just across the narrow end of the plain to the north-east beyond it come mt pelion and the steep harbourless coast up to the north-west the plain of thessaly stretch far away towards the molossian mountain the wild beast gather round apollo as they do round orpheus -lrb- there where orpheus harp of old and the tree awake and know he and the wild thing gather to he as he pipe amid the broken glen he music manifold -- _ bacchae _ p 35 -rrb- p 37 l 614 scene with pherês -rrb- -- pherês be in tradition the eponymous hero of pherae _ ie _ the mythical person who be suppose to have give he name to the town it be only in this play that he have any particular character the scene give the reader a shock but be a brilliant piece of satirical comedy with a good deal of pathos in it too the line -lrb- 691 -rrb- -lrb- greek : chairei horon pho patera d' ou chairein dokei -rrb- -lrb- thou lovest the light thinkest thou thy father love it not -rrb- seem to I one of the most characteristic in euripide it have a peculiar mordant beauty in its absolutely simple language and one can not measure the intensity of feeling that may be behind it phere show great power of fight yet one feel he age and physical weakness see preface p xvi p 40 l 713 ff the quick thrust and parry be sometimes hard to follow in read though in act the sense would be plain enough admetus cry angrily oh live a longer life than zeus be that a curse say phere be you cursing because nobody do you any harm -lrb- _ ie _ since you clearly have nothing else to curse for -rrb- admetus : on the contrary i bless you i know you be greedy of life phere : _ i _ greedy it be _ you _ i believe that alcesti be die for p 42 l 732 acastus be alcesti 's brother son of pelia p 43 l 747 it be rare in greek tragedy for the chorus to leave the stage altogether in the middle of a play but they do so for example in the _ ajax _ of sophocle ajax be lose and the sailor who form the chorus go out to look for he when they be go the scene be suppose to shift and ajax enter alone arrange he own death this very effective scene of the revel heracle be to be explain i think by the satyr-play tradition see preface p 45 ll 782-785 there be four line rhyming in the greek here a odd and slightly drunken effect p 46 l 805 ff a woman dead of no one 's kin : why grieve so much -rrb- -- heracle be somewhat shameless as a greek would say he have much more delicacy when he be sober p 48 l 837 ff a fine speech leave one in doubt whether it be the outburst of a real hero or the vapouring of a half-drunken man just the effect intend electryon be a chieftain of tiryn he daughter alcmênê the tirynthian _ korê _ or earth-maiden be beloved of zeus or as other put it be choose by zeus to be the mother of the deliverer of mankind whom he be resolve to beget she be marry to amphitryon of thebe p 49 l 860 ff if heracle set out straight to the grave and admetus with the procession be return from the grave how be it they do not meet the answer be that attic drama seldom ask such question pp 49-54 ll 861-961 this threno or lamentation scene seem to we mind a little long we must remember -lrb- 1 -rrb- that a tragedy _ be _ a threno -- a _ trauerspiel _ -- and however much it develop in the direction of a mere entertainment the threnos-element be of primary importance -lrb- 2 -rrb- this scene have two purpose to serve first to illustrate the helpless loneliness of admetus when he return to he empty house and secondly the way in which remorse work in he mind till in ll 935-961 he make public confession that he have do wrong for both purpose one need the illusion of a long lapse of time p 53 l 945 ff the floor unswept -rrb- -- probably the floor really would be unswept in the house of a primitive thessalian chieftain whose wife be dead and she place unfilled but i doubt if the point would have be mention so straightforwardly in a real tragedy pp 54-55 l 966 ff that which need must be -rrb- -- ananke or necessity -- orphic rune -rrb- -- the charm inscribe by orpheus on certain tablet in thrace orphic literature and worship have a strong magical element in they p 55 l 995 ff a grave-mound of the dead -rrb- -- every exist greek tragedy have somewhere in it a taboo grave -- a grave which be either worship or specially avoid or somehow magical we may conjecture from this passage that there be in the time of euripide a sacred tomb near phera which receive worship and have the story tell about it that she who lay there have die for she husband pp 56-67 ll 1008-end this last scene must have be exceedingly difficult to compose and some critic have think it ineffective or worse to I it seem brilliantly conceive and write though of course it need to be read with the imagination strongly at work one must never forget the silent and veil woman on whom the whole scene centre i have try conjecturally to indicate the main line of she acting but of course other may read it differently to understand heracle in this scene one must first remember the traditional connexion of satyr -lrb- and therefore of satyric hero -rrb- with the re-awakening of the dead earth in spring and the return of human soul to they tribe dionysus be of all the various kourous the one most widely connect with resurrection idea and the satyr be he attendant daemon who dance magic dance at the return to life of semele or persephone and heracle himself in certain of he ritual aspect have similar function see je harrison _ themi _ pp 422 f and 365 ff or my _ four stage of greek religion _ pp 46 f this tradition explain to start with what heracle -- and this particular sort of revel heracle -- have to do in a resurrection scene heracle bring back the dead be a datum of the saga there remain then the more purely dramatic question about we poet 's treatment of the datum why for instance do heracle mystify admetus with the veil woman to break the news gently or to retort he own mystification upon he i think the latter admetus have say that a woman be dead heracle say : all right : here be ' a woman ' whom i want you to look after again what be the feeling of admetus himself first mere indignation and disgust at the utterly tactless proposal : then i think in 1061 ff -lrb- i must walk with care end of speech -rrb- a strange discovery about himself which amaze and humiliate he as he look at the woman he find himself feel how exactly like alcesti she be and then yearning towards she almost fall in love with she a most beautiful and poignant touch in modern language one would say that he subconscious nature feel alcestis there and respond emotionally to she presence he conscious nature believe the woman to be a stranger be horrify at he own apparent baseness and inconstancy p 57 l 1051 where in my castle etc -rrb- -- the castle be divide into two main part : a public _ megaron _ or great hall where the man live during the day and sleep at night and a private region rule by the queen and centring in the _ thalamo _ or royal bed-chamber if the new woman be take into this harem even if admetus never speak to she the world outside would surmise the worst and consider he dishonour p 66 l 1148 be righteous to thy guest as he would have thee be -rrb- -- do this mean go on be hospitable as you have be or learn after this not to take liberty with other guest it be hard to say p 66 l 1152 the feast day shall surely come now i must need away -rrb- -- a fine last word for heracle we have see he feast but that make a small part in he life he main life be to perform labor upon labor in service to he king euripide occasionally like this method of end a play not with a complete finish -lrb- greek _ catastrophê _ -rrb- but with the opening of a door into some further vista of endurance or adventure the _ trojan woman _ end by the woman go out to the greek ship to begin a life of slavery the _ rhesus _ with the doomed army of trojan gather bravely for a attack which we know will be disastrous here we have the story finish for admetus and alcesti but no rest for heracle see the note at the end of my _ trojan woman _ the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of alcesti by euripide
