all my predecessor impose on I a obligation i cheerfully fulfill -- to accompany the first and solemn act of my public trust with a avowal of the principle that will guide I in perform it and a expression of my feeling on assume a charge so responsible and vast in imitate they example i tread in the footstep of illustrious man whose superior it be we happiness to believe be not find on the executive calendar of any country among they we recognize the earliest and firmest pillar of the republic -- those by whom we national independence be first declare he who above all other contribute to establish it on the field of battle and those whose expand intellect and patriotism construct improved and perfect the inestimable institution under which we live if such man in the position i now occupy feel themselves overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all mark of they country 's confidence and by a consciousness of they inability adequately to discharge the duty of a office so difficult and exalted how much more must these consideration affect one who can rely on no such claim for favor or forbearance unlike all who have precede I the revolution that give we existence as one people be achieve at the period of my birth and whilst i contemplate with grateful reverence that memorable event i feel that i belong to a later age and that i may not expect my countryman to weigh my action with the same kind and partial hand so sensibly fellow-citizen do these circumstance press themselves upon I that i should not dare to enter upon my path of duty do i not look for the generous aid of those who will be associate with I in the various and coordinate branch of the government do i not repose with unwavering reliance on the patriotism the intelligence and the kindness of a people who never yet desert a public servant honestly labor in they cause and above all do i not permit myself humbly to hope for the sustain support of a ever-watchful and beneficent providence to the confidence and consolation derive from these source it would be ungrateful not to add those which spring from we present fortunate condition though not altogether exempt from embarrassment that disturb we tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad yet in all the attribute of a great happy and flourishing people we stand without a parallel in the world abroad we enjoy the respect and with scarcely a exception the friendship of every nation at home while we government quietly but efficiently perform the sole legitimate end of political institution -- in do the greatest good to the greatest number -- we present a aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be find how imperious then be the obligation impose upon every citizen in he own sphere of action whether limited or extend to exert himself in perpetuate a condition of thing so singularly happy all the lesson of history and experience must be lose upon we if we be content to trust alone to the peculiar advantage we happen to possess position and climate and the bounteous resource that nature have scatter with so liberal a hand -- even the diffused intelligence and elevated character of we people -- will avail we nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those political institution that be wisely and deliberately form with reference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger the blessing we enjoy the thoughtful framer of we constitution legislate for we country as they find it look upon it with the eye of statesman and patriot they see all the source of rapid and wonderful prosperity but they see also that various habit opinion and institution peculiar to the various portion of so vast a region be deeply fix distinct sovereignty be in actual existence whose cordial union be essential to the welfare and happiness of all between many of they there be at least to some extent a real diversity of interest liable to be exaggerate through sinister design they differ in size in population in wealth and in actual and prospective resource and power they vary in the character of they industry and staple production and -lrb- in some -rrb- exist domestic institution which unwisely disturb might endanger the harmony of the whole most carefully be all these circumstance weigh and the foundation of the new government lay upon principle of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise the jealousy which the smaller state might entertain of the power of the rest be allay by a rule of representation confessedly unequal at the time and design forever to remain so a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interest be counteract by limit strictly draw around the action of the federal authority and to the people and the state be leave unimpaired they sovereign power over the innumerable subject embrace in the internal government of a just republic except such only as necessarily appertain to the concern of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a unite community with the other nation of the world this provident forecast have be verify by time half a century teem with extraordinary event and elsewhere produce astonishing result have pass along but on we institution it have leave no injurious mark from a small community we have rise to a people powerful in number and in strength but with we increase have go hand in hand the progress of just principle the privilege civil and religious of the humblest individual be still sacredly protect at home and while the valor and fortitude of we people have remove far from we the slightest apprehension of foreign power they have not yet induce we in a single instance to forget what be right we commerce have be extend to the remotest nation the value and even nature of we production have be greatly change a wide difference have arise in the relative wealth and resource of every portion of we country yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to exist compact have continue to prevail in we council and never long be absent from we conduct we have learn by experience a fruitful lesson -- that a implicit and undeviating adherence to the principle on which we set out can carry we prosperously onward through all the conflict of circumstance and vicissitude inseparable from the lapse of year the success that have thus attend we great experiment be in itself a sufficient cause for gratitude on account of the happiness it have actually confer and the example it have unanswerably give but to I my fellow-citizen look forward to the far-distant future with ardent prayer and confide hope this retrospect present a ground for still deeper delight it impress on my mind a firm belief that the perpetuity of we institution depend upon ourselves that if we maintain the principle on which they be establish they be destine to confer they benefit on countless generation yet to come and that america will present to every friend of mankind the cheer proof that a popular government wisely form be want in no element of endurance or strength fifty year ago its rapid failure be boldly predict latent and uncontrollable cause of dissolution be suppose to exist even by the wise and good and not only do unfriendly or speculative theorist anticipate for we the fate of past republic but the fear of many a honest patriot overbalance he sanguine hope look back on these foreboding not hastily but reluctantly make and see how in every instance they have completely fail a imperfect experience during the struggle of the revolution be suppose to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the taxation requisite to discharge a immense public debt already incur and to pay the necessary expense of the government the cost of two war have be pay not only without a murmur but with unequaled alacrity no one be now leave to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully bear that may be necessary to sustain we civil institution or guard we honor or welfare indeed all experience have show that the willingness of the people to contribute to these end in case of emergency have uniformly outrun the confidence of they representative in the early stage of the new government when all feel the impose influence as they recognize the unequaled service of the first president it be a common sentiment that the great weight of he character could alone bind the discordant material of we government together and save we from the violence of contend faction since he death nearly forty year be go party exasperation have be often carry to its highest point the virtue and fortitude of the people have sometimes be greatly try yet we system purify and enhance in value by all it have encounter still preserve its spirit of free and fearless discussion blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling the capacity of the people for self-government and they willingness from a high sense of duty and without those exhibition of coercive power so generally employ in other country to submit to all needful restraint and exaction of municipal law have also be favorably exemplify in the history of the american state occasionally it be true the ardor of public sentiment outrun the regular progress of the judicial tribunal or seek to reach case not denounce as criminal by the exist law have display itself in a manner calculate to give pain to the friend of free government and to encourage the hope of those who wish for its overthrow these occurrence however have be far less frequent in we country than in any other of equal population on the globe and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hope that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence the generous patriotism and sound common sense of the great mass of we fellow-citizen will assuredly in time produce this result for as every assumption of illegal power not only wound the majesty of the law but furnish a pretext for abridge the liberty of the people the latter have the most direct and permanent interest in preserve the landmark of social order and maintain on all occasion the inviolability of those constitutional and legal provision which they themselves have make in a suppose unfitness of we institution for those hostile emergency which no country can always avoid they friend find a fruitful source of apprehension they enemy of hope while they foresee less promptness of action than in government differently form they overlook the far more important consideration that with we war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will but must be a measure of redress for injury sustain voluntarily resort to by those who be to bear the necessary sacrifice who would consequently feel a individual interest in the contest and whose energy would be commensurate with the difficulty to be encounter actual event have prove they error the last war far from impair give new confidence to we government and amid recent apprehension of a similar conflict we see that the energy of we country would not be want in ample season to vindicate its rights we may not possess as we should not desire to possess the extended and ever-ready military organization of other nation we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point have cease while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from invite aggression from abroad certain danger be foretell from the extension of we territory the multiplication of state and the increase of population we system be suppose to be adapt only to boundary comparatively narrow these have be widen beyond conjecture the member of we confederacy be already double and the number of we people be incredibly augmented the alleged cause of danger have long surpass anticipation but none of the consequence have follow the power and influence of the republic have rise to a height obvious to all mankind respect for its authority be not more apparent at its ancient than it be at its present limit new and inexhaustible source of general prosperity have be open the effect of distance have be avert by the inventive genius of we people develop and foster by the spirit of we institution and the enlarged variety and amount of interest production and pursuit have strengthen the chain of mutual dependence and form a circle of mutual benefit too apparent ever to be overlook in justly balance the power of the federal and state authority difficulty nearly insurmountable arise at the outset and subsequent collision be deem inevitable amid these it be scarcely believe possible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could remain uninjured from time to time embarrassment have certainly occur but how just be the confidence of future safety impart by the knowledge that each in succession have be happily remove overlook partial and temporary evil as inseparable from the practical operation of all human institution and look only to the general result every patriot have reason to be satisfy while the federal government have successfully perform its appropriate function in relation to foreign affair and concern evidently national that of every state have remarkably improve in protect and develop local interest and individual welfare and if the vibration of authority have occasionally tend too much toward one or the other it be unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system have be to strengthen all the exist institution and to elevate we whole country in prosperity and renown the last perhaps the greatest of the prominent source of discord and disaster suppose to lurk in we political condition be the institution of domestic slavery we forefather be deeply impressed with the delicacy of this subject and they treat it with a forbearance so evidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until the present period disturb the tranquillity of we common country such a result be sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism of they course it be evidence not to be mistake that a adherence to it can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other anticipated cause of difficulty or danger have not recent event make it obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from this spirit of forbearance be injurious to every interest that of humanity include amidst the violence of excited passion this generous and fraternal feeling have be sometimes disregard and standing as i now do before my countryman in this high place of honor and of trust i can not refrain from anxiously invoke my fellow-citizen never to be deaf to its dictate perceive before my election the deep interest this subject be begin to excite i believe it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiment in regard to it and now when every motive for misrepresentation have pass away i trust that they will be candidly weigh and understand at least they will be my standard of conduct in the path before I i then declare that if the desire of those of my countryman who be favorable to my election be gratified i must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the district of columbium against the wish of the slaveholding state and also with a determination equally decide to resist the slightest interference with it in the state where it exist i submit also to my fellow-citizen with fullness and frankness the reason which lead I to this determination the result authorize I to believe that they have be approve and be confide in by a majority of the people of the united state include those whom they most immediately affect it now only remain to add that no bill conflict with these view can ever receive my constitutional sanction these opinion have be adopt in the firm belief that they be in accordance with the spirit that actuate the venerated father of the republic and that succeed experience have prove they to be humane patriotic expedient honorable and just if the agitation of this subject be intend to reach the stability of we institution enough have occur to show that it have signally fail and that in this as in every other instance the apprehension of the timid and the hope of the wicked for the destruction of we government be again destine to be disappoint here and there indeed scene of dangerous excitement have occur terrifying instance of local violence have be witness and a reckless disregard of the consequence of they conduct have expose individual to popular indignation but neither mass of the people nor section of the country have be swerve from they devotion to the bond of union and the principle it have make sacred it will be ever thus such attempt at dangerous agitation may periodically return but with each the object will be better understand that predominate affection for we political system which prevail throughout we territorial limit that calm and enlighten judgment which ultimately govern we people as one vast body will always be at hand to resist and control every effort foreign or domestic which aim or would lead to overthrow we institution what can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this we look back on obstacle avoid and danger overcome on expectation more than realize and prosperity perfectly secure to the hope of the hostile the fear of the timid and the doubt of the anxious actual experience have give the conclusive reply we have see time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and we constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dread at the outset as beyond control present excitement will at all time magnify present danger but true philosophy must teach we that none more threatening than the past can remain to be overcome and we ought -lrb- for we have just reason -rrb- to entertain a abide confidence in the stability of we institution and a entire conviction that if administer in the true form character and spirit in which they be establish they be abundantly adequate to preserve to we and we child the rich blessing already derive from they to make we beloved land for a thousand generation that choose spot where happiness spring from a perfect equality of political rights for myself therefore i desire to declare that the principle that will govern I in the high duty to which my country call I be a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution as it be design by those who frame it look back to it as a sacred instrument carefully and not easily frame remember that it be throughout a work of concession and compromise view it as limit to national object regard it as leave to the people and the state all power not explicitly part with i shall endeavor to preserve protect and defend it by anxiously refer to its provision for direction in every action to matter of domestic concernment which it have intrust to the federal government and to such as relate to we intercourse with foreign nation i shall zealously devote myself beyond those limit i shall never pass to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my view on the various question of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it be probably unexpected before the suffrage of my countryman be confer upon I i submit to they with great precision my opinion on all the most prominent of these subject those opinion i shall endeavor to carry out with my utmost ability we course of foreign policy have be so uniform and intelligible as to constitute a rule of executive conduct which leave little to my discretion unless indeed i be willing to run counter to the light of experience and the known opinion of my constituent we sedulously cultivate the friendship of all nation as the condition most compatible with we welfare and the principle of we government we decline alliance as adverse to we peace we desire commercial relation on equal term be ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantage receive we endeavor to conduct we intercourse with openness and sincerity promptly avow we object and seek to establish that mutual frankness which be as beneficial in the dealings of nation as of man we have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in dispute whether internal or foreign that may molest other country regard they in they actual state as social community and preserve a strict neutrality in all they controversy well know the try valor of we people and we exhaustless resource we neither anticipate nor fear any design aggression and in the consciousness of we own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be call upon to exert we determination never to permit a invasion of we rights without punishment or redress in approach then in the presence of my assemble countryman to make the solemn promise that yet remain and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i be about to fill i bring with I a settle purpose to maintain the institution of my country which i trust will atone for the error i commit in receive from the people the sacred trust twice confide to my illustrious predecessor and which he have discharge so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success but unite as i have be in he counsel a daily witness of he exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to he country 's welfare agree with he in sentiment which he countryman have warmly support and permit to partake largely of he confidence i may hope that somewhat of the same cheer approbation will be find to attend upon my path for he i but express with my own the wish of all that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of he well-spent life and for myself conscious of but one desire faithfully to serve my country i throw myself without fear on its justice and its kindness beyond that i only look to the gracious protection of the divine be whose strengthen support i humbly solicit and whom i fervently pray to look down upon we all may it be among the dispensation of he providence to bless we beloved country with honor and with length of day may she way be way of pleasantness and all she path be peace march 4 1837

the senate and house of representative _ : the act of the 23d of June 1836 regulate the deposit of the public money and direct the employment of state district and territorial bank for that purpose make it the duty of the secretary of the treasury to discontinue the use of such of they as should at any time refuse to redeem they note in specie and to substitute other bank provide a sufficient number could be obtain to receive the public deposit upon the term and condition therein prescribe the general and almost simultaneous suspension of specie payment by the bank in may last render the performance of this duty imperative in respect to those which have be select under the act and make it at the same time impracticable to employ the requisite number of other upon the prescribed condition the specific regulation establish by congress for the deposit and safe-keeping of the public money have thus unexpectedly become inoperative i feel it to be my duty to afford you a early opportunity for the exercise of you supervisory power over the subject i be also lead to apprehend that the suspension of specie payment increase the embarrassment before exist in the pecuniary affair of the country would so far diminish the public revenue that the accrue receipt into the treasury would not with the reserved five million be sufficient to defray the unavoidable expense of the government until the usual period for the meeting of congress whilst the authority to call upon the state for a portion of the sum deposit with they be too restricted to enable the department to realize a sufficient amount from that source these apprehension have be justify by subsequent result which render it certain that this deficiency will occur if additional means be not provide by congress the difficulty experience by the mercantile interest in meet they engagement induce they to apply to I previously to the actual suspension of specie payment for indulgence upon they bond for duty and all the relief authorize by law be promptly and cheerfully grant the dependence of the treasury upon the avail of these bond to enable it to make the deposit with the state require by law lead I in the outset to limit this indulgence to the 1st of September but it have since be extend to the 1st of October that the matter might be submit to you further direction question be also expect to arise in the recess in respect to the October installment of those deposit require the interposition of congress a provision of another act pass about the same time and intend to secure a faithful compliance with the obligation of the united state to satisfy all demand upon they in specie or its equivalent prohibit the offer of any bank note not convertible on the spot into gold or silver at the will of the holder and the ability of the government with million on deposit to meet its engagement in the manner thus require by law be render very doubtful by the event to which i have refer sensible that adequate provision for these unexpected exigency could only be make by congress convince that some of they would be indispensably necessary to the public service before the regular period of you meeting and desirous also to enable you to exercise at the earliest moment you full constitutional power for the relief of the country i could not with propriety avoid subject you to the inconvenience of assemble at as early a day as the state of the popular representation would permit i be sure that i have do but justice to you feeling in believe that this inconvenience will be cheerfully encounter in the hope of render you meeting conducive to the good of the country during the earlier stage of the revulsion through which we have just pass much acrimonious discussion arise and great diversity of opinion exist as to its real cause this be not surprising the operation of credit be so diversified and the influence which affect they so numerous and often so subtle that even impartial and well-informed person be seldom find to agree in respect to they to inherent difficulty be also add other tendency which be by no means favorable to the discovery of truth it be hardly to be expect that those who disapprove the policy of the government in relation to the currency would in the excited state of public feeling produce by the occasion fail to attribute to that policy any extensive embarrassment in the monetary affair of the country the matter thus become connect with the passion and conflict of party opinion be more or less affect by political consideration and difference be prolong which might otherwise have be determine by a appeal to fact by the exercise of reason or by mutual concession it be however a cheer reflection that circumstance of this nature can not prevent a community so intelligent as ours from ultimately arrive at correct conclusion encourage by the firm belief of this truth i proceed to state my view so far as may be necessary to a clear understanding of the remedy i feel it my duty to propose and of the reason by which i have be lead to recommend they the history of trade in the united state for the last three or four year afford the most convincing evidence that we present condition be chiefly to be attribute to overaction in all the department of business -- a over-action derive perhaps its first impulse from antecedent cause but stimulate to its destructive consequence by excessive issue of bank paper and by other facility for the acquisition and enlargement of credit at the commencement of the year 1834 the banking capital of the united state include that of the national bank then exist amount to about $ 200000000 the bank note then in circulation to about ninety-five million and the loan and discount of the bank to three hundred and twenty-four million between that time and the 1st of January 1836 be the latest period to which accurate account have be receive we banking capital be increase to more than two hundred and fifty-one million we paper circulation to more than one hundred and forty million and the loan and discount to more than four hundred and fifty-seven million to this vast increase be to be add the many million of credit acquire by means of foreign loan contract by the state and state institution and above all by the lavish accommodation extend by foreign dealer to we merchant the consequence of this redundancy of credit and of the spirit of reckless speculation engender by it be a foreign debt contract by we citizen estimate in march last at more than $ 30000000 the extension to trader in the interior of we country of credit for supplies greatly beyond the want of the people the investment of $ 39500000 in unproductive public land in the year 1835 and 1836 whilst in the preceding year the sale amount to only four and a half million the creation of debt to a almost countless amount for real estate in exist or anticipate city and village equally unproductive and at price now see to have be greatly disproportionate to they real value the expenditure of immense sum in improvement which in many case have be find to be ruinously improvident the diversion to other pursuit of much of the labor that should have be apply to agriculture thereby contribute to the expenditure of large sum in the importation of grain from europe -- a expenditure which amount in 1834 to about $ 250000 be in the first two quarter of the present year increase to more than $ 2000000 and finally without enumerate other injurious result the rapid growth among all class and especially in we great commercial town of luxurious habit found too often on merely fancied wealth and detrimental alike to the industry the resource and the moral of we people it be so impossible that such a state of thing could long continue that the prospect of revulsion be present to the mind of considerate man before it actually come none however have correctly anticipate its severity a concurrence of circumstance inadequate of themselves to produce such widespread and calamitous embarrassment tend so greatly to aggravate they that they can not be overlook in consider they history among these may be mention as most prominent the great loss of capital sustain by we commercial emporium in the fire of December 1835 -- a loss the effect of which be underrate at the time because postpone for a season by the great facility of credit then exist the disturbing effect in we commercial city of the transfer of the public money require by the deposit law of June 1836 and the measure adopt by the foreign creditor of we merchant to reduce they debt and to withdraw from the united state a large portion of we specie however unwilling any of we citizen may heretofore have be to assign to these cause the chief instrumentality in produce the present state of thing the development subsequently make and the actual condition of other commercial country must as it seem to I dispel all remain doubt upon the subject it have since appear that evil similar to those suffer by ourselves have be experience in great britain on the continent and indeed throughout the commercial world and that in other country as well as in we own they have be uniformly precede by a undue enlargement of the boundary of trade prompt as with we by unprecedented expansion of the system of credit a reference to the amount of banking capital and the issue of paper credit put in circulation in great britain by bank and in other way during the year 1834 1835 and 1836 will show a augmentation of the paper currency there as much disproportioned to the real want of trade as in the united state with this redundancy of the paper currency there arise in that country also a spirit of adventurous speculation embrace the whole range of human enterprise aid be profusely give to project improvement large investment be make in foreign stock and loan credit for goods be grant with unbounded liberality to merchant in foreign country and all the means of acquire and employ credit be put in active operation and extend in they effect to every department of business and to every quarter of the globe the reaction be proportion in its violence to the extraordinary character of the event which precede it the commercial community of great britain be subject to the greatest difficulty and they debtor in this country be not only suddenly deprive of accustomed and expected credit but call upon for payment which in the actual posture of thing here could only be make through a general pressure and at the most ruinous sacrifice in view of these fact it would seem impossible for sincere inquirer after truth to resist the conviction that the cause of the revulsion in both country have be substantially the same two nation the most commercial in the world enjoy but recently the highest degree of apparent prosperity and maintain with each other the closest relation be suddenly in a time of profound peace and without any great national disaster arrest in they career and plunge into a state of embarrassment and distress in both country we have witness the same redundancy of paper money and other facility of credit the same spirit of speculation the same partial success the same difficulty and reverse and at length nearly the same overwhelming catastrophe the most material difference between the result in the two country have only be that with we there have also occur a extensive derangement in the fiscal affair of the federal and state government occasion by the suspension of specie payment by the bank the history of these cause and effect in great britain and the united state be substantially the history of the revulsion in all other commercial country the present and visible effect of these circumstance on the operation of the government and on the industry of the people point out the object which call for you immediate attention they be to regulate by law the safe-keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money to designate the fund to be receive and pay by the government to enable the treasury to meet promptly every demand upon it to prescribe the term of indulgence and the mode of settlement to be adopt as well in collect from individual the revenue that have accrue as in withdraw it from former depository and to devise and adopt such further measure within the constitutional competency of congress as will be best calculate to revive the enterprise and to promote the prosperity of the country for the deposit transfer and disbursement of the revenue national and state bank have always with temporary and limited exception be heretofore employ but although advocate of each system be still to be find it be apparent that the event of the last few month have greatly augmented the desire long exist among the people of the united state to separate the fiscal operation of the government from those of individual or corporation again to create a national bank as a fiscal agent would be to disregard the popular will twice solemnly and unequivocally express on no question of domestic policy be there stronger evidence that the sentiment of a large majority be deliberately fix and i can not concur with those who think they see in recent event a proof that these sentiment be or a reason that they should be change event similar in they origin and character have heretofore frequently occur without produce any such change and the lesson of experience must be forget if we suppose that the present overthrow of credit would have be prevent by the existence of a national bank proneness to excessive issue have ever be the vice of the banking system -- a vice as prominent in national as in state institution this propensity be as subservient to the advancement of private interest in the one as in the other and those who direct they both be principally guide by the same view and influence by the same motive will be equally ready to stimulate extravagance of enterprise by improvidence of credit how strikingly be this conclusion sustain by experience the bank of the united state with the vast power confer on it by congress do not or could not prevent former and similar embarrassment nor have the still greater strength it have be say to possess under its present charter enable it in the exist emergency to check other institution or even to save itself in great britain where it have be see the same cause have be attend with the same effect a national bank possess power far greater than be ask for by the warmest advocate of such a institution here have also prove unable to prevent a undue expansion of credit and the evil that flow from it nor can i find any tenable ground for the reestablishment of a national bank in the derangement allege at present to exist in the domestic exchange of the country or in the facility it may be capable of afford they although advantage of this sort be anticipate when the first bank of the united state be create they be regard as a incidental accommodation not one which the federal government be bind or could be call upon to furnish this accommodation be now indeed after the lapse of not many year demand from it as among its first duty and a omission to aid and regulate commercial exchange be treat as a ground of loud and serious complaint such result only serve to exemplify the constant desire among some of we citizen to enlarge the power of the government and extend its control to subject with which it should not interfere they can never justify the creation of a institution to promote such object on the contrary they justly excite among the community a more diligent inquiry into the character of those operation of trade toward which it be desire to extend such peculiar favor the various transaction which bear the name of domestic exchange differ essentially in they nature operation and utility one class of they consist of bill of exchange draw for the purpose of transfer actual capital from one part of the country to another or to anticipate the proceeds of property actually transmit bill of this description be highly useful in the movement of trade and well deserve all the encouragement which can rightfully be give to they another class be make up of bill of exchange not draw to transfer actual capital nor on the credit of property transmit but to create fictitious capital partaking at once of the character of note discount in bank and of bank note in circulation and swell the mass of paper credit to a vast extent in the most objectionable manner these bill have form for the last few year a large proportion of what be term the domestic exchange of the country serve as the means of usurious profit and constitute the most unsafe and precarious paper in circulation this species of traffic instead of be uphold ought to be discountenance by the government and the people in transfer its fund from place to place the government be on the same footing with the private citizen and may resort to the same legal means it may do so through the medium of bill draw by itself or purchase from other and in these operation it may in a manner undoubtedly constitutional and legitimate facilitate and assist exchange of individual found on real transaction of trade the extent to which this may be do and the best means of effect it be entitle to the fullest consideration this have be bestow by the secretary of the treasury and he view will be submit to you in he report but it be not design by the constitution that the government should assume the management of domestic or foreign exchange it be indeed authorize to regulate by law the commerce between the state and to provide a general standard of value or medium of exchange in gold and silver but it be not its province to aid individual in the transfer of they fund otherwise than through the facility afford by the post-office department as justly might it be call on to provide for the transportation of they merchandise these be operation of trade they ought to be conduct by those who be interested in they in the same manner that the incidental difficulty of other pursuit be encounter by other class of citizen such aid have not be deem necessary in other country throughout europe the domestic as well as the foreign exchange be carry on by private house often if not generally without the assistance of bank yet they extend throughout distinct sovereignty and far exceed in amount the real exchange of the united state there be no reason why we own may not be conduct in the same manner with equal cheapness and safety certainly this might be accomplish if it be favor by those most deeply interested and few can doubt that they own interest as well as the general welfare of the country would be promote by leave such a subject in the hand of those to whom it properly belong a system found on private interest enterprise and competition without the aid of legislative grant or regulation by law would rapidly prosper it would be free from the influence of political agitation and extend the same exemption to trade itself and it would put a end to those complaint of neglect partiality injustice and oppression which be the unavoidable result of interference by the government in the proper concern of individual all former attempt on the part of the government to carry its legislation in this respect further than be design by the constitution have in the end prove injurious and have serve only to convince the great body of the people more and more of the certain danger of blend private interest with the operation of public business and there be no reason to suppose that a repetition of they now would be more successful it can not be conceal that there exist in we community opinion and feeling on this subject in direct opposition to each other a large portion of they combine great intelligence activity and influence be no doubt sincere in they belief that the operation of trade ought to be assist by such a connection they regard a national bank as necessary for this purpose and they be disincline to every measure that do not tend sooner or later to the establishment of such a institution on the other hand a majority of the people be believe to be irreconcilably oppose to that measure they consider such a concentration of power dangerous to they liberty and many of they regard it as a violation of the constitution this collision of opinion have doubtless cause much of the embarrassment to which the commercial transaction of the country have lately be expose banking have become a political topic of the highest interest and trade have suffer in the conflict of party a speedy termination of this state of thing however desirable be scarcely to be expect we have see for nearly half a century that those who advocate a national bank by whatever motive they may be influence constitute a portion of we community too numerous to allow we to hope for a early abandonment of they favorite plan on the other hand they must indeed form a erroneous estimate of the intelligence and temper of the american people who suppose that they have continue on slight or insufficient grounds they persevere opposition to such a institution or that they can be induce by pecuniary pressure or by any other combination of circumstance to surrender principle they have so long and so inflexibly maintain my own view of the subject be unchanged they have be repeatedly and unreservedly announce to my fellow-citizen who with full knowledge of they confer upon I the two highest office of the government on the last of these occasion i feel it due to the people to apprise they distinctly that in the event of my election i would not be able to cooperate in the reestablishment of a national bank to these sentiment i have now only to add the expression of a increase conviction that the reestablishment of such a bank in any form whilst it would not accomplish the beneficial purpose promise by its advocate would impair the rightful supremacy of the popular will injure the character and diminish the influence of we political system and bring once more into existence a concentrated moneyed power hostile to the spirit and threaten the permanency of we republican institution local bank have be employ for the deposit and distribution of the revenue at all time partially and on three different occasion exclusively : first anterior to the establishment of the first bank of the united state secondly in the interval between the termination of that institution and the charter of its successor and thirdly during the limited period which have now so abruptly close the connection thus repeatedly attempt proved unsatisfactory on each successive occasion notwithstanding the various measure which be adopt to facilitate or insure its success on the last occasion in the year 1833 the employment of the state bank be guard especially in every way which experience and caution could suggest personal security be require for the safe-keeping and prompt payment of the money to be receive and full return of they condition be from time to time to be make by the depository in the first stage the measure be eminently successful notwithstanding the violent opposition of the bank of the united state and the unceasing effort make to overthrow it the select bank perform with fidelity and without any embarrassment to themselves or to the community they engagement to the government and the system promise to be permanently useful but when it become necessary under the act of June 1836 to withdraw from they the public money for the purpose of place it in additional institution or of transfer it to the state they find it in many case inconvenient to comply with the demand of the treasury and numerous and press application be make for indulgence or relief as the installment under the deposit law become payable they own embarrassment and the necessity under which they lay of curtail they discount and call in they debt increase the general distress and contribute with other cause to hasten the revulsion in which at length they in common with the other bank be fatally involve under these circumstance it become we solemn duty to inquire whether there be not in any connection between the government and bank of issue evil of great magnitude inherent in its very nature and against which no precaution can effectually guard unforeseen in the organization of the government and force on the treasury by early necessity the practice of employ bank be in truth from the begin more a measure of emergency than of sound policy when we start into existence as a nation in addition to the burden of the new government we assume all the large but honorable load of debt which be the price of we liberty but we hesitate to weigh down the infant industry of the country by resort to adequate taxation for the necessary revenue the facility of bank in return for the privilege they acquire be promptly offer and perhaps too readily receive by a embarrassed treasury during the long continuance of a national debt and the intervene difficulty of a foreign war the connection be continue from motive of convenience but these cause have long since pass away we have no emergency that make bank necessary to aid the want of the treasury we have no load of national debt to provide for and we have on actual deposit a large surplus no public interest therefore now require the renewal of a connection that circumstance have dissolve the complete organization of we government the abundance of we resource the general harmony which prevail between the different state and with foreign power all enable we now to select the system most consistent with the constitution and most conducive to the public welfare should we then connect the treasury for a fourth time with the local bank it can only be under a conviction that past failure have arise from accidental not inherent defect a danger difficult if not impossible to be avoid in such a arrangement be make strikingly evident in the very event by which it have now be defeat a sudden act of the bank intrust with the fund of the people deprive the treasury without fault or agency of the government of the ability to pay its creditor in the currency they have by law a right to demand this circumstance no fluctuation of commerce could have produce if the public revenue have be collect in the legal currency and keep in that form by the officer of the treasury the citizen whose money be in bank receive it back since the suspension at a sacrifice in its amount whilst he who keep it in the legal currency of the country and in he own possession pursue without loss the current of he business the government place in the situation of the former be involve in embarrassment it could not have suffer have it pursue the course of the latter these embarrassment be moreover augment by those salutary and just law which forbid it to use a depreciated currency and by so do take from the government the ability which individual have of accommodate they transaction to such a catastrophe a system which can in a time of profound peace when there be a large revenue lay by thus suddenly prevent the application and the use of the money of the people in the manner and for the object they have direct can not be wise but who can think without painful reflection that under it the same unforeseen event might have befall we in the midst of a war and take from we at the moment when most want the use of those very mean which be treasured up to promote the national welfare and guard we national rights to such embarrassment and to such danger will this government be always expose whilst it take the money raise for and necessary to the public service out of the hand of its own officer and convert they into a mere right of action against corporation intrust with the possession of they nor can such result be effectually guard against in such a system without invest the executive with a control over the bank themselves whether state or national that might with reason be object to ours be probably the only government in the world that be liable in the management of its fiscal concern to occurrence like these but this imminent risk be not the only danger attendant on the surrender of the public money to the custody and control of local corporation though the object be aid to the treasury its effect may be to introduce into the operation of the government influence the most subtle found on interest the most selfish the use by the bank for they own benefit of the money deposit with they have receive the sanction of the government from the commencement of this connection the money receive from the people instead of be keep till it be need for they use be in consequence of this authority a fund on which discount be make for the profit of those who happen to be owner of stock in the bank select as depository the suppose and often exaggerated advantage of such a boon will always cause it to be seek for with avidity i will not stop to consider on whom the patronage incident to it be to be confer whether the selection and control be trust to congress or to the executive either will be subject to appeal make in every form which the sagacity of interest can suggest the bank under such a system be stimulate to make the most of they fortunate acquisition the deposit be treat as a increase of capital loan and circulation be rashly augmented and when the public exigency require a return it be attend with embarrassment not provide for nor foresee thus bank that think themselves most fortunate when the public fund be receive find themselves most embarrassed when the season of payment suddenly arrive unfortunately too the evil of the system be not limit to the bank it stimulate a general rashness of enterprise and aggravate the fluctuation of commerce and the currency this result be strikingly exhibit during the operation of the late deposit system and especially in the purchase of public land the order which ultimately direct the payment of gold and silver in such purchase greatly check but could not altogether prevent the evil specie be indeed more difficult to be procure than the note which the bank could themselves create at pleasure but still be obtain from they as a loan and return as a deposit which they be again at liberty to use it only pass round the circle with diminish speed this operation could not have be perform have the fund of the government go into the treasury to be regularly disburse and not into bank to be loan out for they own profit while they be permit to substitute for it a credit in account in express these sentiment i desire not to undervalue the benefit of a salutary credit to any branch of enterprise the credit bestow on probity and industry be the just reward of merit and a honorable incentive to further acquisition none oppose it who love they country and understand its welfare but when it be unduly encourage when it be make to inflame the public mind with the temptation of sudden and unsubstantial wealth when it turn industry into path that lead sooner or later to disappointment and distress it become liable to censure and need correction far from help probity and industry the ruin to which it lead fall most severely on the great labor class who be throw suddenly out of employment and by the failure of magnificent scheme never intend to enrich they be deprive in a moment of they only resource abuse of credit and excess in speculation will happen in despite of the most salutary law no government perhaps can altogether prevent they but surely every government can refrain from contribute the stimulus that call they into life since therefore experience have show that to lend the public money to the local bank be hazardous to the operation of the government at least of doubtful benefit to the institution themselves and productive of disastrous derangement in the business and currency of the country be it the part of wisdom again to renew the connection it be true that such a agency be in many respects convenient to the treasury but it be not indispensable a limitation of the expense of the government to its actual want and of the revenue to those expense with convenient means for its prompt application to the purpose for which it be raise be the object which we should seek to accomplish the collection safe-keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money can it be believe be well manage by officer of the government its collection and to a great extent its disbursement also have indeed be hitherto conduct solely by they neither national nor state bank when employ be require to do more than keep it safely while in they custody and transfer and pay it in such portion and at such time as the treasury shall direct surely bank be not more able than the government to secure the money in they possession against accident violence or fraud the assertion that they be so must assume that a vault in a bank be stronger than a vault in the treasury and that director cashier and clerk not select by the government nor under its control be more worthy of confidence than officer select from the people and responsible to the government -- officer bind by official oath and bond for a faithful performance of they duty and constantly subject to the supervision of congress the difficulty of transfer and the aid heretofore render by bank have be less than be usually suppose the actual account show that by far the larger portion of payment be make within short or convenient distance from the place of collection and the whole number of warrant issue at the treasury in the year 1834 -- a year the result of which will it be believe afford a safe test for the future -- fall short of 5000 or a average of less than 1 daily for each state in the city of new york they do not average more than 2 a day and at the city of washington only 4 the difficulty heretofore exist be moreover daily lessen by a increase in the cheapness and facility of communication and it may be assert with confidence that the necessary transfer as well as the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public money can be with safety and convenience accomplish through the agency of treasury officer this opinion have be in some degree confirm by actual experience since the discontinuance of the bank as fiscal agent in may last -- a period which from the embarrassment in commercial intercourse present obstacle as great as any that may be hereafter apprehend the manner of keep the public money since that period be fully state in the report of the secretary of the treasury that officer also suggest the propriety of assign by law certain additional duty to exist establishment and officer which with the modification and safeguard refer to by he will he think enable the department to continue to perform this branch of the public service without any material addition either to they number or to the present expense the extent of the business to be transact have already be state and in respect to the amount of money with which the officer employ would be intrust at any one time it appear that assume a balance of five million to be at all time keep in the treasury and the whole of it leave in the hand of the collector and receiver the proportion of each would not exceed a average of $ 30000 but that deduct one million for the use of the mint and assume the remain four million to be in the hand of one-half of the present number of officer -- a supposition deem more likely to correspond with the fact -- the sum in the hand of each would still be less than the amount of most of the bond now take from the receiver of public money every apprehension however on the subject either in respect to the safety of the money or the faithful discharge of these fiscal transaction may it appear to I be effectually remove by add to the present means of the treasury the establishment by law at a few important point of office for the deposit and disbursement of such portion of the public revenue as can not with obvious safety and convenience be leave in the possession of the collect officer until pay over by they to the public creditor neither the amount retain in they hand nor those deposit in the office would in a ordinary condition of the revenue be larger in most case than those often under the control of disbursing officer of the army and navy and might be make entirely safe by require such security and exercise such control supervision as congress may by law prescribe the principal officer whose appointment would become necessary under this plan take the largest number suggest by the secretary of the treasury would not exceed ten nor the additional expense at the same estimate $ 60000 a year there can be no doubt of the obligation of those who be intrust with the affair of government to conduct they with as little cost to the nation as be consistent with the public interest and it be for congress and ultimately for the people to decide whether the benefit to be derive from keep we fiscal concern apart and sever the connection which have hitherto exist between the government and bank offer sufficient advantage to justify the necessary expense if the object to be accomplish be deem important to the future welfare of the country i can not allow myself to believe that the addition to the public expenditure of comparatively so small a amount as will be necessary to effect it will be object to by the people it will be see by the report of the postmaster-general herewith communicate that the fiscal affair of that department have be successfully conduct since may last upon the principle of deal only in the legal currency of the united state and that it need no legislation to maintain its credit and facilitate the management of its concern the exist law be in the opinion of that officer ample for those object difficulty will doubtless be encounter for a season and increase service require from the public functionary such be usually incident to the commencement of every system but they will be greatly lessen in the progress of its operation the power and influence suppose to be connect with the custody and disbursement of the public money be topic on which the public mind be naturally and with great propriety peculiarly sensitive much have be say on they in reference to the propose separation of the government from the banking institution and surely no one can object to any appeal or animadversion on the subject which be consistent with fact and evince a proper respect for the intelligence of the people if a chief magistrate may be allow to speak for himself on such a point i can truly say that to I nothing would be more acceptable than the withdrawal from the executive to the greatest practicable extent of all concern in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue not that i would shrink from any responsibility cast upon I by the duty of my office but because it be my firm belief that its capacity for usefulness be in no degree promote by the possession of any patronage not actually necessary to the performance of those duty but under we present form of government the intervention of the executive officer in the custody and disbursement of the public money seem to be unavoidable and before it can be admit that the influence and power of the executive would be increase by dispense with the agency of bank the nature of that intervention in such a agency must be carefully regard and a comparison must be institute between its extent in the two case the revenue can only be collect by officer appoint by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the public money in the first instance must therefore in all case pass through hand select by the executive other officer appoint in the same way or as in some case by the president alone must also be intrust with they when draw for the purpose of disbursement it be thus see that even when bank be employ the public fund must twice pass through the hand of executive officer besides this the head of the treasury department who also hold office at the pleasure of the president and some other officer of the same department must necessarily be invest with more or less power in the selection continuance and supervision of the bank that may be employ the question be then narrow to the single point whether in the intermediate stage between the collection and disbursement of the public money the agency of bank be necessary to avoid a dangerous extension of the patronage and influence of the executive but be it clear that the connection of the executive with powerful moneyed institution capable of minister to the interest of man in point where they be most accessible to corruption be less liable to abuse than he constitutional agency in the appointment and control of the few public officer require by the propose plan will the public money when in they hand be necessarily expose to any improper interference on the part of the executive may it not be hope that a prudent fear of public jealousy and disapprobation in a matter so peculiarly expose to they will deter he from any such interference even if higher motive be find inoperative may not congress so regulate by law the duty of those officer and subject it to such supervision and publicity as to prevent the possibility of any serious abuse on the part of the executive and be there equal room for such supervision and publicity in a connection with bank act under the shield of corporate immunity and conduct by person irresponsible to the government and the people it be believe that a considerate and candid investigation of these question will result in the conviction that the propose plan be far less liable to objection on the score of executive patronage and control than any bank agency that have be or can be devise with these view i leave to congress the measure necessary to regulate in the present emergency the safe-keeping and transfer of the public money in the performance of constitutional duty i have state to they without reserve the result of my own reflection the subject be of great importance and one on which we can scarcely expect to be as unite in sentiment as we be in interest it deserve a full and free discussion and can not fail to be benefit by a dispassionate comparison of opinion well aware myself of the duty of reciprocal concession among the coordinate branch of the government i can promise a reasonable spirit of cooperation so far as it can be indulge in without the surrender of constitutional objection which i believe to be well found any system that may be adopt should be subject to the fullest legal provision so as to leave nothing to the executive but what be necessary to the discharge of the duty impose on he and whatever plan may be ultimately establish my own part shall be so discharge as to give to it a fair trial and the best prospect of success the character of the fund to be receive and disburse in the transaction of the government likewise demand you most careful consideration there can be no doubt that those who frame and adopt the constitution have in immediate view the depreciate paper of the confederacy -- of which $ 500 in paper be at time only equal to $ 1 in coin -- intend to prevent the recurrence of similar evil so far at least as related to the transaction of the new government they give to congress express power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin they refuse to give it power to establish corporation -- the agent then as now chiefly employ to create a paper currency they prohibit the state from make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debt and the first congress direct by positive law that the revenue should be receive in nothing but gold and silver public exigency at the outset of the government without direct legislative authority lead to the use of bank as fiscal aid to the treasury in admit deviation from the law at the same period and under the same exigency the secretary of the treasury receive they note in payment of duty the sole ground on which the practice thus commence be then or have since be justified be the certain immediate and convenient exchange of such note for specie the government do indeed receive the inconvertible note of state bank during the difficulty of war and the community submit without a murmur to the unequal taxation and multiply evil of which such a course be productive with the war this indulgence cease and the bank be oblige again to redeem they note in gold and silver the treasury in accordance with previous practice continue to dispense with the currency require by the act of 1789 and take the note of bank in full confidence of they be pay in specie on demand and congress to guard against the slightest violation of this principle have declare by law that if note be pay in the transaction of the government it must be under such circumstance as to enable the holder to convert they into specie without depreciation or delay of my own duty under the exist law when the bank suspend specie payment i could not doubt direction be immediately give to prevent the reception into the treasury of anything but gold and silver or its equivalent and every practicable arrangement be make to preserve the public faith by similar or equivalent payment to the public creditor the revenue from land have be for some time substantially so collect under the order issue by direction of my predecessor the effect of that order have be so salutary and its forecast in regard to the increase insecurity of bank paper have become so apparent that even before the catastrophe i have resolve not to interfere with its operation congress be now to decide whether the revenue shall continue to be so collect or not the receipt into the treasury of bank note not redeem in specie on demand will not i presume be sanction it would destroy without the excuse of war or public distress that equality of impost and identity of commercial regulation which lie at the foundation of we confederacy and would offer to each state a direct temptation to increase its foreign trade by depreciate the currency receive for duty in its port such a proceeding would also in a great degree frustrate the policy so highly cherish of infuse into we circulation a larger proportion of the precious metal -- a policy the wisdom of which none can doubt though there may be different opinion as to the extent to which it should be carry its result have be already too auspicious and its success be too closely interwoven with the future prosperity of the country to permit we for a moment to contemplate its abandonment we have see under its influence we specie augment beyond eighty million we coinage increase so as to make that of gold amount between August 1834 and December 1836 to $ 10000000 exceed the whole coinage at the mint during the thirty-one previous year the prospect of further improvement continue without abatement until the moment of the suspension of specie payment this policy have now indeed be suddenly check but be still far from be overthrow amidst all conflict theory one position be undeniable -- the precious metal will invariably disappear when there cease to be a necessity for they use as a circulate medium it be in strict accordance with this truth that whilst in the month of may last they be everywhere see and be current for all ordinary purpose they disappear from circulation the moment the payment of specie be refuse by the bank and the community tacitly agree to dispense with its employment they place be supply by a currency exclusively of paper and in many case of the worst description already be the bank note now in circulation greatly depreciate and they fluctuate in value between one place and another thus diminish and make uncertain the worth of property and the price of labor and fail to subserve except at a heavy loss the purpose of business with each succeed day the metallic currency decrease by some it be hoard in the natural fear that once part with it can not be replace while by other it be divert from its more legitimate use for the sake of gain should congress sanction this condition of thing by make irredeemable paper money receivable in payment of public due a temporary check to a wise and salutary policy will in all probability be convert into its absolute destruction it be true that bank note actually convertible into specie may be receive in payment of the revenue without be liable to all these objection and that such a course may to some extent promote individual convenience -- a object always to be consider where it do not conflict with the principle of we government or the general welfare of the country if such note only be receive and always under circumstance allow they early presentation for payment and if at short and fixed period they be convert into specie to be keep by the officer of the treasury some of the most serious obstacle to they reception would perhaps be remove to retain the note in the treasury would be to renew under another form the loan of public money to the bank and the evil consequent thereon it be however a mistaken impression that any large amount of specie be require for public payment of the seventy or eighty million now estimate to be in the country ten million would be abundantly sufficient for that purpose provide a accumulation of a large amount of revenue beyond the necessary want of the government be hereafter prevent if to these consideration be add the facility which will arise from enable the treasury to satisfy the public creditor by its draft or note receivable in payment of the public due it may be safely assume that no motive of convenience to the citizen require the reception of bank paper to say that the refusal of paper money by the government introduce a unjust discrimination between the currency receive by it and that use by individual in they ordinary affair be in my judgment to view it in a very erroneous light the constitution prohibit the state from make anything but gold and silver a tender in the payment of debt and thus secure to every citizen a right to demand payment in the legal currency to provide by law that the government will only receive its due in gold and silver be not to confer on it any peculiar privilege but merely to place it on a equality with the citizen by reserve to it a right secure to he by the constitution it be doubtless for this reason that the principle have be sanction by successive law from the time of the first congress under the constitution down to the last such precedent never object to and proceed from such source afford a decisive answer to the imputation of inequality or injustice but in fact the measure be one of restriction not of favor to forbid the public agent to receive in payment any other than a certain kind of money be to refuse he a discretion possess by every citizen it may be leave to those who have the management of they own transaction to make they own term but no such discretion should be give to he who act merely as a agent of the people -- who be to collect what the law require and to pay the appropriation it make when bank note be redeem on demand there be then no discrimination in reality for the individual who receive they may at he option substitute the specie for they he take they from convenience or choice when they be not so redeem it will scarcely be contend that they receipt and payment by a public officer should be permit though none deny that right to a individual if it be the effect would be most injurious to the public since they officer could make none of those arrangement to meet or guard against the depreciation which a individual be at liberty to do nor can inconvenience to the community be allege as a objection to such a regulation its object and motive be they convenience and welfare if at a moment of simultaneous and unexpected suspension by the bank it add something to the many embarrassment of that proceeding yet these be far overbalance by its direct tendency to produce a wider circulation of gold and silver to increase the safety of bank paper to improve the general currency and thus to prevent altogether such occurrence and the other and far greater evil that attend they it may indeed be question whether it be not for the interest of the bank themselves that the government should not receive they paper they would be conduct with more caution and on sounder principle by use specie only in its transaction the government would create a demand for it which would to a great extent prevent its exportation and by keep it in circulation maintain a broader and safer basis for the paper currency that the bank would thus be render more sound and the community more safe can not admit of a doubt the foregoing view it seem to I do but fairly carry out the provision of the federal constitution in relation to the currency as far as relate to the public revenue at the time that instrument be frame there be but three or four bank in the united state and have the extension of the banking system and the evil grow out of it be foresee they would probably have be specially guard against the same policy which lead to the prohibition of bill of credit by the state would doubtless in that event have also interdict they issue as a currency in any other form the constitution however contain no such prohibition and since the state have exercise for nearly half a century the power to regulate the business of bank it be not to be expect that it will be abandon the whole matter be now under discussion before the proper tribunal -- the people of the state never before have the public mind be so thoroughly awaken to a proper sense of its importance never have the subject in all its bearing be submit to so search a inquiry it would be distrust the intelligence and virtue of the people to doubt the speedy and efficient adoption of such measure of reform as the public good demand all that can rightfully be do by the federal government to promote the accomplishment of that important object will without doubt be perform in the meantime it be we duty to provide all the remedy against a depreciate paper currency which the constitution enable we to afford the treasury department on several former occasion have suggest the propriety and importance of a uniform law concern bankruptcy of corporation and other banker through the instrumentality of such a law a salutary check may doubtless be impose on the issue of paper money and a effectual remedy give to the citizen in a way at once equal in all part of the union and fully authorize by the constitution the indulgence grant by executive authority in the payment of bond for duty have be already mention see that the immediate enforcement of these obligation would subject a large and highly respectable portion of we citizen to great sacrifice and believe that a temporary postponement could be make without detriment to other interest and with increase certainty of ultimate payment i do not hesitate to comply with the request that be make of I the term allow be to the full extent as liberal as any that be to be find in the practice of the executive department it remain for congress to decide whether a further postponement may not with propriety be allow and if so they legislation upon the subject be respectfully invite the report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit the condition of these debt the extent and effect of the present indulgence the probable result of its further extension on the state of the treasury and every other fact necessary to a full consideration of the subject similar information be communicate in regard to such depository of the public money as be indebted to the government in order that congress may also adopt the proper measure in regard to they the receipt and expenditure for the first half of the year and a estimate of those for the residue will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury in he report of December last it be estimate that the current receipt would fall short of the expenditure by about $ 3000000 it will be see that the difference will be much greater this be to be attribute not only to the occurrence of greater pecuniary embarrassment in the business of the country than those which be then predict and consequently a greater diminution in the revenue but also to the fact that the appropriation exceed by nearly six million the amount which be ask for in the estimate then submit the sum necessary for the service of the year beyond the probable receipt and the amount which it be intend should be reserve in the treasury at the commencement of the year will be about six million if the whole of the reserved balance be not at once apply to the current expenditure but four million be still keep in the treasury as seem most expedient for the use of the mint and to meet contingency the sum need will be ten million in make this estimate the receipt be calculate on the supposition of some further extension of the indulgence grant in the payment of bond for duty which will affect the amount of the revenue for the present year to the extent of two and a half million it be not propose to procure the require amount by loan or increase taxation there be now in the treasury $ 9367214 direct by the act of the 23d of June 1836 to be deposit with the state in October next this sum if so deposit will be subject under the law to be recall if need to defray existing appropriation and as it be now evident that the whole or the principal part of it will be want for that purpose it appear most proper that the deposit should be withhold until the amount can be collect from the bank treasury note may be temporarily issue to be gradually redeem as it be receive i be aware that this course may be productive of inconvenience to many of the state rely upon the act of congress which hold out to they the strong probability if not the certainty of receive this installment they have in some instance adopt measure with which its retention may seriously interfere that such a condition of thing should have occur be much to be regret it be not the least among the unfortunate result of the disaster of the time and it be for congress to devise a fit remedy if there be one the money be indispensable to the want of the treasury it be difficult to conceive upon what principle of justice or expediency its application to that object can be avoid to recall any portion of the sum already deposit with the state would be more inconvenient and less efficient to burden the country with increase taxation when there be in fact a large surplus revenue would be unjust and unwise to raise money by loan under such circumstance and thus to commence a new national debt would scarcely be sanction by the american people the plan propose will be adequate to all we fiscal operation during the remainder of the year should it be adopt the treasury aid by the ample resource of the country will be able to discharge punctually every pecuniary obligation for the future all that be need will be that caution and forbearance in appropriation which the diminution of the revenue require and which the complete accomplishment or great forwardness of many expensive national undertaking render equally consistent with prudence and patriotic liberality the precede suggestion and recommendation be submit in the belief that they adoption by congress will enable the executive department to conduct we fiscal concern with success so far as they management have be commit to it whilst the object and the means propose to attain they be within its constitutional power and appropriate duty they will at the same time it be hope by they necessary operation afford essential aid in the transaction of individual concern and thus yield relief to the people at large in a form adapt to the nature of we government those who look to the action of this government for specific aid to the citizen to relieve embarrassment arise from loss by revulsion in commerce and credit lose sight of the end for which it be create and the power with which it be clothe it be establish to give security to we all in we lawful and honorable pursuit under the lasting safeguard of republican institution it be not intend to confer special favor on individual or on any class of they to create system of agriculture manufacture or trade or to engage in they either separately or in connection with individual citizen or organize association if its operation be to be direct for the benefit of any one class equivalent favor must in justice be extend to the rest and the attempt to bestow such favor with a equal hand or even to select those who should most deserve they would never be successful all community be apt to look to government for too much even in we own country where its power and duty be so strictly limit we be prone to do so especially at period of sudden embarrassment and distress but this ought not to be the framer of we excellent constitution and the people who approve it with calm and sagacious deliberation act at the time on a sounder principle they wisely judge that the less government interfere with private pursuit the better for the general prosperity it be not its legitimate object to make man rich or to repair by direct grant of money or legislation in favor of particular pursuit loss not incur in the public service this would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit of other but its real duty -- that duty the performance of which make a good government the most precious of human blessing -- be to enact and enforce a system of general law commensurate with but not exceed the object of its establishment and to leave every citizen and every interest to reap under its benign protection the reward of virtue industry and prudence i can not doubt that on this as on all similar occasion the federal government will find its agency most conducive to the security and happiness of the people when limit to the exercise of its concede power in never assume even for a well-meant object such power as be not design to be confer upon it we shall in reality do most for the general welfare to avoid every unnecessary interference with the pursuit of the citizen will result in more benefit than to adopt measure which could only assist limited interest and be eagerly but perhaps naturally seek for under the pressure of temporary circumstance if therefore i refrain from suggest to congress any specific plan for regulate the exchange of the country relieve mercantile embarrassment or interfere with the ordinary operation of foreign or domestic commerce it be from a conviction that such measure be not within the constitutional province of the general government and that they adoption would not promote the real and permanent welfare of those they might be design to aid the difficulty and distress of the time though unquestionably great be limit in they extent and can not be regard as affect the permanent prosperity of the nation arise in a great degree from the transaction of foreign and domestic commerce it be upon they that they have chiefly fall the great agricultural interest have in many part of the country suffer comparatively little and as if providence intend to display the munificence of its goodness at the moment of we greatest need and in direct contrast to the evil occasion by the waywardness of man we have be bless throughout we extended territory with a season of general health and of uncommon fruitfulness the proceeds of we great staple will soon furnish the means of liquidate debt at home and abroad and contribute equally to the revival of commercial activity and the restoration of commercial credit the bank establish avowedly for its support derive they profit from it and rest under obligation to it which can not be overlook will feel at once the necessity and justice of unite they energy with those of the mercantile interest the suspension of specie payment at such a time and under such circumstance as we have lately witness could not be other than a temporary measure and we can scarcely err in believe that the period must soon arrive when all that be solvent will redeem they issue in gold and silver dealings abroad naturally depend on resource and prosperity at home if the debt of we merchant have accumulate or they credit be impaired these be fluctuation always incident to extensive or extravagant mercantile transaction but the ultimate security of such obligation do not admit of question they be guarantee by the resource of a country the fruit of whose industry afford abundant means of ample liquidation and by the evident interest of every merchant to sustain a credit hitherto high by promptly apply these means for its preservation i deeply regret that event have occur which require I to ask you consideration of such serious topic i could have wish that in make my first communication to the assemble representative of my country i have nothing to dwell upon but the history of she unalloyed prosperity since it be otherwise we can only feel more deeply the responsibility of the respective trust that have be confide to we and under the pressure of difficulty unite in invoke the guidance and aid of the supreme ruler of nation and in labor with zealous resolution to overcome the difficulty by which we be environ it be under such circumstance a high gratification to know by long experience that we act for a people to whom the truth however unpromise can always be speak with safety for the trial of whose patriotism no emergency be too severe and who be sure never to desert a public functionary honestly labor for the public good it seem just that they should receive without delay any aid in they embarrassment which you deliberation can afford come directly from the midst of they and know the course of event in every section of we country from you may best be learn as well the extent and nature of these embarrassment as the most desirable measure of relief i be aware however that it be not proper to detain you at present longer than may be demand by the special object for which you be convene to they therefore i have confine my communication and believe it will not be you own wish now to extend you deliberation beyond they i reserve till the usual period of you annual meeting that general information on the state of the union which the constitution require I to give m van buren

the public interest will permit the correspondence between the government of the united state and that of great britain relate to the northeastern boundary of the united state since the message of the late president to the senate of the united state of the 15th of June 1836 and all the correspondence which have take place since that period between the government of the united state and the governor of the state of maine on the subject of alleged aggression upon the rights of maine by the british authority have the honor respectfully to submit to the president copy of the letter and document request by that resolution john forsyth state of maine executive department _ augusta march 30 1837 _ sir : in compliance with a request of the legislature of this state i have the honor to transmit to you the accompany report and resolution i be very respectfully you obedient servant robert p dunlap state of maine house of representative _ march 29 1837 _ the joint select committee who have under consideration the order relate to the expediency of call the attention of congress to the subject of fortify we maritime and interior frontier have attend to that duty and ask leave to present the follow report : one object of the federal compact be to provide for the common defense and general welfare in accordance with these object of the compact the general government have from time to time make liberal appropriation for fortify and defend the several state along we extended maritime frontier west and south of the western boundary line of this state east of that line a mere trifle have as yet be appropriate for these object maine have a maritime frontier of about 500 mile in extent follow the indentation of she shore and we interior frontier bound on new brunswick on the east and the canada on the north be about 600 mile in extent consider this great extent of seacoast she numerous excellent harbor she noble river and great advantage for shipbuilding and she proximity to the fishing grounds probably no state in the union possess the natural advantage for carry on this branch of industry that maine do it be a fact worthy of consideration that all maritime nation have look to they fishery as the nursery of hardy seaman for the merchant service in time of peace and for the navy in time of war and as a great question of national policy -lrb- aside from the inducement to encourage this branch of business as a unfailing source of natural wealth -rrb- it be deem worthy of the foster care of all commercial nation already the navigation of maine be estimate at more than 300000 ton and exceed by only two state in the union and she increase annually of tonnage be greater than that of any other state the abundance of building material believe to be inexhaustible she great convenience for shipbuilding along she extended seacoast she numerous bay river and harbor render it highly probable that the day be not far distant when the maritime interest of maine will exceed that of any of she sister state and if reliance can be place upon the statement of a scientific engineer of high respectability and standing who have during the past year under the direction of the government of this state and we parent commonwealth make a geological survey of a portion of we state it may be doubt whether the same extent of territory on the continent contain more real value view in all its bearing -lrb- the facility of quarry manufacturing export and its influence upon the great interest of the state and nation -rrb- than be contain in we inexhaustible quarry of granite lime marble slate etc mine and mineral in which large and profitable investment be already make some of these branch of business have be carry on for many year and other to a large extent be commence under the most favorable auspices these together with we agricultural commercial and manufacturing interest we immense forest of invaluable timber with a water power of vast extent and value give we the means of lay the seaport of the union under a contribution for age to come and warrant the belief that we present shipping interest will be sustained and employ and a great increase require about one-third of the most valuable portion of we territory be claim by great britain and the history of this protracted controversy from its commencement to the present time be such as to awaken general anxiety we be admonish by recent event that we have not yet reach the termination of we toil and embarrassment and they have awaken the painful apprehension that we just rights may not be secure by honorable negotiation or patient submission to unprovoked injury these consideration in the opinion of you committee call loudly for the interposition of the general government and require at they hand all needful preparation for possible contingency the late governor lincoln nearly ten year since call the attention of the government to the importance of erect a strong fortification in some eligible position on the confines of that portion of we territory to which a adverse claim be set up by great britain in the opinion of you committee the subject have lose none of its interest since that period but on the contrary the event to which we have allude give to it vastly augment importance and to we view irrespective of any condition grow out of the present controversy a strong fortification upon the northeastern boundary of the united state situate far in the interior and upon the confines of a foreign country and surround by million of acre of fertile land destine soon to be people with a numerous population of hardy yeomanry be of high importance we isolate situation be the northeastern boundary of the nation with a interior frontier upward of 600 mile upon a foreign country and a large proportion of we territory lie between two province of great britain and so situate as to render it greatly to the advantage of that nation to possess it the inflexible determination which she manifest to pursue the course which interest dictate should not be forget the extent of we seacoast the expose situation of we seaport town lie within a few hour ' sail of the british naval depot in the neighborhood of maine the disastrous consequence of we defenseless situation during the last war the great and increase maritime interest which we have at stake without one single point where a ship if dependent upon the united state fortification would be safe from the attack of a frigate -- these and the consideration that little comparatively have yet be do for maine seem to we view to constitute irresistible reason why maine should no longer be forget or neglect in the common defense of the country through all the long-protracted struggle difficulty and embarrassment of we infant republic this portion of we union have never be urgent or importunate in press its claim but have submit patiently to the force of circumstance which render it necessary to defer they but in the present altered condition of the country -- the national debt pay off at a season of universal peace and unexampled prosperity with a overburthen treasury and when it be deem necessary to dispose of it to resort to measure which many eminent statesman consider unwarranted by the constitution and which a great portion of the people of the union consider of doubtful policy -- at such a period and under such circumstance it be difficult to perceive the justice of longer withholding suitable appropriation for the defense of maine and to we view it can only be withhold by do violence to the principle of equal rights and by neglect a plain constitutional duty you committee therefore submit the follow resolution stephen c foster _ chairman _ state of maine resolve relate to the fortification of frontier state _ resolve _ that the obligation of the federal government under the constitution when it have the means to erect suitable fortification for the defense of the frontier of the state be a practical duty not justly to be deny evade neglect or delay _ resolve _ that we senator in congress be instruct and we representative request to use they influence to obtain liberal appropriation for the defense of maine and the union _ resolve _ that the governor be request to transmit copy of the above report and resolution to the president and vice-president the secretary of state navy and war and to each of we senator and representative in congress -lrb- pass by both house and approve march 30 1837 -rrb- state of maine executive department _ augusta April 30 1837 _ he excellency martin van buren _ president of the united state _ sir : in compliance with a request of the legislature of this state i have the honor to transmit to you excellency the accompany report and resolution : in behalf of the state of maine i would respectfully yet urgently call on the president of the united state to cause the northeastern boundary of this state to be explore and survey and monument erect in accordance with the request contain in the resolution which be herewith communicate as the subject be one in which the people of maine have a deep interest i feel a confidence it will commend itself to you early attention with high consideration i have the honor to be you obedient servant robert p dunlap state of maine in house of representative _ February 2 1837 _ the joint committee to whom be refer so much of the governor 's message as relate to the northeastern boundary and the document and evidence together with a order of the two house instruct the committee to inquire into the expediency of provide by law for the appointment of commissioner on the part of this state by the consent of the government of the united state to survey the line between this state and the province of new brunswick accord to the treaty of 1783 to establish monument in such place as shall be fix by say commissioner and by commissioner to be appoint on the part of the government of great britain have attend to the duty assign they with the industry and solicitude which the importance of the subject demand could the committee have spare the time and have the means to obtain document not within the jurisdiction of the state and consequently out of its power a more clear methodical and perfect view of the subject would have be present but as there have be hitherto so much procrastination and the impatience of the public already great be become more and more intense you committee without further preamble or apology ask leave to present the follow report : the legislature and people of maine we believe will not contend that the treaty-making power of the united state do not extend to a final adjustment of a dispute and undefined line of boundary between a state and a foreign nation _ but we do insist _ that no power be grant by the constitution of the united state to _ limit _ or _ change the boundary of a state or cede a part of its territory without its consent _ it be even by no means certain how far _ such consent _ would enable the treaty authority to exert its power _ citizen _ might be make the subject of a treaty transfer and these citizen owe allegiance to the state and to the union and allegiance and protection be reciprocally bind the right to transfer a citizen to a foreign government to _ sell _ he might well be question as be inconsistent with the spirit of we free institution but be this as it may maine will never concede the principle that the president and two-third of the senate can transfer its territory much less its citizen without its permission give by its constitutional organ you committee however deem it but fair to admit that they have discover no inclination in the general government or any department of it to assume this power on the contrary the president have repeatedly decline the adoption of a conventional line deviate from the treaty of 1783 upon the express ground that it could not be do without the consent of maine it be due nevertheless to the state of maine to say that the committee have no evidence that any conventional line have be propose to they for they consent it indeed appear that the consent of maine have not be give to the adoption of any other boundary than that prescribe by the treaty of 1783 up to the 29th February 1836 and we be well assure that no proposition for a different boundary have since that time be make to any department of the government of this state the president of the united state on the 15th June last communicate to the senate in compliance with they resolution a copy of the correspondence relative to the northeastern boundary this correspondence embrace a period from the 21st July 1832 to the 5th march 1836 the opinion and advice of the king of the netherland to whom the controversy be refer by the provision of the treaty of ghent be make on the 10th January 1831 and of the three question submit viz _ the northeastern boundary the northwesternmost head of connecticut river _ and _ the forty-fifth parallel of latitude _ he seem to have determine _ but one _ he do decide that the source of the stream run into and through connecticut lake be the true northwest head of that river as intend by the treaty of 1783 and as to the rest he _ advise _ that it will be _ convenient -lrb- il conviendra -rrb- _ to adopt the thalweg the deepest channel of the st john and st franci for the north line and that the forty-fifth degree be to be measure in order to mark out the boundary to the st lawrence with a deviation so as to include rous point within the united state as to _ the convenience _ of establish the st john and st franci as the northern boundary of maine we have only to observe that however convenient it may be to great britain to obtain so large a portion of we territory and water it would certainly be very _ inconvenient _ to we and inasmuch as we be probably capable of judge of we own convenience and have never solicit _ the advice _ of anyone on this point it be scarcely to be expect that we shall be _ advise _ to adopt a line so preposterous and injurious it be in this view and in strict conformity with the constitution confer the treaty power that the president on the 7th December 1831 submit to the senate this award and advice of the king of the netherland senator be divide on a principal point some insist that to carry the award or opinion into effect be only _ in execution _ of the treaty and it therefore belong exclusively to the president to take care that this supreme law be faithfully execute or to reject it altogether but the prevail opinion be that this award or advice be _ perfect a unfinished _ treaty and that therefore it could not be effect by the president without the advice and consent of the senate two-third of the member present concur therein so far from the concurrence of two-third _ for _ the measure there be _ thirty-four _ to _ eight against _ it and it be consequently reject and a recommendation to the president be adopt to open a new negotiation to determine the line of boundary accord to the treaty of 1783 it be insist by the british minister that a due north line from the monument at the source of the st croix will intersect no highland describe in the treaty of 1783 now this be a assumption by great britain totally unwarranted by any evidence the boundary bear upon the question be thus give : from the northwest angle of nova scotium to wit that angle which be form by a line draw due north from the source of the st croix river to the highland along the say highland which divide _ the river _ that empty themselves into the st lawrence from those which fall into the atlantic ocean to the north westernmost head of connecticut river east by a line to be draw along the middle of the river st croix from its mouth in the bay of fundy to its source and from its source directly north to the aforesaid highland which divide the river that fall into the atlantic ocean from those which fall into the st lawrence the first object start place or _ terminus a quo _ be this _ northwest angle of nova scotium _ it be the corner of the british province _ designate by themselves _ it be presume and it be still believe that they know the identical spot we have a right to demand of they to define it in the treaty of 1783 they be dispose to define it and hence they say it be _ that angle which be form by a line draw due north from the source of the st croix to those highland which divide the river that flow into the st lawrence from those which flow into the atlantic ocean _ nothing can be more clear than that the british negotiator of the treaty of 1783 have reference to they east and west line between canada and nova scotium this in 1755-56 be matter of controversy between france and england the french claim that it be far south and the british strenuously contend that these very highland be even more north than we have endeavor to fix they the controversy result in a war which after the capture of quebec be terminate by the peace of 1763 whereby great britain obtain both side of the line and she then establish the north line of nova scotium about where we contend it should be so far from admit that a due north line from the monument will not intersect the highland intend by the treaty of 1783 the state of maine have always insist and still insist that no known obstacle exist to the ascertain and accurately define they and thus establish the _ terminus a quo to wit the northwest angle of nova scotium _ it would seem strange indeed that this line so fully discuss and controvert between the english and french in 1755-56 should have be leave unsettled still when both province become british it be impossible to imagine such ignorance of so important a point as this northwest angle so often refer to and speak of as a notorious monument the peace of 1783 be consider by great britain as _ a grant by mete and bound _ the boundary be prescribe and this northwest angle be _ the commencement _ twenty year only before this -lrb- 1763 -rrb- nova scotium have be organize as a distinct province then include what be now nova scotium and new brunswick and this angle be refer to as a boundary without hesitancy or doubt indeed the treaty itself as if to make assurance doubly sure fix it where a due north line from the source of the st croix will intersect those highland which divide the river which flow into the _ river _ st lawrence from those which flow into the atlantic ocean this source of the st croix have be determine and a monument fix there by the commissioner under the fifth article of the treaty of 1795 -lrb- jay 's -rrb- now the assumption that the north line from this monument will intersect or meet no such highland be entirely gratuitous the treaty do not speak of mountain nor even hill but of highland that divide river flow different way it be well know that river do fall into the st lawrence and into the atlantic that these river would run _ down _ and not _ up _ and it be consequently infer that the _ land _ from whence these _ river _ flow must of necessity be _ high _ and unless there be to be find in that region _ geological phenomenon _ which exist nowhere else on the face of the globe this inference be irresistible the truth be that these highland have be know and well understand by the british themselves ever since the grant of jame i to sir william alexander in 1621 the portion of the boundary there give which relate to this controversy be from the western spring head of the st croix by a imaginary line conceive to run through the land northward to the next road of ship river or spring discharging itself into the great river of canada and proceed thence _ eastward _ along the shore of the sea of the say river of canada to the road haven or shore commonly call _ gaspeck _ -lrb- gasp -rrb- the cession of canada by france make it necessary to define the limit of the province of quebec and accordingly he britannic majesty by he proclamation of 7th October 1763 be thus explicit as to what affect this question : pass along the highland which divide _ the river _ that empty themselves into the say _ river _ st lawrence from those which fall into _ the _ sea and also _ along the north coast of the bay de chaleurs _ and the coast of the _ gulf _ of the st lawrence to _ cape rosier _ etc the act of parliament of the fourteenth george iii -lrb- 1774 -rrb- define thus the south line of canada : south by a line from the bay de chaleur along the highland which divide the river that empty themselves into the river st lawrence from those which flow into _ the sea _ the north line of the grant to alexander be from the source of the st croix to the spring head or source of some river or stream which fall into the river st lawrence and thence _ eastward _ to gasp bay which communicate with the gulf of st lawrence in latitude 49  30 ' and would make nearly a east and west line the proclamation of 1763 define the _ south _ line of the province of quebec as pass along the highland which divide the river that fall into the st lawrence from those which fall into the sea and also along the north coast of the bay de chaleur to _ the gulf _ of st lawrence this be the _ south _ boundary and consequently in a _ east _ and _ west direction _ but it pass _ north _ of bay de chaleur wherefore the south boundary of the province must of necessity be north of bay de chaleur the eastern boundary be northerly by the gulf of _ cape rosier _ in about latitude 50  longitude 64  north of gasp bay and at the mouth of the river st lawrence where it communicate with the gulf or sea and the act of parliament make _ this south side _ from this same bay along those highland and it must _ inevitably run west _ or _ it be no south _ boundary now no one can doubt that in the proclamation of 1763 it be the intent to adopt sir william alexander 's _ northern _ for this _ southern _ boundary of the province of quebec indeed it appear in every commission to the governor of nova scotium and new brunswick from 1763 to 1784 and after the treaty of peace of 1783 that the province of nova scotium extend to the southern boundary of the province of quebec it then irresistibly and inevitably follow that a west line from the bay de chaleurs intersect a due north line from the monument be the identical northwest angle now a line from mar hill direct to cape rosier instead of be _ easterly _ would be north of northeast _ cross _ the bay de chaleur but pass along its north coast as the proclamation provide the line from this mar hill must be more northerly still indeed the pretense that a pyramidal spur or peak such as this hill should constitute the range of highland mention in the treaty be so utterly visionary that it be entitle to _ no sort of respect _ we may now by these fact and reflection give this inquiry a right direction _ to wit _ to the ascertainment of the north boundary of nova scotium which be the southern boundary of canada we have always be lure from this by the british negotiator to the _ leave _ or _ west _ of this north line from the monument no one who be in the least conversant with the subject can suppose for a moment that this northwest angle can be find in such a direction the question for we be be there any highland north of the bay de chaleurs extend _ in a western direction toward _ a north line draw from the monument if this line westerly from the bay be not distinctly mark so far as to intersect this north line the principle be to extend it in the same direction to the place of intersection that be if the line between nova scotium and canada be _ west _ to within say 30 mile of the north line from the monument and the rest of the way be indefinite or obscure extend it on in the same direction until you form a point of intersection and this will be the northwest angle of nova scotium but the truth be _ the highland be there _ and have be find in run due north from the monument the elevation be take by the british surveyor from the source of the st croix at the monument to the first water of the restigouche and at mar hill 40 mile the summit of this isolate sugar loaf be 1100 foot and at the termination of the survey at the restigouche water 100 mile farther the elevation be i600 foot consequently the summit of mar hill 1100 foot above the water of the st croix be 500 foot lower than the land at the restigouche and yet the pretense be that there be no highland but this detach spur mar hill still further the highest position survey be nearly 50 mile short of the meli which fall into the st lawrence and we do not perceive that the elevation have be take there at all but we do find it be here that _ the water separate _ and consequently the land must be still higher in failure of highland -lrb- _ assume _ not to exist -rrb- the british negotiator claim a line which instead of divide the st lawrence and atlantic water would actually extend between two river _ both of which fall into the atlantic _ to say nothing of the absurdity not to say ignorance of such a claim it be enough that it be in the tooth of the treaty itself it be painful to repeat the argument that no other highland be intend for all other be expressly exclude but those which divide the water that flow in those different direction the effect of they construction as we all know be to give they the whole of the st john with all its tributary and a tract of territory south of that river equal at least to 75 mile square whether from the peaceful spirit of we government the christian patience of maine or the modest assurance of the british negotiator -- any or all -- certain it be that he britannic majesty 's pretension _ be grow every day _ it be not only a afterthought but one very recently conceive that we be to be drive south of the st john he britannic majesty 's agent mr chipman who have be lately urge we south of that river be also agent to the commission under the treaty of 1795 to ascertain the true st croix and in insist on a more _ western _ branch of this river give as a reason that a line due north will cross the st john _ farther up _ whereas if you take a _ eastern _ branch such line will cross near frederickton the seat of government of new brunswick and materially infringe upon he majesty 's province he not only admit but contend that this north line _ must _ cross the river here be he word : this north line must of necessity cross the river st john mr liston the british minister in a private letter to mr chipman of 23d October 1798 recommend a modification of the power of the commissioner for the reason that _ it might give great britain a greater extent of navigation on the st john river _ the same agent mr chipman be also agent under the fourth article of the treaty of ghent and we find he contend there that the northwest angle of nova scotium be the same designate in the grant to sir william alexander in 1621 subject only to such alteration as be occasion by the erection of the province of quebec in 1763 now we have already see that this south line of the province of quebec so far from _ alter _ this northwest angle in fact confirm it in perfect accordance with this disposition to encroach be a proposition of the british minister -lrb- mr vaughan -rrb- that inasmuch as the highland can not be find by a due north direction from the monument we should _ vary west _ until we should intersect they _ but not _ east now that in case a monument can not be find in the course prescribe you should look for it _ at the left but not to the right _ seem to we a very _ sinister _ proposition we have show and as we think conclusively that the range of highland be to be look for on british ground and nowhere else because it be they own boundary and a line which must with a ascertain north line form the angle of one of they own province and yet we be not to examine there at all we have never explore the country there and be expect to yield to such arrogant extravagant and baseless pretension we would ask why in what justice if we can not find the object in the route prescribe be we to be thus trammele where be the _ reciprocity _ of such a proposition so degrading to the dignity and insulting to the rights and liberty of this state no the people of maine will not now and we trust they never will tamely submit to such a _ one-sided _ measure the next restriction or limitation with which this negotiation be to be clog be a admission that the restigouche and st john be not atlantic river because one flow into the bay de chaleur and the other into the bay of fundy yet neither fall into the river st lawrence they would then find those highland between the st john and the penobscot there can not be a more arrogant pretension or palpable absurdity suppose the water of both these river be exclude as flow _ neither way _ still the water that flow _ each way _ be so far separate as to leave a tract of country which if equally divide would carry we far beyond the st john but we admit no such hypothesis the _ atlantic _ and the _ sea _ be use in the charter as synonymous term the restigouche unite with the bay de chaleur which communicate with the sea and the st john unite with the bay of fundy which also communicate with the sea and that too by a mouth 90 mile wide be both atlantic river these river be know by the negotiator not to be _ st lawrence river _ they be know to exist for they be river of the first class if they be neither st lawrence nor atlantic why be they not except they be not of the former therefore they must be include in the latter description indeed if river unite with atlantic bay be not atlantic river the penobscot and kennebec which unite with the respective bay of penobscot and sagadahock would not be atlantic river and then where be those highland which divide the water refer to in the treaty of 1783 should we leave this question unsettle a little longer and the british claim continue to increase we might very soon find these highland south of the connecticut and all the intermediate country would be _ recolonize _ by construction we therefore invoke the sympathy of all new england with new york besides to unite against this progressive claim -- this avalanche which threaten to overwhelm _ they as well as ourselves _ again if this mar hill -lrb- and we confess we can not speak of the pretension with any patience -rrb- _ be the northwest angle _ and the north boundary of nova scotium and the south boundary of the province of quebec be the same and north of the bay de chaleurs then there be indeed _ no _ northwest angle for a line due north from the monument passing by mar hill must pursue nearly the same direction to get to the north of that bay without cross it and who ever think of a angle at the side of a continuous line now accord to the british map take in this very case you must run a course of north about 14  east to obtain the north side of the bay without cross it and the distance would be in this almost due north direction more than 100 mile while that from the monument to mar hill would be little more than 40 now when we consider that this northerly line must form nearly a right angle to pass along the north shore of the bay de chaleur that this be 100 mile farther north than mar hill where instead of a angle there can be only a inclination of 14  can there be a greater absurdity than the british claim found on these fact we will now present some fact and remark in regard to the survey and exploring make by the commission under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent and the first fact that occur be that the elevation take by the british surveyor stop far short of where the water divide and we find no proof that these elevation be carry through by we own surveyor if the british surveyor after ascertain _ he be still ascend _ and have in fact arrive at the land at _ a branch of a river _ elevated 500 foot above the summit of mar hill _ find it prudent to stop short _ we see no good reason why the american agent do _ not proceed on _ and take accurate elevation at a place where the water divide if such a survey be make the committee have not be able to obtain the evidence it be not in the map or document in the library or office of the secretary of state and the committee believe that no such elevation have be take northerly of the first water of the restigouche it be indeed a little singular that we have so little evidence not only in regard to this height of land but also of the river which flow into the st lawrence _ to the left _ and _ especially to the right _ of the north line from the monument we know some of they to be sure such as the _ oelle kamouska verte trois pistoles remouskey _ and _ meti _ on the left and the _ blanche loui magdalen _ and other on the right of this line but we know they chiefly as _ on map _ and as transcribe from older map but very little from actual survey or even exploration a examination of the source of those river at the right of this north line with the important natural boundary the north shore of the bay de chaleur would accurately define the divisional line between the province of quebec and nova scotium which extend west would intersect the due north line and thus form the northwest angle of nova scotium it moreover appear that little or no exploration have be make of the land _ east _ of the due north line it seem strange to we although it may be satisfactorily explain why we should have be draw away from this very important region it be indeed the true source of inquiry in this direction the evidence be to be find and maine can never be satisfy until it be look for here a extraordinary method of adjust this question though in perfect accordance with other pretension have be propose by great britain -- that the dispute territory should be divide in equal portion each party be satisfy of the justice of its claim to this proposition we can not subscribe it be equally unjust between nation and individual whether a party in controversy be satisfied or not with the justice of he claim be what be only know to himself and consequently the one whose claim be most exorbitant however unjust will always get the best end of the bargain but such a rule would in this case apply most unfortunately to maine we be limit at farthest to the st lawrence and to a very narrow point there while the british may extend they claim to the south and west indefinitely establish this principle and we shall soon find they claim already so progressive stretch over to the piscataqua and then if we be to divide equally both as to _ quantity and quality _ the divisional line then would fall south of the kennebec if the want of the consent of maine be the obstacle to such a adjustment we trust it will always remain a insuperable one indeed we protest against the application to we of such a rule as manifestly unequal and unjust we come now to the recent transaction of the british colonial authority sanction as it appear by the government at home and we regret to perceive in they also those strong indication of continual and rapid encroachment which have characterize that government in the whole of this controversy mr livingston in he letter of 21st July 1832 propose that until the matter be bring to a final conclusion both party should refrain from the exercise of jurisdiction and mr vaughan in reply of 14th April 1833 in behalf of he government entirely concur here then the faith of the two government _ be pledge to _ abstain from act of jurisdiction until all be settle now how be the fact we understand and indeed it appear by document herewith exhibit that a act have pass the legislature of new brunswick incorporate the st andrew and quebec railroad company that the king have grant # 10000 to aid the enterprise and that the legislature of lower canada by its resolution of both house have approve the scheme and promise its cooperation it may be that the government at home be not aware that this railroad must inevitably cross the dispute territory but this ignorance of the subject seem incredible a railroad from st andrew to quebec would be _ impossible _ unless it cross the territory in question even next to impossible and totally useless be it to pass at the north of the st john it seem therefore extraordinary indeed that the british government even in the incipient stage of this enterprise should make a appropriation which be in direct violation of its solemn pledge to give to a railroad corporation power over we rights and property be the strongest act of sovereignty it be a act of delegated power which we ourselves give to we own citizen with extreme caution and with guard restriction and reservation this railroad _ must _ not only cross the dispute territory but it cross it 50 mile south of the st john and almost to the southerly extremity of the british claim extravagant as it be by the map herewith exhibit of the survey of the route it appear that the road cross we due north line at mar hill thence double round it toward the south it cross the _ roostic _ between the great and little _ machia _ the _ allegwash _ at the outlet of _ first lake _ a branch of the st john south of _ black river _ and pass into canada between spruce hill on the right and three hill on the left thus cross a tract of country south of the st john 100 by 50 mile we have not a copy of the act of incorporation of new brunswick and can not therefore say that the route there define be the same as on the map be this as it may certain it be as anyone will see that no possible route can be devise which will not cross the territory in question it be then a deliberate act of power palpable and direct claim and exercise sovereignty far south even of the line recommend by the king of the netherland in all we inquiry and examination of this subject there have be great negligence in regard to this northwest angle judge benson one of the commissioner under jay 's treaty in a letter to the president of the united state expressly and clearly define this angle he state distinctly that the due north line from the source of the st croix be _ the west-side line _ and the highland be _ the north-side line _ which form this angle and this have never be question by the british themselves this due north line viz the west-side line be establish by the commission of which judge benson be a member and the british have make the north side line to be north of the bay de chaleur and yet with these postulate to pretend that the point of intersection can not be find be one of the greatest of they absurdity and another absurdity quite equal be that after pass west along the north shore of this bay they would fall down nearly south more than 100 mile to mar hill about 60 mile from the south shore of the province at the bay of passamaquoddy which be part of the bay of fundy and this point too of so little inclination that it be a palpable perversion of language to call it _ a angle _ much more a northwest angle it be indeed time for we to begin to search and in the right place too in order to put a stop to these perpetual encroachment upon we territory and rights we first object should be to ascertain and trace the north boundary of nova scotium which be the south boundary of the province of quebec and see if canada come as far down as mar hill and we should proceed to finish take the elevation on the due north line to some point where the water divide the general government should be immediately call on to execute the work with the cooperation of massachusett and maine notice should be give to the british authority to unite in the undertaking and if they refuse we government ought to proceed _ ex parte _ the act would be entirely pacific as the object would be _ to ascertain fact _ -- much more pacific than the survey _ without notice _ of the st andrew and quebec railroad through we territory not for the purpose of ascertain a boundary but to assume jurisdiction you committee have go through this tedious investigation with all the deliberation exactness and candor which we time mean and feeling would allow we animadversion may in some instance have be strong and even severe but we think we have express the sentiment and feeling of the people of maine suffering under protracted injury this state should take a firm deliberate and dignified stand and one which it will not retract while it award to the general government all its legitimate power it will not be forgetful of its own we call upon the president and congress we invoke that aid and sympathy of we sister state which maine have always accord to they we ask nay we demand in the name of justice how long we be to be thus trample down by a foreign people and we trust we shall meet a cordial and patriotic response in the heart of every republican of the union you committee therefore submit the follow resolution : state of maine resolve relative to the northeastern boundary _ resolve _ that we view with much solicitude the british usurpation and encroachment on the northeastern part of the territory of this state _ resolve _ that pretension so groundless and extravagant indicate a spirit of hostility which we have no reason to expect from a nation with whom we be at peace _ resolve _ that vigilance resolution firmness and union on the part of this state be necessary in this state of the controversy _ resolve _ that the governor be authorize and request to call on the president of

he have evidently act in ignorance or under a misconception of the subsist relation betwixt england and the united state of america which i can not allow myself to doubt that you excellency will lose no time in cause to be explain and remove though necessarily commit to confinement i have desire that every regard may be show to greely 's personal convenience consistent with the position in which

and be now in confinement in the jail at frederickton and insist that prompt measure be adopt by the government of the united state to effect the early release of the above-named citizen the circumstance attend this outrage as give in mr greely 's letter be not sufficient in the view of the president to warrant the interference of the government at present for what cause at what place and by what authority the arrest be make be not state the necessary explanation may be find perhaps in the previous communication which mr greely refer to as have be address to you by he on the 10th June if not it be probable that you will easily be able to obtain explicit information from other source and communicate it to this department it be indispensable that a full knowledge of all the fact illustrative of the case should be in possession of the government before any formal application for redress can be properly prefer in the meantime i have in conversation unofficially call the attention of mr fox the british minister at washington to this complaint and he have give I a assurance that he will immediately address a representation on the subject to the governor of new

relation to the subject of the northeastern boundary with the exception of such as be furnish this department by the general government in the year 1827 it be understand that copy have be furnished relative to this subject down to the respective statement submit by the two government to the king of the netherland but the argument we have not be furnish with i be very respectfully you obedient servant robert p dunlap state of maine executive department _ July 3 1837 _ hon john forsyte _ secretary of state of united state _ sir : i have have the honor to receive yours of the 26th of June last in which by direction of the president you indicate that the circumstance detail in mr greely 's letter relative to he arrest and imprisonment be not of themselves without further explanation sufficient to justify the interference of the government of the united state this information be receive with some surprise and much regret -- surprise because i have understand mr greely 's communication to show that while employ within the limit of this state and under its authority on a business intrust to he by the law of the state he be without be charge or suspect of any other offense seize and transport to a foreign jail regret inasmuch as the feeling of the people of this state have be strongly excite by this outrage upon the honor and sovereignty of maine and each additional day 's confinement which that unoffending citizen endure be add to the indignation of we citizen i therefore hasten to lay before you a summary of the transaction connect with this subject as they be gather from mr greely 's communication to this department the fact be to be consider the less indisputable because they be in the main confirm by the statement contain in the letter of the lieutenant-governor of the province of new brunswick by whose order the imprisonment be make and a copy of which i recently have the honor of transmit to the president on the 8th day of march last the legislature of this state pass a act relative to the surplus revenue a copy of which be inclose -lrb- 2 -rrb- to the eleventh twelfth and thirteenth section of which i beg leave to refer you attention a additional act be pass on the 29th day of march last a copy of which i also inclose -lrb- 2 -rrb- by this last-named act it become the duty of the county commissioner of penobscot county to cause a enumeration to be take of the inhabitant of say county reside north of the survey and located township the tract thus define comprise the town of madawaska which be incorporate by this state on the 15th of march 1831 pursuant to that requirement the county commissioner of say county appoint ebenezer s greely to perform that service and be duly commission he forthwith proceed to the place designate and enter upon the require operation be thus employ he be on the 29th day of may last arrest by the authority of the province of new brunswick and convey to woodstock in the county of carleton in say province but the sheriff of the county refuse to commit he to jail and he be accordingly discharge he immediately return to the madawaska settlement to enter again upon the duty intrust to he on the 6th day of June last he be arrest a second time by the same authority and commit to the jail at frederickton it be for this act of obedience to the law of he government that mr greely now lie incarcerate in a public jail in the province of new brunswick be not redress urgently call for must not this unoffending citizen be immediately release permit I sir to add my confident belief that the president on this presentation of the fact relative to this outrage upon the national as well as the state rights will not fail to demand the immediate release of ebenezer s greely and to interpose suitable claim of indemnity for the wrong so wantonly enforce upon he i be very respectfully you obedient servant robert p dunlap -lrb- footnote 2 : omit -rrb- department of state _ washington July 14 1837 _ hon robert p dunlap _ governor of the state of maine _ sir : you letter of the 3d instant have be receive the surprise you express that the information contain in the letter of mr greely which accompany you former communication be not consider sufficient to enable the president to make a formal application to the british government for he release have probably arise from

department _ July 28 1837 _ he excellency martin van buren _ president of the united state _ sir : impel by a sense of duty arise from the oversight commit to I of the rights and interest of this state i beg leave to invite the attention of you excellency to the subject of the northeastern boundary of maine by the federal compact the obligation of defend each state against foreign invasion and of protect it in the exercise of its jurisdictional rights up to its extreme line of boundary be devolve upon the national government permit I respectfully to inform the president that in the opinion of the people of maine the justice due to this state in this respect have not be render let it not be suspect that the discontent which be move strongly and deeply through the public mind flow from any deficiency of attachment or practical adhesion to we national government without appeal to the blood so freely pour out in war by the citizen of maine to the privation so cheerfully endure while the restrictive measure of the government be prostrate the most important interest of this commercial people or to the support of the union so cordially give through every vicissitude up to the present hour such a suspicion if it could arise would be sufficiently refute by merely advert to the forbearance with which they have so long endure the aggression by a foreign government upon they sovereignty they citizen and they soil it would be easy to prove that the territory of maine extend to the highland north of the st john but that point have be not only admit but successful demonstrate by the federal government need not now to be discuss candor however require I to say that this concede and undeniable position ill accord with the proceedings in which the british authority have for many year be indulge and by which the rightful jurisdiction of maine have be subvert she land ravage of they most valuable product and she citizen drag beyond the limit of the state to undergo the suffering and ignominy of a foreign jail these outrage have be make know to the federal government they have be the subject of repeat remonstrance by the state and these remonstrance seem as often to have be contemn it can not be deem irrelevant for I here to ask amid all these various imposition and while maine have be vigorously employ in sustain the union and in train she child to the same high standard of devotion to the political institution of the country what relief have be bring to we by the federal government the invader have not be expel the sovereignty and soil of the state be yet stain by the hostile machination of resident emissary of a foreign government the territory and the jurisdiction of 6000000 acre we title to which the government of the united state have pronounce to be perfect have without the knowledge of maine be once put entirely at hazard grave discussion treaty arrangement and sovereign arbitration have be resort to in which maine be not permit to speak and they have result not in remove the fictitious pretension but in supply new encouragement to the aggressor diplomatic ingenuity the only foundation of the british claim have be array against the perfect right in the meantime a stipulation make by the executive of the nation without the knowledge of maine purported to preclude she from reclaim she rightful jurisdiction until the slow process of a negotiation should be bring to a close whatever the real force of that stipulation might be make as it be without the concurrence of the two branch of the treaty-making power it be hope when it expire by the close up of that negotiation that a measure fraught with such hurtful consequence to maine would not again be attempt but that hope be to be disappointed and now by a compact of similar character a writ of protection appear to have be spread by we own government over the whole mass of british aggression what then have the federal government do for this state may it not be say in the language of another maine have not be treat as she endeavor to deserve on the 22d day of April last i have the honor to transmit to you excellency certain resolve pass by the legislature of this state relative to the northeastern boundary and in behalf of the state to call upon the president of the united state to cause the line to be explore and survey and monument thereof erect that this call make by direction of the legislature do not extend to the expulsion of invader but merely to the ascertainment of the treaty line will i trust be view as it be design to be not only as a evidence of the continue forbearance of maine but as a testimonial of the confidence she cherish that the federal executive would protect the territory after its limitation should be ascertain that this application would meet with favor from the federal executive be expect more especially as congress have make a specific appropriation for the purpose i will not attempt to conceal the mortification i have realize that no reply have be make to that communication nor any measure take so far as my information extend for effect the object propose it now remain that in the exercise of that faithfulness for which i stand solemnly pledge to the people of maine i should again commend to the attention of the national executive this apparently unwelcome but really important subject i have therefore the honor again to request that the president will cause the treaty line upon the northeastern limit of maine to be run and mark and i can not but hope that on a reexamination of the subject you excellency will concur with this state in relation to the rightfulness and the necessity of the measure propose as well as to all the remedy to be adopt for restore to maine the invaluable rights from which she have so long be debar i have the honor to be with high consideration you obedient servant robert p dunlap department of state _ washington August 17 1837 _ he excellency robert p dunlap _ governor of the state of maine _ sir : you letter of the 28th ultimo to the president be duly receive it have be refer to this department with instruction to make a suitable reply you excellency be of opinion that the federal government have for a series of year fail to protect the state of maine in the exercise of she jurisdictional rights to the extent of she boundary and complain that these rights have be in consequence thereof subvert the land of the state ravage of they most valuable production and she citizen subject to imprisonment in a foreign jail you excellency particularly object to the course of the federal government for have without the knowledge of the state put entirely at hazard the title of maine admit by the government of the united state to be perfect to the territory in question by the resort to diplomatic discussion treaty arrangement and foreign arbitration in which maine be not permit to speak for have enter into a stipulation without she consent purport to preclude the state from retain she rightful jurisdiction pend a negotiation and for the continuance of it after that negotiation be suppose to have be conclude and for a omission on the part of the executive of the united state to comply with a application of the state make through she legislature to have the boundary line between maine and the british north american possession explore survey and monument erect thereon in pursuance of the authority confer on the president by congress and of a request make by you excellency which be now renew the view which you excellency have be please to take of the subject at this time embrace measure some of which have long since cease to be operative and reach back to the propriety of the stipulation enter into by the treaty of ghent also of the subsequent negotiation design to bring those stipulation to a satisfactory result in the mode prescribe by that treaty -- that of arbitrament it be as you excellency state the opinion of maine that those proceedings be unjust and unwise it be in a matter in which she be so deeply interested she undoubted right to say so yet the president think that he can not be mistake in believe that no practical good can at this time be expect from discussion between the federal and state government upon those point that the measure refer to have not be as fortunate in they result as be hope be entirely true but you excellency may nevertheless be assure that they have they origin in a sincere desire on the part of the federal government to discharge all its duty toward the state of maine as a member of the union and be resort to in the full belief that she just rights would be promote by they adoption in speaking of the restriction impose upon maine in reclaim she rightful jurisdiction you excellency doubtlessly refer to the understanding between the federal government and that of great britain that each party should abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction over the dispute territory during the pendency of negotiation unless it be correct to say that the controversy be one that do not admit of negotiation and that the duty of the federal government consist only in a immediate resort to maintain the construction put by itself upon its own rights and those of the state of maine there would seem to be no reasonable objection to such a arrangement as that allude to whether it be view in respect to the interest or the pacific and just character of the respective government that this arrangement be not abrogate at the period at which you excellency be understand to suppose that it ought to have be do viz upon the failure of a settlement of the controversy by arbitration be explain by event of subsequent occurrence when the award of the arbitrator be submit by the late president to the senate of the united state that body refuse its advice and consent to the execution of the award and pass a resolution recommend to he to open a new negotiation with great britain for the ascertainment of the boundary accord to the treaty of peace of 1783 that negotiation be forthwith enter upon by the executive be still pend and have be prosecute with unremitting assiduity it be under such circumstance that the federal executive have decide upon a continued compliance with the arrangement refer to and have insist also upon its observance on the part of great britain consideration of a similar nature have induce the president to refrain hitherto from exercise the discretionary authority with which he be invest to cause the boundary line in dispute to be explore survey and monument to be erect thereon coincide with the government of maine on the question of the true boundary between the british province and the state the president be yet bind by duty to consider the claim which have be set up by a foreign power in amity with the united state and the circumstance under which the negotiation for the adjustment of that claim have be transmit to he it could not be useful to examine the foundation of the british claim in a letter to you excellency respect for the authority of a friendly nation compel we to admit that they have persuade themselves that they claim be justly ground however that may be the present president of the united state upon enter on the discharge of the duty of he office find that a distinct proposition have be make by he predecessor for the purpose of amicably settle this long-disputed controversy to which no answer have yet be receive under such circumstance the president be not able to satisfy himself however anxious to gratify the people and the legislature of maine that a step like that recommend by they could be usefully or properly take the clause contain the specific appropriation make by the last congress for explore survey and mark certain portion of the northeastern boundary of the united state to which you excellency allude be by no means imperative in its character the simple legislative act of place a sum of money under the control of the executive for a designate object be not understand to be a direction that it must in any event be immediately apply to the prosecution of that object on the contrary so far from imply that the end in view be to be attain at all hazard it be believe that it merely vest a discretionary power in the president to carry out the view of congress on he own responsibility should contingency arise to render expedient the propose expenditure under exist circumstance the president deem it proper to wait for the definitive answer of the british government to the last proposition offer by the united state when receive a further communication to you excellency may be find proper and if so will be make without unnecessary delay it can not be necessary to assure you excellency that the omission to reply to you communication forwarding to this department the resolution of the legislature of maine do not in any degree arise either from a want of respect for they wish or for the wish of you excellency or from indifference to the interest of the state when these resolution be receive there be every reason at no distant day to expect what be now daily look for -- a definitive answer to the proposition just allude to to which the attention of the british government have be again forcibly invite about the time those resolution be on they passage under this expectation a reply to the application from maine be temporarily delay the more readily as about the time of its reception the representative of maine act in reference to one of those resolution have a full and free conversation with the president the most recent proceedings relative to the question of boundary be show to they in this department by he direction and the occasion thus afford be cheerfully embrace of offer frank and unreserved explanation of the president 's view of the recent event which have call the attention of the state of maine to the question of the northeastern boundary and which have be bring by it to the notice of the president one -- the arrest and imprisonment of mr greely -- have already be make the subject of communication with you excellency all that it be competent for the federal executive to do have be do redress have be demand will be insist upon and be expect from that authority from whom alone redress can properly be seek the president have follow the same course that be pursue by one of he predecessor and which be understand to be satisfactory to the state of maine under circumstance of a somewhat similar character in respect to the other -- the project construction of a railroad between st andrew and quebec -- a representation have be address to the british government state that the propose measure be inconsistent with the understanding between the two government to preserve the _ status quo _ in the dispute territory until the question of boundary be satisfactorily adjust remonstrate against the project as contrary to the american claim and demand a suspension of all further movement in execution of it no answer have yet be receive to this communication from a informal conversation between the british minister at washington and myself at the department of state the president be however firm in the conviction that the attempt to make the road in question will not be further prosecute i be in conclusion direct to inform you that however unbounded may be the confidence of the legislature and people of maine in the justice of they claim to the boundary contend for by the united state the president 's be not less so and you excellency may rest assure that no exertion have be or shall be spare on he part to bring to a favorable and speedy termination a question involve interest so highly important to maine and to the union i have the honor to be with high consideration you excellency 's obedient servant john forsyth department of state _ washington August 25 1837 _ he excellency robert p dunlap _ governor of maine _ sir : i have the honor to transmit to you excellency by direction of the president the copy of a note from the british minister at washington date yesterday state that the government of she britannic majesty have be please to direct the immediate discontinuance by the colonial authority of lower canada and new brunswick respectively of all operation connect with the project railroad between the city of quebec and st andrew mr fox take occasion on Wednesday last to inform I that mr greely have be discharge from imprisonment at frederickton a fact of which doubtlessly you excellency have be some time since apprise i have the honor to be with high consideration you excellency 's obedient servant john forsyth department of state _ washington march 23 1837 _ henry s fox esq etc : the undersign secretary of state of the united state have the honor by direction of the president to invite the attention of mr fox he britannic majesty 's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to a subject which from its high importance demand the prompt consideration of he majesty 's government it appear from representation and document recently receive at the department of state that a number of inhabitant of the town of st andrew in new brunswick associate themselves together in the year 1835 by the name of the st andrew and quebec railroad association for the purpose of bring into public notice the practicability of construct a railway between those port and that sundry resolution be pass in furtherance of this object that the project be sanction and patronize by the governor in chief of british north america the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick and nova scotium and the legislature and people of the province of lower canada and new brunswick that the route of the propose railroad have be explore as far as the head water of the st john river by surveyor employ by the association that a act have actually pass the legislature of new brunswick incorporate this company and that a similar act be expect to be pass in lower canada that letter be address to the board of trade of quebec and montreal request they cooperation that these communication be favorably receive and that petition have be forward to he britannic majesty sign by committee of the association and by inhabitant of the city of quebec and montreal solicit the construction of a railway between the port above name or the extension of royal aid and protection to the petitioner in the propose undertaking without allow himself for a moment to believe that he britannic majesty 's government will in any manner countenance the project railroad from st andrew to quebec when the slightest inspection of the map of the country which it cross will show that its intended location would be for a great portion of the route a encroachment upon the territory in dispute between the united state and great britain the president yet see cause for painful surprise and deep regret in the fact that the civil authority of he majesty 's province on we northeastern border should have lend they encouragement to or should in any wise have promote a undertaking which if persevere in will inevitably lead to the most disastrous consequence the object of the association from its inception be objectionable since it could only be effect by enter upon territory the title to which be controvert and unsettle -- a proceeding which could not fail to be offensive to the government and people of the united state still more unjustifiable be the act of sovereignty give to this company corporate power over property know to be claim by citizen of a friendly and neighboring state and which constitute at the time the subject of a amicable negotiation between the government of he majesty and that of the united state the president regret to see in this step on the part of he majesty 's provincial authority and subject a most exceptionable departure from the principle of continue to abstain during the progress of negotiation from any extension of the exercise of jurisdiction within the dispute territory on either side the propriety of which have be hitherto so sedulously inculcate and so distinctly acquiesce in by both party a understanding that this principle should be observe by they be the natural result of the respective position and pacific intention of the two government and could alone prevent the exercise of assert rights by force without it the end of all negotiation on the subject would have be defeat if therefore nothing have be say by either party relative to such a understand it would have be proper to infer that a tacit agreement to that effect exist between the two government but the correspondence between they be sufficiently full and explicit to prevent all misconception the view of both government in respect to it will be find in the letter of the secretary of state to the minister of great britain date the 18th of January 1826 9th of January 11th of march and 11th of may 1829 and of the british minister to the secretary of state dated 15th of November and 2d of December 1825 16th of January 1827 18th of February and 25th of march 1828 and 14th of April 1833 as well as in other communication which it be deem needless now to

of the united state to the territory in question and as a unwarrantable assumption of jurisdiction therein by the british government and the undersign be instruct to urge the prompt adoption of such measure as may be deem most appropriate by he majesty 's government to suspend any further movement in execution of the propose railroad from st andrew to quebec during the continuance of the pend negotiation between the two government relative to the northeastern boundary of the united state the proceedings above allude to consider in connection with incident on other part of the dispute boundary line well know to he majesty 's minister would seem to render it indispensable to the maintenance of those liberal and friendly relation between the two country which both government be so sincerely anxious to preserve that they should come to a speedy adjustment of the subject the recent resolution of the state of maine to which the project railroad from st andrew to quebec give rise request the president of the united state to cause the line establish by the treaty of 1783 to be run and monument to be establish thereon and the appropriation of $ 20000 by congress at they late session to enable the executive to carry that request into effect with a subsequent earnest application from the representative of maine for a immediate compliance with it afford additional incentive to exertion to bring this controversy to a conclusion not to be disregard by the president of the united state the president therefore await with great anxiety the decision of he majesty 's government on the proposition make by the undersign to he majesty 's charg d'affaire at washington in February 1836 suggest the river st john from its mouth to its source as a eligible and convenient line of

the condition of we foreign relation have not materially change since the last annual message of my predecessor we remain at peace with all nation and no effort on my part consistent with the preservation of we rights and the honor of the country shall be spare to maintain a position so consonant to we institution we have faithfully sustain the foreign policy with which the united state under the guidance of they first president take they stand in the family of nation -- that of regulate they intercourse with other power by the approve principle of private life ask and accord equal rights and equal privilege render and demand justice in all case advance they own and discuss the pretension of other with candor directness and sincerity appeal at all time to reason but never yield to force nor seek to acquire anything for themselves by its exercise a rigid adherence to this policy have leave this government with scarcely a claim upon its justice for injury arise from act commit

in respect to we northeastern boundary it be with unfeigned regret that the people of the united state must look back upon the abortive effort make by the executive for a period of more than half a century to determine what no nation should suffer long to remain in dispute -- the true line which divide its possession from those of other power the nature of the settlement on the border of the united state and of the neighbor territory be for a season such that this perhaps be not indispensable to a faithful performance of the duty of the federal government time have however change this state of thing and have bring about a condition of affair in which the true interest of both country imperatively require that this question should be put at rest it be not to be disguise that with full confidence often express in the desire of the british government to terminate it we be apparently as far from its adjustment as we be at the time of sign the treaty of peace in 1783 the sole result of long-pending negotiation and a perplexing arbitration appear to be a conviction on its part that a conventional line must be adopt from the impossibility of ascertain the true one accord to the description contain in that treaty without coincide in this opinion which be not think to be well found my predecessor give the strongest proof of the earnest desire of the united state to terminate satisfactorily this dispute by propose the substitution of a conventional line if the consent of the state interested in the question could be obtain to this proposition no answer have as

also i be persuade become more general with the people of england than at any previous period it be scarcely necessary to say to you how cordially it be reciprocate by the government and people of the united state the conviction which must be common to all of the injurious consequence that result from keep open this irritating question and the certainty that its final settlement can not be much longer defer will i trust lead to a early and satisfactory adjustment at you last session i lay before you the recent communication between the two government and between this government and that of the state of maine in whose solicitude concern a subject in which she have so deep a interest every portion of the union participate the feeling produce by a temporary interruption of those harmonious relation between france and the united state which be due as well to the recollection of former time as to a correct appreciation of exist interest have be happily succeed by a cordial disposition on both side to cultivate a active friendship in they future intercourse the opinion undoubtedly correct and steadily entertain by we that the commercial relation at present exist between the two country be susceptible of great and reciprocally beneficial improvement be obviously gain ground in france and i be assure of the disposition of that government to favor the accomplishment of such a object this disposition shall be meet in a proper spirit on we part the few and comparatively unimportant question that remain to be adjust between we can i have no doubt be settle with entire satisfaction and without difficulty between russium and the united state sentiment of good will continue to be mutually cherish we minister recently accredit to that court have be receive with a frankness and cordiality and with evidence of respect for he country which leave we no room to doubt the preservation in future of those amicable and liberal relation which have so long and so uninterruptedly exist between the two country on the few subject under discussion between we a early and just decision be confidently anticipate a correspondence have be open with the government of austrium for the establishment of diplomatic relation in conformity with the wish of congress as indicate by a appropriation act of the session of 1837 and arrangement make for the purpose which will be duly carry into effect with austrium and prussium and with the state of the german empire -lrb- now compose with the latter the commercial league -rrb- we political relation be of the most friendly character whilst we commercial intercourse be gradually extend with benefit to all who be engage in it civil war yet rage in spain produce intense suffer to its own people and to other nation inconvenience and regret we citizen who have claim upon that country will be prejudice for a time by the condition of its treasury the inevitable consequence of long-continued and exhausting internal war the last installment of the interest of the debt due under the convention with the queen of spain have not be pay and similar failure may be expect to happen until a portion of the resource of she kingdom can be devote to the extinguishment of its foreign debt have receive satisfactory evidence that discriminate tonnage duty be charge upon the vessel of the united state in the port of portugal a proclamation be issue on the 11th day of October last in compliance with the act of may 25 1832 declare that fact and the duty on foreign tonnage which be levy upon portuguese vessel in the united state previously to the passage of that act be accordingly revive the act of July 4 1836 suspend the discriminate duty upon the produce of portugal import into this country in portuguese vessel be pass upon the application of that government through its representative here under the belief that no similar discrimination exist in portugal to the prejudice of the united state i regret to state that such duty be now exact in that country upon the cargo of american vessel and as the act refer to vest no discretion in the executive it be for congress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the subject against these discrimination affect the vessel of this country and they cargo seasonable remonstrance be make and notice be give to the portuguese government that unless they should be discontinue the adoption of countervail measure on the part of the united state would become necessary but the reply of that government receive at the department of state through we charg d'affaire at lisbon in the month of September last afford no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system so little in harmony with the treatment show to the vessel of portugal and they cargo in the port of this country and so contrary to the expectation we have a right to entertain with holland sweden denmark naple and belgium a friendly intercourse have be uninterruptedly maintain with the government of the ottoman porte and its dependency on the coast of the mediterranean peace and good will be carefully cultivate and have be foster by such good office as the relative distance and the condition of those country would permit we commerce with greece be carry on under the law of the two government reciprocally beneficial to the navigate interest of both and i have reason to look forward to the adoption of other measure which will be more extensively and permanently advantageous copy of the treaty conclude with the government of siam and muscat be transmit for the information of congress the ratification have be receive and the treaty make public since the close of the last annual session already have we reason to congratulate ourselves on the prospect of considerable commercial benefit and we have besides receive from the sultan of muscat prompt evidence of he desire to cultivate the most friendly feeling by liberal act toward one of we vessel bestow in a manner so striking as to require on we part a grateful acknowledgment we commerce with the island of cuba and porto rico still labor under heavy restriction the continuance of which be a subject of regret the only effect of a adherence to they will be to benefit the navigation of other country at the expense of both the united state and spain the independent nation of this continent have ever since they emerge from the colonial state experience severe trial in they progress to the permanent establishment of liberal political institution they unsettled condition not only interrupt they own advance to prosperity but have often seriously injure the other power of the world the claim of we citizen upon peru chili brazil the argentine republic the government form out of the republic of colombium and mexico be still pend although many of they have be present for examination more than twenty year new granada venezuelum and ecuador have recently form a convention for the purpose of ascertain and adjust claim upon the republic of colombium from which it be earnestly hope we citizen will ere long receive full compensation for the injury inflict upon they and for the delay in afford it a advantageous treaty of commerce have be conclude by the united state with the peru-bolivian confederation which want only the ratification of that government the progress of a subsequent negotiation for the settlement of claim upon peru have be unfavorably affect by the war between that power and chili and the argentine republic and the same event be also likely to produce delay in the settlement of we demand on those power the aggravating circumstance connect with we claim upon mexico and a variety of event touch the honor and integrity of we government lead my predecessor to make at the second session of the last congress a special recommendation of the course to be pursue to obtain a speedy and final satisfaction of the injury complain of by this government and by we citizen he recommend a final demand of redress with a contingent authority to the executive to make reprisal if that demand should be make in vain from the proceedings of congress on that recommendation it appear that the opinion of both branch of the legislature coincide with that of the executive that any mode of redress know to the law of nation might justifiably be use it be obvious too that congress believe with the president that another demand should be make in order to give undeniable and satisfactory proof of we desire to avoid extremity with a neighboring power but that there be a indisposition to vest a discretionary authority in the executive to take redress should it unfortunately be either deny or unreasonably delay by the mexican government so soon as the necessary document be prepare after enter upon the duty of my office a special messenger be send to mexico to make a final demand of redress with the document require by the provision of we treaty the demand be make on the 20th of July last the reply which bear date the 29th of the same month contain assurance of a desire on the part of that government to give a prompt and explicit answer respect each of the complaint but that the examination of they would necessarily be deliberate that in this examination it would be guide by the principle of public law and the obligation of treaty that nothing should be leave undo that might lead to the most speedy and equitable adjustment of we demand and that its determination in respect to each case should be communicate through the mexican minister here since that time a envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary have be accredit to this government by that of the mexican republic he bring with he assurance of a sincere desire that the pend difference between the two government should be terminate in a manner satisfactory to both he be receive with reciprocal assurance and a hope be entertain that he mission would lead to a speedy satisfactory and final adjustment of all exist subject of complaint a sincere believer in the wisdom of the pacific policy by which the united state have always be govern in they intercourse with foreign nation it be my particular desire from the proximity of the mexican republic and well-known occurrence on we frontier to be instrumental in obviate all exist difficulty with that government and in restore to the intercourse between the two republic that liberal and friendly character by which they should always be distinguish i regret therefore the more deeply to have find in the recent communication of that government so little reason to hope that any future effort of mine for the accomplishment of those desirable object would be successful although the larger number -- and many of they aggravate case of personal wrong -- have be now for year before the mexican government and some of the cause of national complaint and those of the most offensive character admit of immediate simple and satisfactory reply it be only within a few day past that any specific communication in answer to we last demand make five month ago have be receive from the mexican minister by the report of the secretary of state herewith present and the accompany document it will be see that for not one of we public complaint have satisfaction be give or offer that but one of the case of personal wrong have be favorably consider and that but four case of both description out of all those formally present and earnestly press have as yet be decide upon by the mexican government not perceive in what manner any of the power give to the executive alone could be further usefully employ in bring this unfortunate controversy to a satisfactory termination the subject be by my predecessor refer to congress as one call for its interposition in accordance with the clearly understand wish of the legislature another and formal demand for satisfaction have be make upon the mexican government with what success the document now communicate will show on a careful and deliberate examination of they contents and consider the spirit manifest by the mexican government it have become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stand to congress to whom it belong to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress whatever may be you decision it shall be faithfully execute confident that it will be characterize by that moderation and justice which will i trust under all circumstance govern the council of we country the balance in the treasury on the 1st January 1837 be $ 45968523 the receipt during the present year from all source include the amount of treasury note issue be estimate at $ 23499981 constitute a aggregate of $ 69468504 of this amount about $ 35281361 will have be expend at the end of the year on appropriation make by congress and the residue amounting to $ 34187143 will be the nominal balance in the treasury on the 1st of January next but of that sum only $ 1085498 be consider as immediately available for and applicable to public purpose those portion of it which will be for some time unavailable consist chiefly of sum deposit with the state and due from the former deposit bank the detail upon this subject will be find in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury the amount of treasury note which it will be necessary to issue during the year on account of those fund be unavailable will it be suppose not exceed four and a half million it seem proper in the condition of the country to have the estimate on all subject make as low as practicable without prejudice to any great public measure the department be therefore desire to prepare they estimate accordingly and i be happy to find that they have be able to graduate they on so economical a scale in the great and often unexpected fluctuation to which the revenue be subject it be not possible to compute the receipt beforehand with great certainty but should they not differ essentially from present anticipation and should the appropriation not much exceed the estimate no difficulty seem likely to happen in defray the current expense with promptitude and fidelity notwithstanding the great embarrassment which have recently occur in commercial affair and the liberal indulgence which in consequence of these embarrassment have be extend to both the merchant and the bank it be gratify to be able to anticipate that the treasury note which have be issue during the present year will be redeem and that the resource of the treasury without any resort to loan or increase tax will prove ample for defray all charge impose on it during 1838 the report of the secretary of the treasury will afford you a more minute exposition of all matter connect with the administration of the finances during the current year -- a period which for the amount of public money disburse and deposit with the state as well as the financial difficulty encounter and overcome have few parallel in we history you attention be at the last session invite to the necessity of additional legislative provision in respect to the collection safe-keeping and transfer of the public money no law have be then mature and not understand the proceedings of congress as intend to be final it become my duty again to bring the subject to you notice on that occasion three mode of perform this branch of the public service be present for consideration these be the creation of a national bank the revival with modification of the deposit system establish by the act of the 23d of June 1836 permit the use of the public money by the bank and the discontinuance of the use of such institution for the purpose refer to with suitable provision for they accomplishment through the agency of public officer consider the opinion of both house of congress on the first two proposition as express in the negative in which i entirely concur it be unnecessary for I again to recur to they in respect to the last you have have a opportunity since you adjournment not only to test still further the expediency of the measure by the continue practical operation of such part of it as be now in force but also to discover what should ever be seek for and regard with the utmost deference -- the opinion and wish of the people the national will be the supreme law of the republic and on all subject within the limit of he constitutional power should be faithfully obey by the public servant since the measure in question be submit to you consideration most of you have enjoy the advantage of personal communication with you constituent for one state only have a election be hold for the federal government but the early day at which it take place deprive the measure under consideration of much of the support it might otherwise have derive from the result local election for state officer have however be hold in several of the state at which the expediency of the plan propose by the executive have be more or less discuss you will i be confident yield to they result the respect due to every expression of the public voice desire however to arrive at truth and a just view of the subject in all its bearing you will at the same time remember that question of far deeper and more immediate local interest than the fiscal plan of the national treasury be involve in those election above all we can not overlook the striking fact that there be at the time in those state more than one hundred and sixty million of bank capital of which large portion be subject to actual forfeiture other large portion uphold only by special and limited legislative indulgence and most of it if not all to a greater or less extent dependent for a continuance of its corporate existence upon the will of the state legislature to be then choose apprise of this circumstance you will judge whether it be not most probable that the peculiar condition of that vast interest in these respects the extent to which it have be spread through all the ramification of society its direct connection with the then pend election and the feeling it be calculate to infuse into the canvass have exercise a far greater influence over the result than any which could possibly have be produce by a conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the administration of the general government more remote and far less important in its bearing upon that interest i have find no reason to change my own opinion as to the expediency of adopt the system propose be perfectly satisfied that there will be neither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affair of the government or in the pecuniary transaction of individual and corporation so long as a connection exist between they which like the past offer such strong inducement to make they the subject of political agitation indeed i be more than ever convince of the danger to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion -- the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government -- would be expose by any further increase of the already overgrown influence of corporate authority i can not therefore consistently with my view of duty advise a renewal of a connection which circumstance have dissolve the discontinuance of the use of state bank for fiscal purpose ought not to be regard as a measure of hostility toward those institution bank properly establish and conduct be highly useful to the business of the country and will doubtless continue to exist in the state so long as they conform to they law and be find to be safe and beneficial how they should be create what privilege they should enjoy under what responsibility they should act and to what restriction they should be subject be question which as i observe on a previous occasion belong to the state to decide upon they rights or the exercise of they the general government can have no motive to encroach its duty toward they be well perform when it refrain from legislating for they special benefit because such legislation would violate the spirit of the constitution and be unjust to other interest when it take no step to impair they usefulness but so manage its own affair as to make it the interest of those institution to strengthen and improve they condition for the security and welfare of the community at large they have no right to insist on a connection with the federal government nor on the use of the public money for they own benefit the object of the measure under consideration be to avoid for the future a compulsory connection of this kind it propose to place the general government in regard to the essential point of the collection safe-keeping and transfer of the public money in a situation which shall relieve it from all dependence on the will of irresponsible individual or corporation to withdraw those money from the use of private trade and confide they to agent constitutionally select and control by law to abstain from improper interference with the industry of the people and withhold inducement to improvident dealings on the part of individual to give stability to the concern of the treasury to preserve the measure of the government from the unavoidable reproach that flow from such a connection and the bank themselves from the injurious effect of a suppose participation in the political conflict of the day from which they will otherwise find it difficult to escape these be my view upon this important subject form after careful reflection and with no desire but to arrive at what be most likely to promote the public interest they be now as they be before submit with unfeigned deference for the opinion of other it be hardly to be hope that change so important on a subject so interesting could be make without produce a serious diversity of opinion but so long as those conflict view be keep above the influence of individual or local interest so long as they pursue only the general good and be discuss with moderation and candor such diversity be a benefit not a injury if a majority of congress see the public welfare in a different light and more especially if they should be satisfy that the measure propose would not be acceptable to the people i shall look to they wisdom to substitute such as may be more conducive to the one and more satisfactory to the other in any event they may confidently rely on my hearty cooperation to the fullest extent to which my view of the constitution and my sense of duty will permit it be obviously important to this branch of the public service and to the business and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in some way be settle and regulate by law and if possible at you present session besides the plan above refer to i be not aware that any one have be suggest except that of keep the public money in the state bank in special deposit this plan be to some extent in accordance with the practice of the government and with the present arrangement of the treasury department which except perhaps during the operation of the late deposit act have always be allow even during the existence of a national bank to make a temporary use of the state bank in particular place for the safe-keeping of portion of the revenue this discretionary power might be continue if congress deem it desirable whatever general system be adopt so long as the connection be voluntary we need perhaps anticipate few of those difficulty and little of that dependence on the bank which must attend every such connection when compulsory in its nature and when so arrange as to make the bank a fixed part of the machinery of government it be undoubtedly in the power of congress so to regulate and guard it as to prevent the public money from be apply to the use or intermingle with the affair of individual thus arrange although it would not give to the government that entire control over its own fund which i desire to secure to it by the plan i have propose it would it must be admit in a great degree accomplish one of the object which have recommend that plan to my judgment -- the separation of the fiscal concern of the government from those of individual or corporation with these observation i recommend the whole matter to you dispassionate reflection confidently hope that some conclusion may be reach by you deliberation which on the one hand shall give safety and stability to the fiscal operation of the government and be consistent on the other with the genius of we institution and with the interest and wish of the great mass of we constituent it be my hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on this occasion any allusion to the late national bank there be circumstance however connect with the present state of its affair that bear so directly on the character of the government and the welfare of the citizen that i should not feel myself excuse in neglect to notice they the charter which terminate its banking privilege on the 4th of march 1836 continue its corporate power two year more for the sole purpose of close its affair with authority to use the corporate name style and capacity for the purpose of suit for a final settlement and liquidation of the affair and act of the corporation and for the sale and disposition of they estate -- real personal and mixed -- but for no other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever just before the banking privilege cease its effect be transfer by the bank to a new state institution then recently incorporate in trust for the discharge of its debt and the settlement of its affair with this trustee by authority of congress a adjustment be subsequently make of the large interest which the government have in the stock of the institution the manner in which a trust unexpectedly create upon the act grant the charter and involve such great public interest have be execute would under any circumstance be a fit subject of inquiry but much more do it deserve you attention when it embrace the redemption of obligation to which the authority and credit of the united state have give value the two year allow be now nearly at a end it be well understand that the trustee have not redeem and cancel the outstanding note of the bank but have reissue and be actually reissue since the 3d of march 1836 the note which have be receive by it to a vast amount accord to its own official statement so late as the 1st of October last nineteen month after the banking privilege give by the charter have expire it have under its control uncanceled note of the late bank of the united state to the amount of $ 27561866 of which $ 6175861 be in actual circulation $ 1468627 at state bank agency and $ 3002390 _ in transitu _ thus show that upward of ten million and a half of the note of the old bank be then still keep outstanding the impropriety of this procedure be obvious it be the duty of the trustee to cancel and not to put forth the note of a institution whose concern it have undertake to wind up if the trustee have a right to reissue these note now i can see no reason why it may not continue to do so after the expiration of the two year as no one could have anticipate a course so extraordinary the prohibitory clause of the charter above quote be not accompany by any penalty or other special provision for enforce it nor have we any general law for the prevention of similar act in future but it be not in this view of the subject alone that you interposition be require the united state in settle with the trustee for they stock have withdraw they fund from they former direct liability to the creditor of the old bank yet note of the institution continue to be send forth in its name and apparently upon the authority of the united state the transaction connect with the employment of the bill of the old bank be of vast extent and should they result unfortunately the interest of individual may be deeply compromise without undertake to decide how far or in what form if any the trustee could be make liable for note which contain no obligation on its part or the old bank for such as be put in circulation after the expiration of its charter and without its authority or the government for indemnity in case of loss the question still press itself upon you consideration whether it be consistent with duty and good faith on the part of the government to witness this proceeding without a single effort to arrest it the report of the commissioner of the general land office which will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury will show how the affair of that office have be conduct for the past year the disposition of the public land be one of the most important trust confide to congress the practicability of retain the title and control of such extensive domain in the general government and at the same time admit the territory embrace they into the federal union as coequal with the original state be seriously doubt by many of we wisest statesman all fear that they would become a source of discord and many carry they apprehension so far as to see in they the seed of a future dissolution of the confederacy but happily we experience have already be sufficient to quiet in a great degree all such apprehension the position at one time assume that the admission of new state into the union on the same footing with the original state be incompatible with a right of soil in the united state and operate as a surrender thereof notwithstanding the term of the compact by which they admission be design to be regulate have be wisely abandon whether in the new or the old state all now agree that the right of soil to the public land remain in the federal government and that these land constitute a common property to be dispose of for the common benefit of all the state old and new acquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new state have naturally promote a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the sale of the public land a policy which should be limit to the mere object of sell the land for the greatest possible sum of money without regard to higher consideration find but few advocate on the contrary it be generally concede that whilst the mode of disposition adopt by the government should always be a prudent one yet its leading object ought to be the early settlement and cultivation of the land sell and that it should discountenance if it can not prevent the accumulation of large tract in the same hand which must necessarily retard the growth of the new state or entail upon they a dependent tenantry and its attendant evil a question embrace such important interest and so well calculate to enlist the feeling of the people in every quarter of the union have very naturally give rise to numerous plan for the improvement of the exist system the distinctive feature of the policy that have hitherto prevail be to dispose of the public land at moderate price thus enable a greater number to enter into competition for they purchase and accomplish a double object -- of promote they rapid settlement by the purchaser and at the same time increase the receipt of the treasury to sell for cash thereby prevent the disturbing influence of a large mass of private citizen indebted to the government which they have a voice in control to bring they into market no faster than good land be suppose to be want for improvement thereby prevent the accumulation of large tract in few hand and to apply the proceeds of the sale to the general purpose of the government thus diminish the amount to be raise from the people of the state by taxation and give each state its portion of the benefit to be derive from this common fund in a manner the most quiet and at the same time perhaps the most equitable that can be devise these provision with occasional enactment in behalf of special interest deem entitle to the favor of the government have in they execution produce result as beneficial upon the whole as could reasonably be expect in a matter so vast so complicated and so exciting upward of 70000000 acre have be sell the greater part of which be believe to have be purchase for actual settlement the population of the new state and territory create out of the public domain increase between 1800 and 1830 from less than 60000 to upward of 2300000 soul constitute at the latter period about one-fifth of the whole people of the united state the increase since can not be accurately know but the whole may now be safely estimate at over three and a half million of soul compose nine state the representative of which constitute above one-third of the senate and over one-sixth of the house of representative of the united state thus have be form a body of free and independent landholder with a rapidity unequale in the history of mankind and this great result have be produce without leave anything for future adjustment between the government and its citizen the system under which so much have be accomplish can not be intrinsically bad and with occasional modification to correct abuse and adapt it to change of circumstance may i think be safely trust for the future there be in the management of such extensive interest much virtue in stability and although great and obvious improvement should not be decline change should never be make without the fullest examination and the clearest demonstration of they practical utility in the history of the past we have a assurance that this safe rule of action will not be depart from in relation to the public land nor be it believe that any necessity exist for interfere with the fundamental principle of the system or that the public mind even in the new state be desirous of any radical alteration on the contrary the general disposition appear to be to make such modification and addition only as will the more effectually carry out the original policy of fill we new state and territory with a industrious and independent population the modification most perseveringly press upon congress which have occupy so much of its time for year past and will probably do so for a long time to come if not sooner satisfactorily adjust be a reduction in the cost of such portion of the public land as be ascertain to be unsalable at the rate now establish by law and a graduation accord to they relative value of the price at which they may hereafter be sell it be worthy of consideration whether justice may not be do to every interest in this matter and a vexed question set at rest perhaps forever by a reasonable compromise of conflict opinion hitherto after be offer at public sale land have be dispose of at one uniform price whatever difference there might be in they intrinsic value the lead consideration urge in favor of the measure refer to be that in almost all the land district and particularly in those in which the land have be long survey and expose to sale there be still remain numerous and large tract of every gradation of value from the government price downward that these land will not be purchase at the government price so long as better can be conveniently obtain for the same amount that there be large tract which even the improvement of the adjacent land will never raise to that price and that the present uniform price combine with they irregular value operate to prevent a desirable compactness of settlement in the new state and to retard the full development of that wise policy on which we land system be found to the injury not only of the several state where the land lie but of the united state as a whole the remedy propose have be a reduction of the price accord to the length of time the land have be in market without reference to any other circumstance the certainty that the efflux of time would not always in such case and perhaps not even generally furnish a true criterion of value and the probability that person reside in the vicinity as the period for the reduction of price approach would postpone purchase they would otherwise make for the purpose of avail themselves of the lower price with other consideration of a similar character have hitherto be successfully urge to defeat the graduation upon time may not all reasonable desire upon this subject be satisfy without encounter any of these objection all will concede the abstract principle that the price of the public land should be proportion to they relative value so far as can be accomplish without depart from the rule heretofore observe require fixed price in case of private entry the difficulty of the subject seem to lie in the mode of ascertain what that value be would not the safest plan be that which have be adopt by many of the state as the basis of taxation -- a actual valuation of land and classification of they into different rate would it not be practicable and expedient to cause the relative value of the public land in the old district which have be for a certain length of time in market to be appraise and class into two or more rate below the present minimum price by the officer now employ in this branch of the public service or in any other mode deem preferable and to make those price permanent if upon the come in of the report they shall prove satisfactory to congress could not all the object of graduation be accomplish in this way and the objection which have hitherto be urge against it avoid it would seem to I that such a step with a restriction of the sale to limited quantity and for actual improvement would be free from all just exception by the full exposition of the value of the land thus furnished and extensively promulgate person live at a distance would be inform of they true condition and enable to enter into competition with those reside in the vicinity the means of acquire a independent home would be bring within the reach of many who be unable to purchase at present price the population of the new state would be make more compact and large tract would be sell which would otherwise remain on hand not only would the land be bring within the means of a larger number of purchaser but many person possess of greater means would be content to settle on a larger quantity of the poorer land rather than emigrate farther west in pursuit of a smaller quantity of better land such a measure would also seem to be more consistent with the policy of the exist law -- that of convert the public domain into cultivate farm own by they occupant that policy be not best promote by send emigration up the almost interminable stream of the west to occupy in group the best spot of land leave immense waste behind they and enlarge the frontier beyond the means of the government to afford it adequate protection but in encourage it to occupy with reasonable denseness the territory over which it advance and find its best defense in the compact front which it present to the indian tribe many of you will bring to the consideration of the subject the advantage of local knowledge and greater experience and all will be desirous of make a early and final disposition of every disturbing question in regard to this important interest if these suggestion shall in any degree contribute to the accomplishment of so important a result it will afford I sincere satisfaction in some section of the country most of the public land have be sell and the register and receiver have very little to do it be a subject worthy of inquiry whether in many case two or more district may not be consolidated and the number of person employ in this business considerably reduce indeed the time will come when it will be the true policy of the general government as to some of the state to transfer to they for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold land and to withdraw the machinery of the federal land office altogether all who take a comprehensive view of we federal system and believe that one of its greatest excellence consist in interfere as little as possible with the internal concern of the state look forward with great interest to this result a modification of the exist law in respect to the price of the public land might also have a favorable influence on the legislation of congress in relation to another branch of the subject many who have not the ability to buy at present price settle on those land with the hope of acquire from they cultivation the means of purchase under preemption law from time to time pass by congress for this encroachment on the rights of the united state they excuse themselves under the plea of they own necessity the fact that they dispossess nobody and only enter upon the waste domain : that they give additional value to the public land in they vicinity and they intention ultimately to pay the government price so much weight have from time to time be attach to these consideration that congress have pass law give actual settler on the public land a right of preemption to the tract occupy by they at the minimum price these law have in all instance be retrospective in they operation but in a few year after they passage crowd of new settler have be find on the public land for similar reason and under like expectation who have be indulge with the same privilege this course of legislation tend to impair public respect for the law of the country either the law to prevent intrusion upon the public land should be execute or if that should be impracticable or inexpedient they should be modify or repeal if the public land be to be consider as open to be occupy by any they should by law be throw open to all that which be intend in all instance to be legalize should at once be make legal that those who be dispose to conform to the law may enjoy at least equal privilege with those who be not but it be not believe to be the disposition of congress to open the public land to occupancy without regular entry and payment of the government price as such a course must tend to worse evil than the credit system which it be find necessary to abolish it would seem therefore to be the part of wisdom and sound policy to remove as far as practicable the cause which produce intrusion upon the public land and then take efficient step to prevent they in future would any single measure be so effective in remove all plausible grounds for these intrusion as the graduation of price already suggest a short period of industry and economy in any part of we country would enable the poorest citizen to accumulate the means to buy he a home at the lower price and leave he without apology for settle on land not he own if he do not under such circumstance he would enlist no sympathy in he favor and the law would be readily execute without do violence to public opinion a large portion of we citizen have seat themselves on the public land without authority since the passage of the last preemption law and now ask the enactment of another to enable they to retain the land occupy upon payment of the minimum government price they ask that which have be repeatedly grant before if the future may be judge of by the past little harm can be do to the interest of the treasury by yield to they request upon a critical examination it be find that the land sell at the public sale since the introduction of cash payment in 1820 have produce on a average the net revenue of only 6 cent a acre more than the minimum government price there be no reason to suppose that future sale will be more productive the government therefore have no adequate pecuniary interest to induce it to drive these people from the land they occupy for the purpose of sell they to other entertain these view i recommend the passage of a preemption law for they benefit in connection with the preparatory step toward the graduation of the price of the public land and further and more effectual provision to prevent intrusion hereafter indulgence to those who have settle on these land with expectation that past legislation would be make a rule for the future and at the same time remove the most plausible ground on which intrusion be excuse and adopt more efficient means to prevent they hereafter appear to I the most judicious disposition which can be make of this difficult subject the limitation and restriction to guard against abuse in the execution of a preemption law will necessarily attract the careful attention of congress but under no circumstance be it consider expedient to authorize float claim in any shape they have be heretofore and doubtless would be hereafter most prolific source of fraud and oppression and instead of operate to confer the favor of the government on industrious settler be often use only to minister to a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most meritorious of that class the accompany report of the secretary of war will bring to you view the state of the army and all the various subject confide to the superintendence of that officer the principal part of the army have be concentrate in florida with a view and in the expectation of bring the war in that territory to a speedy close the necessity of strip the post on the maritime and inland frontier of they entire garrison for the purpose of assemble in the field a army of less than 4000 man would seem to indicate the necessity of increase we regular force and the superior efficiency as well as greatly diminish expense of that description of troops recommend this measure as one of economy as well as of expediency i refer to the report for the reason which have induce the secretary of war to urge the reorganization and enlargement of the staff of the army and of the ordnance corps in which i fully concur it be not however compatible with the interest of the people to maintain in time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of we extensive frontier in period of danger and alarm we must rely principally upon a well-organized militia and some general arrangement that will render this description of force more efficient have long be a subject of anxious solicitude it be recommend to the first congress by general washington and have be since frequently bring to you notice and recently its importance strongly urge by my immediate predecessor the provision in the constitution that render it necessary to adopt a uniform system of organization for the militia throughout the united state present a insurmountable obstacle to a efficient arrangement by the classification heretofore propose and i invite you attention to the plan which will be submit by the secretary of war for the organization of volunteer corps and the instruction of militia officer as more simple and practicable if not equally advantageous as a general arrangement of the whole militia of the united state a moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical engineer have be more than once recommend by my predecessor and my conviction of the propriety not to say necessity of the measure in order to enable they to perform the various and important duty impose upon they induce I to repeat the recommendation the military academy continue to answer all the purpose of its establishment and not only furnish well-educated officer to the army but serve to diffuse throughout the mass of we citizen individual possess of military knowledge and the scientific attainment of civil and military engineering at present the cadet be bind with consent of he parent or guardian to remain in service five year from the period of he enlistment unless sooner discharge thus exact only one year 's service in the army after he education be complete this do not appear to I sufficient government ought to command for a longer period the service of those who be educate at the public expense and i recommend that the time of enlistment be extend to seven year and the term of the engagement strictly enforce the creation of a national foundry for cannon to be common to the service of the army and navy of the united state have be heretofore recommend and appear to be require in order to place we ordnance on a equal footing with that of other country and to enable that branch of the service to control the price of those article and graduate the supplies to the want of the government as well as to regulate they quality and insure they uniformity the same reason induce I to recommend the erection of a manufactory of gunpowder to be under the direction of the ordnance office the establishment of a manufactory of small arm west of the alleghany mountain upon the plan propose by the secretary of war will contribute to extend throughout that country the improvement which exist in establishment of a similar description in the atlantic state and tend to a much more economical distribution of the armament require in the western portion of we union the system of remove the indian west of the mississippus commence by mr jefferson in 1804 have be steadily persevere in by every succeed president and may be consider the settle policy of the country unconnected at first with any well-defined system for they improvement the inducement hold out to the indian be confine to the greater abundance of game to be find in the west but when the beneficial effect of they removal be make apparent a more philanthropic and enlighten policy be adopt in purchase they land east of the mississippus liberal price be give and provision insert in all the treaty with they for the application of the fund they receive in exchange to such purpose as be best calculate to promote they present welfare and advance they future civilization these measure have be attend thus far with the happiest result it will be see by refer to the report of the commissioner of indian affair that the most sanguine expectation of the friend and promoter of this system have be realize the choctaw cherokee and other tribe that first emigrate beyond the mississippus have for the most part abandon the hunter state and become cultivator of the soil the improvement in they condition have be rapid and it be believe that they be now fit to enjoy the advantage of a simple form of government which have be submit to they and receive they sanction and i can not too strongly urge this subject upon the attention of congress stipulation have be make with all the indian tribe to remove they beyond the mississippus except with the band of the wyandot the six nation in new york the menomonee munsee and stockbridge in wisconsin and miamy in indiana with all but the menomonee it be expect that arrangement for they emigration will be complete the present year the resistance which have be oppose to they removal by some of the tribe even after treaty have be make with they to that effect have arise from various cause operate differently on each of they in most instance they have be instigate to resistance by person to whom the trade with they and the acquisition of they annuity be important and in some by the personal influence of interested chief these obstacle must be overcome for the government can not relinquish the execution of this policy without sacrifice important interest and abandon the tribe remain east of the mississippus to certain destruction the decrease in number of the tribe within the limit of the state and territory have be most rapid if they be remove they can be protect from those association and evil practice which exert so pernicious and destructive a influence over they destiny they can be induce to labor and to acquire property and its acquisition will inspire they with a feeling of independence they mind can be cultivate and they can be teach the value of salutary and uniform law and be make sensible of the blessing of free government and capable of enjoy its advantage in the possession of property knowledge and a good government free to give what direction they please to they labor and sharer in the legislation by which they person and the profit of they industry be to be protect and secure they will have a ever-present conviction of the importance of union and peace among themselves and of the preservation of amicable relation with we the interest of the united state would also be greatly promote by free the relation between the general and state government from what have prove a most embarrassing incumbrance by a satisfactory adjustment of conflict title to land cause by the occupation of the indian and by cause the resource of the whole country to be develop by the power of the state and general government and improve by the enterprise of a white population intimately connect with this subject be the obligation of the government to fulfill its treaty stipulation and to protect the indian thus assemble at they new residence from all interruption and disturbance from any other tribe or nation of indian or from any other person or person whatsoever and the equally solemn obligation to guard from indian hostility its own border settlement stretch along a line of more than 1000 mile to enable the government to redeem this pledge to the indian and to afford adequate protection to its own citizen will require the continual presence of a considerable regular force on the frontier and the establishment of a chain of permanent post examination of the country be now make with a view to decide on the most suitable point for the erection of fortress and other work of defense the result of which will be present to you by the secretary of war at a early day together with a plan for the effectual protection of the friendly indian and the permanent defense of the frontier state by the report of the secretary of the navy herewith communicate it appear that unremitted exertion have be make at the different navy-yard to carry into effect all authorize measure for the extension and employment of we naval force the launching and preparation of the ship of the line _ pennsylvanium _ and the complete repair of the ship of the line _ ohio delaware _ and _ columbus _ may be notice as form a respectable addition to this important arm of we national defense we commerce and navigation have receive increase aid and protection during the present year we squadron in the pacific and on the brazilian station have be much increase and that in the mediterranean although small be adequate to the present want of we commerce in that sea addition have be make to we squadron on the west indium station where the large force under commodore dalla have be most actively and efficiently employ in protect we commerce in prevent the importation of slave and in cooperate with the officer of the army in carry on the war in florida the satisfactory condition of we naval force abroad leave at we disposal the means of conveniently provide for a home squadron for the protection of commerce upon we extensive coast the amount of appropriation require for such a squadron will be find in the general estimate for the naval service for the year 1838 the naval officer engage upon we coast survey have render important service to we navigation the discovery of a new channel into the harbor of new york through which we largest ship may pass without danger must afford important commercial advantage to that harbor and add greatly to its value as a naval station the accurate survey of george shoal off the coast of massachusett lately complete will render comparatively safe a navigation hitherto consider dangerous considerable addition have be make to the number of captain commander lieutenant surgeon and assistant surgeon in the navy these addition be render necessary by the increase number of vessel put in commission to answer the exigency of we grow commerce you attention be respectfully invite to the various suggestion of the secretary for the improvement of the naval service the report of the postmaster-general exhibit the progress and condition of the mail service the operation of the post-office department constitute one of the most active element of we national prosperity and it be gratify to observe with what vigor they be conduct the mail route of the united state cover a extent of about 142877 mile have be increase about 37103 mile within the last two year the annual mail transportation on these route be about 36228962 mile have be increase about 10359476 mile within the same period the number of post-office have also be increase from 10770 to 12099 very few of which receive the mail less than once a week and a large portion of they daily contractor and postmaster in general be represent as attend to they duty with most commendable zeal and fidelity the revenue of the department within the year end on the 30th of June last be $ 413705659 and its liability accrue within the same time be $ 338084775 the increase of revenue over that of the preceding year be $ 70816641 for many interesting detail i refer you to the report of the postmaster-general with the accompany papers you particular attention be invite to the necessity of provide a more safe and convenient building for the accommodation of that department i lay before congress copy of report submit in pursuance of a call make by I upon the head of department for such suggestion as they experience might enable they to make as to what further legislative provision may be advantageously adopt to secure the faithful application of public money to the object for which they be appropriate to prevent they misapplication or embezzlement by those intrust with the expenditure of they and generally to increase the security of the government against loss in they disbursement it be needless to dilate on the importance of provide such new safeguard as be within the power of legislation to promote these end and i have little to add to the recommendation submit in the accompany papers by law the term of service of we most important collect and disburse officer in the civil department be limit to four year and when reappoint they bond be require to be renew the safety of the public be much increase by this feature of the law and there can be no doubt that its application to all officer intrust with the collection or disbursement of the public money whatever may be the tenure of they office would be equally beneficial i therefore recommend in addition to such of the suggestion present by the head of department as you may think useful a general provision that all officer of the army or navy or in the civil department intrust with the receipt or payment of public money and whose term of service be either unlimited or for a longer time than four year be require to give new bond with good and sufficient surety at the expiration of every such period a change in the period of terminate the fiscal year from the 1st of October to the 1st of April have be frequently recommend and appear to be desirable the distressing casualty in steamboat which have so frequently happen during the year seem to evince the necessity of attempt to prevent they by means of severe provision connect with they customhouse papers this subject be submit to the attention of congress by the secretary of the treasury in he last annual report and will be again notice at the present session with additional detail it will doubtless receive that early and careful consideration which its press importance appear to require you attention have heretofore be frequently call to the affair of the district of columbium and i should not again ask it do not they entire dependence on congress give they a constant claim upon its notice separate by the constitution from the rest of the union limit in extent and aid by no legislature of its own it would seem to be a spot where a wise and uniform system of local government might have be easily adopt this district have however unfortunately be leave to linger behind the rest of the union its code civil and criminal be not only very defective but full of obsolete or inconvenient provision be form of portion of two state discrepancy in the law prevail in different part of the territory small as it be and although it be select as the seat of the general government the site of its public edifice the depository of its archive and the residence of officer intrust with large amount of public property and the management of public business yet it have never be subject to or receive that special and comprehensive legislation which these circumstance peculiarly demand i be well aware of the various subject of greater magnitude and immediate interest that press themselves on the consideration of congress but i

understanding which exist between the two government on the subject and the moderation which both government have heretofore manifest forbid the exercise by either of such high act of sovereign power as that which have be exert in the present case by the authority of she majesty 's provincial government the undersign must therefore suppose that this arrest and imprisonment of a american citizen under such circumstance and in the exist state of the controversy could only have be justify by some suppose infringement of the understanding exist between the party in relation to the question of jurisdiction within the dispute territory such however be not the case the correspondence between the governor of maine and the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick show that the only act do by mr

that this be not the first time that the inhabitant within this particular settlement have be enumerate under the authority of the united state it be do in the census of 1820 -lrb- as a portion of the

a violation of the rights of the united state but be wholly irreconcilable with that moderation and forbearance which it be peculiarly the duty of both government to maintain until the question of right shall be definitively settle it become the duty of the undersign therefore in pursuance of special instruction from he government to invite the early and favorable consideration of she majesty

violation of the rights and sovereignty of the united state and entirely irreconcilable with that mutual forbearance which it be understand would be practice by both government pend the negotiation the circumstance under which these recent attempt to enforce jurisdiction have be make show that in the most favorable aspect in which they can be regard they be wholly indefensible the act for which greely be arrest and imprison so far from have be commit within the acknowledged dominion of the british crown and beyond the limit of the dispute territory and therefore liable to be treat as a violation of territorial jurisdiction take place as appear by the statement of the governor of maine whilst he be employ within the limit of that state and under its authority in enumerate the inhabitant of the county of penobscot by what authority then the provincial government of new brunswick feel itself justified in exercise such act of sovereign power the undersign be at a loss to conceive unless indeed upon the ground that the jurisdiction and sovereignty over the dispute territory pend the controversy rest exclusively with great britain if such should turn out to be the fact it can hardly be necessary again to repeat the assurance which have be heretofore give that in any such claim of power the government of the united state can not acquiesce upon the consequence which would unavoidably result from attempt to exercise such jurisdiction it be needless to enlarge it must now be apparent that all such attempt if persevere in can produce only feud and collision of the most painful character and besides increase the feeling of international discord which have already be excite between the contend party they will close every avenue to a amicable adjustment of a controversy which it be so much the desire and interest of both government to accomplish ought it not then to be the earnest endeavor of the two government to avoid do anything which can have a tendency to lead to such mischievous consequence it be under this view of the subject that the undersign have be instruct again to remonstrate against these proceedings of the authority of new brunswick as a violation of the rights of maine in the person of she agent and to protest in the most solemn manner against the future exercise of all such act of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the dispute territory or the citizen of the united state reside within its limit until a final adjustment of the controversy take place the undersign therefore can not and ought not to close this note without again invoke the early and earnest attention of lord palmerston and that of she majesty 's government to this painful subject it be one of deep and mutual interest to the party concern and the delicacy and embarrassment which surround it be justly appreciate by the government of the united state deeply regret as that government do the collision of authority to which both country have be so repeatedly expose by the delay that have take place in the final settlement of the main question it be sincerely desirous as the undersign have take occasion repeatedly to assure lord palmerston to have it bring to a speedy and amicable termination this can only be do by measure of mutual forbearance and moderation on the part of both government to this end the effort of the american government have be earnest persevere and constant it have do as it will continue to do everything in its power to induce the state of maine to pursue a course best calculate to avoid all excitement and collision between the citizen of that state and the inhabitant of new brunswick or which would tend in any manner to embarrass the mediatorial action of they two government on the subject but it can not be expect if the authority of new brunswick still persevere in attempt to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute territory by the arrest and imprisonment in foreign jail of citizen of maine for perform they duty under the law of they own state and within what be believe to be she territorial limit that measure of retaliation will not be resort to by maine and great mischief ensue indeed under exist circumstance and in the nature of human connection it be not possible should such a course of violence be continue to avoid collision of the most painful character for which the government of the united state can not be responsible but which both government would equally deplore it be doubtless with a view of guard against these consequence that the understanding take place that each government should abstain from exercise jurisdiction within the limit of the dispute territory pend the settlement of the main question the undersign therefore persuade himself that these proceedings of the colonial government may have take place without a careful examination of the important question involve in they or the consequence to which they might lead rather than under instruction from she majesty 's government or with a deliberate view of assert and enforce territorial and jurisdictional rights over the contest territory in look back as he do with satisfaction to the conciliatory spirit in which the negotiation have heretofore be conduct and the moderation which both government have observe the undersign can not permit himself to doubt but that upon a careful review of the whole subject she majesty 's government will see fit not only to mark with its disapprobation this last proceeding of she colonial government and direct the immediate liberation of mr greely from imprisonment with ample indemnity for the wrong he may have sustain but that it will see the propriety of give suitable instruction to the authority of new brunswick to abstain for the future from all act of that character which can have no other tendency than to increase the excitement and jealousy which already prevail and retard the final and amicable adjustment of this painful controversy the

state of the property in issue the governor of massachusett observe in he letter to I that in relation to the land on fish river it must be recollect that the survey of a road by the joint

dispute from courtesy to he government and a respectful regard to a suggestion from the department of state the making of the road be suspend the governor justly conclude : but it will be a ill requital for this voluntary forbearance on we part if the land be to be plunder of its timber and the value of the property destroy before it shall be determine that it do not belong to we if the government of new brunswick will authorize or countenance such trespass as have be state by mr coffin on the dispute territory it can not be expect that the state of maine will abstain from the adoption of preventive measure or from the performance of similar or other act of jurisdiction and proprietorship the consequence would be immediate and disagreeable collision to prevent this state of

through the state of maine to mar hill over that point and to occupy mar hill as a military station and protest against such occupation upon the ground that the line draw by the commissioner of boundary under the treaty of ghent due north from the monument which mark the source of the river st croix be not consider by they as correctly lay down and that it yet remain to be determine whether mar hill be eastward or westward of the true line the undersign deem it unnecessary upon the present occasion to enter into a elaborate discussion of the point state by sir howard dougla the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick concern the line refer to by he inasmuch as the relative position of mar hill to that line be already designate upon map a and the line itself mutually agree to and sufficiently understand for all present purpose though not definitively settle by the convention of condon of the 29th September 1827 the undersigned will therefore merely state that he find

lie to the westward of the line to be draw due north from the monument at the source of the st croix to the highland which divide the water that empty into the river st lawrence from those which empty into the atlantic ocean that the joint survey and exploration make under that commission place the hill about a mile due west of that line and that the agent of he britannic majesty before the commissioner so far from intimate any doubt on the point make it one ground of argument that the true line when correctly lay down would necessarily on account of the ascertain progressive westerly variation of the needle fall still farther westward the undersign can not acquiesce in the supposition that because the agent of he britannic majesty thought proper in the proceedings before the commissioner to lay claim to all that portion of the state of maine which lie north of a line run westerly from mar hill and designate as the limit or boundary of the british claim thereby the united state or the state of maine cease to have jurisdiction in the territory thus claim in the view of this government he britannic majesty 's agent might with equal justice have extend he claim to any other undisputed part of the state as to claim the portion of it which he have draw in question and in such case the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick could surely not have consider a continuance on the part of the united state and of the state of maine to exercise they accustomed jurisdiction and authority to be a encroachment if so in what light be we to regard the continued act of

which the unsettled condition of the country in that region and other circumstance admit and require the undersigned therefore can not discover in the fact and circumstance of the case any just principle upon which sir howard dougla could predicate he protest he have however submit the note which he have the honor to receive from mr vaughan to the president of the united state and be by he direct to say in reply that although this government could feel no difficulty in the exercise of what it deem a unquestionable right and could not allow itself to be restrain by the protest of the

be direct by he government to make the follow observation to mr forsyth secretary of state of the united state with reference to certain point connect with the question of the northeastern boundary which question form the subject of the accompany note which the undersign have the honor this day to address to mr forsyth : the british government with a view to prevail upon that of the united state to come to a understanding with great britain upon the river question have state that the king of the netherland in he award have decide that question accord to the british interpretation of it and have express he opinion that the river which fall into the bay of fundy be not to be consider as atlantic river for the purpose of the treaty mr forsyth however in he note to sir charle vaughan of the 28th of April 1835 controvert this assertion and maintain that the king of the netherland do not in he award express such a opinion and mr forsyth quote a passage from the award in support of this proposition but it appear to she majesty 's government that mr forsyth have not correctly perceive the meaning of the passage which he quote for in the passage in question mr forsyth apprehend that the word _ alone _ be govern by the verb _ include _ whereas a attentive examination of the context will show that the word _ alone _ be govern by the verb _ divide _ and that the real meaning of the passage be this : that the river flow north and south from the highland claim by the united state may be arrange in two genus the first genus comprehend the river which fall into the st lawrence the second genus comprehend those whose water in some manner or other find they way into the atlantic but that even if accord to this general classification and in contradistinction from river flow into the st lawrence the river which fall into the bay of chaleur and fundy might be comprise in the same genus with the river which fall directly into the atlantic still the st john and the restigouche form a distinct species by themselves and do not belong to the species of river which fall _ directly _ into the atlantic for the st john and restigouche be not divide in company with any such last-mentioned river and the award go on to say that moreover if this distinction between the two species be confound a erroneous interpretation would be apply to a treaty in which every separate word must be suppose to have a meaning and a generic distinction would be give to case which be purely specific the above appear to be the true meaning of the passage quote by mr forsyth but if that passage have not be in itself sufficiently explicit which she majesty 's government think it be the passage which immediately follow it would remove all doubt as to what the opinion of the king of the netherland be upon the river question for that passage setting forth reason against the line of boundary claim by the united state go on to say that such line would not even separate the st lawrence river immediately from the st john and restigouche and that thus the river which this line would separate from the st lawrence river would need _ in order to reach the atlantic _ the aid of _ two intermediary _ -- first the river st john and restigouche and _ secondly the bay of chaleur and fundy _ now it be evident from this passage that the king of the netherland deem the bay of fundy and chaleur to be for the purpose of the treaty as distinct and separate from the atlantic ocean as be the river st john and restigouche for he specifically mention those river and those bay as the channel through which certain river would have to pass in they way from the northern range of divide highland down to the atlantic ocean and it be clear that he consider that the water of those highland river would not reach the atlantic ocean until after they have travel through the whole extent either of the restigouche and the bay of chaleur or of the st john and the bay of fundy as the case might be and for this reason among other the king of the netherland declare it to be he opinion that the line north of the st john claim by the united state be not the line intend by the treaty the undersigned avail himself of this occasion to renew to mr forsyth the assurance of he high respect and consideration h fox _ mr fox to mr forsyth _ washington _ January 19 1838 _ hon john forsyth etc : the undersign she britannic majesty 's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary have receive the order of he government to make the follow communication to the secretary of state of the united state with reference to the question pend between the two government upon the subject of the northeastern boundary : the undersign be in the first instance direct to express to mr forsyth the sincere regret of she majesty 's government that the long-continued endeavor of both party to come to a settlement of this important matter have hitherto be unavail she majesty 's government feel a undiminished desire to cooperate with the cabinet of washington for the attainment of a object of so much mutual interest and they learn with satisfaction that they sentiment upon this point be fully share by the actual president of the united state the communication which during the last few year have take place between the two government with reference to the present subject if they have not lead to the solution of the question at issue have at least narrow the field of future discussion both government have agree to consider the award of the king of the netherland as binding upon neither party and the two government therefore be as free in this respect as they be before the reference to that sovereign be make the british government despairing of the possibility of draw a line that shall be in literal conformity with the word of the treaty of 1783 have suggest that a conventional boundary should be substitute for the line describe by the treaty and have propose that in accordance with the principle of equity and in pursuance of the general practice of mankind in similar case the object of difference should be equally divide between the two differ party each of whom be alike convince of the justice of its own claim the united state government have reply that to such a arrangement it have no power to agree that until the line of the treaty shall have be otherwise determine the state of maine will continue to assume that the line which it claim be the true line of 1783 and will assert that all the land up to that line be territory of maine that consequently such a division of the dispute territory as be propose by great britain would be consider by maine as tantamount to a cession of what that state regard as a part of its own territory and that the federal government have no power to agree to such a arrangement without the consent of the state concern she majesty 's government exceedingly regret that such a obstacle should exist to prevent that settlement which under all the circumstance of the case appear to be the simplest the readiest the most satisfactory and the most just nor can she majesty 's government admit that the objection of the state of maine be well found for the principle on which that objection rest be as good for great britain as it be for maine if maine think itself entitle to contend that until the true line describe in the treaty be determine the boundary claim by maine must be regard as the right one great britain be surely still more entitle to insist upon a similar pretension and to assert that until the line of the treaty shall be establish to the satisfaction of both party the whole of the dispute territory ought to be consider as belong to the british crown because great britain be the original possessor and all the territory which have not be prove to have be by treaty cede by she must be look upon as belong to she still but the very existence of such conflicting pretension seem to point out the expediency of a compromise and what compromise can be more fair than that which would give to each party one-half of the subject-matter of dispute a conventional line different from that describe in the treaty be agree to as state by mr forsyth in he note of the 28th of April 1835 with respect to the boundary westward from the lake of the wood why should such a line not be agree to likewise for the boundary eastward from the river connecticut she majesty 's government can not refrain from again press this proposition upon the serious consideration of the government of the united state as the arrangement which would be best calculate to effect a prompt and satisfactory settlement between the two power the government of the united state indeed while it express a doubt of its be able to obtain the assent of maine to the above-mentioned proposal do nevertheless express its readiness to apply to the state of maine for the assent of that state to the adoption of another conventional line which should make the river st john from its source to its mouth the boundary between the two country but it be difficult to understand upon what grounds any expectation could have be form that such a proposal could be entertain by the british government for such a arrangement would give to the united state even greater advantage than they would obtain by a unconditional acquiescence in they claim to the whole of the dispute territory because such a arrangement would in the first place give to maine all that part of the dispute territory which lie to the south of the st john and would in the next place in exchange for the remain part of the dispute territory which lie to the north of the st john add to the state of maine a large district of new brunswick lie between the united state boundary and the southern part of the course of the st john -- a district smaller indeed in extent but much more considerable in value than the portion of the dispute territory which lie to the north of the st john but with respect to a conventional line generally the government of washington have state that it have not at present the power constitutionally requisite for treat for such a line and have no hope of obtain such power until the impossibility of establish the line describe by the treaty shall have be completely demonstrate by the failure of another attempt to trace that line by a local survey under these circumstance it appear that a conventional line can not at present be agree upon and that such a mode of settlement be in the exist state of the negotiation impossible thus then the award of the king of the netherland have be abandon by both party in consequence of its rejection by the american senate and a negotiation between the two government for a conventional line suit to the interest and convenience of the two party have for the present be render impossible by difficulty arise on the part of the united state and both government be alike averse to a new arbitration in this state of thing the government of the united state have propose to the british cabinet that another attempt should be make to trace out a boundary accord to the letter of the treaty and that a commission of exploration and survey should be appoint for that purpose she majesty 's government have little expectation that such a commission could lead to any useful result and on that account would be dispose to object to the measure but at the same time they be so unwilling to reject the only plan now leave which seem to afford a chance of make any further advance in this long-pending matter that they will not withhold they consent to such a commission if the principle upon which it be to be form and the manner in which it be to proceed can be satisfactorily settle the united state government have propose two mode in which such a commission might be constitute : first that it might consist of commissioner name in equal number by each of the two government with a umpire to be select by some friendly european power secondly that it might be entirely compose of scientific european to be select by a friendly sovereign and might be accompany in its operation by agent of the two different party in order that such agent might give to the commissioner assistance and information if such a commission be to be appoint she majesty 's government think that the first of these two mode of construct it would be the best and that it should consist of member choose in equal number by each of the two government it might however be better that the umpire should be select by the member of the commission themselves rather than that the two government should apply to a third power to make such a choice the object of this commission as understand by she majesty 's government would be to explore the dispute territory in order to find within its limit divide highland which may answer the description of the treaty the search be first to be make in the due north line from the monument at the head of the st croix and if no such highland should be find in that meridian the search to be then continue to the westward thereof and she majesty 's government have state they opinion that in order to avoid all fruitless dispute as to the character of such highland the commissioner should be instruct to look for highland which both party might acknowledge as fulfil the condition of the treaty the united state secretary of state in he note of the 5th of march 1836 express a wish to know how the report of the commissioner would accord to the view of she majesty 's government be likely when render to lead to a ultimate settlement of the question of boundary between the two government in reply to this inquiry she majesty 's government would beg to observe that the proposal to appoint a commission originate not with they but with the government of the united state and that it be therefore rather for the government of the united state than for that of great britain to answer this question she majesty 's government have themselves already state that they have little expectation that such a commission could lead to any useful result and that they would on that account be dispose to object to it and if she majesty 's government be now to agree to appoint such a commission it would be only in compliance with the desire so strongly express by the government of the united state and in spite of doubt -lrb- which she majesty 's government still continue to entertain -rrb- of the efficacy of the measure but with respect to the way in which the report of the commission might be likely to lead to a ultimate settlement of the question she majesty 's government in the first place conceive that it be mean by the government of the united state that if the commission should discover highland answer to the description of the treaty a connect line draw from these highland to the head of the st croix should be deem to be a portion of the boundary line between the two country but she majesty 's government would further beg to refer the united state secretary of state to the note of mr mclane of the 5th of June 1833 and of the 11th and 28th of march 1834 on this subject in which it will be see that the government of the united state appear to have contemplate as one of the possible result of the propose commission of exploration that such additional information might possibly be obtain respect the feature of the country in the district to which the treaty relate as might remove all doubt as to the impracticability of lay down a boundary in accordance with the letter of the treaty and if the investigation of the propose commission should show that there be no reasonable prospect of find a line strictly conformable with the description contain in the treaty of 1783 the constitutional difficulty which now prevent the united state from agree to a conventional line may possibly be remove and the way may thus be prepare for the satisfactory settlement of the difference by a equitable division of the dispute territory but if the two government should agree to the appointment of such a commission it would be necessary that they agreement should be first record in a convention and it would obviously be indispensable that the state of maine should be a assent party to the arrangement the undersign in make the above communication by order of she majesty 's government to the united state secretary of state mr forsyth have the honor to renew to he the assurance of he high respect and consideration h fox _ mr forsyth to mr fox _ department of state _ washington February 6 1838 _ henry s fox esq etc : the undersign secretary of state of the united state have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note of mr fox envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of she britannic majesty of the 10th ultimo in which he present by direction of he government certain observation in respect to the construction to be give to that part of the award of the arbiter on the question of the northeastern boundary which relate to the character in which the river st john and restigouche be to be regard in reference to that question sir charle vaughan in he note to mr mclane of February 10 1834 allege that although the arbiter have not decide the first of the three main question propose to he yet that he have determine certain subordinate point connect with that question upon which the party have entertain different view and among other that the river st john and restigouche could not be consider accord to the meaning of the treaty as river flow into the atlantic the undersign in he note to sir charle r vaughan of the 28th of April 1835 question the correctness of the interpretation which have be give by sir charle to the award of the arbiter in this particular and after quote that part of the award to which sir charle be suppose to refer as contain the determination by the arbiter of the point just mention observe that it could not but appear from further reflection to sir charle that the declaration that the river st john and restigouche could not be _ alone _ take into view without hazard in determine the dispute boundary be not the expression of a opinion that they should be altogether exclude in determine that question or in other word that they could not be look upon as river empty into the atlantic the remark present by mr fox in the note to which this be a reply be design to shew a misconception on the part of the undersigned of the true meaning of the passage cite by he from the award and to support the construction which be give to it by sir charle vaughan whether the apprehension entertain by the one party or the other of the opinion of the arbiter upon this minor point be correct be regard by the undersign as a matter of no consequence in the settlement of the main question the government of the united state never have acquiesce in the decision of the arbiter that the nature of the difference and the vague and not sufficiently determinate stipulation of the treaty of 1783 do not permit the adjudication of either of the two line respectively claim by the interested party to one of the say party without wound the principle of law and equity with regard to the other can not consent to be govern in the prosecution of the exist negotiation by the opinion of the arbiter upon any of the preliminary point about which there be a previous difference between the party and the adverse decision of which have lead to so unsatisfactory and in the view of this government so erroneous a conclusion this determination on the part of the united state not to adopt the premise of the arbiter while reject he conclusion have be heretofore make know to she majesty 's government and while it remain must necessarily render the discussion of the question what those premise be unavail if not irrelevant the few observation which the undersign be lead to make in the course of he note to sir charle vaughan upon one of the point allege to have be thus determine be prompt only by a respect for the arbiter and a consequent anxiety to remove a misinterpretation of he meaning which alone it be believe could induce the supposition that the arbiter in search for the river refer to in the treaty as designate the boundary could have come to the opinion that the two great river whose water pervade the whole district in which the search be make and constitute the most striking object of the country have be entirely unnoticed by the negotiator of the treaty and be to be pass over unheeded in determine the line while other be to be seek for which he himself assert could not be find that the imputation of such a opinion to the respected arbiter could only be the result of misinterpretation seem the more evident as he have himself declare that it could not be sufficiently explain how if the high contracting party intend in 1783 to establish the boundary at the south of the river st john that river to which the territory in dispute be in a great measure indebted for its distinctive character have be neutralize and set aside it be under the influence of the same motive that the undersign now proceed to make a brief comment upon the observation contain in mr fox 's note of the 10th ultimo and thus to close a discussion which it can answer no purpose to prolong the passage from the award of the arbiter quote by the undersign in he note of the 28th April 1835 to sir charle vaughan and the true meaning of which mr fox suppose to have be misconceive be the following : if in contradistinction to the river that empty themselves into the river st lawrence it have be proper agreeably to the language ordinarily use in geography to comprehend the river fall into the bay fundy and des chaleurs with those empty themselves directly into the atlantic ocean in the generical denomination of river fall into the atlantic ocean it would be hazardous to include into the species belong to that class the river st john and restigouche which the line claim at the north of the river st john divide _ immediately _ from river empty themselves into the river st lawrence not with other river fall into the atlantic ocean but _ alone _ and thus to apply in interpret the delimitation establish by a treaty where each word must have a meaning to two exclusively special case and where no mention be make of the genus -lrb- _ genre _ -rrb- a generical expression which would ascribe to they a broader meaning etc it be observe by the undersign that this passage do not appear to contain a expression of opinion by the arbiter that the river st john and restigouche should be altogether exclude in determine the question of dispute boundary or in other word that they could not be look upon as river empty into the atlantic mr fox allege this to be a misconception of the meaning of the arbiter and suppose it to have arise from a erroneous apprehension by the undersign that the word _ alone _ be govern by the verb _ include _ whereas he think that a attentive examination of the context will shew that the word _ alone _ be govern by the verb _ divide _ and that the real meaning of the passage be this : that the river flow north and south from the highland claim by the united state may be arrange in two genus the first genus comprehend the river which fall into the st lawrence the second genus comprehend those whose water in some manner or other find they way into the atlantic but that even if accord to the general classification and in contradistinction from river flow into the st lawrence the river which fall into the bay of chaleur and fundy might be comprise in the same genus with the river which fall directly into the atlantic still the st john and the restigouche form a distinct species by themselves and do not belong to the species of river which fall _ directly _ into the atlantic for the st john and restigouche be not divide in company with any _ such last-mentioned river _ the undersign consider it unnecessary to enter into the question whether accord to the context the circumstance express by the adverb alone have reference to the verb divide or to the verb include because even allow it to refer to the former it do not appear to the undersign that he interpretation of the passage be thereby impaired or that of mr fox sustain the undersign conceive that the arbiter contemplate two different _ species _ of river as admissible into _ genus _ of those which fall into the atlantic to wit those which fall _ directly _ into the atlantic and those which fall into it _ indirectly _ that the arbiter be further of opinion though at variance with the idea entertain in that respect by the united state that the river st john and restigouche empty they water into the bay of fundy and des chaleurs do not belong to the species of river fall _ directly _ into the atlantic that if they be consider _ alone _ therefore the appellation of river fall into the atlantic ocean could not be regard as applicable to they because to use the language of the award it would be apply to two exclusively special case where no mention be make of the genus a generical expression which would ascribe to they a broader meaning but it be not conceive that the arbiter intend to express a opinion that these river _ might not be include with other _ in form the _ genus _ of river describe by the treaty as those which fall into the atlantic and that upon this ground they should be wholly exclude in determine the question of the dispute boundary while therefore the undersign agree with mr fox that the arbiter do not consider these river as fall directly into the atlantic ocean the undersign can not concur in mr fox 's construction when he suppose the arbiter to give as a reason for this that they be not divide in company with any _ such last-mentioned river _ -- that be with river fall _ directly _ into the atlantic concede as a point which it be deem unnecessary for the present purpose to discuss that the grammatical construction of the sentence contend for by mr fox be the correct one the arbiter be understand to say only that those river be not divide _ immediately _ with other fall into the atlantic either directly or indirectly but he do not allege this to be a sufficient reason for exclude they when connect with other river divide mediately from those empty into the st lawrence from the genus of river fall into the atlantic on the contrary it be admit in the award that the line claim to the north of the st john divide the st john and restigouche in company with the schoodic lake the penobscot and the kennebec which be state as empty themselves _ directly _ into the atlantic and it be strongly imply in the language use by the arbiter that the first-named river might in he opinion be class for the purpose of the treaty with those last name though not in the same _ species _ yet in the same _ genus _ of atlantic river the reason why the st john and restigouche be not permit to determine the question of boundary in favor of the united state be understand to have be not that they be to be wholly exclude as river not fall into the atlantic ocean as mr fox appear to suppose but because in order to include they in that genus of river they must be consider in connection with other river which be not divide _ immediately _ like themselves from the river fall into the st lawrence but _ mediately _ only which would introduce the principle that the treaty of 1783 mean highland that divide as well mediately as immediately the river that empty themselves into the river st lawrence from those which fall into the atlantic ocean -- a principle which the arbiter do not reject as unfounded or erroneous but which consider in connection with the other point which he have decide he regard as _ equally realize by both line _ and therefore as constitute a equal weight in either scale and consequently afford he no assistance in determine the dispute between the respective party the arbiter appear to the undersign to have view the river st john and restigouche as possess both a specific and a generic character that consider _ alone _ they be _ specific _ ' and the designation in the treaty of river fall into the atlantic be inapplicable to they that consider _ in connection with other river _ they be _ generic _ and be embrace in the term of the treaty but that as they connection with other river would bring they within a principle which accord to the view take by he of other part of the question be equally realize by both line it would be hazardous to allow they any weight in decide the dispute boundary it have always be contend by this government that the river st john and restigouche be to be consider in connection with the penobscot and kennebec in determine the highland call for by the treaty and the arbiter be not understand to deny to they when thus connect the character of river fall into the atlantic ocean this construction of the arbiter 's meaning derive from the general tenor of the context it will be perceive be not invalidate by the next succeed paragraph cite by mr fox in which the bay of fundy and des chaleurs be speak of as _ intermediary _ whereby the river flow into the st john and restigouche reach the atlantic ocean inasmuch as such construction admit the opinion of the arbiter to have be that the st john and restigouche do not fall _ directly _ into the atlantic and that they thus constitute a _ species _ by themselves while it deny that they be therefore exclude by the arbiter from the genus of 4 ' river fall into the atlantic the undersigned avail himself of this opportunity to renew to mr fox the assurance of he distinguished consideration john forsyth _ mr forsyth to mr fox _ department of state _ washington February 7 1838 _ henry s fox esq etc : the undersign secretary of state of the united state have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note address to he on the 10th ultimo by mr fox she britannic majesty 's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at washington with regard to the question pend between the two government upon the subject of the northeastern boundary and to inform he that he communication have be submit to the president it have receive from he the attentive examination due to a paper expect to embody the view of she britannic majesty 's government in reference to interest of primary importance to both country but whilst the president see with satisfaction the expression it contain of a continued desire on the part of she majesty 's government to cooperate with this in its earnest endeavor to arrange the matter of dispute between they he perceive with feeling of deep disappointment that the answer now present to the proposition make by this government with the view of effect that object after have be so long delay notwithstanding the repeat intimation that it be look for here with much anxiety be so indefinite in its term as to render it impracticable to ascertain without further discussion what be the real wish and intention of she majesty 's government respect the propose appointment of a commission of exploration and survey to trace out a boundary accord to the letter of the treaty of 1783 the president however for the purpose of place in the possession of the state of maine the view of she majesty 's government as exhibit in mr fox 's note and of ascertain the sense of the state authority upon the expediency of meeting those view so far as they be develop therein have direct the undersign to transmit a copy of it to governor kent for they consideration this will be accordingly do without unnecessary delay and the result when obtain may form the occasion of a further communication to she majesty 's minister in the meantime the undersigned avail himself of the present occasion to offer a few remark upon certain part of mr fox 's note of the 10th ultimo after advert to the suggestion heretofore make by the british government that a conventional line equally divide the territory in dispute between the two party should be substitute for the line describe by the treaty and regret the constitutional incompetency of the federal government to agree to such a arrangement without the consent of the state of maine mr fox refer to the conventional line adopt although different from that designate by the treaty with respect to the boundary westward from the lake of the wood and ask why should such a line not be agree to likewise for the boundary eastward from the river connecticut the reply to this question be obvious the parallel of latitude adopt on the occasion refer to as a conventional substitute for the treaty line pass over territory within the exclusive jurisdiction of the general government without trench upon the rights or claim of any individual member of the union and the legitimate power of the government therefore to agree to such line be perfect and unquestioned now in consent to a conventional line for the boundary eastward from the river connecticut the government of the united state would transcend its constitutional power since such a measure could only be carry into effect by violate the jurisdiction of a sovereign state of the union and by assume to alienate without the color of rightful authority to do so a portion of the territory claim by the state with regard to the suggestion make by the undersign in he note of the 29th of February 1836 of the readiness of the president to apply to the state of maine for she assent to the adoption of a conventional line make the river st john from its source to its mouth the boundary between the united state and the adjacent british province mr fox think it difficult to understand upon what grounds a expectation could have be form that such a proposal could be entertain by the british government since such a arrangement would give to the united state even greater advantage than would be obtain by a unconditional acquiescence in they claim to the whole territory in dispute in make the suggestion refer to the undersigned expressly state to mr bankhead that it be offer as the proposition on the part of great britain that lead to it be suppose to have be without regard to the mere question of acre -- the extent of territory lose or acquire by the respective party the suggestion be submit in the hope that the preponderate importance of terminate at once and forever this controversy by establish a unchangeable and definite and indisputable boundary would be see and acknowledge by she majesty 's government and have a correspondent weight in influence its decision that the advantage of substitute a river for a highland boundary could not fail to be recognize be apparent from the fact that mr bankhead 's note of 28th December 1835 suggest the river st john from the point in which it be intersect by a due north line draw from the monument at the head of the st croix to the southernmost source of that river as a part of the general outline of a conventional boundary no difficulty be anticipate on the part of she majesty 's government in understand the grounds upon which such a proposal be expect to be entertain by it since the precedent proposition of mr bankhead just advert to although professedly base on the principle of a equal division between the party could not be justify by it as it would have give nearly two-third of the dispute territory to she majesty 's government it be therefore fairly presume that the river line present in the opinion of she majesty 's government advantage sufficient to counterbalance any loss of territory by either party that would follow its adoption as a boundary another recommendation of the river line it be suppose would be find by she majesty 's government in the fact that whilst by its adoption the right of jurisdiction alone would have be yield to the united state over that portion of new brunswick south of the st john great britain would have acquire the right of soil as well as of jurisdiction of the whole portion of the dispute territory north of the river it be to be lament that the impose consideration allude to have fail in they desire effect -- that the hope of the president in regard to they have not be realize and consequently that she britannic majesty 's government be not prepare at present to enter into a arrangement of the exist difference between the two nation upon the basis propose it would seem to the undersign from a expression use in mr fox 's late communication that some misapprehension exist on he part either as to the object of this government in ask for information relative to the manner in which the report of a commission of exploration and survey might tend to a practical result in the settlement of the boundary question or as to the distinctive difference between the american proposal for the appointment of such a commission and the same proposition when modify to meet the wish of she majesty 's government of the two mode suggest by direction of the president for constitute such a commission the first be that which be regard by she majesty 's government with most favor viz the commissioner to be choose in equal number by each of the two party with a umpire select by some friendly european sovereign to decide on all point on which they might disagree with instruction to explore the dispute territory in order to find within its limit divide highland answer to the description of the treaty of 1783 in a due north or northwesterly direction from the monument at the head of the st croix and that a right line draw between such highland and say monument should form so far as it extend a part of the boundary between the two country etc it be now intimate that she majesty 's government will not withhold its consent to such a commission if the principle upon which it be to be form and the manner in which it be to proceed can be satisfactorily settle this condition be partially explain by the suggestion afterwards make that instead of leave the umpire to be choose by some friendly european power it might be better that he should be elect by the member of the commission themselves and a modification be then propose that the commission shall be instruct to look for highland which both party might acknowledge as fulfil the condition of the treaty the american proposition be intend -- and it agree to would doubtless be successful -- to decide the question of boundary definitively by the adoption of the highland report by the commissioner of survey and would thus secure the treaty line the british modification look to no such object it merely contemplate a commission of boundary analogous to that appoint under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent and would in all probability prove equally unsatisfactory in practice whether highland such as be describe in the treaty do or do not exist it can scarcely be hope that those call for by the modify instruction could be find the fact that this question be still pend although more than half a century have elapse since the conclusion of the treaty in which it originate render it in the highest degree improbable that the two government can unite in believe that either the one or the other of the range of highland claim by the respective party fulfil the required condition of that instrument the opinion of the party have be over and over again express on this point and be well know to differ widely the commission can neither reconcile nor change these variant opinion rest on conviction nor will it be authorize to decide the difference under these impression of the inefficiency of such a commission be the inquiry make in the letter of the undersigned of 5th march 1836 as to the manner in which the report of the commission as propose to be constitute and instruct by she majesty 's government be expect to lead to a ultimate settlement of the question of boundary the result which the american proposition promise to secure be fully and frankly explain in previous note from the department of state and have its advantage not be clearly understand this government would not have devolve upon that of she majesty the task of illustrate they mr fox will therefore see that although the proposal to appoint a commission have its origin with this government the modification of the american proposition be as understand by the undersign so fundamentally important that it entirely change its nature and that the supposition therefore that it be rather for the government of the united state than for that of great britain to answer the inquiry refer to be found in misapprehension any decision make by a commission constitute in the manner propose by the united state and instruct to seek for the highland of the treaty of 1783 would be bind upon this government and could without unnecessary delay be carry into effect but if the substitute present by she majesty 's government be insist on and its principle be adopt a resort will then be necessary to the state of maine for she assent to all proceedings hereafter in relation to this matter since if any arrangement can be make under it it can only be for a conventional line to which she must of course be a party the undersign in conclusion be instruct to inform mr fox that if a negotiation be entertain at all upon the inconclusive and unsatisfactory basis afford by the british counter proposition or substitute which possess hardly a feature in common with the american proposition the president will not venture to invite it unless the authority of the state of maine to whom as before state it will be forthwith submit shall think it more likely to lead to a final adjustment of the question of boundary than the general government deem it to be though predispose to see it in the most favorable light the undersigned avail himself of the occasion to renew to mr fox the assurance of he distinguished consideration john forsyth department of state _ washington march 1 1838 _ he excellency edward kent _ governor of the state of maine _ sir : the discussion between the federal government and that of great britain in respect to the northeastern boundary of the united state have arrive at a stage in which the president think it due to the state of maine and necessary to the intelligent action of the general government to take the sense of that state in regard to the expediency of open a direct negotiation for the establishment of a conventional line and if it should deem a attempt to adjust the matter of controversy in that form advisable then to ask its assent to the same with this view and to place the government of maine in full possession of the present state of the negotiation and of all the discussion that have be have upon the subject the accompany document be communicate which take in connection with those heretofore transmit will be find to contain that information the principle which have hitherto govern every successive administration of the federal government in respect to its power and duty in the matter be -- first that it have power to settle the boundary line in question with great britain upon the principle and accord to the stipulation of the treaty of 1783 either by direct negotiation or in case of ascertain inability to do so by arbitration and that it be its duty to make all proper effort to accomplish this object by one or the other of those means second that the general government be not competent to negotiate unless perhaps on grounds of imperious public necessity a conventional line involve a cession of territory to which the state of maine be entitle or the exchange thereof for other territory not include within the limit of that state accord to the true construction of the treaty without the consent of the state in these view of he predecessor in office the president fully concur and it be he design to continue to act upon they the attention of the federal government have of course in the first instance be direct to effort to settle the treaty line a historical outline of the measure which have be successively take by it to that end may be useful to the government of maine in come to a conclusion on the proposition now submit it will however be unnecessary here to do more than advert to the cardinal feature of this protracted negotiation the treaty of peace between the united state of america and he britannic majesty conclude at paris in September 1783 define the boundary of the say state and the follow word take from the second article of that instrument be intend to designate a part of the boundary between those state and the british north american province viz : from the northwest angle of nova scotium viz that angle which be form by a line draw due north from the source of the st croix river to the highland along the say highland which divide those river that empty themselves into the river st lawrence from those which fall into the atlantic ocean to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river east by a line to be draw along the middle of the river st croix from its mouth in the bay of fundy to its source and from its source directly north to the aforesaid highland which divide the river that fall into the atlantic ocean from those which fall into the river st lawrence a immediate execution of some of the provision of this treaty be however delay by circumstance on which it be now unnecessary to dwell and in November 1794 a second treaty be conclude between the two power in the meantime doubt have arise as to what river be truly intend under the name of the st croix mention in the treaty of peace and form a part of the boundary therein describe this question be refer by virtue of the fifth article of the new treaty to the decision of a commission appoint in the manner therein prescribe both party agree to consider such decision final and conclusive the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the fifth article of the treaty of 1794 decide by they declaration of October 25 1798 that the northern branch -lrb- cheputnaticook -rrb- of a river call scoodiac be the true river st croix intend by the treaty of peace at the date of the treaty of ghent December 24 1814 the whole of the boundary line from the source of the river st croix to the most northwesternmost point of the lake of the wood still remain unascertained and it be therefore agree to provide for a final adjustment thereof for this purpose the appointment of commissioner be authorize by the fifth article of the treaty of ghent with power to ascertain and determine the northwest angle of nova scotium and the northwestern-most head of connecticut river in conformity with the provision of the treaty of 1783 and to cause the boundary from the source of the river st croix to the river iroquois or cateraguy to be survey and mark accord to the say provision etc in the event of the commissioner differ or both or either of they fail to act the same article make provision for a reference to a friendly sovereign or state commissioner be appoint under this article in 1815-16 but although they session continue several year they be unable to agree on any of the matter refer to they separate report be accordingly make to both government of the two commissioner in 1822 state the point on which they differ and the grounds upon which they respective opinion have be form the case have thus happen which make it necessary to refer the point of difference to a friendly sovereign or state it be deem expedient by the party to regulate this reference by a formal arrangement a convention for the purpose be therefore conclude on the 29th of September 1827 and the two government subsequently agree in the choice of he majesty the king of the netherland as arbiter who consent to act as such the submission of the point of difference three in number be accordingly make to that sovereign and he award or rather write opinion on the question submit to he be render on the 10th of January 1831 on the 7th of December follow the president communicate the award of the arbiter to the senate of the united state for the advice and consent of that body as to its execution and at the same time intimate the willingness of the british government to abide by it the result be a determination on the part of the senate not to consider the decision of he netherland majesty obligatory and a refusal to advise and consent to its execution they however pass a resolution in June 1832 advise the president to open a new negotiation with he britannic majesty 's government for the ascertainment of the boundary between the possession of the two power on the northeastern frontier of the united state accord to the definitive treaty of peace of the negotiation subsequent to this event it be deem proper to take a more particular notice in July the result of the action of the senate in relation to the award be communicate to mr bankhead the british charg d'affaire and he be inform that the resolution have be adopt in the conviction that the sovereign arbiter instead of decide the question submit to he have recommend a specify compromise of they the secretary of state at the same time express the desire of the president to enter into further negotiation in pursuance of the resolution of the senate and propose that the discussion should be carry on at washington he also say that if the plenipotentiary of the two party should fail in this new attempt to agree upon the line intend by the treaty of 1783 there would probably be less difficulty than before in fix a convenient boundary as measure be in progress to obtain from the state of maine more extensive power than be before possess with a view of overcome the constitutional obstacle which have oppose themselves to such a arrangement and he further intimate that the new negotiation would naturally embrace the important question of the navigation of the river st john in April 1833 sir charle r vaughan the british minister address a note to the department of state in which hopeless of find out by a new negotiation a assume line of boundary which so many attempt have be fruitlessly make to discover he wish to ascertain first the principle of the plan of boundary which the american government appear to contemplate as likely to be more convenient to both party than those hitherto discuss and secondly whether any and what arrangement for avoid the constitutional difficulty allude to have yet be conclude with the state of maine satisfactory answer on these point he say would enable the british government to decide whether it would entertain the proposition but he majesty 's government could not consent to embarrass the negotiation respect the boundary by mix up with it a discussion regard the navigation of the st john as a integral part of the same question or as necessarily connect with it in reply to this note mr livingston under date of the 30th of April state that the arrangement speak of in he previous communication by which the government of the united state expect to be enable to treat for a more convenient boundary have not be effect and that as the suggestion in regard to the navigation of the st john be introduce merely to form a part of the system of compensation in negotiate for such a boundary if that of the treaty should be abandon it would not be insist on the proposition of the president for the appointment of a joint commission with a umpire to decide upon all point on which the two government disagree be then present it be accompany by a suggestion that the controversy might be terminate by the application to it of the rule for survey and lay down the boundary of tract and of country designate by natural object the precise situation of which be not know viz that the natural object call for as terminate point should first be find and that the line should then be draw to they from the give point with the least possible departure from the course prescribe in the instrument describe the boundary two mode be suggest in which such commission might be constitute : first that it should consist of commissioner to be choose in equal number by the two party with a umpire select by some friendly sovereign from among the most skillful man in europe or secondly that it should be entirely compose of such man so select to be attend in the survey and view of the country by agent appoint by the party this commission it be afterwards propose should be restricted to the simple question of determine the point designate by the treaty as the highland which divide the water that fall into the atlantic from those which flow into the st lawrence that these highland should be seek for in a north or northwest direction from the source of the st croix and that a straight line to be draw from the monument at the head of that river to those highland should be consider so far as it extend as a part of the boundary in question the commissioner be then to designate the course of the line along the highland and to fix on the northwesternmost head of the connecticut river in a note of 31st may the british minister suggest that this perplexed and hitherto interminable question could only be set at rest by a abandonment of the defective description of boundary contain in the treaty by the two government mutually agree upon a conventional line more convenient to both party than those insist upon by the commissioner under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent or that suggest by the king of the netherland mr mclane remark in reply -lrb- June 5 -rrb- that the embarrassment in trace the treaty boundary have arise more from the principle assume and from the manner of seek for it than from any real defect in the description when properly understand that in the present state of the business the suggestion of sir charle r vaughan would add to the exist difficulty grow out of a want of power in the general government under the constitution of the united state to dispose of territory belong to either of the state of the union without the consent of the state that as a conventional line to the south of and confessedly variant from that of the treaty would deprive the state of maine of a portion of the territory she claim it be not probable that she consent to it would be give while there remain a reasonable prospect of discover the line of the treaty of 1783 and that the president would not be authorize after the recent proceedings in the senate to venture now to agree upon a conventional line without such consent whilst the proposition submit in April afford not only a fair prospect but in he opinion the certain means of ascertain the boundary call for by the treaty of 1783 and of finally terminate all the perplexity which have encompass that subject in February 1834 sir charle r vaughan after submit certain observation intend to controvert the position assume by the united state on the subject of the constitutional difficulty by which the american government be prevent from acquiesce in the arrangement recommend by the king of the netherland for the settlement of the boundary in the neighborhood of the st john assert that the two government bind themselves by the convention of September 1827 to submit to a arbiter certain point of difference relative to the boundary between the american and british dominion that the arbiter be call on to determine certain question and that if he have determine the greater part of the point submit to he he decision on they ought not to be set aside merely because he declare that one remain point can not be decide in conformity with the word of the treaty of 1783 and therefore recommend to the party a compromise on that particular point that the main point refer to the arbiter be three in number that upon the second and third of these he make a plain and positive decision that upon the remain point he have declare that it be impossible to find a spot or to trace a line which shall fulfill all the condition require by the word of the treaty for the northwest angle of nova scotium and for the highland along which the boundary from that angle be to be draw yet that in the course of he reasoning upon this point he have decide several question connect with it upon which the two party have entertain different view viz : first the arbiter express he opinion that the term ` highland ' may properly be apply not only to a hilly and elevated country but to a tract of land which without be hilly divide water flow in different direction and consequently accord to this opinion the highland to be seek for be not necessarily a range of mountain but rather the summit level of the country second the arbiter express he opinion that a inquiry as to what be the ancient boundary of the north american province can be of no use for the present purpose because those boundary be not maintain by the treaty of 1783 and have in truth never be distinctly ascertain and lay down third the arbiter declare that the northwest angle of nova scotium mention in the treaty of 1783 be not a point which be then know and ascertain that it be not a angle which be create by the intersection of any line of boundary at that time acknowledge as exist but that it be a angle still to be find and to be create by the intersection of new line which be hereafter to be draw in pursuance of the stipulation of the treaty and further that the nature of the country eastward of the say angle afford no argument for lay that angle down in one place rather than in another fourth he state that no just argument can be deduce for the settlement of this question from the exercise of the rights of sovereignty over the fief of madawaska and over the madawaska settlement fifth he declare that the highland contemplate in the treaty should divide immediately and not mediately river flow into the st lawrence and river flow into the atlantic and that the word ` divide ' require contiguity of the thing to be divide sixth he declare that river fall into the bay of chaleur and the bay of fundy can not be consider accord to the meaning of the treaty as river flow into the atlantic and specifically that the river st john and restigouche can not be look upon as answerable to the latter description seventh he declare that neither the line of boundary claim by great britain nor that claim by the united state can be adjudge as the true line without depart from the principle of equity and justice as between the two party it be the opinion of he majesty 's government sir charle allege that the decision of the arbiter upon the second and third point refer to he as well as upon the subordinate question ought to be acquiesce in by the two government and that in any future attempt to establish a boundary whether in strict conformity with the word of the treaty of 1783 or by agree to the mode of settlement recommend by the arbiter it would be necessary to adopt these seven decision as a groundwork for further proceedings that the british government therefore previously to any further negotiation claim from the government of the united state a acquiescence in the decision pronounce by the arbiter upon all those point which he have decide and as a preliminary to any attempt to settle the remain point by negotiation to be satisfy that the federal government be possess of the necessary power to carry into effect any arrangement upon which the two party might agree with respect to the proposition make by the american government sir charle think that the difficulty which be find insurmountable as against the line recommend by the king of the netherland viz the want of authority to agree to any line which might imply a cession of any part of the territory to which the treaty as hitherto interpret by the united state might appear to entitle one of the component state of the union would be equally fatal to that suggest by mr livingston since a line draw from the head of the st croix to highland find to the westward of the meridian of that spot would not be the boundary of the treaty and might be more justly object to by maine and with more appearance of reason than that propose by the arbiter the reply of mr mclane to the precede note be date on the 11th of march he express he regret that he britannic majesty 's government should still consider any part of the opinion of the arbiter obligatory on either party those opinion the secretary state could not have be carry into effect by the president without the concurrence of the senate who regard they not only as not determine the principal object of the reference but as in fact decide that object to be impracticable and therefore recommend to the two party a boundary not even contemplate either by the treaty or by the reference nor within the power of the general government to take decline to give they advice and consent to the execution of the measure recommend by the arbiter but do advise the executive to open a new negotiation for the ascertainment of the boundary in pursuance of the treaty of 1783 and the proposition of mr livingston submit in he letter of 30th of April 1833 accordingly proceed upon that basis mr mclane deny that a decision much less the expression of a opinion by the arbiter upon some of the dispute point but of a character not to settle the real controversy be bind upon either party and he allege that the most material point in the line of the true boundary both as it respect the difficulty of the subject and the extent of territory and dominion of the respective government the arbiter not only fail to decide but acknowledge he inability to decide thereby impose upon both government the unavoidable necessity of resort to further negotiation to ascertain the treaty boundary and absolve each party from any obligation to adopt he recommendation the secretary also decline to admit that of the three main point refer to the arbiter as necessary to ascertain the boundary of the treaty he have decide two on the first point mr mclane say it be not contend a decision be make or that either the angle or the highland call for by the treaty be find and on the third point a opinion merely be express that it would be suitable to proceed to fresh operation to measure the observe latitude etc the secretary admit that if the american proposition should be accede to by he majesty 's government and the commission hereafter to be appoint should result in ascertain the true situation of the boundary call for by the treaty of 1783 that it would be afterwards necessary in order to ascertain the true line to settle the other two point accord to which it should be trace he therefore offer if the american proposition should be accede to notwithstanding the obligatory effect of the decision of the arbiter on the point be deny to take the stream situate farthest to the northwest among those which fall into the northernmost of the three lake the last of which bear the name of connecticut lake as the north-westernmost head of the connecticut river accord to the treaty of 1783 and as it respect the third point refer to the arbiter the line of boundary on the forty-fifth degree of latitude but upon which he fail to decide the president would agree if the proposition as to the first point be embrace to adopt the old line survey and mark by valentine and collin in 1771 and 1772 the secretary then proceed to state further and insuperable objection to a acquiescence by the united state in the opinion suppose to have be pronounce by the arbiter in the course of he reasoning upon the first point submit to he he remark that the view express by the arbiter on these subordinate matter could not be regard as decision within the meaning of the reference but rather as postulate or premise by which he arrive at the opinion express in regard to the point in dispute by a acquiescence in they therefore as require by great britain the united state would reject as erroneous the conclusion of the arbiter whilst they would adopt the premise and reasoning by which it be attain -- that the seven postulate or premise present as necessary to be consider by the united state be but part of those on which the arbiter be equally explicit in the expression of he view that on other he reasoning might be consider as more favorable to the pretension of this government and that no reason be perceive why a acquiescence in he opinion upon they should not equally apply to all the premise assume by he and be bind upon both party mr mclane be however persuade that there be no obligation on either government to acquiesce in the opinion of the arbiter on any of the matter involve in he premise that such acquiescence would defeat the end of the present negotiation and that as it appear to be mutually concede that the arbiter have not be able to decide upon the first and most material point so as to make a binding decision there could certainly be no greater obligation to yield to he opinion on subordinate matter merely the secretary further observe that the most material point of the three submit to the arbiter be that of the highland to which the president 's proposition directly apply and which be designate in the treaty of peace as the northwest angle of nova scotium form by a line draw due north from the source of the st croix river to the highland divide the river etc that the arbiter find it impossible to decide this point and therefore recommend a new line different from that call for by the treaty of 1783 and which could only be establish by a conventional arrangement between the two government that the government of the united state could not adopt this recommendation nor agree upon a new and conventional line without the consent of the state of maine that the present negotiation propose to ascertain the boundary accord to the treaty of 1783 and for this purpose however attain the authority of the government of the united state be complete that the proposition offer by the government of the united state promise in the opinion of the president the means of ascertain the true line by discover the highland of the treaty but the british government ask the united state as a preliminary concession to acquiesce in the opinion of the arbiter upon certain subordinate fact -- a concession which would in effect defeat the sole object not only of the proposition but of the negotiation viz the determination of the boundary accord to the treaty of 1783 by confine the negotiation to a conventional line to which this government have not the authority to agree mr mclane also say that if by a resort to the plain rule now recommend it should be find impracticable to trace the boundary accord to the definitive treaty it would then be time enough to enter upon a negotiation for a conventional substitute for it he state in answer to the suggestion of sir charle r vaughan that the objection urge against the line of the arbiter would equally lie against that suggest by mr livingston that the authority of the government to ascertain the true line of the treaty be unquestionable and that the american proposition by confine the course to the natural object would be a legitimate ascertainment of that line in a note date 16th march sir charle r vaughan offer some observation upon the objection on the part of the united state to acquiesce in the point previously submit to the american government he say that the adoption of the view of the british government by the government of the united state be mean to be the groundwork of future proceedings whether those proceedings be to be direct to another attempt to trace the boundary as propose by the latter or to a division of the territory depend upon the conventional line he maintain that the arbiter have decide as the british government assert two out of the three main point submit for he decision viz what ought to be consider as the northwesternmost head of the connecticut -lrb- but which the government of the united state be only willing to admit conditionally -rrb- and the point relative to trace the boundary along the forty-fifth degree of latitude this point he observe mr mclane wish to dispose of by adopt the old line of collin and valentine which be suspect of great inaccuracy by both party and the only motive for retain which be because some american citizen have make settlement upon territory that a new survey might throw into the possession of great britain sir charle deny that the acquiescence of the united state in the seven subordinate point lately submit by he majesty 's government would confine the negotiation to a conventional line to which the president have no authority to agree and affirm that not a step could be take by the commissioner to be appoint accord to mr livingston 's proposition notwithstanding the unlimited discretion which it be propose to give they unless the two government agree upon two of the seven subordinate point -- the character of the land they be to discover as divide water accord to the treaty of 1783 and what be to be consider as atlantic river in answer to mr mclane 's observation that on many point the reasoning of the arbiter have be more favorable to the united state than to great britain and that therefore acquiescence should equally apply to all the premise assume sir charle express he confidence that if acquiescence in they could facilitate the object which now occupy both government they would meet with the most favored consideration sir charle advert to the obligation contract under the seventh article of the convention to the opinion of he majesty 's government that they be bind and its willingness to abide by the award of the arbiter he refer to the small majority by which he suppose the award to have be defeat in the senate of the united state and a new negotiation advise to be open to the complicated nature of the plan propose by the united state for another attempt to trace the boundary of the treaty to the rejection of the point propose by the british government to render that plan more practicable etc and regret sincerely that the award of the arbiter which confer upon the united state three-fifths of the dispute territory together with rous point -- a much greater concession than be ever likely to be obtain by a protracted negotiation -- be set aside a alleged insuperable constitutional difficulty have occasion the rejection of the award sir charle wish to ascertain previously to any further proceedings how far the general government have the power to carry into effect any arrangement result from a new negotiation the answer of mr mclane upon this point have be confine to state that should a new commission of survey free from the restriction of follow the due north line of the treaty find anywhere westward of that line highland separate river accord to the treaty of 1783 a line draw from the monument at the source of the st croix would be such a fulfillment of the term of that treaty that the president could agree to make it the boundary without reference to the state of maine mr mclane under date of 21st march correct the error into which sir charle have fall in regard to the proceedings on the award in the senate of the united state and show that that body not only fail but by two repeat vote of 35 and 34 to 8 refuse to consent to the execution of the award and by necessary implication deny its binding effect upon the united state thus put it out of the power of the president to carry it into effect and leave the high party to the submission situate precisely as they be prior to the selection of the arbiter the president have perceive mr mclane say in all the previous effort to adjust the boundary in accordance with the term of the treaty of 1783 that a natural and uniform rule in the settlement of dispute question of location have be quite overlook that the chief if not only difficulty arise from a suppose necessity of find highland correspond with the treaty description in a due north line from the monument but it be plain that if such highland could be anywhere discover it would be a legal execution of the treaty to draw a line to they from the head of the st croix without regard to the precise course give in the treaty it therefore become he duty to urge the adoption of this principle upon the government of he britannic majesty as perhaps the best expedient which remain for ascertain the boundary of the treaty of 1783 the secretary could not perceive in the plan propose anything so complicated as sir charle appear to suppose on the contrary it be recommend to approbation and confidence by its entire simplicity it chiefly require the discovery of the highland call for by the treaty and the mode of reach they upon the principle suggest be so simple that no observation could make it plainer the difficulty of discover such highland mr mclane say be presume not to be insuperable the arbiter himself be not understand to have find it impracticable to discover highland answer the description of the highland of the treaty though unable to find they due north from the monument and certainly it could not be more difficult for commissioner on the spot to arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to they own judgment as to the locality of the highland mr mclane in answer to sir charle 's request for information on the subject state that the difficulty in the way of the adoption of the line recommend by the arbiter be the want of authority in the government of the united state to agree to a line not only confessedly different from the line call for by the treaty but which would deprive the state of maine of a portion of territory to which she would be entitle accord to the line of the definitive treaty that by the president 's proposition a commission would be raise not to establish a new line differ from the treaty of 1783 but to determine what the true and original boundary be and in which of the two disagree party the right to the dispute territory originally be that for this purpose the authority of the original commissioner if they could have agree be complete under the ghent treaty and that of the new commission propose to be constitute could not be less sir charle r vaughan explain under date of the 24th of march with regard to he observation that the mode in which it be propose by the united state to settle the boundary be complicate that he do not mean to apply it to the adoption of a rule in the settlement of dispute question of location but to the manner in which it be propose by the united state that the new commission of survey shall be select and constitute on the 8th of December 1834 sir charle r vaughan transmit a note to the department of state in which after a passing expression of the regret of he majesty 's government that the american government still decline to come to a separate understanding on the several point of difference with respect to which the element of decision be fully before both government but without abandon the argument contain in he note of 10th February last he address himself exclusively to the american proposition for the appointment of a new commission to be empower to seek westward of the meridian of the st croix highland answer to the description of those mention in the treaty of 1783 he state with regard to the rule of survey on which the proposition be found that however just and reasonable it might be he majesty 's government do not consider it so generally establish and recognize as mr mclane assume it to be that indeed no similar case be recollect in which the principle assert have be put in practice yet on the contrary one be remember not only analogous to that under discussion but arise out of the same article of the same treaty in which the suppose rule be invest by the agent of the american government itself that the treaty of 1783 declare that the line of boundary be to proceed from the lake of the wood in a due west course to the mississippus but it be ascertain that such a line could never reach that river since its source lie south of the latitude of the lake of the wood the commissioner instead of adhering to the natural object -- the source of the mississippus -- and draw a new connect line to it from the lake of the wood adhere to the arbitrary line to be draw due west from the lake and abandon the mississippus the specific landmark mention in the treaty sir charle further state that if the president be persuade that he could carry out the principle of survey he have propose without the consent of maine and if no hope remain as be allege by mr mclane of overcome the constitutional difficulty in any other way until at least this proposition should have be try and have fail he majesty 's government foregoing they own doubt on the subject be ready to acquiesce in the proceeding propose by the president if that proceeding could be carry into effect in a manner not otherwise objectionable that he majesty 's government would consider it desirable that the principle on which the new commissioner would have to conduct they survey should be settle beforehand by a special convention between the two government that there be indeed one preliminary question upon which it be obviously necessary the two government should agree before the commission could begin they survey with any chance of success viz what be the precise meaning to be attach to the word employ in the treaty to define the highland which the commissioner be to seek for that those highland be to be distinguish from other highland by the river flow from they and those distinguish river to be know from other by the situation of they mouth that with respect to the river flow south into the atlantic ocean a difference of opinion exist between the two government that whilst the american government contend that river fall into the bay of fundy be the british government contend that they be not for the purpose of the treaty river fall into the atlantic ocean and that the view and argument of the british government on this point have be confirm by a impartial authority select by the common consent of the two government who be of opinion that the river st john and restigouche be not atlantic river within the meaning of the treaty and that he majesty 's government therefore trust that the american cabinet would concur with that of he majesty in decide that the atlantic river which be to guide the commissioner in search for the highland describe in the treaty be those which fall into the sea to the westward of the mouth of the river st croix that a clear agreement on this point must be a indispensable preliminary to the establishment of any new commission of survey that till this point be decide no survey of commissioner could lead to a useful result but that its decision turn upon the interpretation of the word of a treaty and not upon the operation of surveyor and he majesty 's government have once submit it in common with other point to the judgment of a impartial arbiter by whose award they have declare themselves ready to abide could not consent to refer it to any other arbitration in a note from the department of state dated 28th April 1835 sir charle r vaughan be assure that he prompt suggestion as he britannic majesty 's minister that a negotiation should be open for the establishment of a conventional boundary between the two country be duly appreciate by the president who have he possess like power with he majesty 's government over the subject would have meet the suggestion in a favorable spirit the secretary observe that the submission of the whole subject or any part of it to a new arbitrator promise too little to attract the favorable consideration of either party that the desire adjustment of the controversy be consequently to be seek for in the application of some new principle to the controvert question and that the president think that by a faithful prosecution of the plan submit by he direction a settlement of the boundary in dispute accord to the term of the treaty of 1783 be attainable with regard to the rule of practical survey offer as the basis of the american proposition he say if it should become material to do so -- which be not to be anticipate -- he would find no difficulty either in fortify the ground occupy by this government in this regard or in satisfy sir charle that the instance bring into notice by he britannic majesty 's government of a suppose departure from the rule be not at variance with the assertion of mr livingston repeat by mr mclane the secretary therefore limited himself to the remark that the line of demarcation refer to by sir charle be not establish as the true boundary prescribe by the treaty of 1783 but be a conventional substitute for it the result of a new negotiation control by other consideration than those to be draw from that instrument only the secretary express the president 's unfeigned regret upon learn the decision of he majesty 's government not to agree to the proposition make on the part of the united state without a precedent compliance by they with inadmissible condition he say that the view of this government in regard to this proposal of he majesty 's government have be already communicate to sir charle r vaughan and the president perceive with pain that the reason upon which these opinion be found have not be find to possess sufficient force and justice to induce the entire withdrawal of the objectionable condition but that on the contrary while he majesty 's government have be please to waive for the present six of the seven opinion refer to the remain one amongst the most important of they all be still insist upon viz that the st john and restigouche should be treat by the suppose commission as not be atlantic river accord to the meaning of those term in the treaty with reference to that part of sir charle 's communication which seek to strengthen the ground heretofore take on this point by the british government by call to its aid the suppose confirmation of the arbiter the secretary feel himself warrant in question whether the arbiter have ever give he opinion that the river st john and restigouche can not be consider accord to the meaning of the treaty as river fall into the atlantic and he insist that it be not the intention of the arbiter to express the opinion imputed to he the secretary also inform sir charle that the president could not consent to clog the submission with the condition propose by she majesty 's government that a just regard to the rights of the party and a proper consideration of he own duty require that the new submission if make should be make without restriction or qualification upon the discretion of the commissioner other than such as result from established fact and the just interpretation of the definitive treaty and such as have be heretofore and be now again tender to he britannic majesty 's government that he despair of obtain a better constitute tribunal than the one propose that he see nothing unfit or improper in submit the question as to the character in which the st john and restigouche be to be regard to the decision of a impartial commission that the party have heretofore think it proper so to submit it and that it by no means follow that because commissioner choose by the party themselves without a umpire have fail to come to a agreement respect it that the same result would attend the effort of a commission differently select the secretary close he note by state that the president have no new proposal to offer but would be happy to receive any such proposition as he britannic majesty 's government might think it expedient to make and by intimate that he be authorize to confer with sir charle whenever it might suit he convenience and comport with the instruction of he government with respect to the treaty boundary or a conventional substitute for it on the 4th of may 1835 sir charle r vaughan express he regret that the condition which he majesty 's government have bring forward as a essential preliminary to the adoption of the president 's proposal have be declare to be inadmissible by the american government sir charle confidently appeal to the tenor of the language of the award of the arbiter to justify the inference draw from it by he majesty 's government in regard to that point in the dispute which respect the river which be to be consider as fall directly into the atlantic the acquiescence of the united state in what be understand to be the opinion of the arbiter be invite he say because the new commission could not enter upon they survey in search of the highland of the treaty without a previous agreement between the two government what river ought to be consider as fall into the atlantic and that if the character in which the restigouche and st john be to be regard be a question to be submit to the commissioner the president 's proposition would assume the character of a new arbitration which have be already object to by the secretary sir charle also state that while he majesty 's government have wish to maintain the decision of the arbiter on subordinate point they mention have not be confine to those decide in favor of british claim that the decision be nearly balance in favor of either party and the general result of the arbitration be so manifestly in favor of the united state that to they be assign three-fifths of the territory in dispute and rouse point to which they have voluntarily resign all claim sir charle acknowledge with much satisfaction the secretary 's assurance that if the president possess the same power as he majesty 's government over the question of boundary he would have meet the suggestion of a conventional line contain in sir charle 's note of 31st may 1833 in a favorable spirit he lament that the two government could not coincide in the opinion that the removal of the only difficulty in the relation between they be attainable by the last proposal of the president as it be the only one in he power to offer in alleviation of the task of trace the treaty line to which the senate have advise that any further negotiation should be restricted he say that he be ready to confer with the secretary whenever it might be convenient to receive he and state that as to any proposition which it might be the wish of the united state to receive from he majesty 's government respect a conventional substitute for the treaty of 1783 it would in the first instance to avoid constitutional difficulty in the way of the executive be necessary to obtain the consent of maine a object which must be undertake exclusively by the general government of the united state mr bankhead the british charg d'affaire in a note to the department date 28th December 1835 state that during the three year which have elapse since the refusal of the senate to agree to the award of the king of the netherland although the british government have more than once declare its readiness to abide by its offer to accept the award the government of the united state have as often reply that on its part that award could not be agree to that the british government now consider itself by this refusal of the united state fully and entirely release from the conditional offer which it have make and that he be instruct distinctly to announce to the president that the british government withdraw its consent to accept the territorial compromise recommend by the king of the netherland with regard to the american proposition for the appointment of a new commission of exploration and survey mr bankhead could not see since the president find himself unable to admit the distinction between the bay of fundy and the atlantic ocean how any useful result could arise out of the propose survey he think on the contrary that if it do not furnish fresh subject of difference between the two government it could at best only bring the subject back to the same point at which it now stand to the suggestion of the president that the commission of survey should be empower to decide the river question mr bankhead say it be not in the power of he majesty 's government to assent that this question could not properly be refer to such a commission because it turn upon the interpretation to be put upon the word of the treaty of 1783 and upon the application of that interpretation to geographical fact already well know and ascertain and that therefore a commission of survey have no peculiar competency to decide such a question that to refer it to any authority would be to submit it to a fresh arbitration and that if he majesty 's government be prepare to agree to a fresh arbitration which be not the case such arbitration ought necessarily instead of be confine to one particular point alone to include all the point in dispute between the two government that he majesty 's government could therefore only agree to such a commission provide there be a previous understanding between the two government that although neither should be require to give up its own interpretation of the river question yet the commissioner should be instruct to search for highland upon the character of which no doubt could exist on either side if this modification of the president 's proposal should not prove acceptable mr bankhead observe the only remain way of adjust the difference would be to abandon altogether the attempt to draw a line in conformity with the word of the treaty and to fix upon a convenient line to be draw accord to equitable principle and with a view to the respective interest and the convenience of the two party he state that he majesty 's government be perfectly ready to treat for such a line and conceive that the natural feature of the dispute territory would afford peculiar facility for draw it that he majesty 's government would therefore propose a equal division of the territory in dispute between great britain and the united state and that the general outline of such a division would be that the boundary between the two state should be draw due north from the head of st croix river till it intersect the st john thence up the bed of the st john to the southernmost source of that river and from that point it should be draw to the head of the connecticut river in such manner as to make the northern and southern allotment of the divide territory as nearly as possible equal to each other in extent in reply to the precede note the secretary under date of February 29 1836 express the president 's regret to find that he britannic majesty 's government adhere to its objection to the appointment of a commission to be choose in either of the mode heretofore propose by the united state and he conviction that the proposition on which it be found that the river question be a treaty construction only although repeat on various occasion by great britain be demonstrably untenable and indeed only plausible when material and most important word of description in the treaty be omit in quote from that instrument he say that while he majesty 's government maintain they position agreement between the united state and great britain on this point be impossible that the president be therefore constrain to look to the new and conventional line offer in mr bankhead 's note but that in such a line the wish and interest of maine be to be consult and that the president could not in justice to himself or that state make any proposition utterly irreconcilable with she previously well-known opinion on the subject that the principle of compromise and equitable division be adopt by the king of the netherland in the line recommend by he a line reject by the united state because unjust to maine and yet that line give to great britain little more than 2000000 while the proposition now make by he majesty 's government secure to great britain of the disputed land more than 4000000 acre that the division offer by mr bankhead 's note be not in harmony with the equitable rule from which it be say to spring and if it be in conformity with it could not be accept without disrespect to the previous decision and just expectation of maine the president be far from attribute this proposition the secretary say to the desire of he majesty 's government to acquire territory he doubt not that the offer without regard to the extent of territory fall to the north or south of the st john be make by he majesty 's government from a belief that the substitution of a river for a highland boundary would be useful in prevent territorial dispute in future but although the president coincide in this view of the subject he be compel to decline the boundary propose as inconsistent with the known wish rights and decision of the state the secretary conclude by state that the president with a view to terminate at once all controversy and without regard to the extent of territory lose by one party or acquire by the other to establish a definite and indisputable line would if he majesty 's government assent to it apply to the state of maine for its consent to make the river st john from its source to its mouth the boundary between maine and he britannic majesty 's dominion in that part of north america mr bankhead acknowledge on the 4th march 1836 the receipt of this note from the department and say that the rejection of the conventional line propose in he previous note would cause he majesty 's government much regret he refer the secretary to that part of he note of the 28th December last wherein the proposition of the president for a commission of exploration and survey be fully discuss as it appear to mr bankhead that the secretary have not give the modification on the part of he majesty 's government of the american proposition the weight to which it be entitle he say that it be offer with the view of meeting as far as practicable the wish of the president and of endeavor by such a preliminary measure to bring about a settlement of the boundary upon a basis satisfactory to both party that with this view he again submit to the secretary the modify proposal of he majesty 's government remark that the commissioner who might be appoint be not to _ decide _ upon point of difference but merely to present to the respective government the result of they labor which it be hope and believe would pave the way for a ultimate settlement of the question mr bankhead consider it proper to state frankly and clearly that the proposition offer in the last note from the department to make the river st john from its source to its mouth the boundary between the united state and he majesty 's province of new brunswick be one to which the british government he be convince would never agree on the 5th march the secretary express regret that he proposition to make the river st john the boundary between maine and new brunswick would in the opinion of mr bankhead be decline by he government that the government of the united state could not however relinquish the hope that the proposal when bring before he majesty 's cabinet and consider with the attention and deliberation due to its merit would be view in a more favorable light than that in which it appear to have present itself to mr bankhead if however the secretary add this expectation should be disappoint it would be necessary before the president consent to the modification of he previous proposition for the appointment of a commission of exploration and survey to be inform more fully of the view of the british government in offer the modification so that he might be enable to judge how the report of the commission -lrb- which as now propose to be constitute be not to decide upon point of difference -rrb- would be likely to lead to a ultimate settlement of the question of boundary and also which of the mode propose for the selection of commissioner be the one intend to be accept with the modification suggest by he britannic majesty 's government in January last mr fox the british minister at washington make a communication to the department of state in which with reference to the objection prefer by the american government that it have no power without the consent of maine to agree to the arrangement propose by great britain since it would be consider by that state as equivalent to a cession of what she regard as a part of she territory he observe that the objection of the state could not be admit as valid for the principle on which it rest be as good for great britain as it be for maine that if the state be entitle to contend that until the treaty line be determine the boundary claim by maine must be regard as the right one great britain be still more entitle to insist on a similar pretension and to assert that until the line of the treaty shall be establish satisfactorily the whole of the dispute territory ought to be consider as belong to the british crown since great britain be the original possessor and all the territory which have not be prove to have be by treaty cede by she must be deem to belong to she still but mr fox say the existence of these conflict pretension point out the expediency of a compromise and why he ask as a conventional line different from that describe in the treaty be agree to with respect to the boundary westward from the lake of the wood should such a line not be agree to likewise for the boundary eastward from the connecticut she majesty 's government could not he add refrain from again press this proposition upon the serious consideration of the united state as the arrangement best calculate to effect a prompt and satisfactory settlement between the two power with reference to the american proposition to make the river st john from its mouth to its source the boundary mr fox remark that it be difficult to understand upon what grounds any expectation could have be form that such a proposal could be entertain by the british government for such a arrangement would give to the united state even greater advantage than they would obtain by a unconditional acquiescence in they claim to the whole of the dispute territory because it would give to maine all the dispute territory lie south of the st john and in exchange for the remain part of the territory lie to the north of the st john would add to the state of maine a large district of new brunswick -- a district smaller in extent but much more considerable in value than the portion of the dispute territory which lie to the north of the st john with regard to the proposition for the appointment of a commission of exploration and survey mr fox state that she majesty 's government with little expectation that it could lead to a useful result but unwilling to reject the only plan leave which seem to afford a chance of make a further advance in this matter would not withhold they consent to such a commission if the principle upon which it be to be form and the manner in which it be to proceed could be satisfactorily settle that of the two mode propose in which such a commission might be constitute she majesty 's government think the first viz that it might consist of commissioner name in equal number by each of the two government with a umpire to be select by some friendly european power would be the best but suggest that it might be better that the umpire should be select by the member of the commission themselves rather than that the two government should apply to a third power to make such a choice that the object of this commission should be to explore the dispute territory in order to find within its limit divide highland which might answer the description of the treaty the search to be make in a north and northwest line from the monument at the head of the st croix and that she majesty 's government have give they opinion that the commissioner should be instruct to look for highland which both party might acknowledge as fulfil the condition of the treaty in answer to the inquiry how the report of the commission would accord to the view of she majesty 's government be likely when render to lead to a ultimate settlement of the boundary question mr fox observe that since the proposal for the appointment of a commission originate with the government of the united state it be rather for that government than the government of great britain to answer this question she majesty 's government have already state they have little expectation that such a commission could lead to any useful result etc but that she majesty 's government in the first place conceive that it be mean by the government of the united state that if the commission should discover highland answer to the description of the treaty a connect line from they to the head of the st croix should be deem to be a portion of the boundary between the two country mr fox further refer the secretary to the previous note of mr mclane on the subject in which it be contemplate as one of the possible result of the propose commission that such additional information might be obtain of the feature of the country as might remove all doubt as to the impracticability of lay down a boundary in accordance with the letter of the treaty mr fox say that if the investigation of the commission should show that there be no reasonable prospect of find the line describe in the treaty of 1783 the constitutional difficulty which now prevent the united state from agree to a conventional line might possibly be remove and the way be thus prepare for a satisfactory settlement of the difference by equitable division of the territory but he add in conclusion if the two government should agree to the appointment of such a commission it would be necessary that they agreement should be by a convention and it would be obviously indispensable that the state of maine should be a assent party to the arrangement in acknowledge the receipt of mr fox 's communication at the department he be inform -lrb- 7th February -rrb- that the president experience deep disappointment in find that the answer just present on the part of the british government to the proposition make by this government with the view of effect the settlement of the boundary question be so indefinite in its term as to render it impracticable to ascertain without further discussion what be the real wish and intention of she majesty 's government respect the appointment of a commission of exploration and survey but that a copy of it would be transmit to the executive of maine for the purpose of ascertain the sense of the state authority upon the expediency of meet the view of she majesty 's government so far as they be therein develop occasion be take at the same time to explain to mr fox in answer to the suggestion in he note of the 10th of January last that the parallel of latitude adopt as a conventional substitute for the line designate in the treaty for the boundary westward from the lake of the wood pass over territory within the exclusive jurisdiction of the general government without trench upon the rights or claim of any member of the union and the legitimate power of the government therefore to agree to such line be hold to be perfect but that in accede to a conventional line for the boundary eastward from the river connecticut it would transcend its constitutional power since such a measure could only be carry into effect by violate the jurisdiction of a sovereign state and assume to alienate a portion of the territory claim by such state in reply to the observation of mr fox that it be difficult to understand upon what ground a expectation could have be entertain that the proposition to make the st john the boundary would be receive by she majesty 's government he be inform that the suggestion have be offer as the proposition on the part of great britain that lead to it be suppose to have be with regard to the extent of territory lose or acquire by the respective party and in the hope that the great importance of terminate this controversy by establish a definite and indisputable boundary would be see and acknowledge by the british government and have a correspondent weight in influence its decision that the suggestion in mr bankhead 's note of 28th December 1835 of a part of the river st john as a portion of the general outline of a conventional boundary apparently recognize the superior advantage of a river over a highland boundary and that no difficulty be anticipate on the part of she majesty 's government in understand the grounds upon which such a proposal be expect to be entertain by it since the precedent proposition of mr bankhead just allude to although base upon the principle of a equal division between the party could not be justify by it as it would have give nearly two-third of the dispute territory to great britain that it be therefore fair to presume that the river line in the opinion of he majesty 's government present advantage sufficient to counterbalance any loss of territory by either party that might accrue from its adoption and it be also suppose that another recommendation of this line would be see by great britain in the fact that whilst by its adoption the right of jurisdiction alone would have be yield to the united state over that portion of new brunswick south of the st john great britain would have acquire the right of soil and jurisdiction of all the dispute territory north of that river to correct a misapprehension into which mr fox appear to have fall the distinctive difference between the american proposition for a commission and that proposition as subsequently modify by great britain be point out and he be inform that although the proposal originate with this government the modification be so fundamentally important that it entirely change the nature of the proposition and that the supposition therefore that it be rather for the government of the united state than for that of great britain to answer the inquiry prefer by the secretary of state for information relative to the manner in which the report of the commission as propose to be constitute and instruct by the british government might tend to a practical result be unfounded mr fox be also give to understand that any decision make by a commission constitute in the manner propose by the united state and instruct to seek for the highland of the treaty of 1783 would be bind upon this government and could be carry into effect without unnecessary delay but if the substitute present by she majesty 's government should be insist on and its principle be adopt it would then be necessary to resort to the state of maine for she assent in all proceedings relative to the matter since any arrangement under it can only be for a conventional line to which she must be a party in conclusion it be intimate to mr fox that if a negotiation be entertain by this government at all upon the unsatisfactory basis afford by the british counter proposition or substitute the president will not invite it unless the authority of the state of maine shall think it more likely to lead to a adjustment of the question of boundary than the general government deem it to be although predispose to see it in the most favorable light you excellency will perceive that in the course of these proceedings but without abandon the attempt to adjust the treaty line step necessary from the want of power in the federal government of a informal character have be take to test the disposition of the respective government upon the subject of substitute a conventional for the treaty line it will also be see from the correspondence that the british government despairing of a satisfactory adjustment of the line of the treaty avow its willingness to enter upon a direct negotiation for the settlement of a conventional line if the assent of the state of maine to that course can be obtain whilst the obligation of the federal government to do all in its power to effect a settlement of this boundary be fully recognize on its part it have in the event of its be unable to do so specifically by mutual consent no other means to accomplish the object amicably than by another arbitration or a commission with a umpire in the nature of a arbitration in the contingency of all other measure fail the president will feel it to be he duty to submit another proposition to the government of great britain to refer the decision of the question to a third party he would not however be satisfy in take this final step without have first ascertain the opinion and wish of the state of maine upon the subject of a negotiation for the establishment of a conventional line and he conceive the present the proper time to seek it i be therefore direct by the president to invite you excellency to adopt such measure as you may deem necessary to ascertain the sense of the state of maine with respect to the expediency of attempt to establish a conventional line of boundary between that state and the british possession by direct negotiation between the government of the united state and great britain and whether the state of maine will agree and upon what condition if she elect to prescribe any to abide by such settlement if the same be make should the state of maine be of opinion that additional survey and exploration might be useful either in lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the controversy accord to the term of the treaty or in enable the party to decide more understandingly upon the expediency of open a negotiation for the establishment of a line that would suit they mutual convenience and be reconcilable to they conflict interest and desire the creation for that purpose of a commission upon the principle and with the limited power describe in the letter of mr fox the president will without hesitation open a negotiation with great britain for the accomplishment of that object i have the honor to be with high consideration you

destruction of the life of some american citizen who be on board of the boat at the time she be attack the act complain of be do under the follow circumstance : in upper canada which contain a population of about 450000 soul the most perfect tranquillity prevail up to the 4th day of December last although in the adjoining province of lower canada many of the french canadian inhabitant have be in open rebellion against the government for about a month precede at no time since the treaty of peace with the united state in 1815 have upper canada be more undisturbed the real cause of the insurrection in lower canada namely the national antipathy of the french inhabitant do not in any degree apply in the upper province whose population like the british and american inhabitant of lower canada be wholly oppose to the revolt and anxious to render every service in they power in support of the queen 's authority it have be report to the government some time before the 4th of December that in a remote portion of the home district a number of person occasionally meet and drill with arm under leader know to be disaffected but it be not believe by the government that anything more could be intend than to make a show of threaten revolt in order to create a diversion in favor of the rebel in lower canada the feeling of loyalty throughout this province be know to be so prevalent and decide that it be not think unsafe to forbear for the time at least to take any notice of the proceedings of this party on the night of the 4th December the inhabitant of the city of toronto be alarm by the intelligence that about 500 person arm with rifle be approach the city that they have murder a gentleman of great respectability in the highway and have make several person prisoner the inhabitant rush immediately to arm there be no soldier in the province and no militia have be call out the home district from which this party of armed man come contain 60000 inhabitant the city of toronto 10000 in a few hour a respectable force although undisciplined be collect and arm in self-defense and await the threaten attack it seem now to admit of no doubt that if they have at once advance against the insurgent they would have meet with no formidable resistance but it be think more prudent to wait until a sufficient force should be collect to put the success of a attack beyond question in the meantime people pour in from all quarter to oppose the insurgent who obtain no increase of number but on the contrary be desert by many of they body in consequence of the act of devastation and plunder into which they leader have force they on the 7th of December a overwhelming force of militia go against they and disperse they without lose a man take many prisoner who be instantly by my order release and suffer to depart to they home the rest with they leader flee some have since surrender themselves to justice many have be take and some have escape from the province it be report about this time that in the district of london a similar disposition to rise have be observe and in consequence a militia force of about 400 man be send into that district where it be speedily join by three time as many of the inhabitant of the district who assemble voluntarily and come to they aid with the greatest alacrity it be discover that about 300 person under dr duncombe a american by birth be assemble with arm but before the militia could reach they they disperse themselves and flee of these by far the greater come in immediately and submit themselves to the government declare that they have be mislead and deceive and pray for forgiveness in about a week perfect tranquillity be restore and from that moment not a man have be see in arm against the government in any part of the province with the exception of the hostile aggression upon navy island which i shall presently notice nor have there be the slightest resistance offer to the execution of legal process in a single instance after the dispersion of the armed insurgent near toronto mr mckenzie they leader escape in disguise to the niagara river and cross over to buffalo report have be spread there and elsewhere along the american frontier that toronto have be burnt and that the rebel be completely successful but the falsehood of these absurd rumor be well know before mckenzie arrive on the american side it be know also that the ridiculous attempt of 400 man to revolutionize a country contain nearly half a million inhabitant have be put down by the people instantly and decidedly without the loss of a man nevertheless a number of american citizen in buffalo and other town on the frontier of the state of new york enlist as soldier with the avowed object of invade canada and establish a provisional government public meeting be hold to forward this design of invade a country with which the united state be at peace volunteer be call for and arm ammunition and provision be supply by contribution openly make all this be in direct and flagrant violation of the express law of the united state as well as of the law of nation the civil authority of buffalo offer some slight shew of resistance to the movement be urge to interpose by many of the most respectable citizen but no real impediment be offer and on the 13th of December some hundred of the citizen of the state of new york as a armed body under the command of a mr van rensselaer a american citizen openly invade and take possession of navy island a part of upper canada situate in the niagara river not believe that such a outrage would really be commit no force whatever be assemble at the time to counteract this hostile movement in a very short time this lawless band obtain from some of the arsenal of the state of new york -lrb- clandestinely as it be say -rrb- several piece of artillery and other arm which in broad daylight be openly transport to navy island without resistance from the american authority the people of buffalo and the adjacent country continue to supply they with store of various kind and additional man enlist in they rank in a few day they force be variously state from 500 to 1500 of whom a small proportion be rebel who have flee from upper canada they begin to intrench themselves and threaten that they would in a short time make a landing on the canadian side of the niagara river to prevent this and to keep they in check a body of militia be hastily collect and station on the frontier under the command of colonel cameron assistant adjutant-general of militia who be succeed in this command by colonel mcnab the speaker of the house of assembly a officer whose humanity and discretion as well as he activity have be prove by he conduct in put down the insurrection in the london district and have be acknowledge in warm term of gratitude by the misguided person who have surrender themselves into he hand he receive order to act on the defensive only and to be careful not to do any act which the american government could justly complain of as a breach of neutrality a official statement of the unfriendly proceedings at buffalo be without delay -lrb- on the 13th December -rrb- make by I to he excellency the governor of the state of new york to which no answer have be receive and after this open invasion of we territory and when it become evident that nothing be effect at buffalo for prevent the violation of neutrality a special messenger be send to you excellency at washington to urge you interposition in the matter sufficient time have not yet elapse to admit of he return soon after he departure this band of outlaw on navy island act in defiance of the law and government of both country open a fire from several piece of ordnance upon the canadian shore which in this part be thickly settle the distance from the island be about 600 yard and within sight of the populous village of chippewa they put several ball -lrb- 6-pound shot -rrb- through a house in which a party of militiaman be quarter and which be the dwelling house of captain usher a respectable inhabitant they kill a horse on which a man at the time be ride but happily do no further mischief though they fire also repeatedly with cannon and musketry upon we boat they continue daily to render they position more formidable receive constant supplies of man and warlike store from the state of new york which be chiefly embark at a landing place on the american main shore call fort schlosser nearly opposite to navy island this place be once i believe a military position before the conquest of canada from the french but there be now neither fort nor village there but merely a single house occupy as a tavern and a wharf in front of it to which boat and vessel be moor the tavern have be during these lawless proceedings a rendezvous for the band -lrb- who can not be call by any name more appropriate than pirate -rrb- and be in fact openly and notoriously resort to as they headquarters on the mainland and be so to this time on the 28th December positive information be give to colonel mcnab by person from buffalo that a small steamboat call the _ caroline _ of about 50 ton burthen have be hire by the pirate who call themselves patriot and be to be employ in carry down cannon and other store and in transport man and anything else that might be require between fort schlosser and navy island he resolve if she come down and engage in this service to take or destroy she she do come down agreeably to the information he receive she transport a piece of artillery and other store to the island and make repeat passage during the day between the island and the main shore in the night he send a party of militia in boat with order to take or destroy she they proceed to execute the order they find the _ caroline _ moor to the wharf opposite to the inn at fort schlosser in the inn there be a guard of armed man to protect she -- part of the pirate force or act in they support on she deck there be a armed party and a sentinel who demand the countersign thus identify as she be with the force which in defiance of the law of nation and every principle of natural justice have invade upper canada and make war upon its unoffending inhabitant she be board and after a resistance in which some desperate wound be inflict upon the assailant she be carry if any peaceable citizen of the united state perish in the conflict it be and be unknown to the captor and it be and be equally unknown to they whether any such be there before this vessel be thus take not a gun have be fire by the force under the order of colonel mcnab even upon this gang of pirate much less upon any peaceable citizen of the united state it must therefore have be a consciousness of the guilty service she be engage in that lead those who be employ she to think a armed guard necessary for she defense peaceable citizen of the united state be not likely to be find in a vessel so employ at such a place and in such a juncture and if they be there they presence especially unknown as it be to the captor could not prevent in law or reason this necessary act of self-defense fifteen day have elapse since the invasion of upper canada by a force enlist armed and equipped openly in the state of new york the country where this outrage upon the law of nation be commit be populous buffalo also contain 15000 inhabitant the public authority it be true give no countenance to those flagrant act but it do not prevent they or in the slightest degree obstruct they further than by issue proclamation which be disregard perhaps they could not but in either case the insult and injury to the inhabitant of canada be the same and they right to defend themselves equally unquestionable no wanton injury be commit by the party who gallantly effect this service they loose the vessel from the wharf and finding they could not tow she against the rapid current of the niagara they abandon the effort to secure she set she on fire and let she drift down the stream the prisoner take be a man who it will be see by the document accompany this dispatch avowed himself to be a subject of she majesty inhabit upper

in make war upon this province -lrb- 27 -rrb- fourth other correspondence arise out of the present state of thing on the niagara frontier -lrb- 27 -rrb- fifth the special message of governor marcy -lrb- 27 -rrb- it will be see from these document that a high officer of the government of the state of new york have be send by he excellency the governor for the express purpose of regain possession of the artillery of that state which be now employ in hostile aggression upon this portion of she majesty 's dominion and that be aid and favor as he acknowledge by the most friendly cooperation which the command officer of she majesty 's force could give he he have be successfully defy by this army of american citizen and have abandon the object of he mission in despair it can hardly fail also to be observe by you excellency that in the course of this negotiation between mr van rensselaer and the commissary-general of the state of new york this individual mr van rensselaer have not hesitate to place himself within the immediate jurisdiction of the government whose law he have violate and in direct personal communication with the officer of that government and have nevertheless be allow to return unmolested to continue in command of american citizen engage in open hostility against great britain the exact position then of affair on we frontier may be thus describe : a army of american citizen join to a very few traitor from upper canada and under the command of a subject of the united state have be raise and equip in the state of new york against the law of the united state and the treaty now subsist and be use artillery plunder from the arsenal of the state of new york in carry on this piratical warfare against a friendly country the officer and government of the united state and of the state of new york have attempt to arrest these proceedings and to control they citizen but they have fail although this piratical assemblage be thus defy the civil authority of both country upper canada alone be the object of they hostility the government of the united state have fail to enforce its authority by any means civil or military and the single question -lrb- if it be a question -rrb- be whether upper canada be bind to refrain from necessary act of self-defense against a people whom they own government either could not or would not control in peruse the message of he excellency governor marcy to the legislature of the state of new york you excellency will probably feel some degree of surprise that after three week ' continued hostility carry on by the citizen of new york against the people of upper canada he excellency seem to have consider himself not call upon to make this aggression the subject of remark for any other purpose than to complain of a solitary act of self-defense on the part of she majesty 's province of upper canada to which such unprovoked hostility have unavoidably lead i have the honor to be sir you excellency 's most obedient humble

the other resolve suffer by imprisonment and otherwise for act under a law of this state incorporate the town of madawaska in 1831 the state of maine have acknowledge by these and other resolve its sense of obligation to remunerate in the first instance these sufferer in its cause and to satisfy as far as it be able they claim upon its justice but the wrong by which they suffer be commit by a foreign power with whom we be now at peace the state of maine have no power to make war or authorize reprisal she can only look to the general government to assume the payment as a act of justice to a member of the union under the provision of the constitution and to demand redress and remuneration from the author of the wrong in the name of the united state a minute recapitulation of the fact upon which these resolve be found be deem entirely unnecessary and superfluous as they have heretofore be communicate and be well know to the executive and to congress maine have suffer too many repetition of similar attempt to prevent she from enjoy she rightful possession and enforce she just claim to feel indifferent on the subject and we look with confidence to the general government for protection and support the amount of money although considerable be of comparatively small importance when contrast with the principle involve and the effect which must result from a immediate and ready assumption of the liability on the part of the united state such a act would be highly gratifying to the people of this state as evidence that they just claim and rights be fully recognize by the united state and that the strong arm of the union will be stretch out for they protection in every lawful effort to maintain and enforce they claim which they know and feel to be just and unimpeachable and which they be determine to maintain i trust i shall be pardon for earnestly urge immediate action on the subject i have the honor to inclose to you under date of the 28th of march last a copy of my message to the legislature and of the resolve of the legislature of maine in relation to the northeastern boundary which i have no doubt have receive and will receive all the attention the importance of the subject therein discuss and act on demand you will perceive that in accordance with you wish i communicate the proposition in relation to a conventional line of boundary with the letter of mr forsyth address to the executive of maine the view and wish and determination of the executive and legislature and i think i may safely add of the people of maine be fully and distinctly set forth in the document refer to communicate to you heretofore by I the proposition be distinct and definite and the answer be equally so and i consider that it may be regard as the fix determination of maine to consent to no proposition on we part to vary the treaty line but to stand by that line as a definite a practicable and a fair one until its impracticability be demonstrate it be needless for I to recapitulate the reason upon which this determination be found i refer you to the document before allude to for my own view on this topic sanction fully by the legislature the duty devolve upon I by you request i have endeavor to discharge in a spirit of profound respect for the constitute officer of the general government and with a single eye to the interest and honor of the united state and of the state of maine the attitude assume by maine in relation to the survey of the line of the treaty of 1783 have doubtless attract you attention i feel it due to the state to say to you frankly and unequivocally that this position be take deliberately and with a full consideration of all the circumstance of the case but it be assume in no spirit of defiance or resistance and with no design to embarrass the action of the general government maine feel no desire to act alone or independently on this question she know and feel that it be a national question and that it be the right and duty of the general government to move forward in effect the object propose i feel fully warrant in say that maine do not intend by this expression of she determination to run the line in a certain contingency to waive in the least degree she well-founded claim upon the general government to run mark and establish it on the contrary she will most reluctantly yield the hope she now so strongly feel that it be the intention of that government to relieve she from the necessity of throw herself upon she own resource to assert and defend she most unquestionable right the wish of this state be that the first act should be to run the line of the treaty of 1783 to ascertain the fact in relation to the topography of the country and the exact spot where the northwest angle of nova scotium may be find accord to we construction of the treaty language and to place suitable monument along the whole line such a survey would not settle or determine any rights but it would express and declare we view and intention such a survey be not a warlike or offensive movement and can not justly give offense to the other party in the controversy it be the unquestionable right of litigant in a court of justice to make exploration of land in dispute and if either party decline a joint survey it may be make _ ex parte _ and surely the united state have never so far yield the actual possession to great britain as to preclude the right on we part to ascertain for ourselves the absolute fact and to mark out the limit of we claim and we alleged right this act maine ask and ask earnestly the general government to perform without delay such a assumption of the controversy on the part of the united state would be to maine a assurance that she rights be duly regard and would be steadily and perseveringly maintain we want the name and the authority of the united state and there can be no doubt that a act emanate from that source would be regard by those interested on both side as of more importance than any act of a individual state so far then from any indifference on the part of maine as to the action of the general government or any desire to be drive to assume the performance of the duty allude to she look with intense anxiety and confident hope to be relieve from this position she believe it be alike due to the honor of the united state and the rights of maine that the general government should go forward in the work and that there be less to apprehend in the result from such a course than any other but maine feel that the time for decisive action have come that she can not be satisfy to have the claim to absolute and exclusive jurisdiction of a large part of she territory longer tolerate and acquiesce in she know that it rightfully belong to she jurisdiction that it be hers by a clear perfect and honest title -- as clear as perfect and rightful as she title to any portion of the state -- and she can not consent to have this title impaired or weaken by bold encroachment and unscrupulous demand she can not consent that a title transmit by the father of the revolution shall be destroy or defeat by acquiescence in the adverse occupation of a foreign state and that what be once fairly yield shall be reclaim in utter defiance of a solemn deed of cession i be confident i be not mistake in state that the legislature of maine consider the question as fairly and plainly before the national government and that if the present session of congress should close with a denial or postponement of the propose survey and no commission should be create by the executive as contemplate in the resolution refer to we should have a right and be bind to regard such a delay or refusal as evidence of a indisposition on the part of the general government to accede to we express view and wish and a denial of justice and that maine in that event owe it to herself to cause the survey to be make under she own authority the duty of the executive of maine be plainly point out and make imperative and absolute by the resolve of the legislature and i certainly can not hesitate so far as i have the means and power to execute they declare will the people of maine sir be not desirous of conflict or war both in they habit and they principle they love and wish for peace and quiet within they border they be not ambitious to win laurel or to acquire military glory by wage war with they neighbor and least of all be they desirous of a _ border _ warfare which may be the means of sacrifice human life and engender ill will and bad passion without bring the controversy to a conclusion they be scatter over we thousand hill engage in they quiet and peaceful labor and it be the first wish of they heart to live peaceably with all man and all nation they have no anxiety to extend we limit or to gain territory by conquest but there be a firm and determine spirit in this people which can not brook insult and will not submit to intentional injury they know they rights and know dare maintain they with calm determination and deliberate purpose and they appeal with unshrinking confidence to they sister state and to the government which bind they together for effective support in this they purpose the crisis as we believe demand firm and decide language and the expression of a determine design maine have never refuse to acquiesce in any fair and honorable mode of fix the line _ accord to the treaty of 1783 _ i have no doubt -lrb- but upon this point i speak accord to my individual belief -rrb- that the mode propose by great britain of establish the treaty line upon the face of the earth by a commission compose of impartial and scientific man to be elect by a friendly power would be satisfactory and acquiesce in by this state but that we should neither ask nor agree that any preliminary point should be yield by either party we should only ask that the treaty should be place in they hand with direction to ascertain and run and fix the line accord to its plain language and obvious meaning maine can never consent as i apprehend to yield the main point of the case and then refer it to enable the judge to divide the subject-matter of the controversy we feel that we now stand on the high vantage ground of truth and justice and that it can not be that any nation profess to act on the principle of right and equity can stand up before the civilized world and contest with unyielding pertinacity we claim we have too much respect for the nation from which we descend to believe that she will sully she reputation by such persevere resistance i be conscious that the language and style of this communication be unusual and probably undiplomatic that there be more of the fervor of feeling and the plain language of direct appeal than be usual in such papers but it be a subject of such vast importance to the state whose interest have be in part intrust to I and whose organ i be that i can not speak in measure term or indefinite language on this subject we have no ulterior view and no conceal object we plan and we policy be open and expose to the view of all man maine have nothing in either to conceal or disguise she plainly and distinctly ask for specific and definite action in perform what i conceive to be my duty i have be actuate by entire respect toward the general government and by the single desire to explain and enforce as well as i be able we wish and we rights i can only add that we trust the general government will assume the performance of the act specify in the resolution and relieve maine from the necessity of independent action with great respect i have the honor to be you most obedient servant edward kent -lrb- footnote 32 : omit -rrb-

have hitherto be honorably sustain through every vicissitude in we national affair these blessing which evince the care and beneficence of providence call for we devout and fervent gratitude we have not less reason to be grateful for other bounty bestow by the same munificent hand and more exclusively we own the present year close the first half century of we federal institution and we system differ from all other in the acknowledged practical and unlimited operation which it have for so long a period give to the sovereignty of the people have now be fully test by experience the constitution devise by we forefather as the framework and bond of that system then untried have become a settled form of government not only preserve and protect the great principle upon which it be found but wonderfully promote individual happiness and private interest though subject to change and entire revocation whenever deem inadequate to all these purpose yet such be the wisdom of its construction and so stable have be the public sentiment that it remain unaltered except in matter of detail comparatively unimportant it have prove amply sufficient for the various emergency incident to we condition as a nation a formidable foreign war agitate collision between domestic and in some respects rival sovereignty temptation to interfere in the intestine commotion of neighbor country the dangerous influence that arise in period of excessive prosperity and the antirepublican tendency of associate wealth -- these with other trial not less formidable have all be encounter and thus far successfully resist it be reserve for the american union to test the advantage of a government entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular will and we experience have show that it be as beneficent in practice as it be just in theory each successive change make in we local institution have contribute to extend the right of suffrage have increase the direct influence of the mass of the community give greater freedom to individual exertion and restricted more and more the power of government yet the intelligence prudence and patriotism of the people have keep pace with this augmented responsibility in no country have education be so widely diffused domestic peace have nowhere so largely reign the close bond of social intercourse have in no instance prevail with such harmony over a space so vast all form of religion have unite for the first time to diffuse charity and piety because for the first time in the history of nation all have be totally untrammeled and absolutely free the deepest recess of the wilderness have be penetrate yet instead of the rudeness in the social condition consequent upon such adventure elsewhere numerous community have spring up already unrivaled in prosperity general intelligence internal tranquillity and the wisdom of they political institution internal improvement the fruit of individual enterprise foster by the protection of the state have add new link to the confederation and fresh reward to provident industry doubtful question of domestic policy have be quietly settle by mutual forbearance and agriculture commerce and manufacture minister to each other taxation and public debt the burden which bear so heavily upon all other country have press with comparative lightness upon we without one entangle alliance we friendship be prize by every nation and the rights of we citizen be everywhere respect because they be know to be guard by a unite sensitive and watchful people to this practical operation of we institution so evident and successful we owe that increase attachment to they which be among the most cheer exhibition of popular sentiment and will prove they best security in time to come against foreign or domestic assault this review of the result of we institution for half a century without exciting a spirit of vain exultation should serve to impress upon we the great principle from which they have spring -- constant and direct supervision by the people over every public measure strict forbearance on the part of the government from exercise any doubtful or disputed power and a cautious abstinence from all interference with concern which properly belong and be best leave to state regulation and individual enterprise full information of the state of we foreign affair have be recently on different occasion submit to congress i deem it necessary now to bring to you notice only such event as have subsequently occur or be of such importance as to require particular attention the most amicable disposition continue to be exhibit by all the nation with whom the government and citizen of the united state have a habitual intercourse at the date of my last annual message mexico be the only nation which could not be include in so gratify a reference to we foreign relation i be happy to be now able to inform you that a advance have be make toward the adjustment of we difference with that republic and the restoration of the customary good feeling between the two nation this important change have be effect by conciliatory negotiation that have result in the conclusion of a treaty between the two government which when ratify will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power all the subject of controversy between we grow out of injury to individual there be at present also reason to believe that a equitable settlement of all dispute point will be attain without further difficulty or unnecessary delay and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic intercourse with we sister republic with respect to the northeastern boundary of the united state no official correspondence between this government and that of great britain have pass since that communicate to congress toward the close of they last session the offer to negotiate a convention for the appointment of a joint commission of survey and exploration i be however assure will be meet by she majesty 's government in a conciliatory and friendly spirit and instruction to enable the british minister here to conclude such a arrangement will be transmit to he without needless delay it be hope and expect that these instruction will be of a liberal character and that this negotiation if successful will prove to be a important step toward the satisfactory and final adjustment of the controversy i have hope that the respect for the law and regard for the peace and honor of they own country which have ever characterize the citizen of the united state would have prevent any portion of they from use any means to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with which we be at peace and with which the united state be desirous of maintain the most friendly relation i regret deeply however to be oblige to inform you that this have not be the case information have be give to I derive from official and other source that many citizen of the united state have associate together to make hostile incursion from we territory into canada and to aid and abet insurrection there in violation of the obligation and law of the united state and in open disregard of they own duty as citizen this information have be in part confirm by a hostile invasion actually make by citizen of the united state in conjunction with canadian and other and accompany by a forcible seizure of the property of we citizen and a application thereof to the prosecution of military operation against the authority and people of canada the result of these criminal assault upon the peace and order of a neighboring country have be as be to be expect fatally destructive to the misguided or deluded person engage in they and highly injurious to those in whose behalf they be profess to have be undertake the authority in canada from intelligence receive of such intended movement among we citizen have feel themselves oblige to take precautionary measure against they have actually embody the militia and assume a attitude to repel the invasion to which they believe the colony be expose from the united state a state of feeling on both side of the frontier have thus be produce which call for prompt and vigorous interference if a insurrection exist in canada the amicable disposition of the united state toward great britain as well as they duty to themselves would lead they to maintain a strict neutrality and to restrain they citizen from all violation of the law which have be pass for its enforcement but this government recognize a still higher obligation to repress all attempt on the part of its citizen to disturb the peace of a country where order prevail or have be reestablish depredation by we citizen upon nation at peace with the united state or combination for commit they have at all time be regard by the american government and people with the greatest abhorrence military incursion by we citizen into country so situated and the commission of act of violence on the member thereof in order to effect a change in they government or under any pretext whatever have from the commencement of we government be hold equally criminal on the part of those engage in they and as much deserving of punishment as would be the disturbance of the public peace by the perpetration of similar act within we own territory by no country or person have these invaluable principle of international law -- principle the strict observance of which be so indispensable to the preservation of social order in the world -- be more earnestly cherish or sacredly respect than by those great and good man who first declare and finally establish the independence of we own country they promulgate and maintain they at a early and critical period in we history they be subsequently embody in legislative enactment of a highly penal character the faithful enforcement of which have hitherto be and will i trust always continue to be regard as a duty inseparably associate with the maintenance of we national honor that the people of the united state should feel a interest in the spread of political institution as free as they regard they own to be be natural nor can a sincere solicitude for the success of all those who be at any time in good faith struggle for they acquisition be imputed to we citizen as a crime with the entire freedom of opinion and a undisguised expression thereof on they part the government have neither the right nor i trust the disposition to interfere but whether the interest or the honor of the united state require that they should be make a party to any such struggle and by inevitable consequence to the war which be wage in its support be a question which by we constitution be wisely leave to congress alone to decide it be by the law already make criminal in we citizen to embarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized military operation on they part offens of this character in addition to they criminality as violation of the law of we country have a direct tendency to draw down upon we own citizen at large the multiply evil of a foreign war and expose to injurious imputation the good faith and honor of the country as such they deserve to be put down with promptitude and decision i can not be mistaken i be confident in count on the cordial and general concurrence of we fellow-citizen in this sentiment a copy of the proclamation which i have feel it my duty to issue be herewith communicate i can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism the regard for the honor and reputation of they country the respect for the law which they have themselves enact for they own government and the love of order for which the mass of we people have be so long and so justly distinguish will deter the comparatively few who be engage in they from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprise in the meantime the exist law have be and will continue to be faithfully execute and every effort will be make to carry they out in they full extent whether they be sufficient or not to meet the actual state of thing on the canadian frontier it be for congress to decide it will appear from the correspondence herewith submit that the government of russium decline a renewal of the fourth article of the convention of April 1824 between the united state and he imperial majesty by the third article of which it be agree that hereafter there shall not be form by the citizen of the united state or under the authority of the say state any establishment upon the northwest coast of america nor in any of the island adjacent to the north of 54  40 ' of north latitude and that in the same manner there shall be none form by russian subject or under the authority of russium south of the same parallel and by the fourth article that during a term of ten year count from the signature of the present convention the ship of both power or which belong to they citizen or subject respectively may reciprocally frequent without any hindrance whatever the interior sea gulf harbor and creek upon the coast mention in the precede article for the purpose of fishing and trading with the native of the country the reason assign for decline to renew the provision of this article be briefly that the only use make by we citizen of the privilege it secure to they have be to supply the indian with spirituous liquor ammunition and firearm that this traffic have be exclude from the russian trade and as the supplies furnish from the united state be injurious to the russian establishment on the northwest coast and calculate to produce complaint between the two government he imperial majesty think it for the interest of both country not to accede to the proposition make by the american government for the renewal of the article last refer to the correspondence herewith communicate will show the grounds upon which we contend that the citizen of the united state have independent of the provision of the convention of 1824 a right to trade with the native upon the coast in question at unoccupied place liable however it be admit to be at any time extinguish by the creation of russian establishment at such point this right be deny by the russian government which assert that by the operation of the treaty of 1824 each party agree to waive the general right to land on the vacant coast on the respective side of the degree of latitude refer to and accept in lieu thereof the mutual privilege mention in the fourth article the capital and tonnage employ by we citizen in they trade with the northwest coast of america will perhaps on adverting to the official statement of the commerce and navigation of the united state for the last few year be deem too inconsiderable in amount to attract much attention yet the subject may in other respects deserve the careful consideration of congress i regret to state that the blockade of the principal port on the eastern coast of mexico which in consequence of difference between that republic and france be institute in may last unfortunately still continue enforce by a competent french naval armament and be necessarily embarrassing to we own trade in the gulf in common with that of other nation every disposition however be believe to exist on the part of the french government to render this measure as little onerous as practicable to the interest of the citizen of the united state and to those of neutral commerce and it be to be hope that a early settlement of the difficulty between france and mexico will soon reestablish the harmonious relation formerly subsist between they and again open the port of that republic to the vessel of all friendly nation a convention for mark that part of the boundary between the united state and the republic of texa which extend from the mouth of the sabine to the red river be conclude and sign at this city on the 25th of April last it have since be ratify by both government and seasonable measure will be take to carry it into effect on the part of the united state the application of that republic for admission into this union make in August 1837 and which be decline for reason already make know to you have be formally withdraw as will appear from the accompany copy of the note of the minister plenipotentiary of texa which be present to the secretary of state on the occasion of the exchange of the ratification of the convention above mention copy of the convention with texa of a commercial treaty conclude with the king of greece and of a similar treaty with the peru-bolivian confederation the ratification of which have be recently exchange accompany this message for the information of congress and for such legislative enactment as may be find necessary or expedient in relation to either of they to watch over and foster the interest of a gradually increase and widely extended commerce to guard the rights of american citizen whom business or pleasure or other motive may tempt into distant clime and at the same time to cultivate those sentiment of mutual respect and good will which experience have prove so beneficial in international intercourse the government of the united state have deem it expedient from time to time to establish diplomatic connection with different foreign state by the appointment of representative to reside within they respective territory i be gratify to be enable to announce to you that since the close of you last session these relation have be open under the happiest auspices with austrium and the two sicily that new nomination have be make in the respective mission of russium brazil belgium and sweden and norway in this country and that a minister extraordinary have be receive accredit to this government from the argentine confederation a exposition of the fiscal affair of the government and of they condition for the past year will be make to you by the secretary of the treasury the available balance in the treasury on the 1st of January next be estimate at $ 2765342 the receipt of the year from custom and land will probably amount to $ 20615598 these usual source of revenue have be increase by a issue of treasury note of which less than $ 8000000 include interest and principal will be outstanding at the end of the year and by the sale of one of the bond of the bank of the united state for $ 2254871 the aggregate of means from these and other source with the balance on hand on the 1st of January last have be apply to the payment of appropriation by congress the whole expenditure for the year on they account include the redemption of more than eight million of treasury note constitute a aggregate of about $ 40000000 and will still leave in the treasury the balance before state nearly $ 8000000 of treasury note be to be pay during the coming year in addition to the ordinary appropriation for the support of government for both these purpose the resource of the treasury will undoubtedly be sufficient if the charge upon it be not increase beyond the annual estimate no excess however be likely to exist nor can the postpone installment of the surplus revenue be deposit with the state nor any considerable appropriation beyond the estimate be make without cause a deficiency in the treasury the great caution advisable at all time of limit appropriation to the want of the public service be render necessary at present by the prospective and rapid reduction of the tariff while the vigilant jealousy evidently excite among the people by the occurrence of the last few year assure we that they expect from they representative and will sustain they in the exercise of the most rigid economy much can be effect by postpone appropriation not immediately require for the ordinary public service or for any press emergency and much by reduce the expenditure where the entire and immediate accomplishment of the object in view be not indispensable when we call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassment produce by excessive issue of bank paper aggravate by the unforeseen withdrawal of much foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arise from the distribution of the surplus revenue among the state as require by congress and consider the heavy expense incur by the removal of indian tribe by the military operation in florida and on account of the unusually large appropriation make at the last two annual session of congress for other object we have striking evidence in the present efficient state of we finances of the abundant resource of the country to fulfill all its obligation nor be it less gratifying to find that the general business of the community deeply affect as it have be be revive with additional vigor chasten by the lesson of the past and animated by the hope of the future by the curtailment of paper issue by curb the sanguine and adventurous spirit of speculation and by the honorable application of all available means to the fulfillment of obligation confidence have be restore both at home and abroad and ease and facility secure to all the operation of trade the agency of the government in produce these result have be as efficient as its power and mean permit by withhold from the state the deposit of the fourth installment and leave several million at long credit with the bank principally in one section of the country and more immediately beneficial to it and at the same time aid the bank and commercial community in other section by postpone the payment of bond for duty to the amount of between four and five million of dollar by a issue of treasury note as a means to enable the government to meet the consequence of they indulgence but afford at the same time facility for remittance and exchange and by steadily decline to employ as general depository of the public revenue or receive the note of all bank which refuse to redeem they with specie -- by these measure aid by the favorable action of some of the bank and by the support and cooperation of a large portion of the community we have witness a early resumption of specie payment in we great commercial capital promptly follow in almost every part of the united state this result have be alike salutary to the true interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture to public moral respect for the law and that confidence between man and man which be so essential in all we social relation the contrast between the suspension of 1814 and that of 1837 be most striking the short duration of the latter the prompt restoration of business the evident benefit result from a adherence by the government to the constitutional standard of value instead of sanction the suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper and the advantage derive from the large amount of specie introduce into the country previous to 1837 afford a valuable illustration of the true policy of the government in such a crisis nor can the comparison fail to remove the impression that a national bank be necessary in such emergency not only be specie payment resume without its aid but exchange have also be more rapidly restore than when it exist thereby show that private capital enterprise and prudence be fully adequate to these end on all these point experience seem to have confirm the view heretofore submit to congress we have be save the mortification of see the distress of the community for the third time seize on to fasten upon the country so dangerous a institution and we may also hope that the business of individual will hereafter be relieve from the injurious effect of a continued agitation of that disturbing subject the limited influence of a national bank in avert derangement in the exchange of the country or in compelling the resumption of specie payment be now not less apparent than its tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden expansion and contraction its disposition to create panic and embarrassment for the promotion of its own design its interference with politics and its far greater power for evil than for good either in regard to the local institution or the operation of government itself what be in these respects but apprehension or opinion when a national bank be first establish now stand confirm by humiliating experience the scene through which we have pass conclusively prove how little we commerce agriculture manufacture or finance require such a institution and what danger be attendant on its power -- a power i trust never to be confer by the american people upon they government and still less upon individual not responsible to they for its unavoidable abuse my conviction of the necessity of further legislative provision for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public money and my opinion in regard to the measure best adapt to the accomplishment of those object have be already submit to you these have be strengthen by recent event and in the full conviction that time and experience must still further demonstrate they propriety i feel it my duty with respectful deference to the conflicting view of other again to invite you attention to they with the exception of limited sum deposit in the few bank still employ under the act of 1836 the amount receive for duty and with very inconsiderable exception those accrue from land also have since the general suspension of specie payment by the deposit bank be keep and disburse by the treasurer under he general legal power subject to the superintendence of the secretary of the treasury the propriety of define more specifically and of regulate by law the exercise of this wide scope of executive discretion have be already submit to congress a change in the office of collector at one of we principal port have bring to light a defalcation of the gravest character the particulars of which will be lay before you in a special report from the secretary of the treasury by he report and the accompany document it will be see that the weekly return of the default officer apparently exhibit throughout a faithful administration of the affair intrust to he management it however now appear that he commence abstract the public money shortly after he appointment and continue to do so progressively increase the amount for the term of more than seven year embrace a portion of the period during which the public money be deposit in the bank of the united state the whole of that of the state bank deposit system and conclude only on he retirement from office after that system have substantially fail in consequence of the suspension of specie payment the way in which this defalcation be so long conceal and the step take to indemnify the united state as far as practicable against loss will also be present to you the case be one which imperatively claim the attention of congress and furnish the strongest motive for the establishment of a more severe and secure system for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public money than any that have heretofore exist it seem proper at all event that by a early enactment similar to that of other country the application of public money by a officer of government to private use should be make a felony and visit with severe and ignominious punishment this be already in effect the law in respect to the mint and have be productive of the most salutary result whatever system be adopt such a enactment would be wise as a independent measure since much of the public money must in they collection and ultimate disbursement pass twice through the hand of public officer in whatever manner they be intermediately keep the government it must be admit have be from its commencement comparatively fortunate in this respect but the appoint power can not always be well advise in its selection and the experience of every country have show that public officer be not at all time proof against temptation it be a duty therefore which the government owe as well to the interest commit to its care as to the officer themselves to provide every guard against transgression of this character that be consistent with reason and humanity congress can not be too jealous of the conduct of those who be intrust with the public money and i shall at all time be dispose to encourage a watchful discharge of this duty if a more direct cooperation on the part of congress in the supervision of the conduct of the officer intrust with the custody and application of the public money be deem desirable it will give I pleasure to assist in the establishment of any judicious and constitutional plan by which that object may be accomplish you will in you wisdom determine upon the propriety of adopt such a plan and upon the measure necessary to its effectual execution when the late bank of the united state be incorporate and make the depository of the public money a right be reserve to congress to inspect at its pleasure by a committee of that body the book and the proceedings of the bank in one of the state whose banking institution be suppose to rank amongst the first in point of stability they be subject to constant examination by commissioner appoint for that purpose and much of the success of its banking system be attribute to this watchful supervision the same course have also in view of its beneficial operation be adopt by a adjoining state favorably know for the care it have always bestow upon whatever relate to its financial concern i submit to you consideration whether a committee of congress might not be profitably employ in inspect at such interval as might be deem proper the affair and account of officer intrust with the custody of the public money the frequent performance of this duty might be make obligatory on the committee in respect to those officer who have large sum in they possession and leave discretionary in respect to other they might report to the executive such defalcation as be find to exist with a view to a prompt removal from office unless the default be satisfactorily account for and report also to congress at the commencement of each session the result of they examination and proceedings it do appear to I that with a subjection of this class of public officer to the general supervision of the executive to examination by a committee of congress at period of which they should have no previous notice and to prosecution and punishment as for felony for every breach of trust the safe-keeping of the public money might under the system propose be place on a surer foundation than it have ever occupy since the establishment of the government the secretary of the treasury will lay before you additional information contain new detail on this interesting subject to these i ask you early attention that it should have give rise to great diversity of opinion can not be a subject of surprise after the collection and custody of the public money have be for so many year connect with and make subsidiary to the advancement of private interest a return to the simple self-denying ordinance of the constitution could not but be difficult but time and free discussion elicit the sentiment of the people and aid by that conciliatory spirit which have ever characterize they course on great emergency be rely upon for a satisfactory settlement of the question already have this anticipation on one important point at least -- the impropriety of divert public money to private purpose -- be fully realize there be no reason to suppose that legislation upon that branch of the subject would now be embarrass by a difference of opinion or fail to receive the cordial support of a large majority of we constituent the connection which formerly exist between the government and bank be in reality injurious to both as well as to the general interest of the community at large it aggravate the disaster of trade and the derangement of commercial intercourse and administer new excitement and additional means to wild and reckless speculation the disappointment of which throw the country into convulsion of panic and all but produce violence and bloodsh the imprudent expansion of bank credit which be the natural result of the command of the revenue of the state furnish the resource for unbounded license in every species of adventure seduce industry from its regular and salutary occupation by the hope of abundance without labor and derange the social state by tempting all trade and profession into the vortex of speculation on remote contingency the same wide-spreading influence impede also the resource of the government curtail its useful operation embarrass the fulfillment of its obligation and seriously interfere with the execution of the law large appropriation and oppressive tax be the natural consequence of such a connection since they increase the profit of those who be allow to use the public fund and make it they interest that money should be accumulate and expenditure multiply it be thus that a concentrated money power be tempt to become a active agent in political affair and all past experience have show on which side that influence will be array we deceive ourselves if we suppose that it will ever be find assert and support the rights of the community at large in opposition to the claim of the few in a government whose distinguishing characteristic should be a diffusion and equalization of its benefit and burden the advantage of individual will be augment at the expense of the community at large nor be it the nature of combination for the acquisition of legislative influence to confine they interference to the single object for which they be originally form the temptation to extend it to other matter be on the contrary not unfrequently too strong to be resist the rightful influence in the direction of public affair of the mass of the people be therefore in no slight danger of be sensibly and injuriously affect by give to a comparatively small but very efficient class a direct and exclusive personal interest in so important a portion of the legislation of congress as that which relate to the custody of the public money if law act upon private interest can not always be avoid they should be confine within the narrowest limit and leave wherever possible to the legislature of the state when not thus restricted they lead to combination of powerful association foster a influence necessarily selfish and turn the fair course of legislation to sinister end rather than to object that advance public liberty and promote the general good the whole subject now rest with you and i can not but express a hope that some definite measure will be adopt at the present session it will not i be sure be deem out of place for I here to remark that the declaration of my view in opposition to the policy of employ bank as depository of the government fund can not justly be construe as indicative of hostility official or personal to those institution or to repeat in this form and in connection with this subject opinion which i have uniformly entertain and on all proper occasion express though always oppose to they creation in the form of exclusive privilege and as a state magistrate aim by appropriate legislation to secure the community against the consequence of they occasional mismanagement i have yet ever wish to see they protect in the exercise of rights confer by law and have never doubt they utility when properly manage in promote the interest of trade and through that channel the other interest of the community to the general government they present themselves merely as state institution have no necessary connection with its legislation or its administration like other state establishment they may be use or not in conduct the affair of the government as public policy and the general interest of the union may seem to require the only safe or proper principle upon which they intercourse with the government can be regulate be that which regulate they intercourse with the private citizen -- the confer of mutual benefit when the government can accomplish a financial operation better with the aid of the bank than without it it should be at liberty to seek that aid as it would the service of a private banker or other capitalist or agent give the preference to those who will serve it on the best term nor can there ever exist a interest in the officer of the general government as such induce they to embarrass or annoy the state bank any more than to incur the hostility of any other class of state institution or of private citizen it be not in the nature of thing that hostility to these institution can spring from this source or any opposition to they course of business except when they themselves depart from the object of they creation and attempt to usurp power not confer upon they or to subvert the standard of value establish by the constitution while opposition to they regular operation can not exist in this quarter resistance to any attempt to make the government dependent upon they for the successful administration of public affair be a matter of duty as i trust it ever will be of inclination no matter from what motive or consideration the attempt may originate it be no more than just to the bank to say that in the late emergency most of they firmly resist the strongest temptation to extend they paper issue when apparently sustain in a suspension of specie payment by public opinion even though in some case invite by legislative enactment to this honorable course aid by the resistance of the general government act in obedience to the constitution and law of the united state to the introduction of a irredeemable paper medium may be attribute in a great degree the speedy restoration of we currency to a sound state and the business of the country to its wonted prosperity the bank have but to continue in the same safe course and be content in they appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the general government and to derive from it all the protection and benefit which it bestow on other state establishment on the people of the state and on the state themselves in this they true position they can not but secure the confidence and good will of the people and the government which they can only lose when leap from they legitimate sphere they attempt to control the legislation of the country and pervert the operation of the government to they own purpose we experience under the act pass at the last session to grant preemption rights to settler on the public land have as yet be too limit to enable we to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of its provision to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the government in that respect there be however the best reason to anticipate favorable result from its operation the recommendation formerly submit to you in respect to a graduation of the price of the public land remain to be finally act upon have find no reason to change the view then express you attention to they be again respectfully request every proper exertion have be make and will be continue to carry out the wish of congress in relation to the tobacco trade as indicate in the several resolution of the house of representative and the legislation of the two branch a favorable impression have i trust be make in the different foreign country to which particular attention have be direct and although we can not hope for a early change in they policy as in many of they a convenient and large revenue be derive from monopoly in the fabrication and sale of this article yet as these monopoly be really injurious to the people where they be establish and the revenue derive from they may be less injuriously and with equal facility obtain from another and a liberal system of administration we can not doubt that we effort will be eventually crown with success if persist in with temperate firmness and sustain by prudent legislation in recommend to congress the adoption of the necessary provision at this session for take the next census or enumeration of the inhabitant of the united state the suggestion present itself whether the scope of the measure might not be usefully extend by cause it to embrace authentic statistical return of the great interest specially intrust to or necessarily affect by the legislation of congress the accompany report of the secretary of war present a satisfactory account of the state of the army and of the several branch of the public service confide to the superintendence of that officer the law increase and organize the military establishment of the united state have be nearly carry into effect and the army have be extensively and usefully employ during the past season i would again call to you notice the subject connect with and essential to the military defens of the country which be submit to you at the last session but which be not act upon as be suppose for want of time the most important of they be the organization of the militia on the maritime and inland frontier this measure be deem important as it be believe that it will furnish a effective volunteer force in aid of the regular army and may form the basis of a general system of organization for the entire militia of the united state the erection of a national foundry and gunpowder manufactory and one for make small arm the latter to be situate at some point west of the allegany mountain all appear to be of sufficient importance to be again urge upon you attention the plan propose by the secretary of war for the distribution of the force of the united state in time of peace be well calculate to promote regularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the service to preserve the discipline of the troops and to render they available for the maintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the country with this view likewise i recommend the adoption of the plan present by that officer for the defense of the western frontier the preservation of the life and property of we fellow-citizen who be settle upon that border country as well as the existence of the indian population which might be tempt by we want of preparation to rush on they own destruction and attack the white settlement all seem to require that this subject should be act upon without delay and the war department authorize to place that country in a state of complete defense against any assault from the numerous and warlike tribe which be congregate on that border it afford I sincere pleasure to be able to apprise you of the entire removal of the cherokee nation of indian to they new home west of the mississippus the measure authorize by congress at its last session with a view to the long-standing controversy with they have have the happiest effect by a agreement conclude with they by the commanding general in that country who have perform the duty assign to he on the occasion with commendable energy and humanity they removal have be principally under the conduct of they own chief and they have emigrate without any apparent reluctance the successful accomplishment of this important object the removal also of the entire creek nation with the exception of a small number of fugitive amongst the seminole in florida the progress already make toward a speedy completion of the removal of the chickasaw the choctaw the pottawatamy the ottawa and the chippewa with the extensive purchase of indian land during the present year have render the speedy and successful result of the long-established policy of the government upon the subject of indian affair entirely certain the occasion be therefore deem a proper one to place this policy in such a point of view as will exonerate the government of the united state from the undeserved reproach which have be cast upon it through several successive administration that a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red man be incompatible with the safety or happiness of either be a position in respect to which there have long since cease to be room for a difference of opinion reason and experience have alike demonstrate its impracticability the bitter fruit of every attempt heretofore to overcome the barrier interpose by nature have only be destruction both physical and moral to the indian dangerous conflict of authority between the federal and state government and detriment to the individual prosperity of the citizen as well as to the general improvement of the country the remedial policy the principle of which be settle more than thirty year ago under the administration of mr jefferson consist in a extinction for a fair consideration of the title to all the land still occupy by the indian within the state and territory of the united state they removal to a country west of the mississippus much more extensive and better adapt to they condition than that on which they then reside the guarantee to they by the united state of they exclusive possession of that country forever exempt from all intrusion by white man with ample provision for they security against external violence and internal dissension and the extension to they of suitable facility for they advancement in civilization this have not be the policy of particular administration only but of each in succession since the first attempt to carry it out under that of mr monroe all have labor for its accomplishment only with different degree of success the manner of its execution have it be true from time to time give rise to conflict of opinion and unjust imputation but in respect to the wisdom and necessity of the policy itself there have not from the beginning exist a doubt in the mind of any calm judicious disinterested friend of the indian race accustom to reflection and enlighten by experience occupy the double character of contractor on its own account and guardian for the party contract with it be hardly to be expect that the dealings of the federal government with the indian tribe would escape misrepresentation that there occur in the early settlement of this country as in all other where the civilized race have succeed to the possession of the savage instance of oppression and fraud on the part of the former there be too much reason to believe no such offens can however be justly charge upon this government since it become free to pursue its own course its dealings with the indian tribe have be just and friendly throughout its effort for they civilization constant and direct by the best feeling of humanity its watchfulness in protect they from individual fraud unremitt its forbearance under the keenest provocation the deepest injury and the most flagrant outrage may challenge at least a comparison with any nation ancient or modern in similar circumstance and if in future time a powerful civilized and happy nation of indian shall be find to exist within the limit of this northern continent it will be owe to the consummation of that policy which have be so unjustly assail only a very brief reference to fact in confirmation of this assertion can in this form be give and you be therefore necessarily refer to the report of the secretary of war for further detail to the cherokee whose case have perhaps excite the greatest share of attention and sympathy the united state have grant in fee with a perpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession 13554135 acre of land on the west side of the mississippus eligibly situate in a healthy climate and in all respects better suit to they condition than the country they have leave in exchange for only 9492160 acre on the east side of the same river the united state have in addition stipulate to pay they $ 5600000 for they interest in and improvement on the land thus relinquish and $ 1160000 for subsistence and other beneficial purpose thereby put it in they power to become one of the most wealthy and independent separate community of the same extent in the world by the treaty make and ratify with the miamy the chippewa the sioux the sac and fox and the winnebago during the last year the indian title to 18458000 acre have be extinguish these purchase have be much more extensive than those of any previous year and have with other indian expense bear very heavily upon the treasury they leave however but a small quantity of unbought indian land within the state and territory and the legislature and executive be equally sensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of indian title within those limit the treaty which be with a single exception make in pursuance of previous appropriation for defray the expense have subsequently be ratify by the senate and receive the sanction of congress by the appropriation necessary to carry they into effect of the term upon which these important negotiation be conclude i can speak from direct knowledge and i feel no difficulty in affirm that the interest of the indian in the extensive territory embrace by they be to be pay for at its fair value and that no more favorable term have be grant to the united state than would have be reasonably expect in a negotiation with civilized man fully capable of appreciate and protect they own rights for the indian title to 116349897 acre acquire since the 4th of march 1829 the united state have pay $ 72560056 in permanent annuity land reservation for indian expense of removal and subsistence merchandise mechanical and agricultural establishment and implement when the heavy expense incur by the united state and the circumstance that so large a portion of the entire territory will be forever unsalable be consider and this price be compare with that for which the united state sell they own land no one can doubt that justice have be do to the indian in these purchase also certain it be that the transaction of the federal government with the indian have be uniformly characterize by a sincere and paramount desire to promote they welfare and it must be a source of the highest gratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn that notwithstanding the obstruction from time to time throw in its way and the difficulty which have arise from the peculiar and impracticable nature of the indian character the wise humane and undeviating policy of the government in this the most difficult of all we relation foreign or domestic have at length be justified to the world in its near approach to a happy and certain consummation the condition of the tribe which occupy the country set apart for they in the west be highly prosperous and encourage the hope of they early civilization they have for the most part abandon the hunter state and turn they attention to agricultural pursuit all those who have be establish for any length of time in that fertile region maintain themselves by they own industry there be among they trader of no inconsiderable capital and planter export cotton to some extent but the greater number be small agriculturist live in comfort upon the produce of they farm the recent emigrant although they have in some instance remove reluctantly have readily acquiesce in they unavoidable destiny they have find at once a recompense for past suffering and a incentive to industrious habit in the abundance and comfort around they there be reason to believe that all these tribe be friendly in they feeling toward the united state and it be to be hope that the acquisition of individual wealth the pursuit of agriculture and habit of industry will gradually subdue they warlike propensity and incline they to maintain peace among themselves to effect this desirable object the attention of congress be solicit to the measure recommend by the secretary of war for they future government and protection as well from each other as from the hostility of the warlike tribe around they and the intrusion of the whites the policy of the government have give they a permanent home and guarantee to they its peaceful and undisturbed possession it only remain to give they a government and law which will encourage industry and secure to they the reward of they exertion the importance of some form of government can not be too much insist upon the earliest effect will be to diminish the cause and occasion for hostility among the tribe to inspire a interest in the observance of law to which they will have themselves assent and to multiply the security of property and the motive for self-improvement intimately connect with this subject be the establishment of the military defens recommend by the secretary of war which have be already refer to without they the government will be powerless to redeem its pledge of protection to the emigrate indian against the numerous warlike tribe that surround they and to provide for the safety of the frontier settler of the border state the case of the seminole constitute at present the only exception to the successful effort of the government to remove the indian to the home assign they west of the mississippus four hundred of this tribe emigrate in 1836 and 1500 in 1837 and 1838 leave in the country it be suppose about 2000 indian the continued treacherous conduct of these people the savage and unprovoked murder they have lately commit butcher whole family of the settler of the territory without distinction of age or sex and make they way into the very center and heart of the country so that no part of it be free from they ravages they frequent attack on the light-house along that dangerous coast and the barbarity with which they have murder the passenger and crew of such vessel as have be wreck upon the reef and key which border the gulf leave the government no alternative but to continue the military operation against they until they be totally expel from florida there be other motive which would urge the government to pursue this course toward the seminole the united state have fulfil in good faith all they treaty stipulation with the indian tribe and have in every other instance insist upon a like performance of they obligation to relax from this salutary rule because the seminole have maintain themselves so long in the territory they have relinquish and in defiance of they frequent and solemn engagement still continue to wage a ruthless war against the united state would not only evince a want of constancy on we part but be of evil example in we intercourse with other tribe experience have show that but little be to be gain by the march of army through a country so intersect with inaccessible swamp and marsh and which from the fatal character of the climate must be abandon at the end of the winter i recommend therefore to you attention the plan submit by the secretary of war in the accompany report for the permanent occupation of the portion of the territory free from the indian and the more efficient protection of the people of florida from they inhuman warfare from the report of the secretary of the navy herewith transmit it will appear that a large portion of the disposable naval force be either actively employ or in a state of preparation for the purpose of experience and discipline and the protection of we commerce so effectual have be this protection that so far as the information of government extend not a single outrage have be attempt on a vessel carry the flag of the united state within the present year in any quarter however distant or expose the explore expedition sail from norfolk on the 19th of August last and information have be receive of its safe arrival at the island of madeira the best spirit animate the officer and crew and there be every reason to anticipate from its effort result beneficial to commerce and honorable to the nation it will also be see that no reduction of the force now in commission be contemplate the unsettled state of a portion of south america render it indispensable that we commerce should receive protection in that quarter the vast and increase interest embark in the trade of the indian and china sea in the whale fishery of the pacific ocean and in the gulf of mexico require equal attention to they safety and a small squadron may be employ to great advantage on we atlantic coast in meeting sudden demand for the reenforcement of other station in aid merchant vessel in distress in afford active service to a additional number of officer and in visit the different port of the united state a accurate knowledge of which be obviously of the highest importance the attention of congress be respectfully call to that portion of the report recommend a increase in the number of smaller vessel and to other suggestion contain in that document the rapid increase and wide expansion of we commerce which be every day seek new avenue of profitable adventure the absolute necessity of a naval force for its protection precisely in the degree of its extension a due regard to the national rights and honor the recollection of its former exploit and the anticipation of its future triumph whenever opportunity present itself which we may rightfully indulge from the experience of the past -- all seem to point to the navy as a most efficient arm of we national defense and a proper object of legislative encouragement the progress and condition of the post-office department will be see by reference to the report of the postmaster-general the extent of post-roads cover by mail contract be state to be 134818 mile and the annual transportation upon they 34580202 mile the number of post-office in the united state be 12553 and rapidly increase the gross revenue for the year end on the 30th day of June last be $ 4262145 the accrue expenditure $ 4680068 excess of expenditure $ 417923 this have be make up out of the surplus previously on hand the cash on hand on the 1st instant be $ 314068 the revenue for the year end June 30 1838 be $ 161540 more than that for the year end June 30 1837 the expenditure of the department have be graduate upon the anticipation of a largely increase revenue a moderate curtailment of mail service consequently become necessary and have be effect to shield the department against the danger of embarrassment its revenue be now improve and it will soon resume its onward course in the march of improvement you particular attention be request to so much of the postmaster-general 's report as relate to the transportation of the mail upon railroad the law on that subject do not seem adequate to secure that service now become almost essential to the public interest and at the same time protect the department from combination and unreasonable demand nor can i too earnestly request you attention to the necessity of provide a more secure building for this department the danger of destruction to which its important book and papers be continually expose as well from the highly combustible character of the building occupy as from that of other in the vicinity call loudly for prompt action you attention be again earnestly invite to the suggestion and recommendation submit at the last session in respect to the district of columbium i feel it my duty also to bring to you notice certain proceedings at law which have recently be prosecute in this district in the name of the united state on the relation of messr stockton & stoke of the state of maryland against the postmaster-general and which have result in the payment of money out of the national treasury for the first time since the establishment of the government by judicial compulsion exercise by the common-law writ of mandamus issue by the circuit court of this district the fact of the case and the grounds of the proceedings will be find fully state in the report of the decision and any additional information which you may desire will be supply by the proper department no interference in the particular case be contemplate the money have be pay the claim of the prosecutor have be satisfied and the whole subject so far as they be concerned be finally dispose of but it be on the supposition that the case may be regard as a authoritative exposition of the law as it now stand that i have think it necessary to present it to you consideration the object of the application to the circuit court be to compel the postmaster-general to carry into effect a award make by the solicitor of the treasury under a special act of congress for the settlement of certain claim of the relator on the post-office department which award the postmaster-general decline to execute in full until he should receive further legislative direction on the subject if the duty impose on the postmaster-general by that law be to be regard as one of a official nature belong to he office as a branch of the executive then it be obvious that the constitutional competency of the judiciary to direct and control he in its discharge be necessarily draw in question and if the duty so impose on the postmaster-general be to be consider as merely ministerial and not executive it yet remain to be show that the circuit court of this district have authority to interfere by mandamus such a power have never before be assert or claim by that court with a view to the settlement of these important question the judgment of the circuit court be carry by a writ of error to the supreme court of the united state in the opinion of that tribunal the duty impose on the postmaster-general be not a official executive duty but one of a merely ministerial nature the grave constitutional question which have be discuss be therefore exclude from the decision of the case the court indeed expressly admit that with power and duty properly belong to the executive no other department can interfere by the writ of mandamus and the question therefore resolve itself into this : have congress confer upon the circuit court of this district the power to issue such a writ to a officer of the general government command he to perform a ministerial act a majority of the court have decide that it have but have found they decision upon a process of reasoning which in my judgment render further legislative provision indispensable to the public interest and the equal administration of justice it have long since be decide by the supreme court that neither that tribunal nor the circuit court of the united state hold within the respective state possess the power in question but it be now hold that this power deny to both of these high tribunal -lrb- to the former by the constitution and to the latter by congress -rrb- have be by its legislation vest in the circuit court of this district no such direct grant of power to the circuit court of this district be claim but it have be hold to result by necessary implication from several section of the law establish the court one of these section declare that the law of maryland as they exist at the time of the cession should be in force in that part of the district cede by that state and by this provision the common law in civil and criminal case as it prevail in maryland in 1801 be establish in that part of the district in england the court of king 's bench -- because the sovereign who accord to the theory of the constitution be the fountain of justice originally sit there in person and be still deem to be present in construction of law -- alone possess the high power of issue the writ of mandamus not only to inferior jurisdiction and corporation but also to magistrate and other command they in the king 's name to do what they duty require in case where there be a vested right and no other specific remedy it have be hold in the case refer to that as the supreme court of the united state be by the constitution render incompetent to exercise this power and as the circuit court of this district be a court of general jurisdiction in case at common law and the highest court of original jurisdiction in the district the right to issue the writ of mandamus be incident to its common-law power another ground rely upon to maintain the power in question be that it be include by fair construction in the power grant to the circuit court of the united state by the act to provide for the more convenient organization of the court of the united state pass 13th February 1801 that the act establish the circuit court of this district pass the 27th day of February 1801 confer upon that court and the judge thereof the same power as be by law vest in the circuit court of the united state and in the judge of the say court that the repeal of the first-mentioned act which take place in the next year do not divest the circuit court of this district of the authority in dispute but leave it still clothe with the power over the subject which it be concede be take away from the circuit court of the united state by the repeal of the act of 13th February 1801 admit that the adoption of the law of maryland for a portion of this district confer on the circuit court thereof in that portion the transcendent extrajudicial prerogative power of the court of king 's bench in england or that either of the act of congress by necessary implication authorize the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to a officer of the united state to compel he to perform a ministerial duty the consequence be in one respect the same the result in either case be that the officer of the united state station in different part of the united state be in respect to the performance of they official duty subject to different law and a different supervision -- those in the state to one rule and those in the district of columbium to another and a very different one in the district they official conduct be subject to a judicial control from which in the state they be exempt whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vest such a power in the judiciary in a system of government constitute like that of the united state all must agree that these disparage discrepancy in the law and in the administration of justice ought not to be permit to continue and as congress alone can provide the remedy the subject be unavoidably present to you consideration m van buren special message washington

of that state and a copy of the reply of the secretary of state make by my direction together with a note from h fox esq envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of great britain with the answer of the secretary of state to the same it will appear from those document that a numerous band of lawless and desperate man chiefly from the adjoining british province but without the authority or sanction of the provincial government have trespass upon that portion of the territory in dispute between the united state and great britain which be water by the river aroostook and claim to belong to the state of maine and that they have commit extensive depredation there by cut and destroy a very large quantity of timber it will further appear that the governor of maine have be officially apprise of the circumstance have communicate it to the legislature with a recommendation of such provision in addition to those already exist by law as would enable he to arrest the course of say depredation disperse the trespasser and secure the timber which they be about carry away that in compliance with a resolve of the legislature pass in pursuance of he recommendation he excellency have dispatch the land agent of the state with a force deem adequate to that purpose to the scene of the alleged depredation who after accomplish a part of he duty be seize by a band of the trespasser at a house claim to be within the jurisdiction of maine whither he have repair for the purpose of meeting and consulting with the land agent of the province of new brunswick and convey as a prisoner to frederickton in that province together with two other citizen of the state who be assist he in the discharge of he duty it will also appear that the governor and legislature of maine satisfied that the trespasser have act in defiance of the law of both country learn that they be in possession of arm and anticipate -lrb- correctly as the result have prove -rrb- that person of they reckless and desperate character would set at naught the authority of the magistrate without the aid of a strong force have authorize the sheriff and the officer appoint in the place of the land agent to employ at the expense of the state a armed posse who have proceed to the scene of these depredation with a view to the entire dispersion or arrest of the trespasser and the protection of the public property in the correspondence between the governor of maine and sir john harvey lieutenant-governor of the province of new brunswick which have grow out of these occurrence and be likewise herewith communicate the former be request to recall the armed party advance into the dispute territory for the arrest of trespasser and be inform that a strong body of british troops be to be hold in readiness to support and protect the authority and subject of great britain in say territory in answer to that request the provincial governor be inform of the determination of the state of maine to support the land agent and he party in the performance of they duty and the same determination for the execution of which provision be make by a resolve of the state legislature be communicate by the governor to the general government the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick in call upon the governor of maine for the recall of the land agent and he party from the dispute territory and the british minister in make a similar demand upon the government of the united state proceed upon the assumption that a agreement exist between the two nation concede to great britain until the final settlement of the boundary question exclusive possession of and jurisdiction over the territory in dispute the important bearing which such a agreement if it exist would have upon the condition and interest of the party and the influence it might have upon the adjustment of the dispute be too obvious to allow the error upon which this assumption seem to rest to pass for a moment without correction the answer of the secretary of state to mr fox 's note will show the ground take by the government of the united state upon this point it be believe that all the correspondence which have pass between the two government upon this subject have already be communicate to congress and be now on they file a abstract of it however hastily prepared accompany this communication it be possible that in thus abridge a voluminous correspondence commence in 1825 and continue to a very recent period a portion may have be accidentally overlook but it be believe that nothing have take place which would materially change the aspect of the question as therein present instead of sustain the assumption of the british functionary that correspondence disprove the existence of any such agreement it show that the two government have differ not only in regard to the main question of title to the territory in dispute but with reference also to the right of jurisdiction and the fact of the actual exercise of it in different portion thereof always aim at a amicable adjustment of the dispute both party have entertain and repeatedly urge upon each other a desire that each should exercise its rights whatever it consider they to be in such a manner as to avoid collision and allay to the greatest practicable extent the excitement likely to grow out of the controversy it be in pursuance of such a understanding that maine and massachusett upon the remonstrance of great britain desist from make sale of land and the general government from the construction of a project military road in a portion of the territory of which they claim to have enjoy the exclusive possession and that great britain on she part in deference to a similar remonstrance from the united state suspend the issue of licens to cut timber in the territory in controversy and also the survey and location of a railroad through a section of country over which she also claim to have exercise exclusive jurisdiction the state of maine have a right to arrest the depredation complain of it belong to she to judge of the exigency of the occasion call for she interference and it be presume that have the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick be correctly advise of the nature of the proceedings of the state of maine he would not have regard the transaction as require on he part any resort to force each party claim a right to the territory and hence to the exclusive jurisdiction over it it be manifest that to prevent the destruction of the timber by trespasser act against the authority of both and at the same time avoid forcible collision between the contiguous government during the pendency of negotiation concern the title resort must be have to the mutual exercise of jurisdiction in such extreme case or to a amicable and temporary arrangement as to the limit within which it should be exercise by each party the understanding suppose to exist between the united state and great britain have be find heretofore sufficient for that purpose and i believe will prove so hereafter if the party on the frontier directly interested in the question be respectively govern by a just spirit of conciliation and forbearance if it shall be find as there be now reason to apprehend that there be in the mode of construe that understanding by the two government a difference not to be reconcile i shall not hesitate to propose to she britannic majesty 's government a distinct arrangement for the temporary and mutual exercise of jurisdiction by means of which similar difficulty may in future be prevent but between a effort on the part of maine to preserve the property in dispute from destruction by intruder and a military occupation by that state of the territory with a view to hold it by force while the settlement be a subject of negotiation between the two government there be a essential difference as well in respect to the position of the state as to the duty of the general government in a letter address by the secretary of state to the governor of maine on the 1st of march last give a detailed statement of the step which have be take by the federal government to bring the controversy to a termination and design to apprise the governor of that state of the view of the federal executive in respect to the future it be state that while the obligation of the federal government to do all in its power to effect the settlement of the boundary question be fully recognize it have in the event of be unable to do so specifically by mutual consent no other means to accomplish that object amicably than by another arbitration or by a commission with a umpire in the nature of a arbitration and that in the event of all other measure fail the president would feel it he duty to submit another proposition to the government of great britain to refer the decision of the question to a third power these be still my view upon the subject and until this step shall have be take i can not think it proper to invoke the attention of congress to other than amicable means for the settlement of the controversy or to cause the military power of the federal government to be bring in aid of the state of maine in any attempt to effect that object by a resort to force on the other hand if the authority of new brunswick should attempt to enforce the claim of exclusive jurisdiction set up by they by means of a military occupation on they part of the dispute territory i shall feel myself bind to consider the contingency provide by the constitution as have occur on the happen of which a state have the right to call for the aid of the federal government to repel invasion i have express to the british minister near this government a confident expectation that the agent of the state of maine who have be arrest under a obvious misapprehension of the object of they mission will be promptly release and to the governor of maine that a similar course will be pursue in regard to the agent of the province of new brunswick i have also recommend that any militia that may have be bring together by the state of maine from a apprehension of a collision with the government or people of the british province will be voluntarily and peaceably disband i can not allow myself to doubt that the result anticipate from these representation will be seasonably realize the party more immediately interested can not but perceive that a appeal to arm under exist circumstance will not only prove fatal to they present interest but would postpone if not defeat the attainment of the main object which they have in view the very incident which have recently occur will necessarily awaken the government to the importance of promptly adjust a dispute by which it be now make manifest that the peace of the two nation be daily and imminently endanger this expectation be further warrant by the general forbearance which have hitherto characterize the conduct of the government and people on both side of the line in the uniform patriotism of maine she attachment to the union she respect for the wish of the people of she sister state -lrb- of whose interest in she welfare she can not be unconscious -rrb- and in the solicitude feel by the country at large for the preservation of peace with we neighbor we have a strong guaranty that she will not disregard the request that have be make of she as however the session of congress be about to terminate and the agency of the executive may become necessary during the recess it be important that the attention of the legislature should be draw to the consideration of such measure as may be calculate to obviate the necessity of a call for a extra session with that view i have think it my duty to lay the whole matter before you and to invite such action thereon as you may think the occasion require m van buren washington dc _ February 27 1839 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i

representative _ : i regret that i can not on this occasion congratulate you that the past year have be one of unalloyed prosperity the ravages of fire and disease have painfully afflict otherwise flourish portion of we country and serious embarrassment yet derange the trade of many of we city but notwithstanding these adverse circumstance that general prosperity which have be heretofore so bountifully bestow upon we by the author of all good still continue to call for we warmest gratitude especially have we reason to rejoice in the exuberant harvest which have lavishly recompense well-directed industry and give to it that sure reward which be vainly seek in visionary speculation i can not indeed view without peculiar satisfaction the evidence afford by the past season of the benefit that spring from the steady devotion of the husbandman to he honorable pursuit no means of individual comfort be more certain and no source of national prosperity be so sure nothing can compensate a people for a dependence upon other for the bread they eat and that cheerful abundance on which the happiness of everyone so much depend be to be look for nowhere with such sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the bounty of the earth with foreign country we relation exhibit the same favorable aspect which be present in my last annual message and afford continued proof of the wisdom of the pacific just and forbear policy adopt by the first administration of the federal government and pursue by its successor the extraordinary power vest in I by a act of congress for the defense of the country in a emergency consider so far probable as to require that the executive should possess ample means to meet it have not be exert they have therefore be attend with no other result than to increase by the confidence thus repose in I my obligation to maintain with religious exactness the cardinal principle that govern we intercourse with other nation happily in we pend question with great britain out of which this unusual grant of authority arise nothing have occur to require its exertion and as it be about to return to the legislature i trust that no future necessity may call for its exercise by they or its delegation to another department of the government for the settlement of we northeastern boundary the proposition promise by great britain for a commission of exploration and survey have be receive and a counter project include also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of the limit in dispute be now before the british government for its consideration a just regard to the delicate state of this question and a proper respect for the natural impatience of the state of maine not less than a conviction that the negotiation have be already protracted longer than be prudent on the part of either government have lead I to believe that the present favorable moment should on no account be suffer to pass without put the question forever at rest i feel confident that the government of she britannic majesty will take the same view of this subject as i be persuade it be govern by desire equally strong and sincere for the amicable termination of the controversy to the intrinsic difficulty of question of boundary line especially those describe in region unoccupied and but partially know be to be add in we country the embarrassment necessarily arise out of we constitution by which the general government be make the organ of negotiate and decide upon the particular interest of the state on whose frontier these line be to be trace to avoid another controversy in which a state government might rightfully claim to have she wish consult previously to the conclusion of conventional arrangement concern she rights of jurisdiction or territory i have think it necessary to call the attention of the government of great britain to another portion of we conterminous dominion of which the division still remain to be adjust i refer to the line from the entrance of lake superior to the most northwestern point of the lake of the wood stipulation for the settlement of which be to be find in the seventh article of the treaty of ghent the commissioner appoint under that article by the two government have differ in they opinion make separate report accord to its stipulation upon the point of disagreement and these difference be now to be submit to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or state the dispute point should be settle and the line designate before the territorial government of which it be one of the boundary take its place in the union as a state and i rely upon the cordial cooperation of the british government to effect that object there be every reason to believe that disturbance like those which lately agitate the neighbor british province will not again prove the source of border contention or interpose obstacle to the continuance of that good understanding which it be the mutual interest of great britain and the united state to preserve and maintain within the province themselves tranquillity be restore and on we frontier that misguided sympathy in favor of what be presume to be a general effort in behalf of popular rights and which in some instance mislead a few of we more inexperienced citizen have subside into a rational conviction strongly oppose to all intermeddle with the internal affair of we neighbor the people of the united state feel as it be hope they always will a warm solicitude for the success of all who be sincerely endeavor to improve the political condition of mankind this generous feeling they cherish toward the most distant nation and it be natural therefore that it should be awaken with more than common warmth in behalf of they immediate neighbor but it do not belong to they character as a community to seek the gratification of those feeling in act which violate they duty as citizen endanger the peace of they country and tend to bring upon it the stain of a violate faith toward foreign nation if zealous to confer benefit on other they appear for a moment to lose sight of the permanent obligation impose upon they as citizen they be seldom long mislead from all the information i receive confirm to some extent by personal observation i be satisfied that no one can now hope to engage in such enterprise without encounter public indignation in addition to the severest penalty of the law recent information also lead I to hope that the emigrant from she majesty 's province who have seek refuge within we boundary be dispose to become peaceable resident and to abstain from all attempt to endanger the peace of that country which have afford they a asylum on a review of the occurrence on both side of the line it be satisfactory to reflect that in almost every complaint against we country the offense may be trace to emigrant from the province who have seek refuge here in the few instance in which they be aid by citizen of the united state the act of these misguided man be not only in direct contravention of the law and well-known wish of they own government but meet with the decide disapprobation of the people of the united state i regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among she majesty 's subject in the canada the sentiment of hostility to we people and institution which have be so frequently express there and the disregard of we rights which have be manifest on some occasion have i be sorry to say be applaud and encourage by the people and even by some of the subordinate local authority of the province the chief officer in canada fortunately have not entertain the same feeling and have probably prevent excess that must have be fatal to the peace of the two country i look forward anxiously to a period when all the transaction which have grow out of this condition of we affair and which have be make the subject of complaint and remonstrance by the two government respectively shall be fully examine and the proper satisfaction give where it be due from either side nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of we intercourse with austrium belgium denmark france naple portugal prussium russium or sweden the internal state of spain have sensibly improve and a well-grounded hope exist that the return of peace will restore to the people of that country they former prosperity and enable the government to fulfill all its obligation at home and abroad the government of portugal i have the satisfaction to state have pay in full the eleventh and last installment due to we citizen for the claim embrace in the settlement make with it on the 3d of march 1837 i lay before you treaty of commerce negotiate with the king of sardinium and of the netherland the ratification of which have be exchange since the adjournment of congress the liberal principle of these treaty will recommend they to you approbation that with sardinium be the first treaty of commerce form by that kingdom and it will i trust answer the expectation of the present sovereign by aid the development of the resource of he country and stimulate the enterprise of he people that with the netherland happily terminate a long-existing subject of dispute and remove from we future commercial intercourse all apprehension of embarrassment the king of the netherland have also in further illustration of he character for justice and of he desire to remove every cause of dissatisfaction make compensation for a american vessel capture in 1800 by a french privateer and carry into curaoa where the proceeds be appropriate to the use of the colony then and for a short time after under the dominion of holland the death of the late sultan have produce no alteration in we relation with turkey we newly appoint minister resident have reach constantinople and i have receive assurance from the present ruler that the obligation of we treaty and those of friendship will be fulfil by himself in the same spirit that actuate he illustrious father i regret to be oblige to inform you that no convention for the settlement of the claim of we citizen upon mexico have yet be ratify by the government of that country the first convention form for that purpose be not present by the president of mexico for the approbation of its congress from a belief that the king of prussium the arbitrator in case of disagreement in the joint commission to be appoint by the united state and mexico would not consent to take upon himself that friendly office although not entirely satisfy with the course pursue by mexico i feel no hesitation in receive in the most conciliatory spirit the explanation offer and also cheerfully consent to a new convention in order to arrange the payment propose to be make to we citizen in a manner which while equally just to they be deem less onerous and inconvenient to the mexican government rely confidently upon the intention of that government mr elli be direct to repair to mexico and diplomatic intercourse have be resume between the two country the new convention have he inform we be recently submit by the president of that republic to its congress under circumstance which promise a speedy ratification a result which i can not allow myself to doubt instruction have be give to the commissioner of the united state under we convention with texa for the demarcation of the line which separate we from that republic the commissioner of both government meet in new orlean in August last the joint commission be organize and adjourn to convene at the same place on the 12th of October it be presume to be now in the performance of its duty the new government of texa have show its desire to cultivate friendly relation with we by a prompt reparation for injury complain of in the case of two vessel of the united state with central america a convention have be conclude for the renewal of its former treaty with the united state this be not ratify before the departure of we late charg d'affaire from that country and the copy of it bring by he be not receive before the adjournment of the senate at the last session in the meanwhile the period limit for the exchange of ratification have expire i deem it expedient in consequence of the death of the charg d'affaire to send a special agent to central america to close the affair of we mission there and to arrange with the government a extension of the time for the exchange of ratification the commission create by the state which formerly compose the republic of colombium for adjust the claim against that government have by a very unexpected construction of the treaty under which it act decide that no provision be make for those claim of citizen of the united state which arise from capture by colombian privateer and be adjudge against the claimant in the judicial tribunal this decision will compel the united state to apply to the several government formerly unite for redress with all these -- new granada venezuelum and ecuador -- a perfectly good understanding exist we treaty with venezuelum be faithfully carry into execution and that country in the enjoyment of tranquillity be gradually advance in prosperity under the guidance of its present distinguished president general paez with ecuador a liberal commercial convention have lately be conclude which will be transmit to the senate at a early day with the great american empire of brazil we relation continue unchanged as do we friendly intercourse with the other government of south america -- the argentine republic and the republic of uruguay chili peru and bolivium the dissolution of the peru-bolivian confederation may occasion some temporary inconvenience to we citizen in that quarter but the obligation on the new government which have arise out of that confederation to observe its treaty stipulation will no doubt be soon understand and it be presume that no indisposition will exist to fulfill those which it contract with the united state the financial operation of the government during the present year have i be happy to say be very successful the difficulty under which the treasury department have labor from know defect in the exist law relative to the safe-keeping of the public money aggravate by the suspension of specie payment by several of the bank hold public deposit or indebted to public officer for note receive in payment of public due have be surmount to a very gratifying extent the large current expenditure have be punctually meet and the faith of the government in all its pecuniary concern have be scrupulously maintain the nineteen million of treasury note authorize by the act of congress of 1837 and the modification thereof with a view to the indulgence of merchant on they duty bond and of the deposit bank in the payment of public money hold by they have be so punctually redeem as to leave less than the original ten million outstanding at any one time and the whole amount unredeemed now fall short of three million of these the chief portion be not due till next year and the whole would have be already extinguish could the treasury have realize the payment due to it from the bank if those due from they during the next year shall be punctually make and if congress shall keep the appropriation within the estimate there be every reason to believe that all the outstanding treasury note can be redeem and the ordinary expense defray without impose on the people any additional burden either of loan or increase tax to avoid this and to keep the expenditure within reasonable bound be a duty second only in importance to the preservation of we national character and the protection of we citizen in they civil and political rights the creation in time of peace of a debt likely to become permanent be a evil for which there be no equivalent the rapidity with which many of the state be apparently approach to this condition admonish we of we own duty in a manner too impressive to be disregard one not the least important be to keep the federal government always in a condition to discharge with ease and vigor its highest function should they exercise be require by any sudden conjuncture of public affair -- a condition to which we be always expose and which may occur when it be least expect to this end it be indispensable that its finances should be untrammeled and its resource as far as practicable unencumbered no circumstance could present greater obstacle to the accomplishment of these vitally important object than the creation of a onerous national debt we own experience and also that of other nation have demonstrate the unavoidable and fearful rapidity with which a public debt be increase when the government have once surrender itself to the ruinous practice of supply its suppose necessity by new loan the struggle therefore on we part to be successful must be make at the threshold to make we effort effective severe economy be necessary this be the surest provision for the national welfare and it be at the same time the best preservative of the principle on which we institution rest simplicity and economy in the affair of state have never fail to chasten and invigorate republican principle while these have be as surely subvert by national prodigality under whatever specious pretext it may have be introduce or foster these consideration can not be lose upon a people who have never be inattentive to the effect of they policy upon the institution they have create for themselves but at the present moment they force be augment by the necessity which a decrease revenue must impose the check lately give to importation of article subject to duty the derangement in the operation of internal trade and especially the reduction gradually take place in we tariff of duty all tend materially to lessen we receipt indeed it be probable that the diminution result from the last cause alone will not fall short of $ 5000000 in the year 1842 as the final reduction of all duty to 20 per cent then take effect the whole revenue then accrue from the custom and from the sale of public land if not more will undoubtedly be want to defray the necessary expense of the government under the most prudent administration of its affair these be circumstance that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require its prompt and constant exercise with the legislature rest the power and duty of so adjust the public expenditure as to promote this end by the provision of the constitution it be only in consequence of appropriation make by law that money can be draw from the treasury no instance have occur since the establishment of the government in which the executive though a component part of the legislative power have interpose a objection to a appropriation bill on the sole ground of its extravagance he duty in this respect have be consider fulfil by request such appropriation only as the public service may be reasonably expect to require in the present earnest direction of the public mind toward this subject both the executive and the legislature have evidence of the strict responsibility to which they will be hold and while i be conscious of my own anxious effort to perform with fidelity this portion of my public function it be a satisfaction to I to be able to count on a cordial cooperation from you at the time i enter upon my present duty we ordinary disbursement without include those on account of the public debt the post-office and the trust fund in charge of the government have be largely increase by appropriation for the removal of the indian for repel indian hostility and for other less urgent expense which grow out of a overflow treasury independent of the redemption of the public debt and trust the gross expenditure of seventeen and eighteen million in 1834 and 1835 have by these cause swell to twenty-nine million in 1836 and the appropriation for 1837 make previously to the 4th of march cause the expenditure to rise to the very large amount of thirty-three million we be enable during the year 1838 notwithstanding the continuance of we indian embarrassment somewhat to reduce this amount and that for the present year -lrb- 1839 -rrb- will not in all probability exceed twenty-six million or six million less than it be last year with a determination so far as depend on I to continue this reduction i have direct the estimate for 1840 to be subject to the severest scrutiny and to be limit to the absolute requirement of the public service they will be find less than the expenditure of 1839 by over $ 5000000 the precautionary measure which will be recommend by the secretary of the treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the fluctuation and contingency to which we receipt and expenditure be expose and especially in a commercial crisis like the present be commend to you early attention on a former occasion you attention be invite to various consideration in support of a preemption law in behalf of the settler on the public land and also of a law graduate the price for such land as have long be in the market unsold in consequence of they inferior quality the execution of the act which be pass on the first subject have be attend with the happiest consequence in quiet title and secure improvement to the industrious and it have also to a very gratifying extent be exempt from the fraud which be practice under previous preemption law it have at the same time as be anticipate contribute liberally during the present year to the receipt of the treasury the passage of a graduation law with the guard before recommend would also i be persuade add considerably to the revenue for several year and prove in other respects just and beneficial you early consideration of the subject be therefore once more earnestly request the present condition of the defens of we principal seaport and navy-yard as represent by the accompany report of the secretary of war call for the early and serious attention of congress and as connect itself intimately with this subject i can not recommend too strongly to you consideration the plan submit by that officer for the organization of the militia of the united state in conformity with the express wish of congress a attempt be make in the spring to terminate the florida war by negotiation it be to be regret that these humane intention should have be frustrated and that the effort to bring these unhappy difficulty to a satisfactory conclusion should have fail but after enter into solemn engagement with the commanding general the indian without any provocation recommence they act of treachery and murder the renewal of hostility in that territory render it necessary that i should recommend to you favorable consideration the plan which will be submit to you by the secretary of war in order to enable that department to conduct they to a successful issue have have a opportunity of personally inspect a portion of the troops during the last summer it give I pleasure to bear testimony to the success of the effort to improve they discipline by keep they together in as large body as the nature of we service will permit i recommend therefore that commodious and permanent barracks be construct at the several post designate by the secretary of war notwithstanding the high state of they discipline and excellent police the evil result to the service from the deficiency of company officer be very apparent and i recommend that the staff officer be permanently separate from the line the navy have be usefully and honorably employ in protect the rights and property of we citizen wherever the condition of affair seem to require its presence with the exception of one instance where a outrage accompany by murder be commit on a vessel of the united state while engage in a lawful commerce nothing be know to have occur to impede or molest the enterprise of we citizen on that element where it be so signally display on learn this daring act of piracy commodore reed proceed immediately to the spot and receive no satisfaction either in the surrender of the murderer or the restoration of the plundered property inflict severe and merited chastisement on the barbarian it will be see by the report of the secretary of the navy respect the disposition of we ship of war that it have be deem necessary to station a competent force on the coast of africa to prevent a fraudulent use of we flag by foreigner recent experience have show that the provision in we exist law which relate to the sale and transfer of american vessel while abroad be extremely defective advantage have be take of these defect to give to vessel wholly belong to foreigner and navigate the ocean a apparent american ownership this character have be so well simulated as to afford they comparative security in prosecute the slave trade -- a traffic emphatically denounce in we statute regard with abhorrence by we citizen and of which the effectual suppression be nowhere more sincerely desire than in the united state these circumstance make it proper to recommend to you early attention a careful revision of these law so that without impede the freedom and facility of we navigation or impair a important branch of we industry connect with it the integrity and honor of we flag may be carefully preserve information derive from we consul at havana show the necessity of this be communicate to a committee of the senate near the close of the last session but too late as it appear to be act upon it will be bring to you notice by the proper department with additional communication from other source the latest account from the explore expedition represent it as proceed successfully in its object and promising result no less useful to trade and navigation than to science the extent of post-roads cover by mail service on the 1st of July last be about 133999 mile and the rate of annual transportation upon they 34496878 mile the number of post-office on that day be 12780 and on the 30th ultimo 13028 the revenue of the post-office department for the year end with the 30th of June last be $ 4476638 exhibit a increase over the preceding year of $ 241560 the engagement and liability of the department for the same period be $ 4624117 the excess of liability over the revenue for the last two year have be meet out of the surplus which have previously accumulate the cash on hand on the 30th ultimo be about $ 20670195 and the current income of the department vary very little from the rate of current expenditure most of the service suspend last year have be restore and most of the new route establish by the act of 7th July 1838 have be set in operation at a annual cost of $ 136963 notwithstanding the pecuniary difficulty of the country the revenue of the department appear to be increase and unless it shall be seriously check by the recent suspension of payment by so many of the bank it will be able not only to maintain the present mail service but in a short time to extend it it be gratify to witness the promptitude and fidelity with which the agent of this department in general perform they public duty some difficulty have arise in relation to contract for the transportation of the mail by railroad and steamboat company it appear that the maximum of compensation provide by congress for the transportation of the mail upon railroad be not sufficient to induce some of the company to convey they at such hour as be require for the accommodation of the public it be one of the most important duty of the general government to provide and maintain for the use of the people of the state the best practicable mail establishment to arrive at that end it be indispensable that the post-office department shall be enable to control the hour at which the mail shall be carry over railroad as it now do over all other road should serious inconvenience arise from the inadequacy of the compensation now provide by law or from unreasonable demand by any of the railroad company the subject be of such general importance as to require the prompt attention of congress in relation to steamboat line the most efficient remedy be obvious and have be suggest by the postmaster-general the war and navy department already employ steamboat in they service and although it be by no means desirable that the government should undertake the transportation of passenger or freight as a business there can be no reasonable objection to run boat temporarily whenever it may be necessary to put down attempt at extortion to be discontinue as soon as reasonable contract can be obtain the suggestion of the postmaster-general relative to the inadequacy of the legal allowance to witness in case of prosecution for mail depredation merit you serious consideration the safety of the mail require that such prosecution shall be efficient and justice to the citizen whose time be require to be give to the public demand not only that he expense shall be pay but that he shall receive a reasonable compensation the report from the war navy and post-office department will accompany this communication and one from the treasury department will be present to congress in a few day for various detail in respect to the matter in charge of these department i would refer you to those important document satisfy that you will find in they many valuable suggestion which will be find well deserving the attention of the legislature from a report make in December of last year by the secretary of state to the senate show the trial docket of each of the circuit court and the number of mile each judge have to travel in the performance of he duty a great inequality appear in the amount of labor assign to each judge the number of term to be hold in each of the court compose the ninth circuit the distance between the place at which they sit and from thence to the seat of government be represent to be such as to render it impossible for the judge of that circuit to perform in a manner correspond with the public exigency he term and circuit duty a revision therefore of the present arrangement of the circuit seem to be call for and be recommend to you notice i think it proper to call you attention to the power assume by territorial legislature to authorize the issue of bond by corporate company on the guaranty of the territory congress pass a law in 1836 provide that no act of a territorial legislature incorporate bank should have the force of law until approve by congress but act of a very exceptionable character previously pass by the legislature of florida be suffer to remain in force by virtue of which bond may be issue to a very large amount by those institution upon the faith of the territory a resolution intend to be a joint one pass the senate at the same session express the sense of congress that the law in question ought not to be permit to remain in force unless amend in many material respects but it fail in the house of representative for want of time and the desire amendment have not be make the interest involve be of great importance and the subject deserve you early and careful attention the continue agitation of the question relative to the best mode of keep and disburse the public money still injuriously affect the business of the country the suspension of specie payment in 1837 render the use of deposit bank as prescribe by the act of 1836 a source rather of embarrassment than aid and of necessity place the custody of most of the public money afterwards collect in charge of the public officer the new security for its safety which this require be a principal cause of my convene a extra session of congress but in consequence of a disagreement between the two house neither then nor at any subsequent period have there be any legislation on the subject the effort make at the last session to obtain the authority of congress to punish the use of public money for private purpose as a crime -- a measure attend under other government with signal advantage -- be also unsuccessful from diversity of opinion in that body notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless feel by it to afford every practicable security the result of this be still to leave the custody of the public money without those safeguard which have be for several year earnestly desire by the executive and as the remedy be only to be find in the action of the legislature it impose on I the duty of again submit to you the propriety of pass a law provide for the safe-keeping of the public money and especially to ask that its use for private purpose by any officer intrust with it may be declare to be a felony punishable with penalty proportion to the magnitude of the offense these circumstance add to know defect in the exist law and unusual derangement in the general operation of trade have during the last three year much increase the difficulty attendant on the collection keep and disbursement of the revenue and call forth corresponding exertion from those have they in charge happily these have be successful beyond expectation vast sum have be collect and disburse by the several department with unexpected cheapness and ease transfer have be readily make to every part of the union however distant and defalcation have be far less than might have be anticipate from the absence of adequate legal restraint since the officer of the treasury and post-office department be charge with the custody of most of the public money receive by they there have be collect $ 66000000 and exclude the case of the late collector at new york the aggregate amount of loss sustain in the collection can not it be believe exceed $ 60000 the defalcation of the late collector at that city of the extent and circumstance of which congress have be fully inform run through all the mode of keep the public money that have be hitherto in use and be distinguish by a aggravate disregard of duty that break through the restraint of every system and can not therefore be usefully refer to as a test of the comparative safety of either additional information will also be furnish by the report of the secretary of the treasury in reply to a call make upon that officer by the house of representative at the last session require detailed information on the subject of default by public officer or agent under each administration from 1789 to 1837 this document will be submit to you in a few day the general result -lrb- independent of the post-office which be keep separately and will be state by itself -rrb- so far as they bear upon this subject be that the loss which have be and be likely to be sustain by any class of agent have be the greatest by bank include as require in the resolution they depreciate paper receive for public due that the next largest have be by disburse officer and the least by collector and receiver if the loss on duty bond be include they alone will be threefold those by both collector and receiver we whole experience therefore furnish the strongest evidence that the desire legislation of congress be alone want to insure in those operation the highest degree of security and facility such also appear to have be the experience of other nation from the result of inquiry make by the secretary of the treasury in regard to the practice among they i be enable to state that in twenty-two out of twenty-seven foreign government from which undoubted information have be obtain the public money be keep in charge of public officer this concurrence of opinion in favor of that system be perhaps as great as exist on any question of internal administration in the mode of business and official restraint on disbursing officer no legal change be produce by the suspension of specie payment the report last refer to will be find to contain also much useful information in relation to this subject i have heretofore assign to congress my reason for believe that the establishment of a independent national treasury as contemplate by the constitution be necessary to the safe action of the federal government the suspension of specie payment in 1837 by the bank have the custody of the public money show in so alarming a degree we dependence on those institution for the performance of duty require by law that i then recommend the entire dissolution of that connection this recommendation have be subject as i desire it should be to severe scrutiny and animated discussion and i allow myself to believe that notwithstanding the natural diversity of opinion which may be anticipate on all subject involve such important consideration it have secure in its favor as general a concurrence of public sentiment as could be expect on one of such magnitude recent event have also continue to develop new objection to such a connection seldom be any bank under the exist system and practice able to meet on demand all its liability for deposit and note in circulation it maintain specie payment and transact a profitable business only by the confidence of the public in its solvency and whenever this be destroy the demand of its depositor and note holder press more rapidly than it can make collection from its debtor force it to stop payment this loss of confidence with its consequence occur in 1837 and afford the apology of the bank for they suspension the public then acquiesce in the validity of the excuse and while the state legislature do not exact from they they forfeit charter congress in accordance with the recommendation of the executive allow they time to pay over the public money they hold although compel to issue treasury note to supply the deficiency thus create it now appear that there be other motive than a want of public confidence under which the bank seek to justify themselves in a refusal to meet they obligation scarcely be the country and government relieved in a degree from the difficulty occasion by the general suspension of 1837 when a partial one occur within thirty month of the former produce new and serious embarrassment though it have no palliation in such circumstance as be allege in justification of that which have previously take place there be nothing in the condition of the country to endanger a well-managed banking institution commerce be derange by no foreign war every branch of manufacture industry be crown with rich reward and the more than usual abundance of we harvest after supply we domestic want have leave we granary and storehouse fill with a surplus for exportation it be in the midst of this that a irredeemable and depreciate paper currency be entail upon the people by a large portion of the bank they be not drive to it by the exhibition of a loss of public confidence or of a sudden pressure from they depositor or note holder but they excuse themselves by allege that the current of business and exchange with foreign country which draw the precious metal from they vault would require in order to meet it a larger curtailment of they loan to a comparatively small portion of the community than it will be convenient for they to bear or perhaps safe for the bank to exact the plea have cease to be one of necessity convenience and policy be now deem sufficient to warrant these institution in disregard they solemn obligation such conduct be not merely a injury to individual creditor but it be a wrong to the whole community from whose liberality they hold most valuable privilege whose rights they violate whose business they derange and the value of whose property they render unstable and insecure it must be evident that this new ground for bank suspension in reference to which they action be not only disconnect with but wholly independent of that of the public give a character to they suspension more alarming than any which they exhibit before and greatly increase the impropriety of rely on the bank in the transaction of the government a large and highly respectable portion of we banking institution be it afford I unfeigned pleasure to state exempt from all blame on account of this second delinquency they have to they great credit not only continue to meet they engagement but have even repudiate the grounds of suspension now resort to it be only by such a course that the confidence and good will of the community can be preserve and in the sequel the best interest of the institution themselves promote new danger to the bank be also daily disclose from the extension of that system of extravagant credit of which they be the pillar formerly we foreign commerce be principally found on a exchange of commodity include the precious metal and leave in its transaction but little foreign debt such be not now the case aid by the facility afford by the bank mere credit have become too commonly the basis of trade many of the bank themselves not content with largely stimulate this system among other have usurp the business while they impair the stability of the mercantile community they have become borrower instead of lender they establish they agency abroad they deal largely in stock and merchandise they encourage the issue of state security until the foreign market be glut with they and unsatisfied with the legitimate use of they own capital and the exercise of they lawful privilege they raise by large loan additional means for every variety of speculation the disaster attendant on this deviation from the former course of business in this country be now share alike by bank and individual to a extent of which there be perhaps no previous example in the annals of we country so long as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export of we production to meet any necessary partial payment leave the flow of credit undisturbed all appear to be prosperous but as soon as it be check by any hesitation abroad or by a inability to make payment there in we production the evil of the system be disclose the paper currency which might serve for domestic purpose be useless to pay the debt due in europe gold and silver be therefore draw in exchange for they note from the bank to keep up they supply of coin these institution be oblige to call upon they own debtor who pay they principally in they own note which be as unavailable to they as they be to the merchant to meet the foreign demand the call of the bank therefore in such emergency of necessity exceed that demand and produce a corresponding curtailment of they accommodation and of the currency at the very moment when the state of trade render it most inconvenient to be bear the intensity of this pressure on the community be in proportion to the previous liberality of credit and consequent expansion of the currency force sale of property be make at the time when the means of purchase be most reduce and the worst calamity to individual be only at last arrest by a open violation of they obligation by the bank -- a refusal to pay specie for they note and a imposition upon the community of a fluctuate and depreciate currency these consequence be inherent in the present system they be not influence by the bank be large or small create by national or state government they be the result of the irresistible law of trade or credit in the recent event which have so strikingly illustrate the certain effect of these law we have see the bank of the largest capital in the union establish under a national charter and lately strengthen as we be authoritatively inform by exchange that for a state charter with new and unusual privilege -- in a condition too as it be say of entire soundness and great prosperity -- not merely unable to resist these effect but the first to yield to they nor be it to be overlook that there exist a chain of necessary dependence among these institution which oblige they to a great extent to follow the course of other notwithstanding its injustice to they own immediate creditor or injury to the particular community in which they be place this dependence of a bank which be in proportion to the extent of its debt for circulation and deposit be not merely on other in its own vicinity but on all those which connect it with the center of trade distant bank may fail without seriously affect those in we principal commercial city but the failure of the latter be feel at the extremity of the union the suspension at new york in 1837 be everywhere with very few exception follow as soon as it be know that recently at philadelphium immediately affect the bank of the south and west in a similar manner this dependence of we whole banking system on the institution in a few large city be not find in the law of they organization but in those of trade and exchange the bank at that center to which currency flow and where it be require in payment for merchandise hold the power of control those in region whence it come while the latter possess no means of restrain they so that the value of individual property and the prosperity of trade through the whole interior of the country be make to depend on the good or bad management of the banking institution in the great seat of trade on the seaboard but this chain of dependence do not stop here it do not terminate at philadelphium or new york it reach across the ocean and end in london the center of the credit system the same law of trade which give to the bank in we principal city power over the whole banking system of the united state subject the former in they turn to the money power in great britain it be not deny that the suspension of the new york bank in 1837 which be follow in quick succession throughout the union be produce by a application of that power and it be now allege in extenuation of the present condition of so large a portion of we bank that they embarrassment have arise from the same cause from this influence they can not now entirely escape for it have its origin in the credit currency of the two country it be strengthen by the current of trade and exchange which center in london and be render almost irresistible by the large debt contract there by we merchant we bank and we state it be thus that a introduction of a new bank into the most distant of we village place the business of that village within the influence of the money power in england it be thus that every new debt which we contract in that country seriously affect we own currency and extend over the pursuit of we citizen its powerful influence we can not escape from this by make new bank great or small state or national the same chain which bind those now exist to the center of this system of paper credit must equally fetter every similar institution we create it be only by the extent to which this system have be push of late that we have be make fully aware of its irresistible tendency to subject we own bank and currency to a vast control power in a foreign land and it add a new argument to those which illustrate they precarious situation endanger in the first place by they own mismanagement and again by the conduct of every institution which connect they with the center of trade in we own country they be yet subject beyond all this to the effect of whatever measure policy necessity or caprice may induce those who control the credit of england to resort to i mean not to comment upon these measure present or past and much less to discourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the two country base on reciprocal benefit but it have now be make manifest that the power of inflict these and similar injury be by the resistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable of extend they consequence through all the ramification of we banking system and by that mean indirectly obtain particularly when we bank be use as depository of the public money a dangerous political influence in the united state i have deem it my duty to bring the subject to you notice and ask for it you serious consideration be a argument require beyond the exposition of these fact to show the impropriety of use we banking institution as depository of the public money can we venture not only to encounter the risk of they individual and mutual mismanagement but at the same time to place we foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest to do so be to impair the independence of we government as the present credit system have already impaired the independence of we bank it be to submit all its important operation whether of peace or war to be control or thwart at first by we own bank and then by a power abroad greater than themselves i can not bring myself to depict the humiliation to which this government and people might be sooner or later reduce if the means for defend they rights be to be make dependent upon those who may have the most powerful of motive to impair they nor be it only in reference to the effect of this state of thing on the independence of we government or of we bank that the subject present itself for consideration it be to be view also in its relation to the general trade of we country the time be not long pass when a deficiency of foreign crop be think to afford a profitable market for the surplus of we industry but now we await with feverish anxiety the news of the english harvest not so much from motive of commendable sympathy but fearful lest its anticipated failure should narrow the field of credit there do not this speak volume to the patriot can a system be beneficent wise or just which create greater anxiety for interest dependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of we own country and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of we labor the circumstance to which i have thus advert appear to I to afford weighty reason develop by late event to be add to those which i have on former occasion offer when submit to you better knowledge and discernment the propriety of separate the custody of the public money from banking institution nor have anything occur to lessen in my opinion the force of what have be heretofore urge the only ground on which that custody can be desire by the bank be the profitable use which they may make of the money such use would be regard in individual as a breach of trust or a crime of great magnitude and yet it may be reasonably doubt whether first and last it be not attend with more mischievous consequence when permit to the former than to the latter the practice of permit the public money to be use by its keeper as here be believe to be peculiar to this country and to exist scarcely anywhere else to procure it here improper influence be appeal to unwise connection be establish between the government and vast number of powerful state institution other motive than the public good be bring to bear both on the executive and legislative department and selfish combination lead to special legislation be form it be make the interest of banking institution and they stockholder throughout the union to use they exertion for the increase of taxation and the accumulation of a surplus revenue and while a excuse be afford the means be furnish for those excessive issue which lead to extravagant trading and speculation and be the forerunner of a vast debt abroad and a suspension of the bank at home impressed therefore as i be with the propriety of the fund of the government be withdraw from the private use of either bank or individual and the public money keep by duly appoint public agent and believe as i do that such also be the judgment which discussion reflection and experience have produce on the public mind i leave the subject with you it be at all event essential to the interest of the community and the business of the government that a decision should be make most of the argument that dissuade we from employ bank in the custody and disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to the receipt of they note for public due the difference be only in form in one instance the government be a creditor for its deposit and in the other for the note it hold they afford the same opportunity for use the public money and equally lead to all the evil attendant upon it since a bank can as safely extend its discount on a deposit of its note in the hand of a public officer as on one make in its own vault on the other hand it would give to the government no greater security for in case of failure the claim of the note holder would be no better than that of a depositor i be aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and unreasonable pressure upon sound bank have be urge as objection to require the payment of the revenue in gold and silver these objection have be greatly exaggerate from the best estimate we may safely fix the amount of specie in the country at $ 85000000 and the portion of that which would be employ at any one time in the receipt and disbursement of the government even if the proposed change be make at once would not it be now after fuller investigation believe exceed four or five million if the change be gradual several year would elapse before that sum would be require with annual opportunity in the meantime to alter the law should experience prove it to be oppressive or inconvenient the portion of the community on whose business the change would immediately operate be comparatively small nor be it believe that its effect would be in the least unjust or injurious to they in the payment of duty which constitute by far the greater portion of the revenue a very large proportion be derive from foreign commission house and agent of foreign manufacturer who sell the goods consign to they generally at auction and after pay the duty out of the avail remit the rest abroad in specie or its equivalent that the amount of duty should in such case be also retain in specie can hardly be make a matter of complaint we own import merchant by whom the residue of the duty be pay be not only peculiarly interested in maintain a sound currency which the measure in question will especially promote but be from the nature of they dealings best able to know when specie will be need and to procure it with the least difficulty or sacrifice reside too almost universally in place where the revenue be receive and where the draft use by the government for its disbursement must concentrate they have every opportunity to obtain and use they in place of specie should it be for they interest or convenience of the number of these draft and the facility they may afford as well as of the rapidity with which the public fund be draw and disburse a idea may be form from the fact that of nearly $ 20000000 pay to collector and receiver during the present year the average amount in they hand at any one time have not exceed a million and a half and of the fifteen million receive by the collector of new york alone during the present year the average amount hold by he subject to draft during each week have be less than half a million the ease and safety of the operation of the treasury in keep the public money be promote by the application of its own draft to the public due the objection arise from have they too long outstanding might be obviate and they yet make to afford to merchant and bank hold they a equivalent for specie and in that way greatly lessen the amount actually require still less inconvenience will attend the requirement of specie in purchase of public land such purchase except when make on speculation be in general but single transaction rarely repeat by the same person and it be a fact that for the last year and a half during which the note of sound bank have be receive more than a moiety of these payment have be voluntarily make in specie be a larger proportion than would have be require in three year under the graduation propose it be moreover a principle than which none be better settle by experience that the supply of the precious metal will always be find adequate to the use for which they be require they abound in country where no other currency be allow in we own state where small note be exclude gold and silver supply they place when drive to they hiding place by bank suspension a little firmness in the community soon restore they in a sufficient quantity for ordinary purpose postage and other public due have be collect in coin without serious inconvenience even in state where a depreciate paper currency have exist for year and this with the aid of treasury note for a part of the time be do without interruption during the suspension of 1837 at the present moment the receipt and disbursement of the government be make in legal currency in the largest portion of the union no one suggest a departure from this rule and if it can now be successfully carry out it will be surely attend with even less difficulty when bank note be again redeem in specie indeed i can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be raise to the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public transaction be it not from a apprehension that a surplus in the treasury might withdraw a large portion of it from circulation and lock it up unprofitably in the public vault it would not in my opinion be difficult to prevent such a inconvenience from occur but the authentic statement which i have already submit to you in regard to the actual amount in the public treasury at any one time during the period embrace in they and the little probability of a different state of the treasury for at least some year to come seem to render it unnecessary to dwell upon it congress moreover as i have before observe will in every year have a opportunity to guard against it should the occurrence of any circumstance lead we to apprehend injury from this source view the subject in all its aspect i can not believe that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the adoption of all measure necessary to maintain the sanctity of we own engagement and to aid in secure to the community that abundant supply of the precious metal which add so much to they prosperity and give such increase stability to all they dealings in a country so commercial as ours bank in some form will probably always exist but this serve only to render it the more incumbent on we notwithstanding the discouragement of the past to strive in we respective station to mitigate the evil they produce to take from they as rapidly as the obligation of public faith and a careful consideration of the immediate interest of the community will permit the unjust character of monopoly to check so far as may be practicable by prudent legislation those temptation of interest and those opportunity for they dangerous indulgence which beset they on every side and to confine they strictly to the performance of they paramount duty -- that of aid the operation of commerce rather than consult they own exclusive advantage these and other salutary reform may it be believe be accomplish without the violation of any of the great principle of the social compact the observance of which be indispensable to its existence or interfere in any way with the useful and profitable employment of real capital institution so frame have exist and still exist elsewhere give to commercial intercourse all necessary facility without inflate or depreciate the currency or stimulate speculation thus accomplish they legitimate end they have gain the surest guaranty for they protection and encouragement in the good will of the community among a people so just as ours the same result could not fail to attend a similar course the direct supervision of the bank belong from the nature of we government to the state who authorize they it be to they legislature that the people must mainly look for action on that subject but as the conduct of the federal government in the management of its revenue have also a powerful though less immediate influence upon they it become we duty to see that a proper direction be give to it while the keep of the public revenue in a separate and independent treasury and of collect it in gold and silver will have a salutary influence on the system of paper credit with which all bank be connect and thus aid those that be sound and well manage it will at the same time sensibly check such as be otherwise by at once withhold the means of extravagance afford by the public fund and restrain they from excessive issue of note which they would be constantly call upon to redeem i be aware it have be urge that this control may be best attain and exert by means of a national bank the constitutional objection which i be well know to entertain would prevent I in any event from propose or assent to that remedy but in addition to this i can not after past experience bring myself to think that it can any longer be extensively regard as effective for such a purpose the history of the late national bank through all its mutation show that it be not so on the contrary it may after a careful consideration of the subject be i think safely state that at every period of banking excess it take the lead that in 1817 and 1818 in 1823 in 1831 and in 1834 its vast expansion follow by distressing contraction lead to those of the state institution it swell and madden the tide of the banking system but seldom allay or safely direct they at a few period only be a salutary control exercise but a eager desire on the contrary exhibit for profit in the first place and if afterwards its measure be severe toward other institution it be because its own safety compel it to adopt they it do not differ from they in principle or in form its measure emanate from the same spirit of gain it feel the same temptation to overissue it suffer from and be totally unable to avert those inevitable law of trade by which it be itself affect equally with they and at least on one occasion at a early day it be save only by extraordinary exertion from the same fate that attend the weakest institution it profess to supervise in 1837 it fail equally with other in redeem its note -lrb- though the two year allow by its charter for that purpose have not expire -rrb- a large amount of which remain to the present time outstanding it be true that have so vast a capital and strengthen by the use of all the revenue of the government it possess more power but while it be itself by that circumstance free from the control which all bank require its paramount object and inducement be leave the same -- to make the most for its stockholder not to regulate the currency of the country nor have it as far as we be advise be find to be greatly otherwise elsewhere the national character give to the bank of england have not prevent excessive fluctuation in they currency and it prove unable to keep off a suspension of specie payment which last for nearly a quarter of a century and why should we expect it to be otherwise a national institution though derive its charter from a different source than the state bank be yet constitute upon the same principle be conduct by man equally expose to temptation and be liable to the same disaster with the additional disadvantage that its magnitude occasion a extent of confusion and distress which the mismanagement of smaller institution could not produce it can scarcely be doubt that the recent suspension of the united state bank of pennsylvanium of which the effect be feel not in that state alone but over half the union have its origin in a course of business commence while it be a national institution and there be no good reason for suppose that the same consequence would not have follow have it still derive its power from the general government it be in vain when the influence and impulse be the same to look for a difference in conduct or result by such creation we do therefore but increase the mass of paper credit and paper currency without check they attendant evil and fluctuation the extent of power and the efficiency of organization which we give so far from be beneficial be in practice positively injurious they strengthen the chain of dependence throughout the union subject all part more certainly to common disaster and bind every bank more effectually in the first instance to those of we commercial city and in the end to a foreign power in a word i can not but believe that with the full understanding of the operation of we banking system which experience have produce public sentiment be not less oppose to the creation of a national bank for purpose connect with currency and commerce than for those connect with the fiscal operation of the government yet the commerce and currency of the country be suffer evil from the operation of the state bank which can not and ought not to be overlook by they means we have be flood with a depreciate paper which it be evidently the design of the framer of the constitution to prevent when they require congress to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin and when they forbid the state to coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debt or pass any law impair the obligation of contract if they do not guard more explicitly against the present state of thing it be because they could not have anticipate that the few bank then exist be to swell to a extent which would expel to so great a degree the gold and silver for which they have provide from the channel of circulation and fill they with a currency that defeat the object they have in view the remedy for this must chiefly rest with the state from whose legislation it have spring no good that might accrue in a particular case from the exercise of power not obviously confer on the general government would authorize its interference or justify a course that might in the slightest degree increase at the expense of the state the power of the federal authority nor do i doubt that the state will apply the remedy within the last few year event have appeal to they too strongly to be disregard they have see that the constitution though theoretically adhere to be subvert in practice that while on the statute book there be no legal tender but gold and silver no law impair the obligation of contract yet that in point of fact the privilege confer on banking corporation have make they note the currency of the country that the obligation impose by these note be violate under the impulse of interest or convenience and that the number and power of the person connect with these corporation or place under they influence give they a fearful weight when they interest be in opposition to the spirit of the constitution and law to the people it be immaterial whether these result be produce by open violation of the latter or by the workings of a system of which the result be the same a inflexible execution even of the exist statute of most of the state would redress many evil now endure would effectually show the bank the danger of mismanagement which impunity encourage they to repeat and would teach all corporation the useful lesson that they be the subject of the law and the servant of the people what be still want to effect these object must be seek in additional legislation or if that be inadequate in such further constitutional grant or restriction as may bring we back into the path from which we have so widely wander in the meantime it be the duty of the general government to cooperate with the state by a wise exercise of its constitutional power and the enforcement of its exist law the extent to which it may do so by further enactment i have already advert to and the wisdom of congress may yet enlarge they but above all it be incumbent upon we to hold erect the principle of morality and law constantly execute we own contract in accordance with the provision of the constitution and thus serve as a rally point by which we whole country may be bring back to that safe and honor standard we people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burden entail upon they by the false system that have be operate on they sanguine energetic and industrious character nor to the means necessary to extricate themselves from these embarrassment the weight which press upon a large portion of the people and the state be a enormous debt foreign and domestic the foreign debt of we state corporation and man of business can scarcely be less than $ 200000000 require more than $ 10000000 a year to pay the interest this sum have to be pay out of the export of the country and must of necessity cut off import to that extent or plunge the country more deeply in debt from year to year it be easy to see that the increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual demand on the export to pay the interest and to the same extent diminish the import and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and the consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import trade in lieu of the comfort which it now bring we we might have we gigantic banking institution and splendid but in many instance profitless railroad and canal absorb to a great extent in interest upon the capital borrow to construct they the surplus fruit of national industry for year to come and secure to posterity no adequate return for the comfort which the labor of they hand might otherwise have secure it be not by the increase of this debt that relief be to be seek but in its diminution upon this point there be i be happy to say hope before we not so much in the return of confidence abroad which will enable the state to borrow more money as in a change of public feeling at home which prompt we people to pause in they career and think of the means by which debt be to be pay before they be contract if we would escape embarrassment public and private we must cease to run in debt except for object of necessity or such as will yield a certain return let the faith of the state corporation and individual already pledge be keep with the most punctilious regard it be due to we national character as well as to justice that this should on the part of each be a fix principle of conduct but it behoove we all to be more chary in pledge it hereafter by cease to run in debt and apply the surplus of we crop and income to the discharge of exist obligation buy less and sell more and manage all affair public and private with strict economy and frugality we shall see we country soon recover from a temporary depression arise not from natural and permanent cause but from those i have enumerate and advance with renew vigor in she career of prosperity fortunately for we at this moment when the balance of trade be greatly against we and the difficulty of meet it enhance by the disturbed state of we money affair the bounty of providence have come to relieve we from the consequence of past error a faithful application of the immense result of the labor of the last season will afford partial relief for the present and perseverance in the same course will in due season accomplish the rest we have have full experience in time past of the extraordinary result which can in this respect be bring about in a short period by the unite and well-directed effort of a community like ours we surplus profit the energy and industry of we population and the wonderful advantage which providence have bestow upon we country in its climate its various production indispensable to other nation will in due time afford abundant means to perfect the most useful of those object for which the state have be plunge themselves of late in embarrassment and debt without impose on ourselves or we child such fearful burden but let it be indelibly engrave on we mind that relief be not to be find in expedient indebtedness can not be lessen by borrow more money or by change the form of the debt the balance of trade be not to be turn in we favor by create new demand upon we abroad we currency can not be improve by the creation of new bank or more issue from those which now exist although these device sometimes appear to give temporary relief they almost invariably aggravate the evil in the end it be only by retrenchment and reform -- by curtail public and private expenditure by pay we debt and by reform we banking system -- that we be to expect effectual relief security for the future and a enduring prosperity in shape the institution and policy of the general government so as to promote as far as it can with its limited power these important end you may rely on my most cordial cooperation that there should have be in the progress of recent event doubt in many quarter and in some a heated opposition to every change can not surprise we doubt be properly attendant on all reform and it be peculiarly in the nature of such abuse as we be now encounter to seek to perpetuate they power by means of the influence they have be permit to acquire it be they result if not they object to gain for the few a ascendency over the many by secure to they a monopoly of the currency the medium through which most of the want of mankind be supply to produce throughout society a chain of dependence which lead all class to look to privileged association for the means of speculation and extravagance to nourish in preference to the manly virtue that give dignity to human nature a craving desire for luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth which render those who seek they dependent on those who supply they to substitute for republican simplicity and economical habit a sickly appetite for effeminate indulgence and a imitation of that reckless extravagance which impoverish and enslave the industrious people of foreign land and at last to fix upon we instead of those equal political rights the acquisition of which be alike the object and suppose reward of we revolutionary struggle a system of exclusive privilege confer by partial legislation to remove the influence which have thus gradually grow up among we to deprive they of they deceptive advantage to test they by the light of wisdom and truth to oppose the force which they concentrate in they support -- all this be necessarily the work of time even among a people so enlighten and pure as that of the united state in most other country perhaps it could only be accomplish through that series of revolutionary movement which be too often find necessary to effect any great and radical reform but it be the crowning merit of we institution that they create and nourish in the vast majority of we people a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy abuse which have elsewhere cause the effusion of river of blood and the sacrifice of thousand of the human race the result thus far be most honorable to the self-denial the intelligence and the patriotism of we citizen it justify the confident hope that they will carry through the reform which have be so well begin and that they will go still further than they have yet go in illustrate the important truth that a people as free and enlighten as ours will whenever it become necessary show themselves to be indeed capable of self-government by voluntarily adopt appropriate remedy for every abuse and submit to temporary sacrifice however great to insure they permanent welfare my own exertion for the furtherance of these desirable object have be bestow throughout my official career with a zeal that be

the state of massachusett general have dearborn its commissioner by various documentary testimony and by a memorial present in behalf of the several committee on indian concern appoint by the four yearly meeting of friend of genesee new york philadelphium and baltimore in the latter document the memorialist not only insist upon the irregularity and illegality of the negotiation but urge a variety of consideration which appear to they to be very conclusive against the policy of the removal itself the motive by which they have be induce to take so deep a interest in the subject be frankly set forth and be doubtless of the most beneficent character they have however fail to remove my decide conviction that the propose removal if it can be accomplish by proper means will be alike beneficial to the indian to the state in which the land be situate and to the more general interest of the united state upon the subject of indian affair the removal of the new york indian be not only important to the tribe themselves but to a interesting portion of western new york and especially to the grow city of buffalo which be surround by land occupy by the seneca to the indian themselves it present the only prospect of preservation surround as they be by all the influence which work they destruction by temptation they can not resist and artifice they can not counteract they be rapidly decline and notwithstanding the philanthropic effort of the society of friend it be believe that where they be they must soon become extinct and to this portion of we country the extraordinary spectacle be present of densely populated and highly improve settlement inhabit by industrious moral and respectable citizen divide by a wilderness on one side of which be a city of more than 20000 soul whose advantageous position in every other respect and great commercial prospects would insure its rapid increase in population and wealth if not retard by the circumstance of a naturally fertile district remain a barren waste in its immediate vicinity neither do it appear just to those who be entitle to the fee simple of the land and who have pay a part of the purchase money that they should suffer from the waste which be constantly commit upon they reversionary rights and the great deterioration of the land consequent upon such depredation without any corresponding advantage to the indian occupant the treaty too be recommend by the liberality of its provision the cession contain in the first article embrace the right title and interest secure to the six nation of the new york indian and st regi tribe in land at green bay by the menomonee treaty of 8th February 1831 the supplement thereto of 17th of same month and the condition upon which they be ratify by the senate except a tract on which a part of the new york indian now reside the menomonee treaty assign they 500000 acre couple with the original condition that they should remove to they within three year after the date of the treaty modify by the supplement so as to empower the president to prescribe the term within which they should remove to the green bay land and that if they neglect to do so within the period limit so much of the land as should be unoccupied by they at the termination thereof should revert to the united state to these land the new york indian claim title which be resist and for quiet the controversy by the treaty of 1831 the united state pay a large consideration and it will be see that by use the power give in the treaty the executive might put a end to the indian claim instead of this harsher measure for a grant of all they interest in wisconsin which deduct the land in the actual occupancy of new york indian amount to about 435000 acre the treaty as amend by the senate give 1824000 acre of land in the west and the sum of $ 400000 for they removal and subsistence for education and agricultural purpose the erection of mill and the necessary house and the promotion of the mechanic art besides there be special money provision for the cayuga the onondaga the oneida of new york the tuscarora and st regi indian and a engagement to receive from ogden and fellow for the seneca $ 202000 to invest $ 100000 of this sum in safe stock and to distribute $ 102000 among the owner of improvement in new york accord to a appraisement to sell for the tuscaroras 5000 acre of land they hold in niagara county ny and to invest the proceeds exclusive of what may be receive for improvement the income from which shall be pay to the nation at they new home annually and the money which shall be receive for improvement on say land shall be pay to the owner of the improvement when the land be sell these be the substantial part of the treaty and be so careful of indian advantage that one might suppose they would be satisfactory to those most anxious for they welfare the right they cede could be extinguish by a course that treaty provision justify and authorize so long as they persevere in they determination to remain in new york it be of no service to they and for this naked right it be see what the united state propose to give they besides the sum of $ 202000 which will be due from the purchaser of they occupant right to the seneca and $ 9600 to the tuscarora for they title to 1920 acre of land in ontario county ny exclusive of the 5000 acre above mention but whilst such be my view in respect to the measure itself and while i shall feel it to be my duty to labor for its accomplishment by the proper use of all the means that be or shall be place at my disposal by congress i be at the same time equally desirous to avoid the use of any which be inconsistent with those principle of benevolence and justice which i on a former occasion endeavor to show have in the main characterize the dealings of the federal government with the indian tribe from the administration of president washington to the present time the obstacle to the execution of the treaty grow out of the follow consideration : the amend treaty be return to I by you body at the close of its last session accompany by a resolution setting forth that whenever the president of the united state shall be satisfy that the assent of the seneca tribe of indian have be give to the amend treaty of June 11 1838 with the new york indian accord to the true intent and meaning of the resolution of the 11th of June 1838 the senate recommend that the president make proclamation of say treaty and carry the same into effect the resolution of the 11th of June 1838 provide that the say treaty shall have no force or effect whatever as relate to any of the say tribe nation or band of new york indian nor shall it be understand that the senate have assent to any of the contract connect with it until the same with the amendment herein propose be submit and fully explain by the commissioner of the united state to each of the say tribe or band separately assemble in council and they have give they free and voluntary consent thereto the amend treaty be submit to the chief of the several tribe and its provision explain to they in council a majority of the chief of each of the tribe of new york indian sign the treaty in council except the seneca of they only 16 sign in council 13 sign at the commissioner 's office and 2 who be confine by indisposition at home this be report to the war department in October 1838 and in January 1839 a final return of the proceedings of the commissioner be make by which it appear that 41 signature of chief include 6 out of the 8 sachem of the nation have be affix to the treaty the number of chief of the seneca nation entitle to act for the people be variously estimate from 74 to 80 and by some at a still higher number thus it appear that estimate the number of chief at 80 -- and it be believe there be at least that number -- there be only a bare majority of they who sign the treaty and only 16 give they assent to it in council the secretary of war be under these circumstance direct to meet the chief of the new york indian in council in order to ascertain if possible the view of the several tribe and especially of the seneca in relation to the amend treaty he do so in the month of August last and the minute of the proceedings of that council be herewith submit much opposition be manifest by a party of the seneca and from some cause or other some of the chief of the other tribe who have in former council consent to the treaty appear to be now oppose to it document be present show that some of the seneca chief have receive assurance of remuneration from the proprietor of the land provide they assent to the treaty and use they influence to obtain that of the nation while testimony be offer on the other side to prove that many have be deter from signing and take part in favor of the treaty by threat of violence which from the late intelligence of the cruel murder commit upon the signer of the cherokee treaty produce a panic among the partisan of that now under consideration whatever may have be the means use by those interested in the fee simple of these land to obtain the assent of indian it appear from the disinterested and important testimony of the commissioner appoint by the state of massachusett that the agent of the government act throughout with the utmost fairness and general dearborn declare himself to be perfectly satisfied that be it not for the unremitted and disingenuous exertion of a certain number of white man who be actuate by they private interest to induce the chief not to assent to the treaty it would immediately have be approve by a immense majority -- a opinion which he reiterate at cattaraugus statement be present to the secretary of war at cattaraugus to show that a vast majority of the new york indian be adverse to the treaty but no reasonable doubt exist that the same influence which obtain this expression of opinion would if exert with equal zeal on the other side have produce a directly opposite effect and show a large majority in favor of emigration but no advance toward obtain the assent of the seneca tribe to the amend treaty in council be make nor can the assent of a majority of they in council be now obtain in the report of the committee of the senate upon the subject of this treaty of the 28th of February last it be state as follow : but it be in vain to contend that the signature of the last ten which be obtain on the second mission or of the three who have send on they assent lately be such a signing as be contemplate by the resolution of the senate it be competent however for the senate to waive the usual and customary form in this instance and consider the signature of these last thirteen as good as though they have be obtain in open council but the committee can not recommend the adoption of such a practice in make treaty for diver good reason which must be obvious to the senate and among those reason against these secret individual negotiation be the distrust create that the chief so act be do what a majority of they people do not approve of or else that they be improperly act upon by bribery or threat or unfair influence in this case we have most ample illustration those oppose to the treaty accuse several of those who sign they assent to the amend treaty with have be bribe and in at least one instance they make out the charge very clearly although the committee be four in number be unable to agree upon any recommendation to the senate it do not appear that there be any diversity of opinion amongst they in regard to this part of the report the provision of the resolution of the senate of the 11th of June 1838 require the assent of each of the say tribe of indian to the amend treaty to be give in council and which be also make a condition precedent to the recommendation to I of the senate of the 2d of march 1839 to carry the same into effect have not therefore be comply with as it respect the seneca tribe it be however insist by the advocate for the execution of the treaty that it be the intention of the senate by they resolution of the 2d of march 1839 to waive so much of the requirement of that of the 11th of June 1838 as make it necessary that the assent of the different tribe should be give in council this assumption be understand to be found upon the circumstance that the fact that only sixteen of the chief have give they assent in that form have be distinctly communicate to the senate before the passage of the resolution of the 2d of march and that instead of be a majority that number constitute scarcely one-fifth of the whole number of chief and it be hence insist that unless the senate have so intended there would have be no use in send the amend treaty to the president with the advice contain in that resolution this have not appear to I to be a necessary deduction from the foregoing fact as the senate may have contemplate that the assent of the tribe in the form first require should be thereafter obtain and before the treaty be execute and the phraseology of the resolution viz that whenever the president shall be satisfied etc go far to sustain this construction the interpretation of the act of the senate set up by the advocate for the treaty be moreover in direct opposition to the disclaimer contain in the report of the committee which have be advert to it be at best a inference only in respect to the truth of which the senate can alone speak with certainty and which could not with propriety be regard as justify the desire action in relation to the execution of the treaty this measure be further object to on the ground of improper inducement hold out to the assent chief by the agent of the proprietor of the land which it be insist ought to invalidate the treaty if even the requirement that the assent of the chief should be give in council be dispense with documentary evidence upon this subject be lay before you at the last session and be again communicate with additional evidence upon the same point the charge appear by the proceedings of the senate to have be investigate by you committee but no conclusion upon the subject form other than that which be contain in the extract from the report of the committee i have refer to and which assert that at least in one instance the charge of bribery have be clearly make out that improper means have be employ to obtain the assent of the seneca chief there be every reason to believe and i have not be able to satisfy myself that i can consistently

as of the two official note address by the secretary of state to the undersign on the 24th of December and on the 16th of the present month the same report movement of troops be refer to in a recent message from the governor of maine to the legislature of the state and also in a publish official letter address by the governor of maine to the president of the united state on the 23d of December it appear from accurate information now in the possession of the undersign that the governor of maine and through he the president and general government of the united state have be misinform as to the fact in the first place no reenforcement have be march to the british post at the lake temiscoua the only change occur there have be the relief of a detachment of she majesty 's twenty-fourth regiment by a detachment of equal force of the eleventh regiment this force of one company be now station at the temiscoua post as it always have be for the necessary purpose of protect the store and accommodation provide for the use of she majesty 's troops who may be require as heretofore to march by that route to and from the province of canada and new brunswick in the second place it be not true that the british authority either have build or be build barracks on both side of the st john river or at the mouth of the madawaska river no new barracks have in fact be build anywhere in the third place she majesty 's authority be not concentrate a military force at the grand fall the same trifling force of sixteen man be now station at the post of the grand fall which have be station there for the last twelvemonth it be perhaps however needless for the undersign to advert to this last matter at all as the post of the grand fall be beyond the bound of the dispute territory and within the acknowledged limit of new brunswick the undersign while convey the above information upon a matter of fact to the secretary of state of the united state take occasion to repeat distinctly he former declaration that there exist no intention on the part of she majesty 's authority to infringe the term of those provisional agreement which be enter into at the beginning of last year so long as there be reason to trust that the same will be faithfully adhere to by the opposite party but it be the duty of the undersign at the same time clearly to state that she majesty 's authority in north america take into view the attitude assume by the state of maine with reference to the boundary question will as at present advise be govern entirely by circumstance in adopt such measure of defense and protection -lrb- whether along the confines of the dispute territory or within that portion of it where it have be before explain the authority of great britain accord to the exist agreement be not to be interfere with -rrb- as may seem to they necessary for guard against or for promptly repel the further act of hostile aggression over the whole of the dispute territory which it appear to be the avowed design of the state of maine sooner or later to attempt for the undersign have to observe that not only be the extensive system of encroachment which be denounce and remonstrate against by the undersign in he official note of the 2d of last November still carry on and persist in by armed band employ by the authority of maine in the district above the aroostook and fish river but that act as above state of a character yet more violent and obnoxious to the rights of great britain and more dangerous to the preservation of the general peace be with certainty meditate by the inhabitant of that state the existence of such design have for month past be a matter of notoriety by public report those design be plainly indicate in the recent message of the governor of maine to the legislature of the state and they be avow in more explicit term in the letter address to the president of the united state by the governor of maine on the 21st of November which letter have within the last few day be communicate to congress and publish the undersign it be true have be assure by the secretary of state in he note of the 16th instant that the general government see no reason to doubt the disposition of the governor of maine to adhere to the exist arrangement and to avoid all act tend to render more difficult and distant the final adjustment of the boundary question but in face of the above clear indication of the intention of maine as give out by the party themselves the secretary of state have not give to the undersign any adequate assurance that maine will be constrain to desist from carry those intention into effect if contrary to the expectation of the general government the legislature or the executive of the state should think fit to make the attempt the undersign not only preserve the hope but he entertain the firm belief that if the duty of negotiate the boundary question be leave in the hand of the two national government to whom alone of right it belong the difficulty of conduct the negotiation to a amicable issue will not be find so great as have be by many person apprehend but the case will become wholly alter if the people of the state of maine who though interested in the result be not charge with the negotiation shall attempt to interrupt it by violence she majesty 's authority in north america have on they part no desire or intention to interfere with the course of the pend negotiation by a exertion of military force but they will as at present advise consult they own discretion in adopt the measure of defense that may be render necessary by the threat of a violent interruption to the negotiation which have be use by all party in maine and which the undersign regret to find confirm by the language -lrb- as above refer to -rrb- employ by the highest official authority in that state the undersigned avail himself of this occasion to renew to the secretary of state of the united state the assurance of he distinguished consideration h fox _ mr forsyth to mr fox _ department of state _ washington January 28 1840 _ henry s fox esq etc : the undersign secretary of state of the united state have the honor to reply by direction of the president to the note address to he on the 26th instant by mr fox envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of great britain the president derive great satisfaction from the information convey by mr fox 's note that with reference to the report movement of british troops within the territory in dispute no actual change have take place in the attitude of she majesty 's authority in the territory since the arrangement enter into by the two government at the commencement of last year for the preservation of tranquillity within its limit and from he assurance that there exist no intention on the part of she majesty 's authority to infringe the term of those arrangement so long as they be faithfully observe on the side of the united state the president however can not repress a feeling of regret that the british colonial authority without graver motive than the possibility of a departure from the arrangement refer to by the state of maine should take upon themselves the discretion and along with it the fearful responsibility of probable consequence of be guide by circumstance liable as these be to be misapprehend and misjudge in the adoption within the dispute territory of measure of defense and precaution in manifest violation of the understanding between the two country whenever they may imagine that act of hostile aggression over the dispute territory be meditate or threaten on the part of the state of maine the president can not but hope that when she majesty 's government at home shall be apprise of the position assume in this regard by its colonial agent proper step will be take to place the performance of express and solemn agreement upon a more secure basis than colonial discretion to be exercise on apprehend disregard of such agreement on the part of the state of maine it be gratify to the president to perceive that mr fox entertain the firm belief that the difficulty of conduct to a amicable issue the pend negotiation for the adjustment of the question of boundary be not so great as have by many person be apprehend as under a corresponding conviction the united state have with a view to the final settlement of that exciting question submit a proposition for the consideration of she majesty 's government the president hope that the sentiment express by mr fox have they foundation in a expectation of he have it in he power at a early day to communicate to this government a result of the deliberation have by that of she britannic majesty upon the proposition allude to which will present the prospect of a prompt and satisfactory settlement and which when know by the state of maine will put a end to all grounds of apprehension of intention or disposition on she part to adopt any measure calculate to embarrass the negotiation or to involve a departure from the provisional arrangement in the existence of those arrangement the united state behold a earnest of the mutual desire of the two government to divest a question abound in cause of deep and grow excitement of as much as possible of the asperity and hostile feeling it be calculate to engender but unless attend with the most scrupulous observance of the spirit and letter of they provision it would prove but one more cause add to the many already prevail of enmity and discord mr fox have already be make the channel of conveyance to he government of the desire and determination of the president that the obligation of the country shall be faithfully discharge that desire be prompt by a sense of expediency as well as of justice and by a anxious wish to preserve the amicable relation now so manifestly for the advantage of both subsist between the united state and great britain the undersigned avail

collection of impost affect extensively and injuriously the accrue revenue they embrace with many other the important article of linen woolens and cotton the last two of which be often treat as silk because that material constitute a component part of they and thus exempt they from duty altogether assessment of duty which have prevail for year and in some case since the passage of the law themselves be in this manner altered and uncertainty and litigation introduce in regard to the future the effect which these proceedings have already produce in diminish the amount of the revenue and which be likely to increase hereafter deserve you early consideration i have therefore deem it necessary to bring the matter to you notice with a view to such legislative action as the exigency of the case may in you judgment require it be not believe that any law which can now be pass upon the subject can affect the revenue favorably for several month to come and could not therefore be safely regard as a substitute for the early provision of certain and adequate means to enable the treasury to guard the public credit and meet promptly and faithfully any deficiency that may occur in the revenue from whatever cause they may arise the reason in favor of the propriety of adopt at a early period proper measure for that purpose be explain by the secretary of the treasury in he annual report and recommend to you attention by myself the experience of the last two month and especially the recent decision of the court with the continued suspension of specie payment by the bank over

propriety of the legislation then desire the application assume that although the means of the treasury for the whole year may be equal to the expenditure of the year the department may notwithstanding be render unable to meet the claim upon it at the time when they fall due this apprehension arise partly from the circumstance that the largest proportion of the charge upon the treasury include the payment of pension and the redemption of treasury note fall due in the early part of this year viz in the month of march and may while the resource on which it might otherwise rely to discharge they can not be make available until the last half of the year and partly from the fact that a portion of the means of the treasury consist of debt due from bank for some of which delay have already be ask and which may not be punctually pay consider the injurious consequence to the character credit and business of the country which would result from a failure by the government for ever so short a period to meet its engagement that the happen of such a contingency can only be effectually guard against by the exercise of legislative authority that the period when such disability must arise if at all and which at the commencement of the session be comparatively remote have now approach so near as a few day and that the provision ask for be only intend to enable the

other public work construct for they use and accommodation by that report and the three deposition which the undersign informally communicate to mr fox a few day since he will perceive that there must be some extraordinary misapprehension on he part of the fact in relation to the occupation by british troops of portion of the dispute territory the statement contain in these document and that give by mr fox in he note of the 20th of January last exhibit a striking discrepancy as to the number of troops now in the territory as compare with those who be in it when the arrangement between governor fairfield and lieutenant-governor harvey be agree upon and also as to the present and former state of the building there the extensive accommodation prepare and prepare at a old and at new station the work finish and in the course of construction on the land and on the water be not in harmony with the assurance that the only object be the preservation of a few unimportant building and storehouse for the temporary protection of the number of troops she majesty 's ordinary service can require to pass on the road from new brunswick to canada the undersign will abstain from any remark upon these contradictory statement until mr fox shall have have a opportunity to obtain the means of fully explain they how essential it be that this should be promptly do and that the step necessary to a

secretary of state of the united state to which be annex the copy of a report from mr benjamin wiggin a agent employ by the state of maine to visit the british military post at lake temiscoua and in which reference be make to other papers upon the same subject which be informally communicate to the undersign by mr forsyth a few day before and the attention of the undersign be call by mr forsyth to different point upon which the information contain in the say papers be consider to be materially at variance with that which be convey to the united state government by the undersign in he official note of the 26th of last January the undersign have already be make acquaint by the lieutenant-governor of new brunswick with the circumstance of mr wiggin 's visit to the military post at lake temiscoua where the officer in command very properly furnish to mr wiggin the requisite information upon all matter connect with the british station which he appear desirous to inquire about the alleged point of variance after deduct what be fanciful and conjectural in the report now produce and after compare what be there state in contradiction to other report before produce from the same quarter do not appear to the undersign to be by any means so material as they seem to have be consider by the government of the united state the british military detachment station at lake temiscoua which the agent employ by the state of maine have in the first instance with singular exaggeration represent as amounting to two regiment be now discover by the same party to amount to 175 man which instead of two regiment be something less than two company it be indeed true should such a point be consider worth discuss that the undersign might have use a more technically correct expression in he note of the 26th of January if he have state the detachment in question to consist of from one to two company instead of state it to consist of one company but a detachment of she majesty 's troops have be station at the lake temiscoua from time to time ever since the winter of 1837 and 1838 when the necessity arise from march reenforcement by that route from new brunswick to canada and it will be remember that a temporary right of use that route for the same purpose be expressly reserve to great britain in the provisional agreement enter into at the beginning of last year it be not therefore true that the station a military force at the lake temiscoua be a new measure on the part of she majesty 's authority neither be it true that that measure have be adopt for other purpose than to maintain the security of the customary line of communication and to protect the building store and accommodation provide for the use of she majesty 's troops when on march by that route and it be with a view to correct misapprehension which appear to exist upon these point and thus to do away with one needless occasion of dispute that the undersign convey to the united state government the information contain in he note of the 26th of January with regard again to the construction of barracks and other building and the preserve they in a efficient state of repair and defense a similar degree of error and misapprehension appear still to prevail in the mind of the american authority the erection of those building within the portion of the dispute territory now refer to for the shelter of she majesty 's troops while on they march and for the safe lodgment of the store be no new act on the part of she majesty 's authority the building in question have be in the course of construction from a period antecedent to the provisional agreement of last year and they be now maintain and occupy along the line of march with a view to the same object above specify for which the small detachment of troops also refer to be in like manner there station the undersign will not refrain from here remark upon one point of comparison exhibit in the present controversy it be admit by the united state authority that the armed band station by the government of maine in the neighborhood of the aroostook river have fortify those station with artillery and it be now object as matter of complaint against the british authority with reference to the building at lake temiscoua not that those building be furnish with artillery but only that they be defend by palisade capable of resist artillery it would be difficult to adduce stronger evidence of the act on the one side be those of aggression and on the other of defense the fact shortly be -lrb- and this be the essential point of the argument -rrb- that she majesty 's authority have not as yet alter they state of preparation or strengthen they military means within the dispute territory with a view to settle the question of the boundary although the attitude assume by the state of maine with reference to that question would be a clear justification of such measure and it be much to be apprehend that the adoption of such measure will sooner or later become indispensable if the people of maine be not compel to desist from the extensive system of armed aggression which they be continue to carry on in other part of the same disputed territory the undersigned avail himself of this occasion to renew to the secretary of state of the united state the assurance of he distinguished consideration h fox washington _ march 9

from the valley of the st john and confine themselves to the valley of the aroostook that they shall occupy that valley in a temporary manner only for the purpose as agree upon of prevent depredation

undersigned avail himself of this occasion to renew to the secretary of state of the united state the assurance of he distinguished consideration h fox _ mr forsyth to mr fox _ department of state _ washington march 25 1840 _ henry s fox esq etc : the undersign secretary of state of the united state acknowledge to have receive mr fox 's communication of the 13th instant in reference to the boundary negotiation and the affair of the dispute territory the information give in the closing part of it -- that a reply to the last proposition of the united state upon the subject of the boundary may be expect in a short time -- be highly gratifying to the president who have however give direction to the undersign in make this acknowledgment to accompany it with the expression of he profound regret that mr fox 's note be in no other respect satisfactory after the arrangement which in the beginning of last year be enter into on the part of the two government with regard to the occupation of the dispute territory the president have indulge the hope that the cause of irritation which have grow out of this branch of the subject could have be remove rely on the disposition of maine to cooperate with the federal government in all that could lead to a pacific adjustment of the principal question the president feel confident that he determination to maintain order and peace on the border would be fully carry out he look upon all apprehension of design by the people of maine to take possession of the territory as without adequate foundation deem it improbable that on the eve of a amicable adjustment of the question any portion of the american people would without cause and without object jeopard the success of the negotiation and endanger the peace of the country a troublesome irritating and comparatively unimportant because subordinate subject be thus disposed of the president hope that the party would be leave free at once to discuss and finally adjust the principal question in this he have be disappoint while the proceedings of she majesty 's government at home have be attend with unlooked-for delay its attention have be divert from the great subject in controversy by repeat complaint impute to a portion of the people of the united state design to violate the engagement of they government -- design which have never be entertain and which mr fox know would receive no countenance from this government it be to be regret that at this late hour so much misapprehension still exist on the side of the british government as to the object and obvious meaning of the exist arrangement respect the dispute territory the ill success which appear to have attend the effort make by the undersign to convey through mr fox to she majesty 's government more correct impression respect they call for a recurrence to the subject and a brief review of the correspondence which have grow out of it may tend to remove the erroneous view which prevail as to the manner in which the term of the arrangement refer to have be observe as mr fox have no authority to make any agreement respect the exercise of jurisdiction over the dispute territory that between he and the undersigned of the 27th of February 1839 have for its object some provisional arrangement for the restoration and preservation of peace in the territory to accomplish this object it provide that she majesty 's officer should not seek to expel by military force the armed party which have be send by maine into the district border on the restook river and that on the other hand the government of maine would voluntarily and without needless delay withdraw beyond the bound of the dispute territory any armed force then within they besides this the arrangement have other object -- the dispersion of notorious trespasser and the protection of public property from depredation in case future necessity should arise for this the operation be to be conduct by concert jointly or separately accord to agreement between the government of maine and new brunswick in this last-mentioned respect the agreement look to some further arrangement between maine and new brunswick through the agency of general scott one be agree to on the 23d and 25th of march follow by which sir john harvey bind himself not to seek without renew instruction to that effect from he government to take military possession of the territory or to expel from it by military force the arm civil posse or the troops of maine on the part of maine it be agree by she governor that no attempt should be make without renew instruction from the legislature to disturb by arm the province of new brunswick in the possession of the madawaska settlement or interrupt the usual communication between that and the upper province as to possession and jurisdiction they be to remain unchanged -- each party holding in fact possession of part of the dispute territory but each deny the right of the other to do so with that understanding maine be without unnecessary delay to withdraw she military force leave only under a land agent a small civil posse arm or unarmed to protect the timber recently cut and to prevent further depredation in the complaint of infraction of the agreement by the state of maine address to the undersign mr fox have assume two position which be not authorize by the term of those agreement : first admit the right of maine to maintain a civil posse in the dispute territory for the purpose state in the agreement he do so with the restriction that the action of the posse be to be confine within certain limit and second by make the advance of the maine posse into the valley of the upper st john the ground of he complaint of encroachment upon the madawaska settlement he assume to extend the limit of that settlement beyond those it occupy at the date of the agreement the united state can not acquiesce in either of these position in the first place nothing be find in the agreement subscribe to by governor fairfield and sir john harvey define any limit in the dispute territory within which the operation of the civil posse of maine be to be circumscribe the task of preserve the timber recently cut and of prevent further depredation _ within the dispute territory _ be assign to the state of maine after she military force should have be withdraw from it and it be to be accomplish by a civil posse arm or unarmed which be to continue in the territory and to operate in every part of it where its agency might be require to protect the timber already cut and prevent further depredation without any limitation whatever or any restriction except such as might be construe into a attempt to disturb by arm the province of new brunswick in she possession of the madawaska settlement or interrupt the usual communication between the province it be thus in the exercise of a legitimate right and in the conscientious discharge of a obligation impose upon she by a solemn compact that the state of maine have do those act which have give rise to complaint for which no adequate cause be perceive the undersigned feel confident that when those act shall have be consider by she majesty 's government at home as explain in he note to mr fox of the 24th of December last and in connection with the foregoing remark they will no longer be view as calculate to excite the apprehension of she majesty 's government that the faith of exist arrangement be to be break on the part of the united state with regard to the second position assume by mr fox -- that the advance of the maine posse along the valley of the restook to the mouth of fish river and into the valley of the upper st john be at variance with the term and spirit of the agreement -- the undersign must observe that if at variance with any of they provision it could only be with those which secure she majesty 's province of new brunswick against any attempt to disturb the possession of the madawaska settlement and to interrupt the usual communication between new brunswick and the upper province the agreement could only have reference to the madawaska settlement as confine within they actual limit at the time it be subscribe the undersign in he note of the 24th of December last state the reason why the mouth of fish river and the portion of the valley of the st john through which it pass could in no proper sense be consider as embrace in the madawaska settlement be the united state to admit the pretension set up on the part of great britain to give to the madawaska settlement a degree of constructive extension that might at this time suit the purpose of she majesty 's colonial authority those settlement might soon be make with like justice to embrace any portion of the dispute territory and the right give to the province of new brunswick to occupy they temporarily and for a special purpose might by inference quite as plausible give the jurisdiction exercise by she majesty 's authority a extent which would render the present state of the question so long as it could be maintain equivalent to a decision on the merit of the whole controversy in favor of great britain if the small settlement at madawaska on the north side of the st john mean the whole valley of that river if a boom across the fish river and a station of a small posse on the south side of the st john at the mouth of fish river be a disturbance of that settlement which be 25 mile below within the meaning of the agreement it be difficult to conceive that there be any limitation to the pretension of she majesty 's government under it or how the state of maine could exercise the preventive power with regard to trespasser which be on she part the great object of the temporary arrangement the movement of british troops lately witness in the dispute territory and the erection of military work for they protection and accommodation of which authentic information recently receive at the department of state have be communicate to mr fox impart a still graver aspect to the matter immediately under consideration the fact of those military operation establish beyond a doubt leave unexplained or unsatisfactorily account for by mr fox 's note of the 7th instant continue a abide cause of complaint on the part of the united state against she majesty 's colonial agent as inconsistent with arrangement whose main object be to divest a question already sufficiently perplexed and complicate from such embarrassment as those with which the proceedings of the british authority can not fail to surround it if as mr fox must admit the object of the late agreement be the removal of all military force and the preservation of the property from further spoliation leave the possession and jurisdiction as they stand before the state of maine find itself compel to act against the trespasser the president can not but consider that the conduct of the american local authority strongly and most favorably contrast with that of the colonial authority of she majesty 's government while the one promptly withdraw its military force have confine itself to the use of the small posse arm as agree upon and have do no act not necessary to the accomplishment of the conventional object every measure take or indicate by the other party be essentially military in its character and can be justify only by a well-founded apprehension that hostility must ensue with such feeling and conviction the president could not see without painful surprise the attempt of mr fox under instruction from he government to give to the exist state of thing a character not warrant by the friendly disposition of the united state or the conduct of the authority and people of maine much more be he surprise to find it allege as a ground for strengthen a military force and prepare for a hostile collision with the unarmed inhabitant of a friendly state pursue within they own border they peaceful occupation or exert themselves in compliance with they agreement to protect the property in dispute from unauthorized spoliation the president wish that he could dispel the fear that these dark foreboding can be realize unless she majesty 's government shall forthwith arrest all military interference in the question unless it shall apply to the subject more determine effort than have hitherto be make to bring the dispute to a certain and pacific adjustment the misfortune predict by mr fox in the name of he government may most unfortunately happen but no apprehension of the consequence allude to by mr fox can be permit to divert the government and people of the united state from the performance of they duty to the state of maine that duty be as simple as it be imperative the construction which be give by she to the treaty of 1783 have be again and again and in the most solemn manner assert also by the federal government and must be maintain unless maine freely consent to a new boundary or unless that construction of the treaty be find to be erroneous by the decision of a disinterested and independent tribunal select by the party for its final adjustment the president on assume the duty of he station avow he determination all other means of negotiation fail to submit a proposition to the government of great britain to refer the decision of the question once more to a third party in all the subsequent step which have be take upon the subject by he direction he have be actuate by the same spirit neither he disposition in the matter nor he opinion as to the propriety of that course have undergo any change should the fulfillment of he wish be defeat either by a unwillingness on the part of she majesty 's government to meet the offer of the united state in the spirit in which it be make or from adverse circumstance of any description the president will in any event derive great satisfaction from the consciousness that no effort on he part have be spare to bring the question to a amicable conclusion and that there have be nothing in the conduct either of the government and people of the united state or of the state of maine to justify the employment of she majesty 's force as indicate by mr fox 's letter the president can not under such circumstance apprehend that the responsibility for any consequence which may unhappily ensue will by the just judgment of a impartial world be imputed to the united state the undersigned avail himself etc john forsyth _ mr fox to mr forsyth _ washington _ march 26 1840 _ hon john forsyth etc : the

course have become the duty of she majesty 's government to lay the say report and map before parliament but she majesty 's government have be desirous as a mark of courtesy and consideration toward the government of the united state that document bear upon a question of so much interest and importance to the two country should in the first instance be communicate to the president the document have be officially place in the hand of she majesty 's government only a few day previously to the date of the instruction address to the undersign she majesty 's government feel a unabated desire to bring the long-pending question connect with the boundary between the united state and the british possession in north america to a final and satisfactory settlement be well aware that question of this nature as long as they remain open between two country must be the source of frequent irritation on both side and be liable at any moment to lead to event that may endanger the existence of friendly relation it be obvious that the question at issue between great britain and the united state must be beset with various and really exist difficulty or else those question would not have remain open ever since the year 1783 notwithstanding the frequent and earnest endeavor make by each government to bring they to a adjustment but she majesty 's government do not relinquish the hope that the sincere desire which be feel by both party to arrive at a amicable settlement will at length be attend with success the best clew to guide the two government in they future proceedings may perhaps be obtain by a examination of the cause of past failure and the most prominent amongst these cause have certainly be a want of correct information as to the topographical feature and physical character of the district in dispute this want of adequate information may be trace as one of the difficulty which embarrass the netherland government in its endeavor to decide the point submit to its arbitration in 1830 the same have be feel by the government in england it have be feel and admit by the government of the united state and even by the local government of the contiguous state of maine the british government and the government of the united state agree therefore two year ago that a survey of the dispute territory by a joint commission would be the measure best calculate to elucidate and solve the question at issue the president propose such a commission and she majesty 's government consent to it and it be believe by she majesty 's government that the general principle upon which the commission be to be guide in its local operation have be settle by mutual agreement arrive at by means of a correspondence which take place between the two government in 1837 and 1838 she majesty 's government accordingly transmit in April of last year for the consideration of the president the draft of a convention to regulate the proceedings of the propose commission the preamble of that draft recite textually the agreement that have be come to by means of note which have be exchange between the two government and the article of the draft be frame as she majesty 's government consider in strict conformity with that agreement but the government of the united state do not think proper to assent to the convention so propose the united state government do not indeed allege that the propose convention be at variance with the result of the previous correspondence between the two government but it think that the convention would establish a commission of mere exploration and survey and the president be of opinion that the step next to be take by the two government should be to contract stipulation bear upon the face of they the promise of a final settlement under some form or other and within a reasonable time the united state government accordingly transmit to the undersign for communication to she majesty 's government in the month of July last a counter draft of convention vary considerably in some part -lrb- as the secretary of state of the united state admit in he letter to the undersigned of the 29th of July last -rrb- from the draft propose by great britain but the secretary of state add that the united state government do not deem it necessary to comment upon the alteration so make as the text itself of the counter draft would be find sufficiently perspicuous she majesty 's government might certainly well have expect that some reason would have be give to explain why the united state government decline to confirm a arrangement which be found upon proposition make by that government itself and upon modification to which that government have agree or that if the american government think the draft of convention thus propose be not in conformity with the previous agreement it would have point out in what respect the two be consider to differ she majesty 's government consider the present state of the boundary question concur with the government of the united state in think that it be on every account expedient that the next measure to be adopt by the two government should contain arrangement which will necessarily lead to a final settlement and they think that the convention which they propose last year to the president instead of be frame so as to constitute a mere commission of exploration and survey do on the contrary contain stipulation calculate to lead to the final ascertainment of the boundary between the two country there be however undoubtedly one essential difference between the british draft and the american counter draft the british draft contain no provision embody the principle of arbitration the american counter draft do contain such a provision the british draft contain no provision for arbitration because the principle of arbitration have not be propose on either side during the negotiation upon which that draft be found and because moreover it be understand at that time that the principle of arbitration would be decidedly object to by the united state but as the united state government have now express a wish to embody the principle of arbitration in the propose convention she majesty 's government be perfectly willing to accede to that wish the undersign be accordingly instruct to state officially to mr forsyth that she majesty 's government consent to the two principle which form the main foundation of the american counter draft namely : first that the commission to be appoint shall be so constitute as necessarily to lead to a final settlement of the question of boundary at issue between the two country and secondly that in order to secure such a result the convention by which the commission be to be create shall contain a provision for arbitration upon point as to which the british and american commissioner may not be able to agree the undersigned be however instruct to add that there be many matter of detail in the american counter draft which she majesty 's government can not adopt the undersign will be furnish from he government by a early opportunity with a amend draft in conformity with the principle above state to be submit to the consideration of the president and the undersign expect to be at the same time furnished with instruction to propose to the government of the united state a fresh local and temporary convention for the better prevention of incidental border collision within the dispute territory during the time that may be occupy in carry through the operation of survey or arbitration the undersigned avail

of the united state the document refer to and that he derive great satisfaction from the announcement that she majesty 's government do not relinquish the hope that the sincere desire which be feel by

that when the american counter draft be communicate to he some reason would have be give to explain why the united state government decline accept the british draft of convention or that if it think

year transmit the american counter draft he state that in consequence of the then recent event on the frontier and the danger of collision between the citizen and subject of the two government a mere commission of exploration and survey would be inadequate to the exigency of the occasion and fall behind the just expectation of the people of both country and refer to the importance of have the measure next adopt bear upon its face stipulation which must result in a final settlement under some form and in a reasonable time these be the reason which induce the president to introduce in the new project the provision which he think calculate for the attainment of so desirable a object and which in he opinion render obviously unnecessary any allusion to the previous agreement refer to by mr fox the president be gratify to find that a concurrence in those view have bring the mind of she majesty 's government to a similar conclusion and from this fresh indication of harmony in the wish of the two cabinet he permit himself to anticipate the most satisfactory result from the measure under consideration the undersigned avail himself of the opportunity to offer to mr fox renew assurance

on the line of boundary from the entrance of lake superior to the most northwestern point of the lake of the wood by the arbitration of a friendly power in conformity with the seventh article of the treaty of ghent no answer have yet be return by the british government to this proposition with austrium france prussium russium and the remain power of europe i be happy to inform you we relation continue to be of the most friendly character with belgium a treaty of commerce and navigation base upon liberal principle of reciprocity and equality be conclude in march last and have be ratify by the belgian government will be duly lay before the senate it be a subject of congratulation that it provide for the satisfactory adjustment of a long-standing question of controversy thus remove the only obstacle which could obstruct the friendly and mutually advantageous intercourse between the two nation a messenger have be dispatch with the hanoverian treaty to berlin where accord to stipulation the ratification be to be exchange i be happy to announce to you that after many delay and difficulty a treaty of commerce and navigation between the united state and portugal be conclude and sign at lisbon on the 26th of August last by the plenipotentiary of the two government its stipulation be found upon those principle of mutual liberality and advantage which the united state have always seek to make the basis of they intercourse with foreign power and it be hope they will tend to foster and strengthen the commercial intercourse of the two country under the appropriation of the last session of congress a agent have be send to germany for the purpose of promote the interest of we tobacco trade the commissioner appoint under the convention for the adjustment of claim of citizen of the united state upon mexico have meet and organize at washington in August last the papers in the possession of the government relate to those claim be communicate to the board the claim not embrace by that convention be now the subject of negotiation between the two government through the medium of we minister at mexico nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of we relation with the different government of south america i regret however to be oblige to inform you that the claim of we citizen upon the late republic of colombium have not yet be satisfy by the separate government into which it have be resolve the charg d'affaire of brazil have express the intention of he government not to prolong the treaty of 1828 it will cease to be obligatory upon either party on the 12th day of December 1841 when the extensive commercial intercourse between the united state and that vast empire will no longer be regulate by express stipulation it afford I pleasure to communicate to you that the government of chili have enter into a agreement to indemnify the claimant in the case of the _ macedonian _ for american property seize in 1819 and to add that information have also be receive which justify the hope of a early adjustment of the remain claim upon that government the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the convention between the united state and texa for mark the boundary between they have accord to the last report receive from we commissioner survey and establish the whole extent of the boundary north along the western bank of the sabine river from its entrance into the gulf of mexico to the thirty-second degree of north latitude the commission adjourn on the 16th of June last to reassemble on the 1st of November for the purpose of establish accurately the intersection of the thirty-second degree of latitude with the western bank of the sabine and the meridian line thence to red river it be presume that the work will be conclude in the present season the present sound condition of they finances and the success with which embarrassment in regard to they at time apparently insurmountable have be overcome be matter upon which the people and government of the united state may well congratulate themselves a overflow treasury however it may be regard as a evidence of public prosperity be seldom conducive to the permanent welfare of any people and experience have demonstrate its incompatibility with the salutary action of political institution like those of the united state we safest reliance for financial efficiency and independence have on the contrary be find to consist in ample resource unencumbered with debt and in this respect the federal government occupy a singularly fortunate and truly enviable position when i enter upon the discharge of my official duty in march 1837 the act for the distribution of the surplus revenue be in a course of rapid execution nearly $ 28000000 of the public money be in pursuance of its provision deposit with the state in the month of January April and July of that year in may there occur a general suspension of specie payment by the bank include with very few exception those in which the public money be deposit and upon whose fidelity the government have unfortunately make itself dependent for the revenue which have be collect from the people and be indispensable to the public service this suspension and the excess in banking and commerce out of which it arise and which be greatly aggravate by its occurrence make to a great extent unavailable the principal part of the public money then on hand suspend the collection of many million accrue on merchant ' bond and greatly reduce the revenue arise from custom and the public land these effect have continue to operate in various degree to the present period and in addition to the decrease in the revenue thus produce two and a half million of duty have be relinquish by two biennial reduction under the act of 1833 and probably as much more upon the importation of iron for railroad by special legislation whilst such have be we condition for the last four year in relation to revenue we have during the same period be subject to a unavoidable continuance of large extraordinary expense necessarily grow out of past transaction and which could not be immediately arrest without great prejudice to the public interest of these the charge upon the treasury in consequence of the cherokee treaty alone without advert to other arise out of indian treaty have already exceed $ 5000000 that for the prosecution of measure for the removal of the seminole indian which be find in progress have be nearly fourteen million and the public building have require the unusual sum of nearly three million it afford I however great pleasure to be able to say that from the commencement of this period to the present day every demand upon the government at home or abroad have be promptly meet this have be do not only without create a permanent debt or a resort to additional taxation in any form but in the midst of a steadily progressive reduction of exist burden upon the people leave still a considerable balance of available fund which will remain in the treasury at the end of the year the small amount of treasury note not exceed $ 4500000 still outstanding and less by twenty-three million than the united state have in deposit with the state be compose of such only as be not yet due or have not be present for payment they may be redeem out of the accrue revenue if the expenditure do not exceed the amount within which they may it be think be keep without prejudice to the public interest and the revenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipate among the reflection arise from the contemplation of these circumstance one not the least gratifying be the consciousness that the government have the resolution and the ability to adhere in every emergency to the sacred obligation of law to execute all its contract accord to the requirement of the constitution and thus to present when most need a rally point by which the business of the whole country might be bring back to a safe and unvarying standard -- a result vitally important as well to the interest as to the moral of the people there can surely now be no difference of opinion in regard to the incalculable evil that would have arise if the government at that critical moment have suffer itself to be deter from uphold the only true standard of value either by the pressure of adverse circumstance or the violence of unmerited denunciation the manner in which the people sustain the performance of this duty be highly honorable to they fortitude and patriotism it can not fail to stimulate they agent to adhere under all circumstance to the line of duty and to satisfy they of the safety with which a course really right and demand by a financial crisis may in a community like ours be pursue however apparently severe its immediate operation the policy of the federal government in extinguish as rapidly as possible the national debt and subsequently in resist every temptation to create a new one deserve to be regard in the same favorable light among the many objection to a national debt the certain tendency of public security to concentrate ultimately in the coffer of foreign stockholder be one which be every day gathering strength already have the resource of many of the state and the future industry of they citizen be indefinitely mortgage to the subject of european government to the amount of twelve million annually to pay the constantly accrue interest on borrow money -- a sum exceed half the ordinary revenue of the whole united state the pretext which this relation afford to foreigner to scrutinize the management of we domestic affair if not actually to intermeddle with they present a subject for earnest attention not to say of serious alarm fortunately the federal government with the exception of a obligation enter into in behalf of the district of columbium which must soon be discharge be wholly exempt from any such embarrassment it be also as be believe the only government which have fully and faithfully pay all its creditor have also relieve itself entirely from debt to maintain a distinction so desirable and so honorable to we national character should be a object of earnest solicitude never should a free people if it be possible to avoid it expose themselves to the necessity of have to treat of the peace the honor or the safety of the republic with the government of foreign creditor who however well disposed they may be to cultivate with we in general friendly relation be nevertheless by the law of they own condition make hostile to the success and permanency of political institution like ours most humiliating may be the embarrassment consequent upon such a condition another objection scarcely less formidable to the commencement of a new debt be its inevitable tendency to increase in magnitude and to foster national extravagance he have be a unprofitable observer of event who need at this day to be admonish of the difficulty which a government habitually dependent on loan to sustain its ordinary expenditure have to encounter in resist the influence constantly exert in favor of additional loan by capitalist who enrich themselves by government security for amount much exceed the money they actually advance -- a prolific source of individual aggrandizement in all borrow country by stockholder who seek they gain in the rise and fall of public stock and by the selfish importunity of applicant for appropriation for work avowedly for the accommodation of the public but the real object of which be too frequently the advancement of private interest the known necessity which so many of the state will be under to impose tax for the payment of the interest on they debt furnish a additional and very cogent reason why the federal government should refrain from create a national debt by which the people would be expose to double taxation for a similar object we possess within ourselves ample resource for every emergency and we may be quite sure that we citizen in no future exigency will be unwilling to supply the government with all the means ask for the defense of the country in time of peace there can at all event be no justification for the creation of a permanent debt by the federal government its limited range of constitutional duty may certainly under such circumstance be perform without such a resort it have it be see be avoid during four year of greater fiscal difficulty than have exist in a similar period since the adoption of the constitution and one also remarkable for the occurrence of extraordinary cause of expenditure but to accomplish so desirable a object two thing be indispensable : first that the action of the federal government be keep within the boundary prescribe by its founder and secondly that all appropriation for object admit to be constitutional and the expenditure of they also be subject to a standard of rigid but well-considered and practical economy the first depend chiefly on the people themselves -- the opinion they form of the true construction of the constitution and the confidence they repose in the political sentiment of those they select as they representative in the federal legislature the second rest upon the fidelity with which they more immediate representative and other public functionary discharge the trust commit to they the duty of economize the expense of the public service be admit on all hand yet there be few subject upon which there exist a wider difference of opinion than be constantly manifest in regard to the fidelity with which that duty be discharge neither diversity of sentiment nor even mutual recrimination upon a point in respect to which the public mind be so justly sensitive can well be entirely avoid and least so at period of great political excitement a intelligent people however seldom fail to arrive in the end at correct conclusion in such a matter practical economy in the management of public affair can have no adverse influence to contend with more powerful than a large surplus revenue and the unusually large appropriation for 1837 may without doubt independently of the extraordinary requisition for the public service grow out of the state of we indian relation be in no inconsiderable degree trace to this source the sudden and rapid distribution of the large surplus then in the treasury and the equally sudden and unprecedentedly severe revulsion in the commerce and business of the country point with unerring certainty to a great and protracted reduction of the revenue strengthen the propriety of the earliest practicable reduction of the public expenditure but to change a system operating upon so large a surface and applicable to such numerous and diversified interest and object be more than the work of a day the attention of every department of the government be immediately and in good faith direct to that end and have be so continue to the present moment the estimate and appropriation for the year 1838 -lrb- the first over which i have any control -rrb- be somewhat diminish the expenditure of 1839 be reduce $ 6000000 those of 1840 exclusive of disbursement for public debt and trust claim will probably not exceed twenty-two and a half million be between two and three million less than those of the preceding year and nine or ten million less than those of 1837 nor have it be find necessary in order to produce this result to resort to the power confer by congress of postpone certain class of the public work except by defer expenditure for a short period upon a limited portion of they and which postponement terminate some time since -- at the moment the treasury department by further receipt from the indebted bank become fully assure of its ability to meet they without prejudice to the public service in other respects cause be in operation which will it be believe justify a still further reduction without injury to any important national interest the expense of sustain the troops employ in florida have be gradually and greatly reduce through the persevere effort of the war department and a reasonable hope may be entertain that the necessity for military operation in that quarter will soon cease the removal of the indian from within we settle border be nearly complete the pension list one of the heaviest charge upon the treasury be rapidly diminish by death the most costly of we public building be either finish or nearly so and we may i think safely promise ourselves a continue exemption from border difficulty the available balance in the treasury on the 1st of January next be estimate at $ 1500000 this sum with the expect receipt from all source during the next year will it be believe be sufficient to enable the government to meet every engagement and have a suitable balance in the treasury at the end of the year if the remedial measure connect with the custom and the public land heretofore recommend be adopt and the new appropriation by congress shall not carry the expenditure beyond the official estimate the new system establish by congress for the safe-keeping of the public money prescribe the kind of currency to be receive for the public revenue and provide additional guard and security against loss have now be several month in operation although it might be premature upon a experience of such limited duration to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of its influence in correct many evil under which the federal government and the country have hitherto suffer especially those that have grow out of banking expansion a depreciated currency and official defalcation yet it be but right to say that nothing have occur in the practical operation of the system to weaken in the slightest degree but much to strengthen the confident anticipation of its friend the grounds of these have be heretofore so fully explain as to require no recapitulation in respect to the facility and convenience it afford in conduct the public service and the ability of the government to discharge through its agency every duty attendant on the collection transfer and disbursement of the public money with promptitude and success i can say with confidence that the apprehension of those who feel it to be they duty to oppose its adoption have prove to be unfounded on the contrary this branch of the fiscal affair of the government have be and it be believe may always be thus carry on with every desirable facility and security a few change and improvement in the detail of the system without affect any principle involve in it will be submit to you by the secretary of the treasury and will i be sure receive at you hand that attention to which they may on examination be find to be entitle i have deem this brief summary of we fiscal affair necessary to the due performance of a duty specially enjoin upon I by the constitution it will serve also to illustrate more fully the principle by which i have be guide in reference to two contest point in we public policy which be earliest in they development and have be more important in they consequence than any that have arise under we complicated and difficult yet admirable system of government i allude to a national debt and a national bank it be in these that the political contest by which the country have be agitate ever since the adoption of the constitution in a great measure originate and there be too much reason to apprehend that the conflict interest and oppose principle thus marshal will continue as heretofore to produce similar if not aggravate consequence come into office the declare enemy of both i have earnestly endeavor to prevent a resort to either the consideration that a large public debt afford a apology and produce in some degree a necessity also for resort to a system and extent of taxation which be not only oppressive throughout but be likewise so apt to lead in the end to the commission of that most odious of all offens against the principle of republican government the prostitution of political power confer for the general benefit to the aggrandizement of particular class and the gratification of individual cupidity be alone sufficient independently of the weighty objection which have already be urge to render its creation and existence the source of bitter and unappeasable discord if we add to this its inevitable tendency to produce and foster extravagant expenditure of the public money by which a necessity be create for new loan and new burden on the people and finally refer to the example of every government which have exist for proof how seldom it be that the system when once adopt and implant in the policy of a country have fail to expand itself until public credit be exhaust and the people be no longer able to endure its increase weight it seem impossible to resist the conclusion that no benefit result from its career no extent of conquest no accession of wealth to particular class nor any nor all its combined advantage can counterbalance its ultimate but certain result -- a splendid government and a impoverished people if a national bank be as be undeniable repudiate by the framer of the constitution as incompatible with the rights of the state and the liberty of the people if from the begin it have be regard by large portion of we citizen as come in direct collision with that great and vital amendment of the constitution which declare that all power not confer by that instrument on the general government be reserve to the state and to the people if it have be view by they as the first great step in the march of latitudinous construction which unchecked would render that sacred instrument of as little value as a unwritten constitution dependent as it would alone be for its meaning on the interested interpretation of a dominant party and afford no security to the rights of the minority -- if such be undeniably the case what rational grounds could have be conceive for anticipate aught but determine opposition to such a institution at the present day could a different result have be expect when the consequence which have flow from its creation and particularly from its struggle to perpetuate its existence have confirm in so strike a manner the apprehension of its earliest opponent when it have be so clearly demonstrate that a concentrated money power wield so vast a capital and combine such incalculable means of influence may in those peculiar conjuncture to which this government be unavoidably expose prove a overmatch for the political power of the people themselves when the true character of its capacity to regulate accord to its will and its interest and the interest of its favorite the value and production of the labor and property of every man in this extended country have be so fully and fearfully develop when it be notorious that all class of this great community have by means of the power and influence it thus possess be infect to madness with a spirit of heedless speculation when it have be see that secure in the support of the combination of influence by which it be surround it could violate its charter and set the law at defiance with impunity and when too it have become most apparent that to believe that such a accumulation of power can ever be grant without the certainty of be abuse be to indulge in a fatal delusion to avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and its inevitable consequence i have advocate and endeavor to carry into effect the policy of confine the appropriation for the public service to such object only as be clearly within the constitutional authority of the federal government of exclude from its expense those improvident and unauthorized grant of public money for work of internal improvement which be so wisely arrest by the constitutional interposition of my predecessor and which if they have not be so check would long before this time have involve the finances of the general government in embarrassment far greater than those which be now experience by any of the state of limit all we expenditure to that simple unostentatious and economical administration of public affair which be alone consistent with the character of we institution of collect annually from the custom and the sale of public land a revenue fully adequate to defray all the expense thus incur but under no pretense whatsoever to impose tax upon the people to a greater amount than be actually necessary to the public service conduct upon the principle i have state in lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon bank of any description for the management of we fiscal affair i recommend the adoption of the system which be now in successful operation that system afford every requisite facility for the transaction of the pecuniary concern of the government will it be confidently anticipate produce in other respects many of the benefit which have be from time to time expect from the creation of a national bank but which have never be realize avoid the manifold evil inseparable from such a institution diminish to a greater extent than could be accomplish by any other measure of reform the patronage of the federal government -- a wise policy in all government but more especially so in one like ours which work well only in proportion as it be make to rely for its support upon the unbiased and unadulterated opinion of its constituent do away forever all dependence on corporate body either in the raise collect safekeeping or disburse the public revenue and place the government equally above the temptation of foster a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the necessity of adapt its policy to the view and interest of a still more formidable money power abroad it be by adopt and carry out these principle under circumstance the most arduous and discourage that the attempt have be make thus far successfully to demonstrate to the people of the united state that a national bank at all time and a national debt except it be incur at a period when the honor and safety of the nation demand the temporary sacrifice of a policy which should only be abandon in such exigency be not merely unnecessary but in direct and deadly hostility to the principle of they government and to they own permanent welfare the progress make in the development of these position appear in the precede sketch of the past history and present state of the financial concern of the federal government the fact there state fully authorize the assertion that all the purpose for which this government be institute have be accomplish during four year of greater pecuniary embarrassment than be ever before experience in time of peace and in the face of opposition as formidable as any that be ever before array against the policy of a administration that this have be do when the ordinary revenue of the government be generally decrease as well from the operation of the law as the condition of the country without the creation of a permanent public debt or incur any liability other than such as the ordinary resource of the government will speedily discharge and without the agency of a national bank if this view of the proceedings of the government for the period it embrace be warrant by the fact as they be know to exist if the army and navy have be sustain to the full extent authorize by law and which congress deem sufficient for the defense of the country and the protection of its rights and its honor if its civil and diplomatic service have be equally sustain if ample provision have be make for the administration of justice and the execution of the law if the claim upon public gratitude in behalf of the soldier of the revolution have be promptly meet and faithfully discharge if there have be no failure in defray the very large expenditure grow out of that long-continued and salutary policy of peacefully remove the indian to region of comparative safety and prosperity if the public faith have at all time and everywhere be most scrupulously maintain by a prompt discharge of the numerous extended and diversified claim on the treasury -- if all these great and permanent object with many other that might be state have for a series of year mark by peculiar obstacle and difficulty be successfully accomplish without a resort to a permanent debt or the aid of a national bank have we not a right to expect that a policy the object of which have be to sustain the public service independently of either of these fruitful source of discord will receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased and fairly elicited judgment upon public affair be never ultimately wrong that embarrassment in the pecuniary concern of individual of unexampled extent and duration have recently exist in this as in other commercial nation be undoubtedly true to suppose it necessary now to trace these reverse to they source would be a reflection on the intelligence of my fellow-citizen whatever may have be the obscurity in which the subject be involve during the earlier stage of the revulsion there can not now be many by whom the whole question be not fully understand not deem it within the constitutional power of the general government to repair private loss sustain by reverse in business have no connection with the public service either by direct appropriation from the treasury or by special legislation design to secure exclusive privilege and immunity to individual or class in preference to or at the expense of the great majority necessarily debar from any participation in they no attempt to do so have be either make recommend or encourage by the present executive it be believe however that the great purpose for the attainment of which the federal government be institute have not be lose sight of intrust only with certain limited power cautiously enumerate distinctly specify and define with a precision and clearness which would seem to defy misconstruction it have be my constant aim to confine myself within the limit so clearly mark out and so carefully guard have always be of opinion that the best preservative of the union of the state be to be find in a total abstinence from the exercise of all doubtful power on the part of the federal government rather than in attempt to assume they by a loose construction of the constitution or a ingenious perversion of its word i have endeavor to avoid recommend any measure which i have reason to apprehend would in the opinion even of a considerable minority of my fellow-citizen be regard as trenching on the rights of the state or the provision of the hallowed instrument of we union view the aggregate power of the federal government as a voluntary concession of the state it seem to I that such only should be exercise as be at the time intend to be give i have be strengthen too in the propriety of this course by the conviction that all effort to go beyond this tend only to produce dissatisfaction and distrust to excite jealousy and to provoke resistance instead of add strength to the federal government even when successful they must ever prove a source of incurable weakness by alienate a portion of those whose adhesion be indispensable to the great aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary attachment be in my estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government strong in the best of all possible strength -- the confidence and attachment of all those who make up its constituent element thus believe it have be my purpose to secure to the whole people and to every member of the confederacy by general salutary and equal law alone the benefit of those republican institution which it be the end and aim of the constitution to establish and the impartial influence of which be in my judgment indispensable to they preservation i can not bring myself to believe that the lasting happiness of the people the prosperity of the state or the permanency of they union can be maintain by give preference or priority to any class of citizen in the distribution of benefit or privilege or by the adoption of measure which enrich one portion of the union at the expense of another nor can i see in the interference of the federal government with the local legislation and reserve rights of the state a remedy for present or a security against future danger the first and assuredly not the least important step toward relieve the country from the condition into which it have be plunge by excess in trade banking and credit of all kind be to place the business transaction of the government itself on a solid basis give and receive in all case value for value and neither countenance nor encourage in other that delusive system of credit from which it have be find so difficult to escape and which have leave nothing behind it but the wreck that mark its fatal career that the financial affair of the government be now and have be during the whole period of these wide-spreading difficulty conduct with a strict and invariable regard to this great fundamental principle and that by the assumption and maintenance of the stand thus take on the very threshold of the approach crisis more than by any other cause or cause whatever the community at large have be shield from the incalculable evil of a general and indefinite suspension of specie payment and a consequent annihilation for the whole period it might have last of a just and invariable standard of value will it be believe at this period scarcely be question a steady adherence on the part of the government to the policy which have produce such salutary result aid by judicious state legislation and what be not less important by the industry enterprise perseverance and economy of the american people can not fail to raise the whole country at a early period to a state of solid and enduring prosperity not subject to be again overthrow by the suspension of bank or the explosion of a bloated credit system it be for the people and they representative to decide whether or not the permanent welfare of the country -lrb- which all good citizen equally desire however widely they may differ as to the means of its accomplishment -rrb- shall be in this way secure or whether the management of the pecuniary concern of the government and by consequence to a great extent those of individual also shall be carry back to a condition of thing which foster those contraction and expansion of the currency and those reckless abuse of credit from the baleful effect of which the country have so deeply suffer -- a return that can promise in the end no better result than to reproduce the embarrassment the government have experience and to remove from the shoulder of the present to those of fresh victim the bitter fruit of that spirit of speculative enterprise to which we countryman be so liable and upon which the lesson of experience be so unavailing the choice be a important one and i sincerely hope that it may be wisely make a report from the secretary of war present a detailed view of the affair of that department accompany this communication the desultory duty connect with the removal of the indian in which the army have be constantly engage on the northern and western frontier and in florida have render it impracticable to carry into full effect the plan recommend by the secretary for improve its discipline in every instance where the regiment have be concentrate they have make great progress and the best result may be anticipate from a continuance of this system during the last season a part of the troops have be employ in remove indian from the interior to the territory assign they in the west -- a duty which they have perform efficiently and with praiseworthy humanity -- and that portion of they which have be station in florida continue active operation there throughout the heat of summer the policy of the united state in regard to the indian of which a succinct account be give in my message of 1838 and of the wisdom and expediency of which i be fully satisfy have be continue in active operation throughout the whole period of my administration since the spring of 1837 more than 40000 indian have be remove to they new home west of the mississippus and i be happy to add that all account concur in represent the result of this measure as eminently beneficial to that people the emigration of the seminole alone have be attend with serious difficulty and occasioned bloodshed hostility have be commence by the indian in florida under the apprehension that they would be compel by force to comply with they treaty stipulation the execution of the treaty of payne land sign in 1832 but not ratify until 1834 be postpone at the solicitation of the indian until 1836 when they again renew they agreement to remove peaceably to they new home in the west in the face of this solemn and renew compact they break they faith and commence hostility by the massacre of major dade 's command the murder of they agent general thompson and other act of cruel treachery when this alarming and unexpected intelligence reach the seat of government every effort appear to have be make to reenforce general clinch who command the troops then in florida general eusti be dispatch with reenforcement from charleston troops be call out from alabama tennessee and georgium and general scott be send to take the command with ample power and ample means at the first alarm general gaine organize a force at new orlean and without wait for order land in florida where he deliver over the troops he have bring with he to general scott governor call be subsequently appoint to conduct a summer campaign and at the close of it be replace by general jesup these event and change take place under the administration of my predecessor notwithstanding the exertion of the experienced officer who have command there for eighteen month on enter upon the administration of the government i find the territory of florida a prey to indian atrocity a strenuous effort be immediately make to bring those hostility to a close and the army under general jesup be reenforce until it amount to 10000 man and furnish with abundant supplies of every description in this campaign a great number of the enemy be capture and destroy but the character of the contest only be change the indian have be defeat in every engagement disperse in small band throughout the country and become a enterprising formidable and ruthless bandit general taylor who succeed general jesup use he best exertion to subdue they and be second in he effort by the officer under he command but he too fail to protect the territory from they depredation by a act of signal and cruel treachery they break the truce make with they by general macomb who be send from washington for the purpose of carry into effect the express wish of congress and have continue they devastation ever since general armistead who be in florida when general taylor leave the army by permission assume the command and after active summer operation be meet by proposition for peace and from the fortunate coincidence of the arrival in florida at the same period of a delegation from the seminole who be happily settle west of the mississippus and be now anxious to persuade they countryman to join they there hope be for some time entertain that the indian might be induce to leave the territory without further difficulty these hope have prove fallacious and hostility have be renew throughout the whole of the territory that this contest have endure so long be to be attribute to cause beyond the control of the government experience general have have the command of the troops officer and soldier have alike distinguish themselves for they activity patience and endure courage the army have be constantly furnish with supplies of every description and we must look for the cause which have so long procrastinate the issue of the contest in the vast extent of the theater of hostility the almost insurmountable obstacle present by the nature of the country the climate and the wily character of the savage the site for marine hospital on the river and lake which i be authorize to select and cause to be purchase have all be designate but the appropriation not prove sufficient conditional arrangement only have be make for they acquisition it be for congress to decide whether these conditional purchase shall be sanction and the humane intention of the law carry into full effect the navy as will appear from the accompany report of the secretary have be usefully and honorably employ in the protection of we commerce and citizen in the mediterranean the pacific on the coast of brazil and in the gulf of mexico a small squadron consist of the frigate _ constellation _ and the sloop of war _ boston _ under commodore kearney be now on its way to the china and indian sea for the purpose of attend to we interest in that quarter and commander aulick in the sloop of war _ yorktown _ have be instruct to visit the sandwich and society island the coast of new zealand and japan together with other port and island frequent by we whale ship for the purpose of give they countenance and protection should they be require other smaller vessel have be and still be employ in prosecute the survey of the coast of the united state direct by various act of congress and those which have be complete will shortly be lay before you the explore expedition at the latest date be prepare to leave the bay of island new zealand in further prosecution of object which have thus far be successfully accomplish the discovery of

1800 mile but on which they be prevent from landing by vast body of ice which encompass it be one of the honorable result of the enterprise lieutenant wilke bear testimony to the zeal and good conduct of he officer and man and it be but justice to that officer to state that he appear to have perform the duty assign he with a ardor ability and perseverance which give every assurance of a honorable

they principal chief be desirous before the close of he life now draw near to effect a negotiation as in he opinion the emigration or extinction of the tribe be the alternative before they and suggest that the most judicious course would be to conduct the business informally at the annuity payment in reply he be inform on the 2d July that the department do not open negotiation for the purchase of indian land unless thereto previously authorize by congress and that at the request of a portion of the representation of indiana a estimate have be furnish of the sum that would be require to hold a

address to you by the hon oh smith of the senate of the united state from indiana inclosing a letter from mr hamilton date on the 11th urge the vast importance of treat with the miamy as well to they as to the state and give the reason which in the judgment of both lead to the conclusion that they particular case should form a exception to the general rule that obtain in regard of indian treaty and recommend strongly the appointment of general milroy as a suitable person to conduct the negotiation a communication of similar character -lrb- except the last feature -rrb- dated 20th August be receive from mr milroy the letter of the hon mr smith be refer by you to this office and on the 27th August after a conference with you on the subject i reply that exception to the rule state might under very peculiar circumstance exist but that as the senate certainly and it be believe the house too have reject a application for a appropriation the opening of a negotiation might be consider to be oppose to a expression of legislative opinion in answer to the suggestion that little or perhaps no expense need be incur as the treaty could be make at the payment of the annuity it be remark that the consideration money must necessarily be large as the miamus land be very valuable and a appropriation of it require which congress might be disincline to grant after what have happen that it be therefore deem advisable to decline treat and that perhaps a future application for legislative sanction might be more successful of this letter a copy be send to general milroy as a reply on the subject in hand to he communication of 31st July and he letter of 20th August be further answer on 2d September -lrb- c -lrb- 86 -rrb- -rrb- in consequence of the representation refer to and probably other which do not reach I you address I a unofficial note on 14th September suggest that allen hamilton esq might at the payment of the annuity make a arrangement with the miamy that would be gratify to the people as well as beneficial to the service with this express wish of the head of the department and after consultation with you i write unofficial letter to general samuel milroy and to allen hamilton esq on the 18th September setting forth the view of the department as hereinbefore express in regard of precedent legislative sanction and the importance to indiana of treat with the miamy whose disposition to cede they remain land on just and equitable term might not continue it be think however to be in keep with the rule adopt to ascertain informally from the miamy what they would be willing to take for they land when it be they pleasure to emigrate etc it be doubt whether it would be judicious to reduce the term to write however informally on account of the difficulty there might be in convince the indian that it be not a treaty although it be desirable if it could be safely do that it should be so and they be inform that a report from they would answer all my purpose as my object be to be able to say to each branch of congress upon what term the miamus land can be have by the united state so that if the term be approve the necessary law may be pass it be suggest that the annuity payment would afford a good opportunity for procure the information desire which it be expect could be have without any expense for which there be no fund and that if there be it would not be proper to expend they in the way propose -lrb- d -lrb- 86 -rrb- -rrb- i desire to state the fact as they exist so fully as to exhibit precisely what have be the action of the department without go into more detail than may be necessary and therefore annex extract and copy of the papers refer to instead of embody they in this communication on the 28th day of November last a treaty be conclude by

consent to cede they remain land in indiana to the united state subject as they understand it to the approval of the department and the approval and ratification of the president and senate of the united state before be of any binding force or efficiency as a treaty with the original treaty i send a copy of the explanatory letter and of a communication from general milroy give the reason for the money provision make for the chief richardville and the family of chief godfrey -lrb- e -lrb- 86 -rrb- -rrb- it will be thus see that the negotiation of a treaty be not authorize but if in the opinion of the president and senate it shall be advisable to adopt and confirm it i do not see any legal objection to such a course the quantity of land cede be estimate at about 500000 acre for which the consideration be fix at $ 550000 or $ 110 per acre of which $ 250000 be payable presently and the balance in annual payment of $ 15000 which will be discharge in twenty year in addition we will be

reserve to the chief richardville seven section of land and to he and the family of the deceased chief godfrey be to be pay respectively considerable sum of money which it seem from the statement of general milroy be debt due to they and acknowledge by the tribe the treaty of November 1838 which be ratify on the 8th February 1839 extinguish the indian title to about 177000 acre of land and cost the united state $ 335680 or nearly $ 2 per acre measure by this price the present arrangement would seem to be very advantageous it be state by messr milroy and hamilton that more favorable term will not be assent to by the miamy under any circumstance and consider the great importance of the adoption of this compact however irregularly make to the state of indiana as well as the belief that any postponement will probably swallow up what remain to these indian in debt which they most improvidently contract and the conviction that nothing can save they from moral ruin but they removal west i

can be keep in the field have elapse and although no delay take place in the appointment of commissioner to carry it into effect the organization of the board be not effect in consequence of the refusal of one of the commissioner and the agent to accept of they nomination the commissioner act under these disadvantage have do all that lay in they power to accomplish the greatest practicable extent of work and have obtain many result which can not but be important in the examination of the vex and important question which have be commit to they but after have fully and maturely consider the subject and interchange the result of they respective operation they have come to the conclusion that it would be premature to embody the partial result which they have attain in a general report for the purpose of be lay before the political and scientific world the meridian line of the st croix have not be carry to a distance of more than 50 mile from the monument at the source of that river and the operation of the other commissioner although they have cover a wide extent of country have fulfil but one part of the duty assign they namely that of exploration while even in the part explore

original official character as approve by the whole nation to this publication you commission beg leave to refer as embody a argument which may be style unanswerable the operation of the party under the command of the several commissioner be as follow : the party under the direction of professor renwick leave portland in detachment on the 26th and 27th of August the place of general rendezvous be fix at woodstock or fail that at the grand fall of the st john the commissary of the party proceed as speedily as possible to oldtown in order to procure boat and engage man professor renwick pass by

they to keep register to be use as corresponding observation with those of the expedition at augusta some additional article of equipment be obtain from the authority of the state but the barometer which it have be hope might have be procure be find to be unfit for service at houlton two tent and a number of knapsack with some gunpowder be furnish by the politeness of general busti from the government store the boat and all the store reach woodstock on the 3d September and all the party be collect except one engineer who have be leave behind at bangor in the hope of obtain another barometer a bateau be therefore leave to bring he on the remainder of the boat be load and the party embark on the st john on the morning of the 4th of September this the main body reach the grand fall at noon on the 8th of September the remain bateau with the engineer arrive the next evening have ascend the rapid of the st john in a time short beyond precedent on its arrival it be find that the barometer on whose receipt reliance have be place have not be complete in time and although as be learn afterwards it have be commit as soon as finish by the maker to the care of major graham the other commissioner feel compel to set out before he have join they the want of this barometer in which defect observe in the other have be remedy be of no little detriment a delay of eighteen day have occur in portland in consequence of the refusal of messr cleavelaud and jarvi to accept they appointment and it be know from the experience of the commissioner send out in 1838 by the state of maine that it would require at least three week to reach the line claim by the united state from bangor it be therefore imperative to push forward unless the risk of have the whole of the operation of this party paralyze by the setting in of winter be to be encounter it be also ascertain at the grand fall that the stream which be to be ascend be always shallow and rapid and that at the moment they be extremely low so that the boat would not carry more store than would be consume within the time require to reach the region assign to professor renwick as he share of the duty and return it become therefore necessary as it have be before fear it must to be content with a exploration instead of a close and accurate survey several of the man employ have be at the northern extremity of the meridian line but they knowledge be limit to that single object inquiry be carefully make for guide through the country between the source of the grande fourche of restigouche and of tuladus but none be to be find one indian only have pass from the head of green river to the grande fourche but he knowledge be limit to a single path in a direction not likely to shed any light on the object of the commission he be however engage the french hunter of madawaska have never penetrate beyond the source of green river and the indian who formerly reside on the upper water of the st john be say to have abandon the country for more than twelve year the party be now divide into four detachment the first to proceed down the restigouche to the tide of the bay of chaleur the second to ascend the grande fourche of restigouche to its source the third to be station on green river mountain the fourth to convey the surplus store and heavy baggage to lake temiscoua and thence to ascend the tuladus and abagusquash to the highest accessible point of the latter it be resolve that the second and fourth detachment should endeavor to cross the country and meet each other follow as far as possible the height of land a general rendezvous be again fix at lake temiscoua in compliance with this plan the first and second detachment ascend the grande river together cross the wagansis portage and reach the confluence of the grande fourche and southwest branch of restigouche the first detachment then descend the unite stream return by the same course to the st john and reach the portage at temiscoua on the 7th October all the intended object of the detachment be happily accomplish the second detachment under the personal direction of the commissioner reach the junction of the north and south branch of the grande fourche on the 22d September two engineer with two man to carry provision be then dispatch to cross the country to the meridian line and thence to proceed westward to join the detachment at kedgwick lake this duty be perform and many valuable observation obtain but a accident by which the barometer be break prevent all the anticipated object of the mission from be accomplish all the store which could possibly be spare be now place in a depot at the junction of the south branch and the commissioner proceed with the boat thus lighten toward kedgwick lake the lighten of the boat be render necessary in consequence of the diminution of the volume of the river and the occurrence of fall over which it would have be impossible to convey they when fully load for want of a guide a branch more western than that which issue from the lake be enter one of the boat be therefore send round into the lake to await the return of the engineer dispatch to the meridian line the store which be all that could be bring up in the state of the water be now find to be wholly insufficient to allow of commit the party to the unexplored country between this stream and tuladus even the four day which must intervene before the return of the engineer could be expect would do much to exhaust they the commissioner therefore resolve to proceed across the country with no other companion than two man carry ten day ' provision it be hope that four or five day might suffice for the purpose but ten of great toil and difficulty be spend before lake tuladus be reach the remainder of the detachment unite by the return of the engineer descend the north branch of the grande fourche to the junction of the south branch ascend the latter and make the portage to green river in this the boat be completely wear out and the last of they food exhaust just at the moment that supply send up the green river to meet they arrive at they camp no arrangement which could have be make would have suffice to prevent the risk of famine which be thus encounter by the second detachment a greater number of boat would have require more man and these would have eat all they could have carry no other actual suffering but great fatigue and anxiety be encounter and it be now obvious that have the rain which be so abundant during the first week of October be snow -lrb- as they sometimes be in that climate -rrb- there would have be a risk of the detachment perish the third detachment reach they station on green river mountain on the 13th September and continue there until the 12th October a full set of barometric observation be make the latitude well determine by numerous altitude and the longitude approximately by some lunar observation the fourth detachment after deposit the store intend for the return of the party in charge of the british commissary at fort ingall who politely undertake the care of they ascend the tuladus and take its northern branch reach lake abagusquash here one of the engineer wound himself severely and be render unfit for duty the commissary then proceed a journey of five day toward the east blaze a path and making signal to guide the second detachment the difference between the country as it actually exist and as represent on any map prevent the commissioner from meeting this party it find the source of the central or main branch of tuladus to the north of that of the abagusquash and follow the height of land reach the deep and narrow valley of the rimouskus at the point where on the british map that stream be represent as issue from a ridge of mountain far north of the line offer to the king of the netherland as the bound of the american claim the commissary therefore find it impossible to ascend rimouskus to its source and cross its valley find himself again on a divide ridge where he soon strike a stream run to the southeast this from a comparison of course and distance be believe to be the source of the main branch of the grande fourche of ristaymoh and thus the second and fourth detachment have reach point within a very short distance of each other the greater breadth of the divide ridge have thus be explore but it will remain to trace the limit of the valley of the rimouskus which will form a deep indenture in the boundary line this line have be explore a party be form after the assemblage of the several division at temiscoua for the purpose of level it with the barometer but the expedition be frustrate by a heavy snowstorm which set in on the 12th October this the most important part of the whole northern line therefore remain for future investigation it can only be state that strong grounds exist for the belief that its summit be not only higher than any point which have be measure but that although cut by the rimouskus it exceed in average elevation any part of the dispute territory the leveling of the temiscoua portage appear to be a object of great importance not only on its own account but as furnish a base for future operation as soon as a sufficient force have be assemble at lake temiscoua a party be therefore form to survey the portage with a theodolite order be also give by the commissioner that the first barometer which should be return should be carry over the portage it be believe that this double provision would have secure the examination of this point beyond the chance of failure a snowstorm however -lrb- the same which interrupt the last operation refer to -rrb- set in after the level have be run to the mountain of biort and one of the labor man wear out by he precede fatigue fall sick the party be thus render insufficient the engineer in command find himself compel to return the contemplated operation with the barometer be also frustrate for on examination at temiscoua it be find that all be unfit for further service in order that the desire object might be accomplish a new expedition be dispatch from new york on the 12th of November furnish with four barometer this party by great exertion reach st andr on the st lawrence on the eighth day and accomplish the object of its mission the operation be render possible at this inclement season by its be confine to a beaten road and in the vicinity of human habitation the country which have be the object of this reconnoissance be as may already be understand of very difficult access from the settle part of the state of maine it be also at best almost impenetrable except by the water course it furnish no supplies except fish and small game nor can these be obtain by a survey party which can not be strong enough to allow for hunter and fisherman as a constituent part the third detachment alone derive any important benefit from these source the best mode of supply a party move on the eastern section would be to draw provision and store from the st lawrence it be indeed now obvious although it be contrary to the belief of any of the person profess to be acquaint with the subject that have the commissioner proceed from new york by the way of montreal and quebec he must have reach the district assign to he a fortnight earlier and have accomplish twice as much work as he party be able to perform although much remains to be do in this region a extensive knowledge of a country hitherto unknown and unexplored have be obtain and this not only shed much light upon the boundary question in its present state but will be of permanent service in case of a further _ ex parte _ examination or of a joint commission be agree upon by the government of great britain and the united state the season be too late for any efficient work as the line to be explore be not reach before the 22d September not only be the river at they lowest ebb but ice be meet in the progress of the party as early as the 12th September and snow fall on the 21st and 22d September the actual setting in of winter which sometimes occur in the first week of October be therefore to be dread from this time the country become unfit for travel of any description until the stream be bind with solid ice and a crust form on the snow of sufficient firmness to make it passable on snowshoe the only road be that along the st john river and it would be almost impossible for a party distant more than 10 or 12 mile from that stream to extricate itself after the winter begin no duty could be well imagine more likely to be disagreeable than that assign to professor renwick the only feasible mode of approach lay for hundred of mile through the acknowledged limit of the british territory and the line he be direct to explore be include within the military post of that nation it may be liken to the entry upon the land of a neighbor for the purpose of inquire into he title under these circumstance of anticipated difficulty it become he duty as well as he pleasure to acknowledge the uniform attention and civility he have experience from all party whether in official or in private station all possibility of interruption by the local authority be prevent by a proclamation of he excellency sir john harvey kcb lieutenant-governor of the province of new brunswick and the british warden colonel maclauchlan be personally instrumental in promote the comfort of the commissioner and he assistant similar attention be receive from the officer of the garrison at fort ingall and the commandant of the citadel of quebec and from he excellency the governor-general even the private person whose property might be affect by the acknowledgment of the american claim exhibit a generous hospitality the party under the direction of captain talcott leave the settlement on hall stream on the 6th of September the main branch of this be follow to its source in a swamp in which a branch of the st franci also have its origin from this point the party follow the ridge divide the atlantic from the st lawrence water until it be suppose that all the branch of indian stream have be head in this work the party be employ until the 14th September it have now arrive at a point where the magalloway river should be find to the leave accord to the most authentic map of the country especially that prepare by the new hampshire commissioner appoint in 1836 to explore the boundary of that state and accompany that report -lrb- 90 -rrb- the party accordingly bear well north to avoid be lead from the true height of land by the divide ridge between the connecticut and androscoggin river after cross several small stream it come on the afternoon of the 15th to a rivulet about 12 foot wide run to the east which be suppose to be the main magalloway the 16th be spend in explore it to its source the next day it be discover that what have be take for the magalloway be a tributary of salmon river a large branch of the st franci and consequently the party be considerably to the north of the boundary the supply of provision do not allow the party to retrace its step to the point where it have diverge from the true divide ridge the course be therefore change until it bear a little south but it be not until the 22d that the party find itself again on the divide ridge and then upon the water of the magalloway the party reach arnold river or chaudiere above lake megantic on the 24th September after have recruit and take a fresh supply of provision from the depot establish there the party be divide into two detachment one return westward to find the corner of the state of new hampshire as mark by the commission in 1789 appoint to trace the boundary line it be there ascertain that the corner be on the true _ divide _ ridge and not from 8 to 10 mile south as have be erroneously report by the surveyor employ by the new hampshire commissioner in 1836 and reiterate in several official papers from the state corner the divide ridge be follow to where it have be previously explore by the party thence a course be take to the northeast so as to reach the head of lake megantic and thence to lake magaumac where on the 8th October the two detachment be again unite the detachment lead by the assistant mr cutt have successfully follow the divide ridge from the camp of the 24th on arnold river to this place it be now ascertain that the provision remain be not sufficient to subsist all of the company until the kennebec road could be reach by follow the _ height of land _ it be think advisable again to separate into two detachment -- one to follow the ridge supply with provision for twenty day and the other to strike for the nearest settlement which it be suppose could be reach in four or five day this movement commence on the 10th October and the detachment follow the high land reach the kennebec road on the 23d and on the follow day provision for the party for fifteen day be place there and a like quantity at the mouth of the metjarmette it be intend that the two detachment should move simultaneously from these two point on the 26th to explore the boundary line as far as lake etchemin a deep snow which commence fall on the night of the 25th compel the commissioner to abandon further exploration at that time and there be not the slightest probability that they could be resume before another year the result of these exploration may be state as follow : about 160 mile of country along or near the _ height of land _ have be traverse the travel distance carefully estimate and the course measure with a compass barometrical observation be make as often as necessary for give a profile of the route from the head of hall stream to arnold or the chaudiere river and thence to lake magaumac via the corner of the state of new hampshire some further barometrical observation be make between the lake and the kennebec road but for a portion of that distance the barometer be unserviceable in consequence of air have enter the tube astronomical observation be make as often as there be a opportunity but owe to the prevalence of cloud not as often as be desirable they will serve for correct the course and estimate distance travel barometrical observation for comparison be make at the intersection of the kennebec road and height of land hourly from 7 be to 5 pm while the party be on the divide ridge the only discovery of interest make by this party be that the magalloway river do not head any of the branch of the connecticut as it be generally believe it do and consequently we claim to hall stream be deprive of the support it would have have from the fact that _ all _ the other branch be head by a atlantic river and consequently could not be reach by the line along the height of land from the northwest angle of nova scotium the other commissioner -lrb- major graham -rrb- do not receive he appointment until 16th August to fill the place leave vacant by the nonacceptance of professor cleaveland and to he be assign the survey and examination of the due north line commence at the source of the river st croix and extend to the highland which divide the water that flow into the river st lawrence from those which flow into the atlantic ocean immediately after receive he appointment he take the necessary step for organize he party and in addition to two officer of the corps of topographical engineer assign to he by the commandant of the corps for this service he call to he aid two civil engineer possess the requisite qualification for the duty to be perform so soon as the requisite instrument could be procure and put in proper order he leave new york for portland I where he arrive on the 5th of September expect there to join he colleague of the commission they have however proceed to the point designate for the commencement of they respective duty the season be too far advance to justify they incur any further delay at portland a short conference be have with mr stubb the agent of the state department who furnish the necessary means for procure a outfit for the party in provision camp equipage etc the party then proceed to bangor where it be occupy until the 12th in procure the necessary supplies of provision camp equipage transportation etc to enable it to take the field and a few astronomical observation be make here for the purpose of test the rate of the chronometer which be to be use upon this service as well as of obtain additional datum for compute the longitude of this place which together with the latitude have be determine by the commissioner by a very near approximation in the summer of 1838 while occupy upon the military reconnoissance of the northeastern frontier on the 12th the party leave bangor for houlton where it arrive on the evening of the 13th a depot of provision be establish here for supply the line of they future operation and the service of the requisite number of man as axmen chain bearer instrument carrier etc be engage pend these preparation and the time necessarily occupy in cut a roadway through the forest from a convenient point on the calai road to the monument at the source of the river st croix a series of astronomical observation be make both by day and by night by which the latitude and longitude of houlton be satisfactorily determine and the rate of the chronometer further test by the 24th of September the roadway be sufficiently open to permit a camp to be establish upon the experimental line trace by the united state and british surveyor in the year 1817 when a attempt be make to mark this portion of the boundary between the two country agreeably to the provision of the treaty of ghent of 1815 the provision and camp equipage be transport upon a strong but roughly construct sled draw by horse whilst the instrument be carry by hand the surface of the country over which this roadway be open be too rough for any wheel vehicle to pass the point decide upon as the true source of the river st croix by the united state and british commissioner appoint for that purpose under the fifth article of the treaty of 1794 be find and identify both by the inscription upon the monument erect there to mark the spot and also by the testimony of a living witness of high respectability who have know the locality since it be first designate by the commissioner under the treaty of 1794 the avenue which have be clear through a dense forest from the monument to a distance of 12 mile north of it by the surveyor in 1817 be easily recognize by the new and thick growth of young timber which have a width of from 40 to 50 foot now occupy it axmen be at once set at work to reopen this avenue under the supposition that the due north line would at least fall within its border for a distance of 12 mile in the meantime the first astronomical station and camp be establish and the transit instrument set up at a distance of 4578 foot north of the monument upon a eminence 45-1\/2 foot above the level of its base this position command a distinct view of the monument to the south and of the whole line to the north for a distance of 11 mile reach to park hill whilst the work of clear the line of its young growth of timber be progress a series of astronomical observation be commence at this first camp and continue both day and night without intermission -lrb- except when interrupt by unfavorable weather -rrb- with the sextant the repeat circle of reflection and the transit instrument until the latitude and longitude of the monument and of this first camp be satisfactorily ascertain and also the direction of the true meridian from the say monument establish for this latter purpose several observation be in the first place make upon the polar star -lrb- -lrb- greek : alpha -rrb- ursa minori -rrb- when at its greatest eastern diurnal elongation and the direction thus obtain be afterwards verify and correct by numerous transit observation upon star pass the meridian at various altitude both north and south of the zenith these be multiply with every degree of care and with the aid of four excellent chronometer whose rate be constantly test not only by the transit observation but also by equal altitude of the sun in the day to correct the time at noon and midnight and by observe altitude of east and west star for correct the same at various hour of the night the direction of this meridian as thus establish by the commissioner be find to vary from the experimental line trace by the surveyor of 1817 by run in the first place to the west of they line then cross it and afterwards deviate considerably to the east of it at the second principal station erect by the party distant 6 mile and 3952 foot north of the first camp or 7 mile and 3240 foot north of the monument it find itself 60 foot to the west of the line of 1817 this appear to be the maximum deviation to the west of that line as near as its trace could be identify which be only mark by permanent object recognize by the party at the termination of each mile from the monument soon after pass this station the line of 1817 be cross and the party do not afterwards touch it but deviate more and more to the east of it as it progress north by a irregular proportion to the distance advance in order to obtain a correct profile or vertical section along the whole extent of this meridian line in the hope of furnish datum for accurate comparison of elevation so far as they might be consider relevant to the subject in dispute between the two government and also to afford a accurate base of comparison for the barometer along a extended line which must traverse many ridge that will be object of minute exploration for many mile of lateral extent a officer be detail to trace a line of level from the base of the monument mark the source of the river st croix to tide water at calai in maine by which mean the elevation of the base of the monument above the plane of mean low and mean high water and also the elevation of several intermediate point of the river st croix on its expand lake surface have be accurately ascertain another officer be at the same time charge with trace a line of level from the base of the same monument along the due north line as mark by the commissioner by which it be intend that every undulation with the absolute height above the plane of mean low water at calai shall be show along the whole extent of that line at park hill distant only 12 mile from the monument a second station for astronomical observation be establish and a camp suitable for that purpose be form on the 26th day of October whilst occupy in complete the prolongation of the meridian line to that point and in establish a camp there the party be visit by a snowstorm which cover the ground to a depth of 4 inch in the course of six hour this be succeed by six day of dark stormy weather which entirely interrupt all progress and terminate by a rain with a change to a milder temperature which clear away the snow during this untoward event the party make themselves as comfortable as practicable in they tent and be occupy in compute many of the astronomical and other observation previously make on the 2d of November the weather become clear and the necessary astronomical observation be immediately commence at park hill from this elevated point the first station could be distinctly see by means of small heliotrope during the day and bright light erect upon it at night its direction with that of several intermediate station due south of park hill be verify by a new series of transit observation upon high and low star both north and south of the zenith by the same mean the line be prolong to the north in one week after commence the observation at park hill the weather become again unfavorable the sky be so constantly overcast as to preclude all astronomical observation and the atmosphere so thick as to prevent a view to the north which would permit new station to be establish with sufficient accuracy in that direction unwilling to quit the field while there be a prospect of the weather become sufficiently favorable to enable the party to reach the latitude of mar hill or even proceed beyond it it be determine that some of the party should continue in the tent and there occupy themselves with such calculation as ought to be make before quit the field the officer charge with the line of level and with the reconnoissance in advance for the selection of new position for station continue they labor in the field notwithstanding they be frequently expose to slight rain and snow storm as these portion of the work could go on without a clear sky on the 13th of November a severe snowstorm occur which in a single night and a portion of the follow morning cover the surface of the whole country and the roof of the tent to a depth of 16 inch the northern extremity of the avenue which have be clear by the surveyor of 1817 be now reach and in addition to the young growth which have spring up since that period upon the previous part of the line several mile have be clear through the dense forest of heavy timber in order to proceed with the line of level which have reach nearly to the meduxnakeag the depth of snow now upon the ground render it impracticable to continue the level with the requisite accuracy any further and that part of the work be accordingly suspend for the season the thermometer have long since assume a range extend during the night and frequently during a great portion of the day to many degree below the freezing point the highland border on the aroostook distant 40 mile to the north of the party be distinctly see from a elevated position whenever the atmosphere be clear and a long extent of intermediate country of inferior elevation to the position then occupy present itself to the view with the two peak of mar hill rise abruptly above the general surface which surround they base the eastern extremity of the base of the easternmost peak be nearly 2 degree of arc or nine-tenth of a mile in space to the west of the line as it pass the same latitude to erect station opposite to the base of mar hill and upon the height of the aroostook in order to obtain exact comparison with the old line at these point be consider object of so much importance as to determine the commissioner to continue the operation in the field to the latest practicable period in hope of accomplish these end on the 18th day of November the party succeed in erect a station opposite mar hill and very near the meridian line it be thus prove that the line would pass from nine-tenth of a mile to 1 mile east of the eastern extremity of the base of the northeast peak of mar hill on the 30th of November a series of signal be commence to be interchange at night between the position of the transit instrument on park hill and the highland of the aroostook these be continue at interval whenever the weather be sufficiently clear until by successive approximation a station be on the 9th of December establish on the height 1 mile south of that river and on the meridian line the point thus reach be more than 50 mile from the monument at the source of the st croix as ascertain from the land survey make under the authority of the state of maine and massachusett the measurement of the party could not be extend to this last point owe to the depth of the snow which lay upon the ground since the middle of November but the distance derive from the land survey must be a very near approximation to the truth a permanent station be erect at the position establish on the aroostook height and a measurement make from it due west to the experimental or explore line of 1817 by which the party find itself 2400 foot to the east of that line between the 1st and 15th of December the observation be carry on almost exclusively during the night and frequently with the thermometer range from 0 to 10 and 12 degree below that point by fahrenheit 's scale although frequently expose to this temperature in the performance of they duty in the open air at night and to within a few degree of that temperature during the hour of sleep with no other protection than the tent and camp bed commonly use in the army the whole party both officer and man enjoy excellent health during the day the tent in which the astronomical computation be carry on be render quite comfortable by means of small stove but at night the fire would become extinguish and the temperature reduce to within a few degree of that of the outward air within the observatory tent the comfort of a fire could not be indulge in in consequence of the too great liability to produce serious error of observation by the smoke pass the field of the telescope the astronomical observation be therefore always make in the open air or in a tent open to the heaven at top during the hour of observation and without a fire on the 16th of December the tent be strike and this party retire from the field for the season there be then more than 2 foot of snow on the ground to the unremitting zeal amidst severe exposure and to the scientific and practical attainment of the officer both civil and military who serve under the order of the commissioner on this duty he acknowledge himself in a great measure indebted for the progress that he be enable to make notwithstanding the many difficulty encounter observation be make during portion of three lunation of the transit of the moon 's bright limb and of such tabulated star as differ but little in right ascension and declination from the moon in order to obtain additional datum to those furnish by chronometrical comparison with the meridian of boston for compute the longitude of this meridian line at the first station 4578 foot north of the monument and also at the park hill station the dip of the magnetic needle be ascertain by a series of observation -- in the one case upon two and in the other upon three separate needle the horizontal declination be also ascertain at both these station by a full set of observation upon six different needle the detail of these and of all the astronomical observation allude to will be prepare as soon as practicable for the use of the commission should they be require to he excellency major-general sir john harvey kcb lieutenant-governor of the province of new brunswick major graham acknowledge himself greatly indebted for have in the most obliging manner extend to him-every facility within he power for prosecute
