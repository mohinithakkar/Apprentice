on one occasion or another i be invite to lecture i do not find with milton 's satan that the mind be its own place i could speak only of what i be think of and my mind be fix on the war i be unacquainted with military science so my treatment of the war be limit to a estimate of the character of the antagonist the character of germany and the german be a riddle i have see no convincing solution of it by any englishman and hardly any confident attempt at a solution which do not speak the uncontrolled language of passion there be the same difficulty with the lower animal we description of they tend to be a description of nothing but we own love and hate who have ever fathom the mind of a rhinoceros or have remember while he face the beast that a good rhinoceros be a pleasant member of the community in which he life be pass we see only the fold hide the horn and the angry little eye we know that he be strong and cunning and that he desire and instinct be inconsistent with we welfare yet a rhinoceros be a simpler creature than a german and do not trouble we think by conform on occasion to civilized standard and humane condition it seem unreasonable to lay great stress on racial difference the insuperable barrier that divide england from germany have grow out of circumstance and habit and thought for many hundred of year the german people have stand to arm in they own defense against the encroachment of successive empire and modern germany learn the doctrine of the omnipotence of force by prolonged suffering at the hand of the greatest master of that immoral school -- the emperor napoleon no german can understand the attitude of disinterested patronage which the english mind quite naturally assume when it be bring into contact with foreigner the best example of this superiority of attitude be to be see in the people who be call pacifist they be a peculiarly english type and they be the most arrogant of all the english the idea that they should ever have to fight for they life be to they supremely absurd there must be some mistake they think which can be easily remedy once it be point out they title to existence be so clear to themselves that they be convinced it will be universally recognize it must not be make a matter of international conflict partly no doubt this belief be foster by lack of imagination the sheltered condition and leisured life which they enjoy as the parasite of a dominant race have produce in they a false sense of security but there be something also of the english strength and obstinacy of character in they self-confidence and if ever germany be to conquer england some of they would spring to they full stature as the hero of a age-long and indomitable resistance they be not hold in much esteem to-day among they own people they be useless for the work in hand and they credit have suffer from the multitude of pretender who make principle a cover for cowardice but for all that they be kin to the maker of england and the fact that germany would never tolerate they for a instant be not without its lesson we shall never understand the german some of they trait may possibly be explain by they history they passionate devotion to the state they amazing vulgarity they worship of mechanism and mechanical efficiency be explicable in a people who be not strong in individual character who have suffer much to achieve union and who have achieve it by subordinate themselves soul and body to a brutal taskmaster but the convulsion of war have throw up thing that be deeper than these primaeval thing which until recently civilization be believe to have destroy the old monstrous god who give they name to the day of the week be alive again in germany the english soldier of to-day go into action with the cold courage of a man who be prepare to make the best of a bad job the german soldier sacrifice himself in a frenzy of religious exaltation to the war-god the filthiness that the german use they deliberate befouling of all that be elegant and gracious and antique they spit into the food that be to be eat by they prisoner they defile with ordure the sacred vessel in the church -- all these thing too numerous and too monotonous to describe be not the instinctive coarseness of the brute beast they be a solemn ritual of filth religiously practice by officer no less than by man the wave of emotional exaltation which from time to time pass over the whole people have the same character the character of savage religion if they be alien to civilization when they fight they be doubly alien when they reason they be glib and fluent in the use of the term which have be devise for the need of thought and argument but they use of these term be empty and exhibit all the intellectual process with the intelligence leave out i know nothing more distressing than the attempt to follow any german argument concern the war if it be merely wrong-headed cunning deceitful there might still be some compensation in its cleverness there be no such compensation the statement make be not false but empty the argument use be not bad but meaningless it be as if they despise language and make use of it only because they believe that it be a instrument of deceit but a man who have no respect for language can not possibly use it in such a manner as to deceive other especially if those other be accustom to handle it delicately and powerfully it ought surely to be easy to apologize for a war that command the whole-hearted support of a nation but no apology worthy of the name have be produce in germany the pleading which have be use be servile thing write to order and direct to some particular address as if the truth be of no importance no one of these appeal have produce any appreciable effect on the mind of educate frenchman or englishman or american even among those who be eager to hear all that the enemy have to say for himself this be a strange thing and be perhaps the widest breach of all we be hopelessly separate from the german we have lose the use of a common language and can not talk with they if we would we can not understand they be it remotely possible that they will ever understand we here too the difficulty seem insuperable it be true that in the past they have show themselves willing to study we and to imitate we but unless they change they mind and they habit it be not easy to see how they be to get near enough to we to carry on they study while they remain what they be we do not want they in we neighborhood we be not fight to anglicize germany or to impose ourselves on the german we work be be do as work be so often do in this idle sport-loving country with a view to a holiday we wish to forget the german and when once we have police they into quiet and decency we shall have earn the right to forget they at least for a time the time of we respite perhaps will not be long if the ally defeat they as the ally will it seem as certain as any uncertain thing can be that a mania for imitate british and american civilization will take possession of germany we be not vindictive to a beaten enemy and when the german offer themselves as pupil we be not likely to be either enthusiastic in we welcome or obstinate in we refusal we shall be bore but concessive i confess that there be some thing in the prospect of this imitation which haunt I like a nightmare the british soldier whom the german know to be second to none be distinguish for the levity and jocularity of he bearing in the face of danger what will happen when the german soldier attempt to imitate that we shall be deliver from the german peril as when israel come out of egypt and the mountain skip like ram the only part of this book for which i claim any measure of authority be the part which describe the english character no one of purely english descent have ever be know to describe the english character or to attempt to describe it the english newspaper be full of praise of almost any of the ally troops other than the english regiment i have more scottish and irish blood in my vein than english and i think i can see the english character truly from a little distance if by some fantastic chance the statesman of germany could learn what i tell they it would save they country from a vast loss of life and from many hopeless misadventure the english character be not a removable part of the british empire it be the foundation of the whole structure and the secret strength of the american republic but the statesman of germany who fall easy victim to anything foolish in the shape of a theory that flatter they vanity would not believe a word of my essay even if they be to read they so they must learn to know the english character in the usual way as king george the third learn to know it from englishman resident in america a habit of lie and a belief in the utility of lie be often attend by the most unhappy and paralysing effect the liar become unable to recognize the truth when it be present to they this be the misery which fate have fix on the german cause war the german be fond of remark be war in almost all war there be something to be say on both side of the question to know that one side or the other be right may be difficult but it be always useful to know why you enemy be fight we know why germany be fight she explain it very fully by she most authoritative voice on the very eve of the struggle and she have repeat it many time since in moment of confidence or inadvertence but here be the tragedy of germany : she do not know why we be fight we have tell she often enough but she do not believe it and treat we statement as a exercise in the cunning use of what she call ethical propaganda why ethic or moral should be good enough to inspire sympathy but not good enough to inspire war be one of the mystery of german thought no german not even any of those few feeble german writer who have fitfully criticize the german plan have any conception of the deep sincere unselfish and righteous anger that be arouse in million of heart by the cruelty of the cowardly assault on serbium and on belgium the late german chancellor become uneasily aware that the crucifixion of belgium be one of the cause which make this war a truceless war and he offer which no doubt seem to he perfectly reasonable be that germany be willing to bargain about belgium and to relax she hold in exchange for solid advantage elsewhere perhaps he know that if the ally be to spend five minute in bargaining about belgium they would thereby condone the german crime and would lose all that they have fight for but it seem more likely that he do not know it the ally know it there be hope in these clear-cut issue of all war that ever be fight this war be least likely to have a indecisive end it must be settle one way or the other if the ally government be to make peace to-day there would be no peace the people of the free country would not suffer it germany can not make peace for she be bind by heavy promise to she people and she can not deliver the goods she be tie to the stake and must fight the course emaciate exhaust repeat as if in a bad dream the old boastful appeal to military glory she must go on till she drop and then at last there will be peace these may themselves seem boastful word they can not be prove except by the event there be some few englishman with no stomach for a fight who think that england be in a bad way because she be engage in a war of which the end be not demonstrably certain if the issue of war be know beforehand and could be discount there would be no war good war be fight by nation who make they choice and would rather die than lose what they be fight for military fortune be notoriously variable and depend on a hundred accident moral cause be constant and operate all the time the chief of these moral cause be the character of a people germany by she vaunted study of the art and science of war have get herself into a position where no success can come to she except by way of the collapse or failure of the english-speaking people a study of the moral cause if she be capable of make it would not encourage she in she old impious belief that god will destroy these people in order to clear the way for the dominion of the hohenzollern might be right _ first publish as one of the oxford pamphlet October 1914 _ it be now recognize in england that we enemy in this war be not a tyrant military caste but the united people of modern germany we have to combat a armed doctrine which be virtually the creed of all germany saxony and bavaria it be true would never have invent the doctrine but they have accept it from prussium and they believe it the prussian doctrine have pay the german people handsomely it have give they they place in the world when it cease to pay they and not till then they will reconsider it they will not think till they be compel to think when they find themselves face to face with a greater and more enduring strength than they own they will renounce they idol but they be a brave people a faithful people and a stupid people so that they will need rough proof they can not be drive from they position by a little paper shoot in they present mood if they hear a appeal to pity sensibility and sympathy they take it for a cry of weakness i be remind of what i once hear say by a genial and humane irish officer concern a proposal to treat with the leader of a zulu rebellion ` kill they all ' he say ` it be the only thing they understand ' he mean that the zulu chief would mistake moderation for a sign of fear by the irony of human history this sentence have become almost true of the great german people who build up the structure of modern metaphysics they can be argue with only by those who have the will and the power to punish they the doctrine that might be right though it be true be a unprofitable doctrine for it be true only in so broad and simple a sense that no one would dream of deny it if a single nation can conquer depress and destroy all the other nation of the earth and acquire for itself a sole dominion there may be matter for question whether god approve that dominion what be certain be that he permit it no earthly governor who be conscious of he power will waste time in listen to argument concern what he power ought to be he right to wield the sword can be challenge only by the sword a all-powerful governor who fear no assault would never trouble himself to assert that might be right he would smile and sit still the doctrine when it be propound by weak humanity be never a statement of abstract truth it be a declaration of intention a threat a boast a advertisement it have no value except when there be some one to be frightened but it be a very dangerous doctrine when it become the creed of a stupid people for it flatter they self-sufficiency and distract they attention from the difficult subtle frail and wavering condition of human power the tragic question for germany to-day be what she can do not whether it be right for she to do it the buffalo it must be allow have a perfect right to dominate the prairie of america till the hunter come they move in herd they practice shock-tactic they be violent and very cunning there be but few of they now a nation of man who mistake violence for strength and cunning for wisdom may conceivably suffer the fate of the buffalo and perish without know why to the english mind the german political doctrine be so incredibly stupid that for many long year while man in high authority in the german empire minister general and professor expound that doctrine at great length and with perfect clearness hardly any one could be find in england to take it seriously or to regard it as anything but the vapouring of a crazy sect england know better now the scream of the gun have awaken she the german doctrine be to be put to the proof who dare to say what the result will be to predict certain failure to the german arm be only a kind of boast yet there be guard belief which a modest man be free to hold till they be see to be groundless the german have take antwerp they may possibly destroy the british fleet overrun england and france repel russium establish themselves as the dictator of europe -- in short fulfil they dream what then at a immense cost of human suffering they will have achieve as it seem to we a colossal and agonizing failure they engine of destruction will never serve they to create anything so fair as the civilization of france they uneasy jealousy and self-assertion be a miserable substitute for the old law of chivalry and regard for the weak which they have renounce and forget the will and high permission of all-ruling heaven may leave they at large for a time to seek evil to other when they have finish with it the world will have to be remake we can not be sure that the ruler of the world will forbid this we can not even be sure that the destroyer in the peace that they destruction will procure for they may not themselves learn to rebuild the goth who destroy the fabric of the roman empire give they name in time to the greatest mediaeval art nature it be well know love the strong and give to they and to they alone the chance of become civilized be the german people strong enough to earn that chance that be what we be to see they have some admirable element of strength above any other european people no other european army can be march in close order regiment after regiment up the slope of a glaci under the fire of machine gun without flinch to certain death this corporate courage and corporate discipline be so great and impressive a thing that it may well contain a promise for the future moreover they be within the circle of they own kin affectionate and dutiful beyond the average of human society if they succeed in they worldly ambition it will be a triumph of plain brute morality over all the subtler movement of the mind and heart on the other hand it be true to say that history show no precedent for the attainment of world-wide power by a people so politically stupid as the german people be to-day there be no mistake about this the instance of german stupidity be so numerous that they make something like a complete history of german international relation here be one any time during the last twenty year it have be matter of common knowledge in england that one event and one only would make it impossible for england to remain a spectator in a european war -- that event be the violation of the neutrality of holland or belgium there be never any secret about this it be quite well know to many people who take no special interest in foreign politics germany have maintain in this country for many year a army of spy and secret agent yet not one of they inform she of this important truth perhaps the radical difference between the german and the english political system blind the astute agent in england nothing really important be a secret and the amount of privileged political information to be glean in barber ' shop even when they be patronize by civil servant be distressingly small two hour of sympathetic conversation with a ordinary englishman would have tell the german chancellor more about english politics than ever he hear in he life for some reason or other he be unable to make use of this source of intelligence so that he remain in complete ignorance of what every one in england know and say here be another instance the program of german ambition have be voluminously publish for the benefit of the world france be first to be crushed then russium then by means of the indemnity procure from these conquest after some year of recuperation and effort the naval power of england be to be challenge and destroy this program be set forth by high authority and be generally accept there be no criticism and no demur the crime against the civilization of the world foreshadow in the horrible word ` france be to be crush ' be before a high tribunal it would be idle to condemn it here what happen be this the french and russian part of the program be put into action last July england who have be tell that she turn be not yet that germany would be ready for she in a matter of five or ten year very naturally refuse to wait she turn she crowd up on to the scaffold which even now be in peril of break down under the weight of its victim and of bury the executioner in its ruin but because england would not wait she turn she be overwhelm with accusation of treachery and inhumanity by a sincerely indignant germany could stupidity the stupidity of the wise man of gotham be more fantastic or more monstrous german stupidity be even more monstrous a part of the accusation against england be that she have raise she hand against the nation nearest to she in blood the allege close kinship of england and germany be base on bad history and doubtful theory the english be a mixed race with enormous infusion of celtic and roman blood the roman sculpture gallery at naple be full of english face if the german agent would turn they attention to hatter ' shop and give the barber a rest they would find that no english hat fit any german head but suppose we be cousin or brother even what kind of argument be that on the lip of those who but a short time before be explain with a good deal of zest and with absolute frankness how they intend to compass we ruin there be something almost amiable in fatuity like this a touch of the fool soften the brute the german have a magnificent war-machine which roll on its way crush all that it touch we shall break it if we can if we fail the german nation be at the beginning not the end of its trouble with the making of peace even a armed peace the war-machine have serve its turn some other instrument of government must then be invent there be no trace of a design for this new instrument in any of the german shop the governor of alsace-lorraine offer no suggestion the bald fact be that there be no spot in the world where the german govern another race and be not hate they know this and be disquiet they meet with coldness on all hand and they remedy for the coldness be self-assertion and brag the russian statesman be right who remark that modern germany have be too early admit into the comity of european nation she behavior in she new international relation be like the behavior of a uneasy jealous upstart in a old-fashioned quiet drawing-room she have no genius for equality she manners be a compound of threatening and flattery when she wish to assert herself she bully when she wish to endear herself she crawl and the one device be no more successful than the other might be right but the sort of might which enable one nation to govern another in time of peace be very unlike the armored thrust of the war-engine it be a power compound of sympathy and justice the english -lrb- it be admit by many foreign critic -rrb- have study justice and desire justice they have inquire into and protect rights that be unfamiliar and even grotesque to they own idea because they believe they to be rights in the matter of sympathy they reputation do not stand so high they be chill in manner and dislike all effusive demonstration of feeling yet those who come to know they know that they be not unimaginative they have a genius for equality and they do try to put themselves in the other fellow 's place to see how the position look from that side what have happen in indium may perhaps be take to prove among many other thing that the inhabitant of indium begin to know that england have do she best and do feel a disinterested solicitude for the people under she charge she have long be a mother of nation and be not frighten by the problem of adolescence the german have as yet show no sign of skill in govern other people might be right and it be quite conceivable that they may acquire colony by violence if they want to keep they they will have to shut they own professor ' book and study the intimate history of the british empire we be old hand at the business we have lose more colony than ever they own and we begin to think that we have learn the secret of success at any rate we experience have do much for we and have help we to avoid failure yet the german colonial party stare at we with bovine malevolence in all the library of german theorize you will look in vain for any explanation of the fact that the boer be in the main loyal to the british empire if german political thinker could understand that political situation which seem to english mind so simple there might yet be hope for they but they regard it all as a piece of black magic and refuse to reason about it how should a herd of cattle be drive without goad witchcraft witchcraft they world-wide experience it be perhaps which have make the english quick to appreciate the virtue of other people i have never know a englishman who travel in russium without fall in love with the russian people i have never hear a german speak of the russian people without contempt and dislike indeed the german be so unable to see any charm in that profound and humane people that they believe that the english liking for they must be a insincere pretence put forward for wicked or selfish reason what would they say if they see a sight that be common in indian town a british soldier and a gurkha arm in arm roll down the street in cheerful brotherhood and how be it that it have never occur to any of they that this sort of brotherhood have its value in empire-building the new german political doctrine have bid farewell to christianity but there be some political advantage in christianity which should not be overlook it teach human being to think of one another and to care for one another it be a antidote to the worst and most poisonous kind of political stupidity another thing that the german will have to learn for the welfare of they much-talked empire be the value of the lone man the architect and builder of the british empire be all lone man might be right but when a young englishman be set down at a outpost of empire to govern a warlike tribe he have to do a good deal of hard thinking on the problem of political power and its foundation he have to trust to himself to form he own conclusion and to choose he own line of action he have to try to find out what be in the mind of other a young german inure to skilled slavery do not shine in such a position man for man in all that ask for initiative and self-dependence englishman be the better man and some german know it there be a old jest that if you settle a englishman and a german together in a new country at the end of a year you will find the englishman governor and the german he head clerk a german must know the rule before he can get to work more than three hundred year ago a book be write in england which be in some way a very exact counterpart to general von bernhardus 's notorious treatise it be call _ tamburlaine _ and unlike its successor be full of poetry and beauty we own colonization begin with a great deal of violent work and much wrong do to other we suffer for we misdeed and we learn we lesson in part at least why it may be ask should not the german begin in the same manner and by degree adapt themselves to the new task perhaps they may but if they do they can not claim the elizabethan for they model of all man on earth the german be least like the undisciplined exuberant elizabethan adventurer he be reluctant to go anywhere without a copy of the rule a guarantee of support and a regular pension he outlook be as prosaic as general von bernhardus 's or general von der golt 's own and that be say a great deal in all the german political treatise there be a immeasurable dreariness they lay down rule for life and if they be ask what make such a life worth live they be without any hint of a answer they world be a workhouse tyrannically order and full of pusillanimous jealousy it be not impious to be hopeful a germanized world would be a nightmare we have never attempt or desire to govern they and we must not think that god will so far forget they as to permit they to attempt to govern we now they hate we but they do not know for how many year the cheerful brutality of they political talk have shock and disgust we i remember meeting in one of the french mediterranean dependency with a prussian nobleman a well-bred and pleasant man who be fond of expound the prussian creed he be say to be a political agent of sort but he certainly learn nothing in conversation he talk all the time and propound the most monstrous paradox with a air of mathematical precision now it be the character of sir edward gray a cunning machiavel whose only aim be to set europe by the ear and make neighbor fall out a friend who be with I a american laugh aloud at this and protest without produce the smallest effect the stream of talk go on the error of the german we be tell be always that they be too humane they dislike of cruelty amount to a weakness in they they let france escape with a paltry fine next time france must be beat to the dust always with a pleasant outward courtesy he pass on to england england be decadent and powerless she rule must pass to the german ` but we shall treat england rather less severely than france ' say this bland apostle of prussian culture ` for we wish to make it possible for ourselves to remain in friendly relation with other english-speaking people ' and so on -- the whole of the bernhardus doctrine explain in quiet fashion by a man whose very debility of mind make he talk the more impressive for he be simply parrot what he have often hear no one criticize he proposal nor do we dislike he it all seem too mad a rather clumsy jest he world of idea do not touch we world at any point so that real talk between we be impossible he come to see we several time and always give the same kind of mesmerized recital of germany 's policy the grossness of the whole thing be in curious contrast with the polite and quiet voice with which he utter he insolence when i remember he talk i find it easy to believe that the german emperor and the german chancellor have also talk in such a manner that they have never have the smallest opportunity of learn what englishman think and mean while the german doctrine be the plaything merely of hysterical and supersensitive person like carlyle and nietzsche it matter little to the world of politics a excitable man of vivid imagination and invalid constitution like carlyle feel a natural predilection for the cult of the healthy brute carlyle 's english style be itself a kind of epilepsy nietzsche be so nervously sensitive that everyday life be a anguish to he and break he strength both be poet as marlowe be a poet and both sing the song of power the brute of the swamp and the field who gather round they and listen find nothing new or unfamiliar in the message of the poet ` this ' they say ` be what we have always know but we do not know that it be poetry now that great poet teach it we need no longer be ashamed of it ' so they go away resolve to be twice the brute that they be before and they name themselves culture-brute it be difficult to see how the world or any considerable part of it can belong to germany till she change she mind if she can do that she might make a good ruler for she have solid virtue and good instinct it be she intellect that have go wrong bishop butler be one day find ponder the problem whether a whole nation can go mad if he have live to-day what would he have say about it would he have admit that that strangest of grim fancy be realize it would be vain for germany to take the world she could not keep it nor though she can make a vast number of people miserable for a long time could she ever hope to make all the inhabitant of the world miserable for all time she have a giant 's power and do not think it infamous to use it like a giant she can make a winter hideous but she can not prohibit the return of spring or annul the cleanse power of water sanity be not only better than insanity it be much stronger and might be right meantime it be a delight and a consolation to englishman that england be herself again she have a cause that it be good to fight for whether it succeed or fail the hope that uplift she be the hope of a better world which we child shall see she have wonderful friend from what self-governing nation in the world can germany hear such message as come to england from the dominion oversea ` when england be at war canada be at war ' ` to the last man and the last shilling australium will support the cause of the empire ' these be simple word and sufficient have say they canada and australium say no more in the company of such friend and for the creed that she hold england might be proud to die but surely she time be not yet we faith be ours and come not on a tide and whether earth 's great offspring by decree must rot if they abjure rapacity not argument but effort shall decide they number many head in that hard flock trim swordsman they push forth yet try thy steel thou fight for poor human kind shalt feel the strength of roland in thy wrist to hew a chasm sheer into the barrier rock and bring the army of the faithful through the war of idea _ a address to the royal colonial institute December 12 1916 _ i hold as i daresay you do that we be at a crisis of we history where there be not much room for talk the time when this struggle might have be avert or win by talk be long past during the hundred year before the war we have not talk much or listen much to the german for fifty of those year at least the head of water that have now be let loose in a devastating flood over europe be steadily accumulate but we pay little attention to it people sometimes speak of the negotiation of the twelve day before the war as if the whole secret and cause of the war could be find there but it be not so statesman it be true be the keeper of the lock-gate but those keeper can only delay they can not prevent a inundation that have great natural cause the world have in it evil enough and darkness enough but it be not so bad and so dark that a slip in diplomacy a careless word or a impolite gesture can instantaneously as if by magic involve twenty million man in a struggle to the death it be only clever conceited man proud of they neat little mind who think that because they can not fathom the cause of the war it might easily have be prevent i confess i find it difficult to conceive of the war in term of simple right and wrong we must respect the tide and they huge unintelligible force teach we to respect they it be not a war of race for all we difference with the german any cool and impartial mind must admit that we have many point of kinship with they during the year before the war we naval officer in the mediterranean find i believe that it be easier to associate on term of social friendship with the austrian than with the officer of any other foreign navy we have a passionate admiration for france and a real devotion to she but that be a love affair not a family tie we begin to be experience in love affair for ireland steadily refuse to be treat on any other footing in any case we be much closer to the german than they be to the bulgarian or the turk of these three we like the turk the best because they be chivalrous and generous enemy which the german be not it be a war of idea we be fight a armed doctrine yet burke 's use of those word to describe the military power of revolutionary france should warn we against fallacious attempt to simplify the issue when idea become motive and be filter into practice they lose they clearness of outline and be often hard to recognize they leaven the lump but the lump be still human clay with its passion and prejudice its pride and its hate i remember see in a provincial paper in the early day of the war two adjacent column both deal with the war the first be head ' a holy war ' and set forth the great principle of nationality respect for treaty and protection of the weak which in we opinion be the main motive of the ally in this war the second be head ` the war on commerce tip to capture german trade ' and set forth those other principle and motive which in the opinion of the german bring england into this war i be not go to defend england against the charge that she enter this war on a cold calculation of mercantile profit every one here know that the charge be utterly untrue those who believe the charge could not be shake in they belief except by be educate all over again and introduce to some knowledge of human nature it be enough to remark that this charge be a commonplace between belligerent nation they all like to believe that they adversary entertain only base motive while they themselves act only on the loftiest ideal prompting if the charge mean only that every nation at war be bind to think of its own interest to conserve its own strength and to seize on all material gain that be within its reach the charge be true and harmless when two angry woman quarrel in a back street they commonly accuse each other of be amorous they might just as well accuse each other of be human the charge be true and insignificant so also with nation they all cherish themselves and seek to preserve they means of livelihood if this be they sole concern there would be few war certainly this war which be desolating and impoverish europe would be impossible no one surely can look at the war and say that nation be move only by they material interest it would be more plausible to say that they be too little move by those interest bacon in he essay _ of death _ remark that the fear of death do not much affect mankind ` there be no passion in the mind of man so weak but it mate and master the fear of death and therefore death be no such terrible enemy when a man have so many attendant about he that can win the combat of he revenge triumph over death love slight it honor aspireth to it grief flieth to it fear pre-occupateth it nay we read after otho the emperor have slay himself pity -lrb- which be the tenderest of affection -rrb- provoke many to die out of mere compassion to they sovereign and as the truest sort of follower ' if this be true of the fear of death how much truer it be of the love of material gain any whim or point of pride or fix idea or old habit be enough to make a man or a nation forgo the hope of profit and fight for a creed the german creed be by this time well know before the war we take little notice of it we sometimes see it state in print but it seem to we too monstrous and inhuman to be the creed of a whole people we be wrong it be the creed of a whole people by the mesmerism of state education by the discipline of universal military service by the pride of the german people in they past victory and by the fear natural to a nation that find enemy on all its front a absolute belief in the state in war as the highest activity of the state and in the right of the state to enslave all its subject body and soul to its purpose have become the creed of all those diverse people that be unite under the prussian monarchy most of they be not naturally warlike people they have be lure and frighten and drill and bribe into war but it be true to say that on the whole they enjoy fight less than we do one of the truest remark ever make on the war be that famous remark of a british private soldier who be tell how he company take a trench from the enemy fear that he account of the affair might sound boastful he add ` you see sir they be not a military people like we be ' only the word be wrong the meaning be right they be as every one know a enormously military people and if they want to fight at all they have to be a military people for the vast majority of they be not a warlike people a first-class army could never have be fashion in germany out of volunteer civilian like we army on the somme that army have a little shake the faith of the german in they creed again i must quote one of we soldier : ' i do not say ' he remark ` that we average can run ring round they best what i say be that we average be better than they average and we best be better than they best ' the german already be uneasy about they creed and they system but there be no escape for they they have sacrifice everything to it they have impoverish the mind and drill the imagination of every german citizen so that germany appear before the world with the body of a giant and the mind of a dwarf they have sacrifice themselves in million that they creed may prevail and with they creed they must stand or fall the state organize as absolute power responsible to no one with no duty to its neighbor and with only nominal duty to a strictly subordinate god have challenge the soul of man in its dearest possession we can not predict the course of military operation but if we be not sure of the ultimate issue of this great struggle we should have no sufficient motive for continue to breathe the state have challenge the soul of man before now and have always be defeat a miserable remnant of man and woman tie to stake or starve in dungeon have before now shatter what seem a omnipotent tyranny because they stand for the soul and be not prompt by vanity or self-regard they have great ally -- ` they friend be exultation agony and love and man 's unconquerable mind ' if we be defeat we shall be defeat not by german strength but by we own weakness the worst enemy of the martyr be doubt and the divide mind which suggest the question ` be it after all worth while ' we must know what we have believe what do we stand for in this war it be only the immovable conviction that we stand for something ultimate and essential that can help we and carry we through no war of this kind and on this scale be good enough to fight unless it be good enough to fail in ` the calculation of profit ' say burke'in all such war be false on balance the account of such war ten thousand hogs-head of sugar be purchase at ten thousand time they price the blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man it be well shed for we family for we friend for we god for we country for we kind the rest be vanity the rest be crime ' the question i have ask be a difficult question to answer or rather the answer be not easy to formulate briefly and clearly most of the man at the front know quite well what they be fight for they know that it be for they country but that it be also for they kind -- for certain ideal of humanity we at home know that we be at war for liberty and humanity but these word be invoke by different nation in different sens the german or at least most of they have as much liberty as they desire and believe that the highest good of humanity be to be find in the prevalence of they own idea and of they own type of government and society no abstract demonstration can help we liberty be a highly comparative notion no one ask for it complete humanity be a highly variable notion it be interpret in different sens by different society what we be confront by be two type of character two set of aim two ideal for society there can be no harm in try to understand both the german can never be understand by those who neglect they history they be a solid brave and earnest people who till quite recent time have be deny they share in the government of europe in the sixteenth century they be deeply stir by question of religion and be rent asunder by the reformation compromise prove futile the small german state be rank on this side or on that at the will of they ruler and prince man of the same race be range in mortal opposition on the question of religious belief and there be no solution but war for thirty year in the seventeenth century the war rage it be conduct with a fierceness and inhumanity that even the present war have not equal the civilian population suffer hideously whole province be desolate and whole state be bereave of they man when from mere exhaustion the war come to a end germany lay prostrate and the chief gain of the war fall to the rise monarchy of france which have intervene in the middle of the struggle by the treaty of westphalium in 1648 alsace and lorraine go to france and the rule of the great monarch loui xiv have nothing to fear from the german people the ambition of germany for long after this be mainly cosmopolitan and intellectual but political ambition though they seem almost dead be revive by the hardy state of prussium and the rest of germany 's history down to we own time be the history of the welding of the germanic people into a single state by prussian monarch and statesman this history explain many thing if a people have a corporate memory if it can learn from its own suffering germany have reason enough to cherish with a passionate devotion she late achieve unity and german brutality which be not the less brutality because german regard it as quite natural and right have its origin in german history the prussian be a spartan a natural brute but brutal to himself as well as to other capable of extreme of self-denial and self-discipline from the prussian the softer and more emotional german people of the south receive the gift of national unity and they repay the debt by extravagant admiration for prussian prowess and hardihood which have be so serviceable to they cause the southern german the bavarian especially have develop a sort of sentimentalism of brutality express in the hysterical hymn of hate -lrb- which hail from munich -rrb- express also in those monstrous excess and cruelty surpass anything that mere insensibility can produce which have give the bavarian troops they foul reputation in the present war the last half century of german history must also be remembered three assault on neighbouring state be reward by a great increase of territory and of strength from denmark in 1864 prussium take schleswig-holstein the defeat of austrium in 1866 bring hanover and bavarium under the prussian leadership alsace and lorraine be regain from france in 1870 the prussian mind which be not remarkable for subtlety find a justification in these three war for its favorite doctrine of frightfulness that doctrine put briefly be that people can always be frighten into submission and that it be cheaper to frighten they than to fight they to the bitter end denmark be a small nation and moreover be leave utterly unsupported by the european power who have guarantee she integrity bavarium be frightened and will be frighten again when she hot fit give way to she cold fit france be divide and half-heart under a tinsel emperor it be germany 's misfortune that on these three special case she base a general doctrine of war a very little knowledge of human nature -- a knowledge so alien to she that she call it psychology and assign it to specialist -- would have teach she that for the most part human being when they be fight for they home and they faith can not be frightened and must be kill or conciliate the practice of frightfulness have not work very well in this war it have steel the heart of germany 's enemy it have produce in she victim a temper of hate that will outlive this generation and will make the small people whom she have kick and trample on impossible subject of the german empire worst of all it have suggest to onlooker that the people who have so plenary a belief in frightfulness be not themselves stranger to fear there be a old english proverb hackneyed and stale three hundred year ago but now freshen again by disuse that the goodwife would never have look for she daughter in the oven unless she have be there herself how shall i describe the english temper which the german high and low learn and ignorant have so profoundly mistaken you can get no description of it from the englishman pure and simple he have no theory of himself and it bore he to hear himself describe yet it be this temper which have give england she great place in the world and which have cement the british empire it be to be find not in england alone but wherever there be a strain of english blood or a acceptance of english institution you can find it in australium in canada in america it infect scotland and impress wale it be everywhere in we trench to-day it be not clannish or even national it be essentially the lonely temper of a man independent to the verge of melancholy a admirable french writer of to-day have say that the best handbook and guide to the english temper be defoe 's romance of _ robinson crusoe _ crusoe be practical but be conscious of the over-shadowing presence of the thing that be greater than man he make he own clothing teach he goat to dance and wrestle in think with the problem suggest by he bible another example of the same temper may be see in bunyan 's _ pilgrim 's progress _ and yet another in wordsworth 's _ prelude _ there be no danger that english thought will ever underestimate the value and meaning of the individual soul the greatest english literature it might almost be say from shakespeare 's _ hamlet _ to browning 's _ the ring and the book _ be concern with no other subject the age-long satire against the english be that in england every man claim the right to go to heaven he own way english institution instead of subdue man to a single pattern be devise chiefly with the object of save the rights of the subject and the liberty of the individual ` every man in he humor ' be a english proverb and might almost be a statement of english constitutional doctrine but this extreme individualism be the right of all and do not favor self-exaltation the english temper have a almost morbid dislike of all that be showy or dramatic in expression i remember how a winchester boy when he be reproach with the fact that winchester have produce hardly any great man reply ` no indeed i should think not we would pretty soon have knock that out of they ' and the epigram of the english temper usually take the form of understatement ` give dayrolle a chair ' be the last die word of lord chesterfield speak of the friend who have come to see he when the french troops go over the parapet to make a advance they battle cry shout the praise of they country the british troops prefer to celebrate the advance in a more trivial fashion ` this way to the early door sixpence extra ' i might go on interminably with this dissertation but i have say enough for my purpose the history of england have have much to do with mould the english temper we have be protect from direct exposure to the storm that have sweep the continent we war on land have be adventure undertake by expeditionary force at sea while the power of england be grow we have be explorer pirate buccaneer now that we be involve in a great european war on land we method have be change the artillery and infantry of a modern army can not act effectively on they own impulse we hold the sea and the pirate ' work for the present have pass into other hand but we spirit and temper be the same as of old it have find a new world in the air war in the air under the condition of to-day demand all the old gallantry and initiative the airman depend on he own brain and nerve he can not fall back on order from he superior we airman of to-day be the true inheritor of drake they have the same inspired recklessness the same coolness and the same chivalry to a vanquished enemy i be a very bad example of the english temper for the english temper grumble at all this to the great relief of we enemy who believe that what a man admit against he own nation must be true we pessimist by indulge they natural vein serve we without reward quite as well as germany be serve by she wireless press they deceive the enemy modern germany have organize and regimented she people like a ant-hill or a beehive the people themselves include many who belong to the upper class be often simple villager in temper full of kindness and anger much subject to envy and jealousy not magnanimous docile and obedient to a fault if they claim as individual to represent the highest reach of european civilization the claim would be merely absurd so they shift they ground and pretend that society be greater than man and that by they painstaking organization they society have be raise to the pinnacle of human greatness they make this claim so insistently and in such obvious good faith that some few weak temper and foolish mind in england have be impress by it these panic-stricken counsellor advise we without delay to reform we institution and organize they upon the german model only thus they tell we can we hold we own against so huge a power but if we be to take they advice we should have nothing of we own left to hold it be reasonable and good to co-operate and organize in order to attain a agreed object but german organization go far beyond this the german nation be a carefully build smooth-running machine with powerful engine it have only one fault -- that any fool can drive it and see that the govern class in germany be obstinate and unimaginative there be no lack of driver to pilot it to disaster the best ability of germany be see in she military organization napoleon be she worshipped model and like many admirer of napoleon she think only of he great campaign she forget that he die in st helena and that he scheme for the reorganization of europe fail i know that many people in england be not daunt but depress by the military success of the enemy we soldier in the field be not depressed but we who be keep at home suffer from the miasma of the back-parlour we read the headline of newspaper -- a form of literature that be exciting enough but do not merit the praise give to sophocle who see life steadily and see it whole we keep we ear to the telephone and we forget that the great cause which be always at work and which will shape the issue of this war be not record upon the telephone there be thing truer and more important than the latest dispatch here be one of they the organization of the second-rate can never produce anything first-rate we do not understand a people who when it come to the last push of man against man throw up they hand and utter the pathetic cry of ` kamerad ' to surrender be a weakness that no one who have not be under modern artillery fire have any right to condemn to profess a sudden affection for the advance enemy be not weakness but baseness or rather it would be baseness in a voluntary soldier in the german it mean only that the war be not they own war that they be fight as slave not as free man the idea that we could ever live under the rule of these people be merely comic to do they justice they do not now entertain the idea though they have dally with it in the past no harm can be do i think by preach to the english people the necessity for organization and discipline we shall still be ourselves and there be no danger that we shall overdo discipline or make organization a thing to be worship for its own sake the danger be all the other way we have learn much from the war and the work that we shall have to do when it end be almost more important than the term of peace or concession make this way and that if the treacherous assault of the german on the liberty and peace of europe be reward by any solid gain to the german empire then history may forgive they but this people of the british empire will not forgive they nothing will be as it be before and we cause which will not be lose in the war will still have to be win in the so-called peace i know that some say ` let we have war when we be at war and peace when we be at peace ' it sound plausible and magnanimous but it be utopian you must reckon with you own people they know that when we last have peace the sunshine of that peace be use by the german to hatch the spawn of malice and treason if the german be defeat in the war we shall i suppose forgive they for the very english reason that it be a bear not to forgive you enemy but if they escape without decisive defeat in battle they harder trial be yet to come in some way we be stronger than we have be in all we long history we have find ourselves and we have find we friend we dead have teach the child of to-day more and better than any live teacher can teach they no one in this country will ever forget how the people of the dominion at the first note of war spring to arm like one man we must not thank or praise they like the navy they regard we thanks and praise as something of a impertinence they be not fight they say for we but that be how we discover they they be do much better than fight for we they be fight with we because without a word of explanation or appeal they idea and ours be the same we never have discuss with they and we never shall discuss what be decent and clean and honorable in human behavior a philosopher who be interested in this question can find plenty of intellectual exercise by discuss it with the german where a englishman a canadian and a australian be meet there be no material for such a debate it would be extravagant to suppose that a discovery like this can leave we future relation untouch we now know that we be profoundly unite in a union much stronger and deeper than any mechanism can produce i know how difficult a problem it be to hit on the best device for give political expression to this union between state separate from one another by the whole world 's diameter differ in they circumstance they need and they outlook i do not dare to prescribe but i should like to make a few remark and to call attention to a few point which be perhaps more present to the mind of the ordinary citizen than they be in the discussion of constitutional expert we must arrange for co-operation and mutual support if the arrangement be complicate and lengthy we must not wait for it we must meet and discuss we common affair minister from the dominion have already sit with the british cabinet we can never go back on that it be a landmark in we history we minister must travel if they supporter be impatient of they absence on the affair of the empire they must find some less parochial set of supporter we have begin in the right way the right way be not to pass law determine what you be to do but to do what be needful and do it at once -- do a lot of thing and regularize you success by later legislation now be the time while the empire be white-hot we first need be not lawyer but man who feel friendly know how to behave as friend do they will not be impeach if they go beyond the letter of the law one act of faith be worth a hundred argument this be a family affair the habit of a affectionate and united family be the only good model as for the crown colony and indium the dominion must share we burden it be object both here and in indium that life in the dominion be a very inadequate education for the sympathetic handling of alien race and custom so be life in many part of this island the fact be that the process of learn to govern these alien people be the best education in the world the indian civil service be a great college and it govern indium i can speak to this point for i have live there and see it at work if indium be really govern by the idea of the young novice who go out there fresh from they examination she would be a distressful country but the novice be take in hand at once by the older member of the service he work under the eye of the collector and the assistant collector they shoulder he and instruct he as tame elephant shoulder and instruct the wild they be kind to he and he live in they company while he prejudice and folly peel off he so that within a few year he become a tolerant wise and devoted civil servant who speak the language of the college and be proud to belong to it the success of the government of indium be not to be credit to the class from which the civil service be recruit but to the discipline of the service itself a service so high in tradition and so free from corruption that advancement in it be to be gain only by intelligence and sympathy what i be say be that i can imagine no finer raw material for the political discipline of the indian civil service than some of the generous and clean-run spirit who have come from the dominion to help in this war they could be introduce to a share of we responsibility without impede or retard the movement to give to select native of indium a larger share in the government of they country but the war be not over so i return to the main issue -- the conflict between the english idea and the german idea of world government it be not a accident as baron von hgel remark in he book on _ the german soul _ that the chief colonize nation of the world should be a nation without a national army we have depend enormously in the past on the initiative and virtue of the individual adventurer if we adventurer be to fail we which be not likely or if the state be to supersede they and attempt to do they work which be not conceivable we political power and influence would vanish with they the world might perhaps be well order but there would be no freedom and no fun the beauty of the adventurer be that he be practically invincible he do not wait for order under the most perfect police system that germany could devise he would be up and at it again we be not so numerous as the german but there be enough and to spare of we to make german government impossible in any place where we pitch we tent we be practice hand at upset government we political system be a training school for rebel this be what make we very existence a offence to the moral instinct of the german people they be quite right to want to kill we the only way to abolish fun and freedom be to abolish life but i must not be unjust to they they forethought provide for everything and no doubt they would prescribe authorized form of fun for half a hour a week and would gather together they subject in public assembly under municipal regulation to perform approve exercise in freedom mankind life by idea and if a irreconcilable difference in idea make a good war then this be a good war the contrast between the two idea be profound and far-reaching my business lie in a university for a good many year before the war certain select german student who have have a university education in they own country come as rhode scholar to oxford the intention of mr rhode be benevolent he think that if german student be to reside for four year at oxford and to associate there at a impressionable time of life with young englishman understand and fellowship would be encourage between the two people but the german government take care to defeat mr rhodes 's intention instead of send a small number of student for the full period as mr rhode have provide germany ask and -lrb- by whose mistake i do not know -rrb- obtain leave to send a larger number for a shorter stay the student select be intend for the political and diplomatic service and be older than the usual run of oxford freshman they behavior have a certain ambassadorial flavor about it they do not mix much in the many undergraduate society which flourish in a college but meet together in club of they own to drink patriotic toast they be nothing if not superior i remember a conversation i have with one of they who come to consult I he wish he say to do some definite piece of research work in english literature i ask he what problem or question in english literature most interested he and he reply that he would do anything that i advise we have a talk of some length wholly at cross-purposes at last i try to make my point of view clear by remind he that research mean find the answer to a question and that if he reading of english literature which have be fairly extensive have suggest no question to he mind he be not in the happiest possible position to begin research this touch he national pride and he give I something not unlike a lecture in germany he say the professor tell you what you be to do he give you a subject for investigation he name the book you be to read and advise you on what you be to write you follow he advice and produce a thesis which gain you the degree of doctor of letter i have see a good many of these theses and i be sure this account be correct with very rare exception they be as dead as mutton and much less nourish the upshot of we conversation be that he think I a incompetent professor and i think he a unprofitable student there be many people in england to-day who praise the thoroughness of the german and they devotion to systematic thought have any one ever take the trouble to trace the development of the thesis habit and its influence on they national life they theorize everything and they believe in they theory they have solemn theory of the english character of the french character of the nature of war of the history of the world no breath of scepticism dim they complacency although event steadily prove they theory wrong they have courage and when they be seek truth by the process of reasoning they accept the conclusion attain by the process however monstrous these conclusion may be they not only accept they they act upon they and as every one know they behavior in belgium be dictate to they by they philosophy thought of this kind be the enemy of the human race it intoxicate sluggish mind to whom think be not natural it suppress all the gentler instinct of the heart and supply a basis of orthodoxy for all the cruelty and treachery in the world i do not know none of we know when or how this war will end but i know that it be worth fight to the end whatever it may cost to all and each of we we may have peace with the german the peace of exhaustion or the peace that be only a breathing space in a long struggle we can never have peace with the german idea it be not the idea of the older german thinker -- of kant or of goethe who be good european kant say that there be nothing good in the world except the good will the modern german doctrine be that there be nothing good in the world except what tend to the power and glory of the state the inventor of this doctrine it may be remember be the devil who offer to the son of man the glory of all the kingdom of the world if only he would fall down and worship he the german expose to a like temptation have accept the offer and have fulfil the condition they can have no assurance that faith will be keep with they on the other hand we can have no assurance that they will suffer any signal or dramatic reverse human history do not usually observe the law of melodrama but we know that they newly purchase doctrine can be fight in war and in peace and we know that in the end it will not prevail the faith of england _ a address to the union society of university college london march 221917 _ when professor wp ker ask I to address you on this ceremonial occasion i feel none of the confidence of the man who know what he want to say and be look for a audience but professor ker be my old friend and this place be the place where i pick up many of those fragmentary impression which i suppose must be call my education so i think it would be ungrateful to refuse even though it should prove that i have nothing to express save goodwill and the affection of memory when i matriculated in the university of london and become a student in this place my professor be professor goodwin professor church professor henricus professor groom robertson and professor henry morley i remember all these though if they be alive i do not think that any of they would remember I the indescribable exhilaration which must be familiar to many of you of leave school and enter college be in great part the exhilaration of make acquaintance with teacher who care much about they subject and little or nothing about they pupil to escape from the eternal personal judgement which make a school a place of torment be to walk upon air the schoolmaster look at you the college professor look the way you be look the statement make by euclid that thoughtful greek be no longer encumber at college with all those preposterous and irrelevant moral consideration which desolate the atmosphere of a school the question now be not whether you have perfectly acquaint yourself with what euclid say but whether what he say be true in my earliest day at college i hear a complete exposition of the first six book of euclid give in four lecture with masterly ease and freedom by professor henricus who do not hesitate to employ method of demonstration which though they be perfectly legitimate and convincing be reject by the daintiness of the greek professor groom robertson introduce he pupil to the mystery of mental and moral philosophy and incidentally disaffected some of we by what seem to we he excessive reverence for the work of alexander bain those work be we favorite theme for satirical verse which we do not pain we professor by publish professor henry morley lecture hour after hour to successive class in a room half way down the passage on the leave even overwork could not deaden he enormous vitality but i hope that he immediate successor do not lecture so often outside the classroom i remember the passage which resemble the cellar of a unsuccessful sculptor the library where i first read _ romeo and juliet _ and the refectory where we discuss human life in most if not in all of its aspect in the neighborhood of the college there be the classic severity of gower street and for those who prefer the richer variety of romance there be always the tottenham court road beyond all and throughout all there be friendship and there be freedom the college be found i believe partly in the interest of those who object to subscribe to a conclusion before they be permit to examine the grounds for it it have always be a free place and if i remember it as a place of delight that be because i find here the delight of freedom my thought in these day be never very long away from the war so that i should feel it difficult to speak of anything else yet there be so many way in which it would be unprofitable for I to pretend to speak of it that the difficulty remain i have no knowledge of military or naval strategy i be not intimately acquaint with germany or with german culture i could praise we own people and we own fighting man from a full heart but that i think be not exactly what you want from I so i be reduce to attempt what we have all have to attempt during the past two year or more to try to state for myself as much as for you the meaning of this war so far as we can perceive it it seem to be a decree of fate that this country shall be compel every hundred year to fight for she very life we live in a island that lie across the mouth of the rhine and guard the access to all the port of northern europe in this island we have have enough safety and enough leisure to develop for ourselves a system of constitutional and individual liberty which have have a enormous influence on other nation it have be admire and imitate it have also be hate and attack to the majority of european statesman and politician it have be merely unintelligible some of they have regard it with a kind of superstitious reverence for we have be very successful in the world at large and how could so foolish and ineffective a system achieve success except by adventitious aid other include all the statesman and political theorist who prepare germany for this war have refuse to admire the power of england they have teach be not real power she have be crafty and lucky she have keep herself free from the entanglement and strife of the continent and have enrich herself by filch the property of the combatant if once she be compel to hold by force what she win by guile she pretension would collapse and she would fall back into she natural position as a small agricultural island inhabit by a people whose proudest boast would then be that they be poor cousin of the german it be difficult to discuss this question with german professor and politician : they have such simple mind and they talk like angry child they opinion concern england be not original they view be hold with equal fervor and express in very similar language by philip of spain in the sixteenth century by loui xiv of france in the seventeenth century and by napoleon at the close of the eighteenth century ` these all die in faith not have receive the promise but have see they afar off ' i will ask you to consider the attack make upon england by each of these three powerful ruler any one who read the history of these three great war will feel a sense of illusion as if he be read the history of to-day the point of resemblance in all four war be so many and so great that it seem as if the four war be all one war repeat every century the cause of the war be always a ambitious ruler who covet supremacy on the european continent england be always oppose to he -- inevitably and instinctively it take the german twenty year to prepare they people for this war it take we two day to prepare ours we instinct be quick and sound for the resource and wealth of the continent if once they be control by a single autocratic power would make it impossible for england to follow she fortune upon the sea but we never stand quite alone the smaller people of the continent who desire self-government or have achieve it always give the conqueror trouble and rebel against he or resist he england always send help to they the help of a expeditionary force or fail that the help of irregular volunteer sir philip sidney die at zutphen sir john moore at corunna there be always desperate fighting in the low country and the name of mon lige namur and lille recur again and again england always succeed in maintain herself though not without some reverse on the sea in the end the power of the master of legion philip loui napoleon and shall we say william crumble and melt he ambition be too costly to endure he people chafe under he lash and he kingdom fall into insignificance or be transform by internal revolution in all these war there be one other resemblance which it be good to remember to-day the position of england at one time or another in the course of the war always seem desperate when philip of spain invade england with the greatest navy of the world he be meet on the sea by a fleet make up chiefly of volunteer when loui overshadow europe and threaten england we king be in he pay and have make a secret treaty with he we statesman moreover have destroy we alliance with the maritime power of sweden and holland we have war with the dutch and we fleet be beat by they during the war against napoleon we be in a even worse plight the plausible political doctrine of the revolution find many sympathizer in this country we sailor mutiny at the nore ireland be aflame with discontent and we be involve in the mahratta war in indium not to mention the naval war with america even after trafalgar we european ally fail we napoleon dispose of austrium and prussium and conclude a separate treaty with russium it be then that wordsworth write -- '' tis well from this day forward we shall know that in ourselves we safety must be seek that by we own right hand it must be work that we must stand unpropped or be lay low o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer we shall exult if they who rule the land be man who hold its many blessing dear wise upright valiant not a servile band who be to judge of danger which they fear and honor which they do not understand ' always in the same cause we have suffer worse thing than we be suffer to-day and if there be worse to come we hope that we be ready the youngest and best of we who carry on and go through with it though many of they be dead and many more will not live to see the day of victory have be easily the happiest and most confident among we they have believe that at a price they can save decency and civilization in europe and if they be wrong they have know as we know that the day when decency and civilization be trample under the foot of the brute be a day when it be good to die when i speak of the german nation as the brute i be not speak controversially or rhetorically the whole german nation have give its hearty assent to a brutal doctrine of war and politics no fact need be dispute between we : what to we be they shame to they be they glory this be a grave difference yet it would be wrong to suppose that we can treat it adequately by condemn the whole german nation as a nation of confess criminal it be the paradox of war that there be always right on both side when a man be ready and willing to sacrifice he life you can not deny he the right to choose what he will die for the most beautiful virtue faith and courage and devotion grow like weed upon the battle-field the fighter recognize these virtue in each other and the front line for all they mud and slaughter be breathe on by the air of heaven hate and pusillanimity have little there to nourish they to find the meaner passion you must seek further back johnson speaking in the _ idler _ of the calamity produce by war admit that he do not know ` whether more be to be dread from street fill with soldier accustom to plunder or from garret fill with scribbler accustom to lie ' now that we army be the nation in arm the danger from a lawless soldiery have become less or have vanish but the other danger have increase journalist be not the only offender it be a strange squalid background for the nobility of the soldier that be make by the deceit and boast of diplomatist and statesman in one of the prison camp of england some week ago i see a saxon boy who have fight bravely for he country simplicity and openness and loyalty be write on he face there be hundred like he and i would not mention he if it be not that that same day i read with a new and heightened sense of disgust a speech by the german chancellor writhe with timidity and dishonesty and uneasy braggadocio those who feel this contrast as i do may be excuse i think if they come to the conclusion that to talk about war be a accursed trade and that to fight well whether on the one side or the other be the only noble part yet there be no escape for we if we be to avoid chaos if the daily life of the world be to be re-establish and carry on there must be a understanding between nation and there be no possible way to come to a understanding save by the action and word of representative man on the one side and the other such representative man there be there be no reason to doubt that they do in the main truly express the aspiration and wish of they people and on both side they have either explicitly or virtually make offer the offer of the ally power be on record what do germany offer she have refuse to make a definite statement but she ruler have talk a great deal and what she intend be not really in doubt only she be not sure whether she can get it and still cling to the hope that a favourable turn of event may relieve she of the duty of make proposal and put she in a position to dictate a settlement we all know what that settlement would be the german offer for a solution of the problem of world-government be german sentiment german racial pride german manners and custom a immense increase of german territory and german influence and above all a acknowledge supremacy for the german race among the nation of the world she think she have not state these aim in so many word but she have when it be suggest that the future peace of the world might be assure by the formation of a league to enforce peace germany through she official spokesman express she sympathy with that idea and state that she would very gladly put herself at the head of such a league i can hardly help love the german when they rustic simplicity and rustic cunning lead they all unconsciously into self-revelation the very idea of a league to enforce peace imply equality among the contracting party and germany do not understand equality ` by all means ' she say ` let we sit at a round table and i will sit at the top of it ' she panacea for human ill be germanism she have nothing to offer but a purely national sentiment which some greatly privileged may share and the rest must revere and bow to in the book of genesis we be tell how joseph be throw into a pit by he elder brother for talk just like this but he mean it quite innocently and so do the german they do not intend irreverence to god when they call he the good german god on the contrary they choose for he praise a word that to they stand for all goodness and all greatness they worship express itself naturally in the tribal ritual and the tribal creed this tribal creed there can be no doubt be what they offer we for a talisman to ensure the right order of the world patriotism and loyalty to hearth and home be passion so strong in humanity that a creed like this when man be under its influence be not easily see to be absurd the saxon boy whom i saw in he prison camp probably would not quarrel with it and even in the wider world of think the illusion of nationalism be all-pervading i once hear professor henry sidgwick remark that it be not easy for we to understand how the troops of portugal be stir to heroic effort when they commander call on they to remember that they be portuguese he would no doubt have be the first to admit for he have a alert and sceptical mind that it be only we stupidity which find anything comic in such a appeal but it be stupidity of this kind which unfit man to deal with other race and it be stupidity of this kind which have be exalt by the german as a primal duty and have indeed be advance by they as they principal claim to undertake the government of the world this extreme nationalism this unwillingness to feel any sympathy for other people or to show they any consideration have stupefy and blind the german one of the heaviest charge that can be bring against they be that they have see no virtue in france i do not ask that they shall interrupt the war to express admiration for they enemy : i be speaking of the time before the war france be the chief modern inheritor of that great roman civilization which find we paint savage and make we into citizen of the world the french mind it be admit and admit most readily by the most intelligent man be quick and delicate and perceptive surer and clearer in its operation than the average european mind yet the german infatuate with a belief in they own number and they own brute strength have dare to express contempt for the genius of france a contempt for foreigner be common enough among the vulgar and unthinking of all nation but i do not believe that you will find anywhere but in germany a large number of man train in the learn profession who be so besotted by vanity as to deny to france she place in the vanguard of civilization these lout can not be inform or argue with they be interested in no one but themselves and naked self-assertion be they only idea of political argument treitschke who be for twenty year professor of history at berlin and who do perhaps more than any other man to build up the modern german creed have crystallize german politics in a single sentence ` war ' he say ` be politics _ par excellence _ ' that be to say politics at they purest and highest we political doctrine if it must be put in as brief a form would be better express in the sentence ` war be the failure of politics ' if england be give over to nationalism as germany be give over then a war between these two power though it would still be a great dramatic spectacle would have as little meaning as a duel between two rival gamebird in a cockpit we know and it will some day dawn on the german that this war have a deeper meaning than that we be not nationalist we be too deeply experience in politics to stumble into that trap we have have a better and longer political education than have come to germany in she short and feverish national life it be often say that the german be better educate than we be and in a sense that be true they be better furnish with school and college and the public means of education the best boy in a school be the boy who best mind he book and even if he dutifully believe all that it tell he that will not lose he the prize when he leave school and graduate in a wider world where man must depend on they own judgement and they own energy he be often a little disconcerted to find that some of he less bookish fellow easily outgo he in quickness of understanding and resource german education be too elaborate it attempt to do for its pupil much that they have better be leave to do for themselves the pupil be docile and obedient not trouble with unruly doubt and questioning so that the german system of public education be a system of public mesmerism and now that we see it in its effect may be truly describe as a national disease i have say that england be not nationalist if the english believe in england as the german believe in germany there would be nothing for it but a duel to the death the extinction of one people or the other and darkness as the burier of the dead peace would be attain by a great simplification and impoverishment of the world but the english do not believe in themselves in that mad-bull fashion they come of mixed blood and have be accustom for many long century to settle they difference by compromise and mutual accommodation they do not inquire too curiously into a man 's descent if he share they idea they have show again and again that they prefer a tolerant and intelligent foreigner to rule over they rather than a obstinate and wrong-headed man of native origin the earliest strong union of the various part of england be achieve by william the norman a man of french and scandinavian descent we native-born king charle the first be put to death by he people he son jame the second be banish and the dutchman william the third who have prove himself a statesman and soldier of genius in he opposition to loui the fourteenth be elect to the throne of england the fierce struggle of the seventeenth century between royalist and parliamentarian between cavalier and puritan be settle at last not by the destruction of either party but by the stereotyping of the dispute in the milder and more tolerable shape of the party system the only people we have ever show ourselves unwilling to tolerate be the people who will tolerate no one but they own kind we hate all act of uniformity with a deadly hatred we be careful for the rights of minority we think life should be make possible and we do not object to its be make happy for dissenter voltaire the acutest french mind of he age remark on this when he visit england in 1726 ` england ' he say ` be the country of sect in my father 's house be many mansion although the episcopalian and the presbyterian be the two dominant sect in great britain all the other be welcome there and live together very fairly whilst most of the preacher hate one another almost as cordially as a jansenist damn a jesuit enter the london exchange a place much more worthy of respect than most court and you see assemble for the benefit of mankind representative of all nation there the jew the mohammedan and the christian deal with each other as if they be of the same religion and call infidel only those who become bankrupt there the presbyterian trust the anabaptist and the anabaptist rely on the promise of the quaker on leave these free and peaceful assembly some proceed to the synagogue other to the tavern if in england there be only one religion its despotism would be to be dread if there be only two they follower would cut each other 's throat but there be thirty of they and they live in peace and happiness ' since we have have so much practice in tolerate one another and in live together even when we idea on life and the conduct of life seem absolutely incompatible it be no wonder that we approach the treatment of international affair in a temper very unlike the solemn and dogmatic ferocity of the german we do not expect or desire that other people shall resemble we the world be wide and the world-drama be enrich by multiplicity and diversity of character we like bad man if there be salt and spirit in they badness we even admire a brute if he be a whole-hearted brute i have often think that if the german have be true to they principle and they program -- if after proclaim that they mean to win by sheer strength and that they recognize no other right they have continue as they begin and have batter and hack burn and kill without fear or pity a certain reluctant admiration for they might have be feel in this country there be no chance of that now since they take to whine about humanity yet it be very difficult wholly to alienate the sympathy of the english people it be perhaps in some way a weakness as it be certainly in other way a strength that we be fancier of other people we soldier have a tendency to make pet of they prisoner to cherish they as curiosity and souvenir the fancy become a passion when we find a little fellow struggle valiantly against odds i suppose we should be at war with germany to-day even if the german have respect the neutrality of belgium but the unprovoked assault upon a little people that ask only to be let alone unite all opinion in this country and bring we in with a rush i believe there be one german at least -lrb- i hope he be alive -rrb- who understand this early in July 1914 a german student at oxford who be a friend and pupil of mine come to say good-bye to I i have since wonder whether he be under order to join he regiment anyhow we talk very freely of many thing and he tell I of a adventure that have befall he in a oxford picture-palace portrait of notability be be throw on the screen when a portrait of the german emperor appear a youth sit just behind my friend shout out a insulting and scurrilous remark so my friend stand up and turn round and catch he a cuff on the head say ` that be my emperor ' the house be full of undergraduate and he expect to be seize and throw into the street to he great surprise the undergraduate many of whom have now fall on the field of france break into round of cheer ' i should like to think ' my friend say ` that a thing like that could possibly happen in a german city but i be afraid that the feeling there would always be against the foreigner i admire the english they be so just ' i have hear nothing of he since except a rumor that he be with the german army of occupation in belgium if so i like to think of he at a regimental mess suggest doubt or if that be a impossible breach of military discipline keep silence when the loud-voiced major explain that the sympathy of the english for belgium be all pretence and cant ideal and disinterested motive be always to be reckon with in human nature what the german call ` real politics ' that be to say politics which treat disinterested motive as negligible have lead they into a morass and have bog they there how easy it be to explain that the british empire depend on trade that we be a nation of trader that all we policy be shape by trade that therefore it can only be hypocrisy in we to pretend to any of the finer feeling this be not as you might suppose the harmless sally of a one-eyed wit it be the carefully reason belief of germany 's profoundest political thinker they do not understand a cavalier so they confidently assert that there be no such thing in nature that be a bad mistake to make about any nation but perhaps worst when it be make about the english for the cavalier temper in england run through all class you can find it in the schoolmaster the small trader the clerk and the labourer as readily as in the officer of dragoon or the arctic explorer the roundhead win the civil war and bequeath to we they political achievement from the cavalier we have a more intimate bequest : it be from they not from the puritan that the fighting force of the british empire inherit they outlook on the world they freedom from pedantry and that gaiety and lightness of courage which make they carry they life like a feather in the cap i be not say that we quality good or bad commend we very readily to stranger the people of england on the whole be respect more than they be like when i call they fancier of other nation i feel it only fair to add that some of those other nation express the same truth in different language i have often hear the complaint make that englishman can not speak of foreigner without a air of patronage it be impossible to deny this charge for in a question of manners the impression you produce be you manners and there be no doubt about this impression there be a certain coldness about the upright and humane englishman which repel and intimidate any trivial human being who approach he most man would forgo they claim to justice for the chance of be like they would rather have they head break or accept a bribe than be the object of a dispassionate judgement however kindly they feel this so strongly that they experience a dull discomfort in any relationship that be not tincture with passion as there be many such relationship not to be avoid even by the most emotional nature they escape from they by simulate lively feeling and be sometimes exaggerated and insincere in manner they issue a very large paper currency on a very small gold reserve this which be commonly know as the irish question be a insoluble problem for it be a clash not of interest but of temperament the english it must in fairness be admit do as they would be do by no englishman pure and simple be incommode by the coldness of stranger he prefer it for there be many stupid little business in the world which be falsify when they be make much of and even when important fact be to be tell he would rather have they tell in a dreary manner he hate a fuss the german who be a highly emotional and excitable people have concentrate all they energy on a few simple idea they moral outlook be as narrow as they geographical outlook be wide will they faith prevail by its intensity narrow and false though it be i can not prove that it will not but i have a suspicion which i think have already occur to some of they that the world be too large and wilful and strong to be master by they we have see what they hatchet and explosive can do and they be near the end of they resource they can still repeat some of they old exploit but they make no headway and time be not they friend one service perhaps they have do to civilization there be a grow number of people who hold that when this war be over international relation must not be permit to slip back into the unstable condition which tempt the german to they crime a good many pacific theorist no doubt have not the experience and the imagination which would enable they to pass a useful judgement or to make a valuable suggestion on the affair of nation the abolition of war would be easily obtain if it be generally agree that war be the worst thing that can befall a people but this be not generally agree and further it be not true while man be man they can not be sure that they will never be challenge on a point of deep and intimate concern where they would rather die than yield but something can perhaps be do to discourage gambler ' war though even here any stockbroker will tell you how difficult it be to suppress gambling without injure the spirit of enterprise the only real check on war be a understanding between nation for the strengthening of such a understand the ally have a great opportunity and admirable instrument i do not think that we shall call on germany to preside at we conference but we shall have the help of all those quality of heart and mind which be possess by france by russium by italy and by america who for all she caution hate cruelty even more than she love peace there have never be a alliance of greater promise for the government and peace of the world what be the contribution of the british empire and of england towards this settlement many of we domestic problem as i have say bear a curious resemblance to international problem we have not solve they all we have have many stumbling and many backsliding but we have show again and again that we believe in toleration on the widest possible basis and that we be capable of generosity which be a virtue much more commonly show by private person than by community we abolish the slave trade we grant self-government to south africa just after we war with she only a few day ago we give indium she will and allow she to impose a duty on we manufacture ireland could have self-government to-morrow if she do not value she feud more than anything else in the world all these be people to whom we have be bind by tie of kinship or trusteeship a wider and greater opportunity be on its way to we we be to see whether we be capable of generosity and trust towards people who be neither we kin nor we ward we understanding with france and russium will call for great goodwill on both side not so much in the draft of formal treaty as in indulge one another in we national habit family who fail to live together in unity commonly fail not because they quarrel about large interest but because they do not like each other 's little way the french be not a dull people and the russian be not a tedious people -lrb- what they do they do suddenly without explanation -rrb- so that if we fail to take pleasure in they we have ourselves to blame if we be not equal to we opportunity if we do not learn to feel any affection for they then not all the pact and congress in the world can make peace secure of germany it be too early to speak we have not yet defeat she if we do defeat she no one who be acquaint with we temper and we record believe that we shall impose cruel or vindictive term if it be only the engineer of this war who be in question we would destroy they gladly as common pest but the thing be not so easy a single home be in many way a greater and more appealing thing than a nation we should find ourselves think of the misery of simple and ignorant people who have give they all for the country of they birth and we heart would fail we the german would certainly despise this address of mine for i have talk only of morality while they talk and think chiefly of machine zeppelin be a sad disappointment but if any address on the war be be deliver to-night by a german professor there can be no doubt that it deal with submarine and treat they as the savior of the fatherland well i know very little about submarine but i notice that they have not have much success against ship of war we be so easy-going that we expect to carry on we commerce in war very much as we do in peace we have to change all that and it will cost we not a little inconvenience or even great hardship but i can not believe that a scheme of privy attack on the trader of all nation devise as a last resort in lieu of naval victory can be successful when it be no longer a surprise and when i read history i be strengthen in my belief that morality be all-important i do not find that any war between great nation be ever win by a machine the trojan horse will be trot out against I but that be a municipal affair war be win by the temper of a people serbia be not yet defeat it be a frenzied and desperate quest that the german undertake when they begin to seek for some mechanical trick or dodge some monstrous engine which should enable the less resolve and more excited people to defeat the more resolve and less excited if we be to be defeat it must be by they not by they bogey-man we get they measure on the somme and we find that when they gun fail to protect they many of they throw up they hand these man will never be we master until we deserve to be they slave so i be glad to be able to end on a note of agreement with the german military party if they defeat we it will be no more than we deserve till then or till they throw up they hand we shall fight they and god will defend the right some gain of the war _ a address to the royal colonial institute February 13 1918 _ we loss in this war continue to be enormous and we be not yet near to the end so it may seem absurd to speak of we gain of gain that we have already achieve but if you will look at the thing in a large light i think you will see that it be not absurd i do not speak of gain of territory and prisoner and booty it be true that we have take from the german about a million square mile of land in africa where land be cheap we have take more prisoner from they than they have take from we and we have whole park of german artillery to set over against the batter and break remnant of british field-gun which be exhibit in berlin -- a monument to the immortal valor of the little old army i be speak rather of gain which can not be count as gun be count or measure as land be measure but which be none the less real and important the german have achieve certain great material gain in this war and they be fight now to hold they if they fail to hold they the germany of the war-lord be ruin she will have to give up all she bloated ambition to purge and live cleanly and painfully to reconstruct she prosperity on a quieter and sounder basis she will not do this until she be force to it by defeat no doubt there be moderate and sensible man in germany as in other country but in germany they be without influence and can do nothing war be the national industry of prussium prussium have knit together the several state of the larger germany by means of war and have promise they prosperity and power in the future to be achieve by war you know the prussian doctrine of war every one now know it accord to that doctrine it be a foolish thing for a nation to wait till it be attack it should carefully calculate its own strength and the strength of its neighbor and when it be ready it should attack they on any pretext suddenly without warn and should take from they money and land when it have gain territory in this fashion it should subject the population of the conquer territory to the strictest law of military service and so supply itself with a instrument for new and bolder aggression this be not only the german doctrine it be the german practice in this way and no other modern germany have be build up it be a huge new state found on force cement by fear and finance on speculative gain to be derive from the great gamble of war you may have notice that the german people have not be call on as yet to pay any considerable sum in taxation towards the expense of this war those expense -lrb- that at least be the original idea -rrb- be to be bear wholly by the conquered enemy there be hundred of thousand of german to-day who firmly believe that they war-lord will return in triumph from the stricken field bring with they the spoil of war and scatter a largess of peace and plenty to we it seem a marvel that any people should accept such a doctrine and should willingly give they life and they fortune to the work of carry it out in practice but it be not so marvellous as it seem the german people be brave and obedient and so make good soldier they be easily lure by the hope of profit they be naturally attract by the spectacular and sentimental side of war above all they be so curiously stupid that many of they do actually believe that they be a divinely choose race superior to the other race of the world they be very carefully educate and they education which be order by the state be part of the military machine they thinking be do for they by official it would require a extraordinary degree of courage and independence for a german youth to cut himself loose and begin think and judge for himself it must always be remembered moreover that they recent history seem to justify they creed i will not go back to frederick the great though the history of he war be the prussian handbook which teach all the characteristic prussian method of treachery and deceit but consider only the last two german war how in the face of these can it be prove to any german that war be not the most profitable of adventure in 1866 prussia have war with austrium the war last forty day and prussium have from five to six thousand soldier kill in action as a consequence of the war prussium gain much territory and establish she control over the state of greater germany in 1870 she have war with france she total casualty in that war be approximately a hundred thousand just about the same as we casualty in gallipolus from the war she gain besides a great increase of strength at home the rich province of alsace and lorraine with all they mineral wealth and a indemnity of two hundred million pound that be to say four time the actual cost of the war in money how then can it be maintain that war be not good business if you say so to any prussian he think you be talk like a child not only be these two war rich in profit for the german but they do not lose they much esteem there be sympathy in this country for the union of the german people just as there be sympathy a few year earlier for the union of the various state of italy there be not a little admiration for german efficiency and strength so that bismarck who be a expert in all the use of bully blackmail and fraud be accept as a great european statesman i have always believe and i still believe that germany will have to pay a heavy price for bismarck -- all the heavier because the payment have be so long defer the present war then be in the direct line of succession to these former war it be plan by germany elaborately and deliberately plan on a calculation of the profit to be derive from operation on a large scale well as i say we as a people do not believe in gambling in human misery to attain uncertain speculative gain we hold that war can be justify only by a good cause not by a lucky event the german doctrine seem to we impious and wicked though we have define we war aim in detail and the german have not dare publicly to define theirs we real and sufficient war aim be to break the monstrous and inhuman doctrine and practice of the enemy -- to make they calculation miscarry and observe if they calculation miscarry they have fight and suffer for nothing they enter into this war for profit and in the conduct of the war though they have make many mistake they have make none of those generous and magnanimous mistake which redeem and beautify a lose cause the essence of we cause and its greatest strength be that we be not fight for profit we be fight for no privilege except the privilege of possess we soul of be ourselves -- a privilege which we claim also for other weaker nation the inestimable strength of that position be that if the odds be against we it do not matter if you see a ruffian torture a child and interfere to prevent he do you feel that you attempt be a wrong one because he knock you down and if you succeed what material profit be there in save a child from torture we have sometimes fight in the past for doubtful cause and for wrong cause but this time there be no mistake we cause be better than we deserve we embrace it by a act of faith and it be only by continue in that faith that we shall see it through the little old army when they go to france in August 1914 do not ask what profit be likely to come they way they know that there be none but they be willing to sacrifice themselves to save decency and humanity from be trample in the mud this be the army that the german call a mercenary army and its epitaph have be write by a good poet : these in the day when heaven be fall the hour when earth 's foundation flee follow they mercenary calling and take they wages and be dead they shoulder hold the heaven suspend they stand and earth 's foundation stay what god abandon these defend and save the sum of thing for pay we must follow they example for we shall never get a better we must not make too much of calculation especially when it deal with incalculable thing nervous public critic like mr hg well be always call out for more cleverness in we method for new and effective trick so that we may win the war i would never disparage cleverness the more you can get of it the better but it be useless unless it be in the service of something stronger and greater than itself and that be character cleverness can grasp it be only character that can hold the duke of wellington be not a clever man he be a man of simple and honorable mind with a infinite capacity for patience persistence and endurance so that neither unexpected reverse abroad nor a flood of idle criticism at home could shake he or change he so he bear a chief part in lay low the last great tyranny that desolate europe none of we great war be win by cleverness they be all win by resolution and perseverance in all of they we be near to despair and do not despair in all of they we win through to victory in the end but in none of they do victory come in the expect shape the worst of make elaborate plan of victory and program of all that be to follow victory be that the mixed event be sure to defeat those plan not every war find its decision in a single great battle think of we war with spain in the sixteenth century spain be then the greatest of european power she have larger army than we could raise she have more than we wealth and more than we ship the newly discover continent of america be a appanage of spain and she great galleon be waft lazily to and fro bring she all the treasure of the western hemisphere we defeat she by stand out and hold on we fight she in the low country which she enslave and oppress we refuse to recognize she exclusive rights in america and we merchant seaman keep the sea undaunted as they have keep it for the last three year when at last we become a intolerable vexation to spain she collect a great armada or war-fleet to invade and destroy we and it be shatter by the wind of heaven and the sailor of england in 1588 the defeat of the armada be the turning-point of the war but it be not the end it lift a great shadow of fear from the heart of the people as a great shadow of fear have already be lift from they heart in the present war but during the year that follow we suffer many and serious reverse at the hand of spain before peace and security be reach so late as 1601 thirteen year after the defeat of the armada the king of denmark offer to mediate between england and spain so that the long and disastrous war might be end queen elizabeth be then old and frail but this be what she say -- and if you want to understand why she be almost adore by she people listen to she word : ' i would have the king of denmark and all prince christian and heathen to know that england have no need to crave peace nor myself endure one hour 's fear since i attain the crown thereof be guard with so valiant and faithful subject ' in the end the power and menace of spain fade away and when peace be make in 1604 this nation never again from that day to this fear the worst that spain could do what be we gain from the war with spain freedom to live we life in we own way unthreatened freedom to colonize america the gain of a great war be never visible immediately they be defer and extend over many year what do we gain by we war with napoleon which end in the victory of waterloo for long year after waterloo this country be full of riot and discontent there be rick-burnings agitation popular rising and something very near to famine in the land but all these thing from a distance be now see to have be the broken water that follow the passage of a great storm the real gain of waterloo and still more of trafalgar be evident in the enormous commercial and industrial development of england during the nineteenth century and in the peaceful foundation of the great dominion of canada australium and south africa which be make possible only by we unchallenged use of the sea the man who win those two great battle do not live to gather the fruit of they victory but they child do if we defeat germany as completely as we hope we shall not be able to point at once to we gain but it be not a rash forecast to say that we child and child 's child will live in greater security and freedom than we have ever taste a man must have a good and wide imagination if he be to be willing to face wound and death for the sake of he unborn descendant and kinsfolk we can not count on the popular imagination be equal to the task fortunately there be a substitute for imagination which do the work as well or better and that be character we people be sound in instinct they understand a fight they know that a wrestler who consider while he be in the grip of he adversary whether he would not do well to give over and so put a end to the weariness and the strain be no sort of a wrestler they have never fail under a strain of this kind and they will not fail now the people who do the half-hearted and timid talking be either young egotist who be angry at be deprive of they personal ease and independence or elderly pensive gentleman in public office and club who be no longer fit for action and be deny action fall into melancholy or feverish journalist who live on the proceeds of excitement who feel the pulse and take the temperature of the war every morning and then rush into the street to announce they flutter hope and fear or cosmopolitan philosopher to whom the change from london to berlin mean nothing but a change in diet and a pleasant addition to they opportunity of hear good music or alien in heart to whom the historic fame of england ` dear for she reputation through the world ' be less than nothing or practical joker who be calm and confident enough themselves but delight in startling and depressing other these be not the people of england they be the parasite of the people of england the people of england understand a fight that bring I to the first great gain of the war we have find ourselves which of we in the early month of 1914 would have dare to predict the splendor of the youth of this empire -- splendor which be now a part of we history we be adept at self-criticism and self-depreciation we hate the language of emotion some of we if we be take to heaven and ask what we think of it would say that it be decent or not so bad i suppose we be jealous to keep we standard high and to have something to say if a better place should be find but in spite of all this we do now know and it be worth know that we be not weaker than we father we know that the people who inhabit these island and this commonwealth of nation can not be push on one side or drive under or deny a great share in the future order of the world we know this and we knowledge of it be the debt that we owe to we dead it be not vanity to admit that we know it on the contrary it would be vanity to pretend that we do not know it it be visible to other eye than ours some time ago i hear a address give by a friend of mine a indian mohammedan of warrior descent to university student of he own faith he be urge on they the futility of dream and the necessity of self-discipline and self-devotion ` why do the people of this country ' he say ` count for so much all the world over it be not because of they dream it be because thousand of they be lie at the bottom of the sea ' further we have not only find ourselves we have find one another a new kindliness have grow up during the war between people divide by the barrier of class or wealth or circumstance a statesman of the seventeenth century remark that _ it be a misfortune for a man not to have a friend in the world but for that reason he shall have no enemy _ i might invert he maxim and say _ it be a misfortune for a man to have many enemy but for that reason he shall know who be he friend _ no radical member of parliament will again while any of we live cast contempt on ` the carpet captain of mayfair ' no idle tory talker will again dare to say that the work man of england care nothing for they country even the manners of railway travel have improve i be travel in a third-class compartment of a crowded train the other day we be twenty in the compartment but it seem a pity to leave any one behind and we make room for number twenty-one nothing but a very kindly human feeling could have pack we tight enough for this yet now be the time that have be choose by some of these pensive gentleman that i speak of and by some of these excitable journalist to threaten we with class-war and to try to make we flesh creep by conjure up the horror of revolution i advise they to take they opinion to the third-class compartment and discuss they there it be a good tribunal for sooner or later you will find every one there -- even officer when they be travel in mufti at they own expense i have visit this tribunal very often and i have always come away from it with the same impression that this people mean to win the war but i do not travel much in the north of england so i ask a friend of mine whose dealings be with the industrial north what the workpeople of lancashire and yorkshire think of the war he say ` they view be very simple : they mean to win it and they mean to make as much money out of it as ever they can ' certainly that be very simple but before you judge they put yourselve in they place there be great outcry against profiteer for make exorbitant profit out of the war and against munition worker for delay work in order to get higher wages i do not defend either of they they be unimaginative and selfish and i do not care how severely they be deal with but i do say that the majority of they be not wicked in intention a good many of the more innocent profiteer be man whose sin be that they take a offer of two shilling rather than a offer of eighteenpence for what cost they one and a penny some of we in we weaker moment might be betray into do the same as for the munition worker i remember what goldsmith who have know the bitterest poverty write to he brother ` avarice ' he say ` in the lower order of mankind be true ambition avarice be the only ladder the poor can use to preferment preach then my dear sir to you son not the excellence of human nature nor the disrespect of riches but endeavor to teach he thrift and economy let he poor wander uncle 's example be place in he eye i have learn from book to love virtue before i be teach from experience the necessity of be selfish ' the profiteer and the munition worker be endeavor incidentally to better they own position but make no mistake the bulk of these people would rather die than allow one spire of english grass to be trodden under the foot of a foreign trespasser they chief sin be that they do not fear they think that there be plenty of time to do a little business for themselves on the way to defeat the enemy i can not help remember the mutiny at the nore which break out in we fleet during the napoleonic war the mutineer strike for more pay and better treatment but they agree together that if the french fleet should put in a appearance during the mutiny all they claim should be postpone for a time and the french fleet should have they first attention employer and employ do no doubt find in some trade to-day that they relation be strain and irksome they would do well to take a lesson from the army where with very few exception there be harmony and understanding between those who take order and those who give they it be only in the army that you can see realize the ideal of ancient rome then none be for a party then all be for the state then the great man help the poor and the poor man love the great why be the army so far superior to most commercial and industrial business the secret do not lie in state employment there be plenty of discontent and unrest among the state-employed railway man and munition worker it lie rather in the habit of mutual help and mutual trust if any civilian employer of labor want to have willing workpeople let he take a hint from the army let he live with he workpeople and share all they danger and discomfort let he take thought for they welfare before he own and teach self-sacrifice by example let he put the good of the nation before all private interest and those whom he command will do for he anything that he ask i can not believe that the benefit which have come to we from the army will pass away with the passing of the war those who have be comrade in danger will surely take with they something of the old spirit into civil life and those who have keep clear of the army in order to carry on they own trade and business will surely realize that they have miss the great opportunity of they life in a wider sense the war have bring we to a understanding of one another this great commonwealth of independent nation which be call the british empire be scatter over the surface of the habitable globe it embrace people who live ten thousand mile apart and whose way of life be so different that they might seem to have nothing in common but the war have bring they together and have do more than half a century of peace could do to promote a common understanding hundred of thousand of man of we blood who before the war have never see this little island have now make acquaintance with it hundred of thousand of the inhabitant of this island to whom the dominion be strange far place if after the war they should be call on to settle there will not feel that they be leave home i can only hope that the canadian and anzac think as well of we as we do of they we do not like to praise we friend in they hearing so i will say no more than this : i be tell that a new kind of peerage very haughty and very self-important have arise in south london its member be those house-holder who have be privileged to have anzac soldier billet on they it be private tie of this kind invisible to the constitutional lawyer and the political historian which make the fine mesh of the web of empire because he know that the strength of the whole texture depend on the strength of the fine mesh earl gray who die last year will always be remember in we history not many man have he opportunity to make acquaintance with the domain that be they birthright for he have administer a province of south africa and have be governor-general of canada he rediscover the glory of the empire as poet rediscover the glory of common speech ` he have breathe its air ' a friend of he say ` fish its river walk in its valley stand on its mountain meet its people face to face he have see it in all the zone of the world he know what it mean to mankind under the british flag wherever he journey he find man of english speech living in a atmosphere of liberty and carry on the dear domestic tradition of the british isle he see justice firmly plant there industry and invention hard at work unfettered by tyrant of any kind domestic life prosper in natural condition and we old english kindness and cheerfulness and broad-minded tolerance keep thing together but he also see room under that same flag ample room for million and million more of the human race the empire be not a word to he it be a vast a almost boundless home for honest man ' the war do not dishearten he when he die in August 1917 he say ` here i lie on my death-bed look clear into the promised land i be not allow to enter it but there it be before my eye after the war the people of this country will enter it and those who laugh at I for a dreamer will see that i be not so wrong after all but there be still work to do for those who do not laugh hard work and with much opposition in the way all the same it be work right up against the goal my dream have come true ' one of the clear gain of the war be to be find in the increase activity and alertness of we own people the motto of to-day be ` let those now work who never work before and those who always work now work the more ' before the war we have a great national reputation for idleness -- in this island at least i remember a friendly critic from canada who some five or six year ago express to I with much disquiet he opinion that there be something very far wrong with the old country that we have go soft as for we german critic they express the same view in gross and unmistakable fashion wit be not a native product in germany it all have to be import so they could not satirize we but they caricature of the typical englishman show we what they think he be a young weakling with a foolish face and be dress in cricket flannel it would have be worth they while to notice what they do not notice that he muscle and nerve be not soft they learn that later when the bank-clerk of manchester break the prussian guard into fragment at contalmaison this must have be a sad surprise for the german have always teach in they delightful authoritative fashion that the chief industry of the young englishman be lawn-tennis and afternoon tea they be a fussy people and they find it difficult to understand the calm of the man who have nothing to do do it perhaps they be right and we be too idle the disease be never so serious as they think it and now thanks to they we be in a fair way to recovery the idle class have turn they hand to the lathe and the plough woman be do a hundred thing that they never do before and be do they well the elasticity and resourcefulness that the war have develop will not be lose or destroy by the come of peace least of all will those quality be lose if we should prove unable in this war to impose we own term on germany then the peace that follow will be a long struggle and in that struggle we shall prevail in the last long peace we be not suspicious we feel friendly enough to the german and we give they every advantage they despise we for we friendliness and use the peace to prepare we downfall that will never happen again if we can not tame the cunning animal that have assault humanity at least we can and will tether he law will not be necessary there be million of other besides the seaman of england who will have no dealings with a unsubdued and unrepentant germany what the german be not teach by the war they will have to learn in the more tedious and no less costly school of peace in any case whether we win through to real peace and real security or whether we be throw back on a armed peace and the duty of unbroken vigilance we shall be dependent for we future on the child who be now learn in the school or play in the street it be a good dependence the child of to-day be better than the child whom i know when i be a child i think they have more intelligence and sympathy they certainly have more public spirit we can not do too much for they the most that we can do be nothing to what they be go to do for we for they own nation and people i be not concern to discuss the education problem formal education carry on chiefly by means of book be a very small part of the making of a man or a woman but i be interested to know what the child be think you can not fathom a child 's thought but we know who be they best teacher and what lesson have be stamp indelibly on they mind they teacher whom they never see and whose lesson they will never forget lie in grave in flander and france and gallipolus and syrium and mesopotamium or unburied at the bottom of the sea the runner fall but the torch be carry forward this be what julian grenfell who give he mind and he life to the war have say in he splendid poem call _ into battle _ : and life be color and warmth and light and a strive evermore for these and he be dead who will not fight and who die fight have increase those who die fighting will have such increase that a whole new generation better even than the old will be ready no long time hence to uphold and extend and decorate the commonwealth of nation which they father and brother save from ruin one thing i have never hear discuss but it be the clearest gain of all and already it may be call a certain gain after the war the english language will have such a position as it have never have before it will be establish in world-wide security even before the war it may be truly say we language be in no danger from the competition of the german language the german have never have much success in the attempt to get they language adopt by other people not all the military law of prussium can drive out french from the heart and home of the people of alsace in the port of the near and far east you will hear english speak -- pidgin english as it be call that be to say a selection of english word suit for the business of daily life but you may roam the world over and you will hear no pidgin german before the war many german learn english while very few english-speaking people learn german in other matter we disagree but we both know which way the wind be blow it may be say and say truly that we well-known laziness be one cause of we fail or neglect to learn german but it be not the only cause and we be not lazy in task which we believe to be worth we while rather we have a instinctive belief that the future do not belong to the german tongue that belief be not likely to be impair by the war armed ruffian can do some thing but one thing they can not do they can not endear they language to those who have suffer from they violence the german poison the well in south-west africa in europe they do all they could to poison the well of mutual trust and mutual understanding among civilized man do they think that these thing will make a good advertisement for the explosive guttural sound and the huddle deform syntax of the speech in which they express they arrogance and they hate which of the chief european language will come first after the war with the little nation will serbia be content to speak german will norway and denmark feel a new affection for the speech of the man who have degrade the old humanity of the sea neighborhood kinship and the necessity of commerce may retain for the german language a certain measure of custom in sweden and switzerland and in holland but for the most part german will have to be content to be address in they own tongue only by those who fear they or by those who hope to cheat they this gain which i make bold to predict for the english language be a real gain apart from all patriotic bias the english language be incomparably richer more fluid and more vital than the german language where the german have but one way of say a thing we have two or three each with its distinction and its subtlety of usage we capital wealth be greater and so be we power of borrow english spring from the old teutonic stock and we can still coin new word such as ` food-hoard ' and ` joy-ride ' in the german fashion but long century ago we add thousand of romance word word which come into english through the french or norman-french and bring with they the idea of latin civilization and of mediaeval christianity later on when the renew study of latin and greek quicken the intellectual life of europe we import thousand of greek and latin word direct from the ancient world learn word many of they suitable for philosopher or for writer who pride themselves on shoot a little above the vulgar apprehension yet many of these too have find they way into daily speech so that we can say most thing in three way accord as we draw on one or another of the three main source of we speech thus you can begin or commence or initiate a undertaking with boldness or courage or resolution if you be a workman or labourer or operative you can ask or bequest or solicit you employer to yield or grant or concede a increase in the earnings or wages or remuneration which fall to the lot of you fellow or companion or associate you employer be perhaps old or veteran or superannuated which may hinder or delay or retard the success of you application but if you foretell or prophesy or predict that the war will have a end or close or termination that shall not only be speedy or rapid or accelerate but also great or grand or magnificent you may perhaps stir or move or actuate he to have ruth or pity or compassion on you mate or colleague or collaborator the english language then be a language of great wealth -- much greater wealth than can be illustrate by any brief example but wealth be nothing unless you can use it the real strength of english lie in the inspired freedom and variety of its syntax there be no grammar of the english speech which be not comic in its stiffness and inadequacy a english grammar do not explain all that we can do with we speech it merely explain what shackle and restraint we must put upon we speech if we would bring it within the comprehension of a school-bred grammarian but the speech itself be like the sea and soon break down the dyke build by the inland engineer it be the fashion in the eighteenth century to speak of the divine shakespeare the reach and catholicity of he imagination be what earn he that extravagant praise but he syntax have no less title to be call divine it be not cast or work like metal it leap like fire and move like air so be every one that be bear of the spirit we speech be we great charter far better than in the long constitutional process whereby we subject we king to law and give dignity and strength to we common the meaning of english freedom be to be see in the illimitable freedom of we english speech we literature be almost as rich as we language modern german literature begin in the eighteenth century modern english literature begin with chaucer in the fourteenth century and have be full of great name and great book ever since nothing have be do in german literature for which we have not a counterpart do as well or better -- except the work of heine and heine be a jew he opinion of the prussian be that they be a compost of beer deceit and sand french literature and english literature can be compare throughout they long course sometimes to the great advantage of the french german literature can not seriously be compare with either it may be object that literature and art be ornamental affair which count for little in the deadly strife of nation but that be not so we language can not go anywhere without take we idea and we creed with it not to mention we institution and we game if the german could understand what chaucer means when he say of he knight that he lovd chivalry truth and honor freedom and courtesy then indeed we might be near to a understanding i ask a good german scholar the other day what be the german word for ` fair play ' he reply as they do in parliament that he must ask for notice of that question i fear there be no german word for ` fair play ' the little country the pawn and victim of german policy understand we idea better the people who have suffer from tyranny and oppression look to england for help and it be a generous weakness in we that we sometimes deceive they by we sympathy for we power be limited and we can not help they all but it will not count against we at the final reckoning that in most place where humanity have suffer cruelty and indignity the name of england have be invoke : not always in vain and now for i have keep to the last what i believe to be the greatest gain of all the entry of america into the war assure the triumph of we common language america be people by many race only a minority of the inhabitant -- a influential and govern minority -- be of the english stock but here again the language carry it and the idea that inspire america be idea which have they origin in the long english struggle for freedom we suffering in this war be great but they be not so great that we can not recognize virtue in a new recruit to the cause no nation in the whole course of human history have ever make a more splendid decision or perform a more magnanimous act than america when she decide to enter this war she have nothing to gain for to say the bare truth she have little to lose if germany be to dominate the world america no doubt would be ruin but in all human likelihood germany 's impious attempt would have spend itself and be break long before it reach the coast of america america might have stand out of the war in the assurance that she own interest be safe and that when the tempest have pass the center of civilization would be transfer from a broken and exhaust europe to a peaceful and prosperous america some few american talk in this strain and favor a decision in this sense but it be not for nothing that america be found upon religion when she see humanity in anguish she do not pass by on the other side she entry into the war have put a end i hope for ever to the family quarrel not very profound or significant which for a century and a half have be a jarring note in the relation of mother and daughter and it have put a end to another danger it seem at one time not unlikely that the english language as it be speak overseas would set up a life of its own and become separate from the language of the old country a development of this kind would be natural enough the boer of south africa speak dutch but not the dutch speak in holland the french canadian speak french but not the french of molire half a century ago when america be explore and settle she own country in wild and lone place she pioneer enrich the english speech with all kind of new and vivid phrase the tendency be then for america to go she own way and to cultivate what be new in language at the expense of what be old she pride herself even on have a spelling of she own and seem almost willing to break loose from tradition and to coin a new american english this have not happen and now i think it will not happen for one thing the american colonist leave we when already we have a great literature chaucer shakespeare and spenser belong to america no less than to we and america have never forget they the education which have be foster in american school and college keep the whole nation in touch with the past some of they best author write in a style that milton and burke would understand and approve there be no more beautiful english prose than nathaniel hawthorne 's the best speech of abraham lincoln and we may truly add of president wilson be merely classic english during my own lifetime i be sure i have see the speech usage of the two people draw closer together for one thing we on this side now borrow and borrow very freely the more picturesque colloquialism of america on informal occasion i sometimes brighten my own speech with phrase which i think i owe to one of the best of live american author mr george ade of chicago the author of _ fable in slang _ the press the telegraph the telephone and the grow habit of travel bind we closer together every year and the english that we speak however rich and various it may be be go to remain one and the same english we common inheritance one question the most important and difficult of all remain to be ask will this war in its course and in its effect tend to prevent or discourage later war if the gain that it bring prove to be merely partial and national gain if it exalt one nation by unjustly depress another and conquer cruelty by equal cruelty then nothing can be more certain than that the peace of the world be farther off than ever when she be near she death edith cavell patriot and martyr say that patriotism be not enough every one who think on international affair know this almost every one forget it in time of war what can be do to prevent nation from appeal to the wild justice of revenge a league of nation may do good but i be surprise that any one who have imagination and a knowledge of the fact should entertain high hope of it as a full solution there be a league of nation to-day which have give a verdict against the central power and that verdict be be enforce by the most terrible war in all human history if the verdict have be give before the war begin it may be say then germany might have accept it and refrain so she might but what then she would have feel herself wrong she would have defer the war and in way that she know so well would have set about make a party for herself among the nation of the league who can be confident that she would have fail either to divide she judge or to accumulate such element of strength that she might dare to defy they a league of nation would work well only if its verdict be loyally accept by all the nation compose it to make majority-rule possible you must have a community make up of member who be reasonably well inform upon one another 's affair and who be bind together by a tie of loyalty stronger and more enduring than they cause of difference it would be a happy thing if the nation of the world make such a community and the suffering of this war have bring they nearer to desire it but those who believe that such a community can be form to-day or to-morrow be too sanguine it must not be forget that the very principle of the league if its judgement be to take effect involve a world-war in case where a strong minority resist those judgement every war would become a world-war perhaps this very fact would prevent war but it can not be say that experience favor such a conclusion there be no escape for we by way of the gospel the gospel precept to turn the other cheek to the aggressor be not address to a meeting of trustee christianity have never shirk war or even much dislike it where the whole soul be set on thing unseen wound and death become of less account and if the christian have not help we to avoid war how should the pacifist be of use those of they whom i happen to know or to have meet have show themselves in the relation of civil life to be irritable self-willed combative creature where the average soldier be calm unselfish and placable there be something incongruous and absurd in the pacifist of british descent he have fight in he blood and when he creed or he nervous sensibility to physical horror deny he the use of fight he blood turn sour he can argue and object and criticize but he can not lead all that he can offer we in effect be eternal quarrel in place of occasional fight no one can do anything to prevent war who do not recognize its splendor for it be by its splendor that it keep its hold on humanity and persist the wickedest and most selfish war in the world be not fight by wicked and selfish soldier the spirit of man be immense and for a old memory a pledge word a sense of fellowship offer this frail and complicated tissue of flesh and blood which a pin or a grain of sand will disorder to be the victim of all the atrocity that the wit of man can compound out of fire and steel and poison if that spirit be to be change or direct into new course it must be by one who understand it and approach it reverently with bared head the best hope seem to I to lie in pay chief attention to the improvement of war rather than to its abolition to the decency of the craft to the style rather than the matter style be often more important than matter and this war would not have be so fierce or so prolonged if it have not become largely a war on a point of style a war that be to say to determine the question how war should be wage if the german have behave humanely and considerately to the civil population of belgium if they have keep they solemn promise not to use poison-gas if they have refrain from murder at sea if they valor have be accompany by chivalry the war might now have be end perhaps not in they disfavor for it would not have be feel as it now be feel that they must be defeat at no matter how great a cost or civilization will perish even as thing be there have be some gain in the manner of conduct war which when future generation look back on they will be see to be considerable it be true that modern science have devise new and appalling weapon the invention of a new weapon in war always arouse protest but it do not usually in the long run make war more inhuman there be a great outcry in europe when the broadsword be supersede by the rapier and a tall man of he hand could be spit like a cat or a rabbit by any dexterous little fellow with a trained wrist there be a wave of indignation which be a hundred year in pass when musketry first come into use and a man-at-arms of great prowess could be kill from behind a wall by one who would not have dare to meet he in open combat but these change do not in effect make war crueller or more deadly they give more play to intelligence and abolish the tyranny of the bully who take the wall of every man he meet and make himself a public nuisance the introduction of poison-gas which be a small thing compare with the invention of fire-arm have give the chemist a place in the rank of fighting-men and if science have lend its aid to the destruction of life it have spend greater zeal and more prolonged effort on the saving of life no previous war will compare with this in care for the wound and maim in all country and on all front a army of skilled worker devote themselves to this single end i believe that this quicken of the human conscience for that be what it be will prove to be the greatest gain of the war and the greatest advance make in restraint of war if the nation come to recognize that they first duty and they first responsibility be to those who give so much in they service that recognition will of itself do more than can be do by any conclave of statesman to discourage war it be the monk telemachus accord to the old story who stop the gladiatorial game at rome and be stone by the people if war in process of time shall be abolish or fail that shall be govern by the code of humanity and chivalry like a decent tournament then the one sacrificial figure which will everywhere be honor for the change will be the figure not of a priest or a politician but of a hospital nurse the war and the press _ a paper read to the essay society eton college march 14 1918 _ when you ask I to read or speak to you i promise to speak about the war what i have to say be wholly orthodox but it be none the worse for that indeed when i think how entirely the war possess we thought and how entirely we be agree concern it i seem to see a new meaning in the creed of the religion these creed grow up by general consent and no one who believe they grudge repeat they in the face of a indifferent or hostile world the faithful find themselves oblige to define they belief and to strengthen themselves by a unwearying and united profession of faith it be the enemy who give meaning to a religious creed : without we creed we can not win so i be willing to remind you of what you know rather than to try to introduce you to novelty the strength of the enemy lie in he creed not in the land that he have ravish from he neighbor if he creed do not prevail he land will not help he germany have take land from belgium serbium roumanium russium and the rest but unless she digestion be as strong as she appetite she will fail to keep they if she be to hold they in peace the people who inhabit these land must be either exterminate or convert to the german creed land can be annex by a successful campaign they can be permanently conquer only by the operation of peace the people who survive will be a weakness to the german empire unless they accept what they be offer a share in the german creed that creed have not many natural attraction for the people on whom it be impose by force it be a intensely patriotic creed it insist on racial supremacy and on unity to be achieve by violence plead and persuasion have little part in it except as instrument of deceit there be no use in listen to what the german say they do not believe it themselves what they say be for other what they do be for themselves while they be at war language for they have only two use -- to conceal they thought and to deceive they enemy the creed of western civilization for which they feel nothing but contempt and on which they will be break be not a simple thing like theirs the word by which it be commonly express -- democracy parliamentarism individual liberty diversity free development -- be puzzling theoretic word which make no instinctive appeal to the heart nevertheless we stand for growth as against order and for life as against death if germany win this war she system will have to be break or to decay before growth can start again must we lose even a hundred year in shake ourselves free from the paralysis of the german nightmare the german have show themselves strong in they unity and strong in they willingness to make great sacrifice to preserve that unity no one can deny nobility to the sacrifice make by the simple-minded german soldier who die fight bravely for he people and he creed he narrowness be he strength and make unselfishness easier by save he mind from question ` this one thing you shall do ' he country say to he ` fight and die for you country so that you country and you people shall have lordship over other country and other people you be nothing germany be everything ' we who live in this island love we country with at least as deep a passion but a creed so simple as the german creed will never do for we we be patriotic but we patriotism be often overlay and confuse by a wider thought and a wider sympathy than the german have ever know much extravagant praise have lately be give to the german power of think which produce the elaborate marvel of german organization but this thinking be slave-thinking not master-thinking it spend itself wholly on devise complicated means to achieve a very simple end that be what make the german so like the animal they wisdom be all cunning i have have german friend two or three in the course of my life but none of they ever understand a word that i say if i try to say what i think you could talk to they about food and they respond easily it be all very restful and pleasant like talk to a intelligent dog if each of the ally nation be devote to the creed of nationalism the alliance could not endure we depend for we strength on what we hold in common the weakness of this wider creed be that it make no such immediate and strong appeal to the natural instinct as be make by the mother-country it demand the habitual exercise of reason and imagination further see that we be infinitely less tame and less docile than the german we depend for we strength on inform and convince we people and on obtain agreement among they question which in germany be discuss only in the gloomy berlin head-quarter of the general staff be discuss here in the newspaper in the press even under the censorship we think aloud it record we difference and debate we policy you could not suppress these difference and these debate without damage we cause there be no freedom worth have which do not sooner or later include the freedom to say what you think no doubt we could if necessary carry on for a time without the press and i agree with those newspaper writer who have be say recently that the importance of the press be monstrously exaggerate by some of its critic the working-man so far as i know he do not depend for he patriotism on the leader-writer of the newspaper he take even the news with a very large grain of salt ` so the papers say ' he remark ` it may be true or it may not ' yet the press have do good service and might do better in put the meaning of the war before we people and in hold they together freedom mean that we must love we diversity well enough to be willing to unite to protect it we must die for we difference as cheerfully as the german die for they pattern or if we can sketch a design of we cause we must be as passionate in defense of that large vague design as the german be passionate in defense of they tight uniformity and they drill if we be to fail to keep together we cause i believe would still prevail but at a cost that we dare not contemplate by way of anarchy and the dissolution of society by long torture and tear and martyrdom if we refuse to die in the rank against the german tyranny we can keep we faith by die at the stake there be those who think martyrdom the better way and certainly that be how christianity prevail in europe you can read the story in caxton 's translation of the _ golden legend _ but these saint and martyr be make a beginning we be fight to keep what we have win and it would be a huge failure on we part if we could keep nothing of it but have to begin all over again the business of the press then at this present crisis be to keep the cause for which we be fight clearly before we and this it have do well also because we do not fight best in blinders to tell we all that can be know of the fact of the situation and this it have do not so well the power of the newspaper be that most people read they and that many people read nothing else they weakness be that they have to sell or cease to be so that by a natural instinct of self-preservation they fall back on the two sure method whereby you can always capture the attention of the public any man who be try to say what he think make full allowance for all doubt and difference run the risk of lose he audience he can regain they attention by flattering they or by frightening they flattery and fright the one follow the other from day to day and often from paragraph to paragraph be a very large part of the newspaper reader 's diet if he be a sane and busy man he be not too much impress by either he be not mercurial enough for the quick change of a orator 's or journalist 's fancy whereby he be call on one day to dig the german warship like rat out of they harbor and not many day later to spend he last shilling on the purchase of the last bullet to shoot at the german invader he know that this be such stuff as dream be make of he know also that the orator or journalist after call on he for these achievement go home to dinner no great harm be do just as no great harm be do by bad novel but a opportunity be lose the press and the platform might do more than they do to strengthen we and inform we and help forward we cause i name the press and the platform together because they be essentially the same thing journalism be a kind of talk the press it be fair to say be ourselves and every people it may truly be say have the press that it deserve but reading be a thing that we do chiefly for indulgence and pleasure in we idle time and the press fall in with we mood and supply we with what we want in we weaker and lazier moment no responsible man with a eager and active mind spend much of he time on the newspaper those who be excite to action by what they read in the papers be mostly content with the mild exercise of write to these same papers to explain that some one else ought to do something and to do it at once they excitement worry themselves more than it hurt other when the devil with horn and hoof appear to cuvier the naturalist and threaten to devour he cuvier who be asleep at the time open he eye and look at the terrible apparition ` hm ' he say ` cloven-footed graminivorous need not be afraid of you ' and he go to sleep again a man who say that he have not time to read the morning papers carefully be commonly a man who count he know what he have to do and he go on do it so far as i have observe the cadet who be training for command in the army take very little interest in the exhortation of the newspaper they even prefer the miserable trickle which be all that be leave of football news one of the chief problem connect with the press be therefore this -- how can it be prevent from produce hysteria in the feeble-minded in time of war the censorship no doubt do something to prevent this and i think it might do more ` scare-line ' as they be call -- that be sensational heading in large capital letter -- might be reduce by law to modest dimension more important the censorship might insist that all who write shall sign they name to they article why should journalist alone be relieve of responsibility to they country be it possible that the government be afraid of the press there be no need for fear ` beware of aristophane ' say landor ` he can cast you name as a byword to a thousand city of asia for a thousand year but all that the press can do by its disfavor be to keep you name obscure in a hundred city of england for a hundred day sign article be rob of they vague impressiveness and be know for what they be -- the opinion of one man i would also recommend that a photograph of the author be place at the head of every article i have be save from many bad novel by the helpful pictorial advertisement of modern publisher the real work of the press as i say be to help to hold the people together nothing else that it can do be of any importance compare with this we be at one in this war as we have never be at one before within live memory as we be not at one against napoleon or against loui xiv we trial be on we and if we can not preserve we oneness we fail what would be leave to we i do not know but i be sure that a england which have accept condition of peace at germany 's hand would not be the england that any of we know there might still be a few englishman but they would have to look about for somewhere to live serbium would be a good place it have make no peace-treaty with germany we be profoundly at one and be divide only by illusion which the press in time past have do much to keep alive one of these illusion be the illusion of party i have never be behind the scene among the creaking machinery but my impression as a spectator be that party in england be make very much as you pick up side for a game i have observe that they be all conservative the affection be conservative every one have a liking for he old habit and he old associate there be something comic in a well-nourished rich man who believe that he be a bold reformer and a destructive thinker for real clotted reactionary sentiment i know nothing to match the table-talk of any aged parliamentary radical when we get a labor government it will be patriotic prejudiced oppose to all innovation superstitiously reverential of the past sticky and probably tyrannical the party illusion have be much weaken by the war and those who still repeat the old catch-word be very near to lunacy there be a deeper and more dangerous illusion which have not be kill -- the class illusion we be all very much alike but we live in water-tight compartment call class and the inhabitant of each compartment tend to believe that they alone be patriotic this illusion to be just be not foster chiefly by the press which want to sell its work to all class but it have strong hold of the government office the government do not know the people except as a actor know the audience and therefore do not trust the people it be pathetic to hear official talk timidly of the people -- will they endure hardship and sacrifice will they carry through yet most of the success we have win in the war have to be credit not so much to the skill of the management as to the amazing high courage of the ordinary soldier and sailor even soldier be often subject to class illusion i remember listen in the first month of the war to a retired colonel who explain with some heat that the territorial could never be of any use that illusion have go then it be kitchener 's army -- well-meaning people no doubt but impossible for a european war kitchener 's army make good now it be the civil population who though they be the blood relative of the soldier be distrust and believe to be likely to fail under a strain yet all the time if you want to hear half-hearted timid pusillanimous talk the place where you be most likely to hear it be in the public office most of those who talk in this way would be brave enough in fight but they be keep at desk and worry with detailed business and harass by speculative danger and they lose perspective soon or late we be go to win this war and it be the people who be go to win it if the press -lrb- or perhaps the government which control the press -rrb- be not afraid of the people why do it tell they so little about we reverse and the merit of we enemy for information concern these thing we have to depend wholly on conversation with return soldier for instance the horrible story that we hear of the brutal treatment of we prisoner be numerous and be true and make a heavy bill against germany which bill we mean to present but be they fair example of the average treatment we can not tell the account publish be almost exclusively confine to the worst happening most of the officer with whom i have talk who have be in several german military prison say that they have nothing serious to complain of prison be not a good place and it be not pleasant to have you pea-soup and you coffee one after the other in the same tin dipper but they be soldier and they agree that it would be absurd to make a grievance of thing like that one private soldier be a even greater philosopher ` no ' he say ' i have nothing to complain of of course they do spit at you a good deal ' that man be unconquerable in ship return and the like we be give average why be we tell nothing at all of the milder experience of we soldier prisoner it would not make we less resolve to do all that we can to better the lot of those who be suffer insult and torture and to exact full retribution from the enemy and it would bring some hope to those whose husband or child or friend be in german military prison and who be rack every day by tale of what in fact be exceptional atrocity or take the question of the conduct of german officer we know that the prussian military government in its approve handbook teach its officer the use of brutality and terror as military weapon the german philosophy of war of which this be a part be not really a philosophy of war it be a philosophy of victory for a long time now the german have be accustom to victory and have study the art of break the spirit and torture the mind of the people whom they invade they philosophy of war will have to be rewrite when the time come for they to accommodate they doctrine to they own defeat in the meantime they teach frightfulness to they officer and most of they officer prove ready pupil there must be some one would think here and there if only a sprinkling who fall short of the prussian doctrine and be betray by human feeling into what we should recognize as decent and honorable conduct and so there be only we do not hear of they through the press i should like to tell two story which come to I from personal source the first may be call the story of the christmas truce and the german captain in the lull which fall on the fighting at the time of the first christmas of the war a british officer be disquiet to notice that he man be fraternize with the german who be stand about with they in no-man 's land laughing and talk he go out to they at once to bring they back to they own trench when he come up to he man he meet a german captain who have arrive on the same errand the two officer british and german fall into talk and while they be stand together in not unfriendly fashion one of the man take a snapshot photograph of they copy of which be afterwards circulate in the trench then the man be recall to they duty on the one side and the other and after a interval of some day the war begin again a little time after this the british officer be in charge of a patrol and have lose he way find himself in the german trench where he and he man be surround and capture as they be be march off along the trench they meet the german captain who order the man to be take to the rear and then address the officer without any sign of recognition say in a loud voice ` you follow I ' he lead he by complicated way along a whole series of trench and up a sap at the end of which he stop salute and point with he hand say ` you trench be there good day ' my second story the story of the british lieutenant in no-man 's land be briefer i be with a friend of mine a young officer back from the front wounded and the conduct of german officer be be discuss he say ` you can not expect I to be very hard on german officer for one of they save my life ' he then tell how he and a companion creep out into no-man 's land to bring in some of we wound who be lie there when they have reach the wound and be prepare to bring they in they be discover by the german opposite who at once whip up a machine-gun and turn it on they they life be not worth half a minute 's purchase when suddenly a german officer leap up on to the parapet and angrily wave back the machine-gunner call out in english ` that be all right you may take they in ' these be no doubt exceptional case the rule be very different but a good many of such case be know to soldier and i have see none of they in the press soldier be silent by law and journalist either do not hear these thing or believe that hate be a valuable asset suppress all mention of they if england could ever be disgrace by a mishap she would be disgrace by have give birth to those englishman few and wretched who when a enemy behave generously conceal or deny the fact and consider the effect of this silence on the german there be some german officer as i say who be better than the german military handbook and better than they monstrous chief which of they will pay the smallest attention to what we papers say when he find that they collect only atrocity and be blind to humanity if they see it in a enemy he will regard we press account of the german army as the work of malicious cripple and we perfectly true narrative of the unspeakable brutality and filthiness of the german army 's doings will lose credit with he if i have my way i would staff the newspaper office as far as possible with wounded soldier and i would give some of the present staff a holiday as stretcher-bearer then we should hear more of the truth be it fear that we should have no heart for the war if once we be convince that among the german there be some human being be it believe that we people can be heroic on one condition only that they shall be ask to fight no one but orangoutang we airman fight as well as any one in this world or above it have ever fight and we owe they a great debt of thanks for maintain and by they example actually teach the german to maintain a high standard of decency this war have show what we might have gather from we history that we fight best up hill from we history also we may learn that it do not relax we sinew to be tell that we enemy have some good quality we should like he better as a enemy if he have more we know what we have believe and we be not go to fail in resolve or perseverance because we find that we task be difficult and that we have not a monopoly of all the virtue most of we will not live to see it for we recovery from this disease will be long and troublesome but the war will do great thing for we it will make a reality of the british commonwealth which until now have be only a aspiration and a dream it will lay the sure foundation of a league of nation in the affection and understanding which it have promote among all english-speaking people and in the relation of mutual respect and mutual service which it have establish between the english-speaking people and the latin race we unite roll of honor make the most magnificent list of benefactor that the world have ever see in the end the war may perhaps even save the soul of the main criminal awaken he from he bloody dream and lead he back by degree to the possibility of innocence and goodwill shakespeare and england _ annual shakespeare lecture of the british academy deliver July 4 1918 _ there be nothing new and important to be say of shakespeare in recent year antiquary have make some addition to we knowledge of the fact of he life these addition be all tantalizing and comparatively insignificant the history of the publication of he work have also become clearer and more intelligible especially by the labor of mr pollard but the whole question of quarto and folio remain thorny and difficult so that no one can reach any definite conclusion in this matter without a liberal use of conjecture i propose to return to the old catholic doctrine which have be illuminate by so many disciple of shakespeare and to speak of he as we great national poet he embody and exemplify all the virtue and most of the fault of england any one who read and understand he understand england this method of study shakespeare by read he have perhaps go somewhat out of vogue in favor of more roundabout way of approach but it be the best method for all that shakespeare tell we more about himself and he mind than we could learn even from those who know he in he habit as he live if they be all alive and all talk to learn what he tell we have only to listen i think there be no national poet of any great nation whatsoever who be so completely representative of he own people as shakespeare be representative of the english there be certainly no other english poet who come near to shakespeare in embody we character and we foible no one in this connexion would venture even to mention spenser or milton chaucer be english but he live at a time when england be not yet completely english so that he be only half-conscious of he nation wordsworth be english but he be a recluse browning be english but he live apart or abroad and be a tourist of genius the most english of all we great man of letter next to shakespeare be certainly dr johnson but he be no great poet shakespeare it may be suspect be too poetic to be a perfect englishman but he work refute that suspicion he be the englishman endow by a fortunate chance with matchless power of expression he be not silent or dull but he understand silent man and he enter into the mind of dull man moreover the englishman seem duller than he be it be a point of pride with he not to be witty and not to give voice to he feeling the shepherd corin who be never in court have the true philosophy ` he that have learn no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or come of a very dull kindred ' shakespeare know nothing of the british empire he be a islander and he patriotism be centre on this precious stone set in the silver sea which serve it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier land when he speak of briton and british he always mean the celtic people of the island once only he make a slip there be a passage in _ king lear _ -lrb- iv vi 249 -rrb- where the follower of the king who in the text of the quarto version be correctly call ` the british party ' appear in the folio version as ` the english party ' perhaps the quarto contain shakespeare 's own correction of he own inadvertence but those of we and we be many who have be blame by northern patriot for the misuse of the word english may claim shakespeare as a brother in misfortune we critic at home and abroad accuse we of arrogance i doubt if we can prove they wrong but they do not always understand the nature of english arrogance it do not commonly take the form of self-assertion shakespeare 's casual allusion to we national characteristic be almost all of a kind they be humorous and depreciatory here be some of they every holiday fool in england we learn from trinculo in _ the tempest _ would give a piece of silver to see a strange fish though no one will give a doit to relieve a lame beggar the english be quarrelsome master slender testify at the game of bear-baiting they be great drinker say iago ` most potent in pot you dane you german and you swag-bellied hollander be nothing to you english ' they be epicure say macbeth they will eat like wolf and fight like devil say the constable of france a english nobleman accord to the lady of belmont can speak no language but he own a english tailor accord to the porter of macbeth 's castle will steal cloth where there be hardly any cloth to be steal out of a french hose the devil say the clown in _ all 's well _ have a english name he be call the black prince nothing have be change in this vein of humorous banter since shakespeare die one of the best piece of shakespeare criticism ever write be contain in four word of the present poet laureate 's ode for the tercentenary of shakespeare ` london 's laughter be thine ' the wit of we trench in this war especially perhaps among the cockney and south country regiment be pure shakespeare falstaff would find himself at home there and would recognize a brother in old bill the best know of shakespeare 's allusion to england be no doubt those splendid outburst of patriotism which occur in _ king john _ and _ richard ii _ and _ henry v _ and of these the die speech of john of gaunt in _ richard ii _ be the deepest in feeling it be a lament upon the decay of england ` this dear dear land ' since we begin to be a nation we have always lament we decay i be afraid that the german whose self-esteem take another form be deceive by this to the right english temper all bragging be a thing of evil omen that temper be well express where perhaps you would least expect to find it in the speech of king henry v to the french herald : to say the sooth -- though ` tis no wisdom to confess so much unto a enemy of craft and vantage -- my people be with sickness much enfeebled my number lessen and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they be in health i tell thee herald i think upon one pair of english leg do march three frenchman yet forgive I god that i do brag thus this you air of france have blow that vice in I i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i be : my ransom be this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell he we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in we way there be for thy labor montjoy go bid thy master well advise himself : if we may pass we will if we be hinder we shall you tawny ground with you red blood discolor and so montjoy fare you well the sum of all we answer be but this : we would not seek a battle as we be nor as we be we say we will not shun it so tell you master that speech might have be write for the war which we be wage to-day against a less honorable enemy but indeed shakespeare be full of prophecy here be he description of the volunteer who flock to the color in the early day of the war : rash inconsiderate fiery voluntary with lady ' face and fierce dragon ' spleen have sell they fortune at they native home bear they birthright proudly on they back to make a hazard of new fortune here in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirit than now the english bottom have waft o'er do never float upon the swell tide and here be he sermon on national unity preach by the bishop of carlisle : o if you rear this house against this house it will the woefullest division prove that ever fall upon this cursed earth prevent it resist it let it not be so lest child child 's child cry against you ` woe ' the patriotism of the woman be describe by the bastard in _ king john _ : you own lady and pale-visag would maid like amazon come trip after drum : they thimble into armed gauntlet change they needle to lance and they gentle heart to fierce and bloody inclination lastly queen isabellum 's blessing speak over king henry v and he french bride predict a enduring friendship between england and france : as man and wife be two be one in love so be there ` twixt you kingdom such a spousal that never may ill office or fall jealousy which trouble oft the bed of bless marriage thrust in between the paction of these kingdom to make divorce of they incorporate league that english may as french french englishman receive each other god speak this amen one of the delight of a literature as rich and as old as ours be that at every step we take backwards we find ourselves again we be deliver from that foolish vein of think so dear to ignorant conceit which degrade the past in order to exalt the present and the future it be easy to feel ourselves superior to man who no longer breathe and walk and whom we do not trouble to understand here be the real benefit of scholarship it reduce man to kinship with they race science press forward and beat against the bar which guard the secret of the future have no such sympathy in its gift anyhow in shakespeare 's time england be already old england which if she could ever cease to be she might be jerusalem or paradise but would not be england at all what shakespeare and he fellow of the sixteenth century give she be a new self-consciousness and a new self-confidence they forage in the past they recognize themselves in they ancestor they find feudal england which have exist for many hundred of year a dumb thing and when she do not know she own meaning they endow she purpose with word they give she a new delight in herself a new sense of power and exhilaration which have remain with she to this day survive all the airy philosophic theory of humanity which think to supersede the old solid national temper the english national temper be better fit for traffic with the world than any mere doctrine can ever be for it be mark by a immense tolerance and this too shakespeare have express falstaff be perhaps the most tolerant man who be ever make in god 's image but it be rather late in the day to introduce falstaff to a english audience perhaps you will let I modernize a brief scene from shakespeare alter nothing essential to illustrate how completely he spirit be the spirit of we troops in flander and france a small british expeditionary force bind on a international mission find itself strand in a unknown country the force be compose of man very various in rank and profession two of they whom we may call a non-commissioned officer and a private go explore by themselves and take one of the native of the place prisoner this native be a ugly low-born creature of great physical strength and violent criminal tendency a liar and ready at any time for theft rape and murder he be a child of nature a lover of music slavish in he devotion to power and rank and very easily impose upon by authority he captor do not fear he and which be more they do not dislike he they find he lie out in a kind of no-man 's land drench to the skin so they determine to keep he as a souvenir and to take he home with they they nickname he in friendly fashion the monster and the mooncalf as who should say fritz or the boche but they first care be to give he a drink and to make he swear allegiance upon the bottle ` where the devil should he learn we language ' say the non-commissioned officer when the monster speak ' i will give he some relief if it be but for that ' the prisoner then offer to kiss the foot of he captor ' i shall laugh myself to death ' say the private ` at this puppy-headed monster a most scurvy monster i could find in my heart to beat he but that the poor monster 's in drink ' when the private continue to rail at the monster he officer call he to order ` trinculo keep a good tongue in you head : if you prove a mutineer the next tree ------ the poor monster 's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity ' in this scene from _ the tempest _ everything be english except the name the incident have be repeat many time in the last four year ` this be bill ' one private say introduce a german soldier to he company ` he be my prisoner i wound he and i take he and where i go he go come on bill old man ' the german have know many failure since they begin the war but one failure be more tragic than all the rest they love to be impressive to produce a panic of apprehension and a thrill of reverence in they enemy and they have completely fail to impress the ordinary british private he remain incurably humorous and so little move to passion that he daily office of kindness be hardly interrupted shakespeare 's tolerance which be no greater than the tolerance of the common english soldier may be well see in he treatment of he villain be a liar or a thief merely a bad man shakespeare do not much encourage you to think so be a murderer a bad man he would be a undiscerning critic who should accept that phrase as a true and adequate description of macbeth shakespeare do not dislike liar thief and murderer as such and he do not pretend to dislike they he have he own dislike i once ask a friend of mine long since dead who refuse to condemn almost anything whether there be any vice that he could not find it in he heart to tolerate he reply at once that there be two -- cruelty and bilk which if the word be not academic i may paraphrase as cheat the helpless swindle a child out of its penny or leave a house by the back door in order to avoid pay you cabman he lawful fare these exclusion from mercy shakespeare would accept and i think he would add a third he worst villain be all theorist who cheat and murder by the book of arithmetic they be man of principle and be ready to expound they principle and to defend it in argument they follow it without remorse or mitigation wherever it lead they it be iago 's logic that make he so terrible he mind be as cold as a snake and as hard as a surgeon 's knife the italian renaissance do produce some such man the modern german imitation be a grosser and feebler thing brutality try to emulate the glitter and flourish of refine cruelty with he wonderful quickness of intuition and he unsurpassed subtlety of expression shakespeare draw the character of the englishman that he see around he why be it that he have give we no full-length portrait carefully draw of a hypocrite it can hardly have be for lack of model outside england not only among we enemy but among we friend and ally it be agree that hypocrisy be we national vice we ruling passion there must be some meaning in so widely hold a opinion and on we side there be damaging admission by many witness the portrait gallery of charle dickens be crowd with hypocrite some of they be greasy and servile like mr pumblechook or uriah heep other rise to poetic height of daring like mr chadband or mr squeer but shakespeare 's hypocrite enjoy themselves too much they be artist to the finger-tip it may be say no doubt that shakespeare live before organize religious dissent have develop a new type of character among the weaker brethren but the low church protestant whom shakespeare certainly know be not very different from the evangelical dissenter of later day and he do not interest shakespeare my own impression be that shakespeare have a free and happy childhood and grow up without much check from he elder it be the child who see hypocrite these preposterous grown-up people who if they be well-mannered do not seem to enjoy they food who be fussy about meaningless employment and never give way to natural impulse must surely assume this veil of decorum with intent to deceive charle dickens be hard drive in he childhood and the impression that be then burn into he govern all he see the creative spirit in he transform he suffering into delight but he never outgrow they and when he die the eye of a child be close upon a scene touch it be true here and there with rapturous pleasure rich in oddity and tremble with pathos but in the main as bleak and unsatisfying as the ward of a workhouse the intense emotion of he childhood make the usual fervor of adolescence a faint thing in the comparison and if you want to know how lover think and feel you do not go to dickens to tell you you go to shakespeare who put he childhood behind he so that he almost forget it and run forward to seize life with both hand he sometimes look back on child and see they through the eye of they elder dickens see man and woman as they appear to child this comparison suggest a certain lack of sympathy or lack of understanding in those who be quick to see hypocrisy in other in dickens lack of sympathy be a fair revenge moreover he hypocrite amuse he so much that he do not wish to understand they what a loss it would have be to the world if he have explain they away but it be difficult i think to see a hypocrite in a man whose intimacy you have cultivate whose mind you have enter into as shakespeare enter into the mind of he creature hypocrisy in its ordinary form be a superficial thing -- a skin disease not a cancer it be not easy at best to bring the outward and inward relation of the soul into perfect harmony a hypocrite be one who too readily consent to they separation the english for i be ready now to return to my point be a people of a divide mind slow to drive anything through on principle very ready to find reason in compromise they be passionate and they be idealist but they be also a practical people and they dare not give the rein to a passion or a idea they know that in this world a unmitigated principle simply will not work that a clean cut will never take you through the maze so they restrain themselves and listen and seem patient they be not so patient as they seem they must be hypocrite a cruder simpler people like the german feel indignation not unmixed perhaps with envy when they hear the quiet voice and see the white lip of the thoroughbred englishman who be angry it be not manly or honest they think to be angry without get red in the face they certainly feel pride in they own honesty when they give explosive vent to they emotion they have not learn the element of self-distrust the englishman be seldom quite content to be himself often he thought be trouble by something better he suffer from the divide mind and earn the reputation of a hypocrite but the simpler nature that indulge itself and believe in itself have a even heavier penalty to pay if in the name of honesty you cease to distinguish between what you be and what you would wish to be between how you act and how you would like to act you be in some danger of reel back into the beast it be true that man be a animal and before long you feel a glow of conscious virtue in proclaim and illustrate that truth you scorn the hypocrisy of pretend to be better than you be and that very scorn fix you in what you be ` he that be unjust let he be unjust still and he which be filthy let he be filthy still ' that be the epitaph on german honesty i have drift away from shakespeare who know nothing of the sea of trouble that england would one day take arm against and who could not know that on that day she would outgo he most splendid praise and more than vindicate he reverence and he affection but shakespeare be still so live a mind that it be vain to try to expound he by select text or to pin he to a mosaic of quotation from he book often if you seek to know what he think on question which must have exercise he imagination you can gather it only from a hint drop by accident and quite irrelevant what be he view on literature and on the literary controversy which have be agitate from he day to we own he tell we very little he must have hear discussion and argument on metre on classical precedent on the ancient and modern drama but he make no mention of these question he do not seem to have attach any prophetic importance to poetry the poet who exalt they craft be of a more slender build be it conceivable that he would have give he support to a literary academy -- a project which begin to find advocate during he lifetime i think not it be true that he be full of good sense and that a academy exist to promulgate good sense moreover he own free experiment bring he nearer and nearer into conformity with classical model _ othello _ and _ macbeth _ be better construct play than _ hamlet _ the only one of he play which whether by chance or by design observe the so-called unity of action and time and place be one of he latest play -- _ the tempest _ but he be a englishman and would have be jealous of he freedom and independence when the grave-digger remark that it be no great matter if hamlet do not recover he wit in england because there the man be as mad as he the satire have a sympathetic ring in it shakespeare do not wish to see the mad english altered nor be they likely to alter we fear and we hope be vain we enter on the greatest of we war with a army no bigger so we be tell than the bulgarian army since that time we have regimented and organize we people not without success and we soothsayer be now direct we attention to the danger that after the war we shall be keep in uniform and shall become tame creature lose we independence and we spirit of enterprise there be nothing that soothsayer will not predict when they be gravel for lack of matter but this be the stupidest of all they effort the national character be not so flimsy a thing it have go through good and evil fortune for hundred of year without turn a hair you can make a soldier and a good soldier of a humorist but you can not militarize he he remain a free thinker new institution do not flourish in england the town be a comparatively modern innovation it have never so to say catch on most scheme of town-planning be scheme for pretend that you live in the country this be one of the most persistent of we many hypocrisy wherever work people inhabit a street of continuous red-brick cottage the name that they give to they home be one long catalogue of romantic lie the house have no garden and the only prospect that they command be the view of over the way but read they name -- the dingle the elm pine grove windermere the nook the nest even social pretence which be say to be one of we weakness and which may be read in such name as belvoir or apsley house be less in evidence than the englishman 's passion for the country he can not bear to think that he live in a town he do not much respect the institution of a town a policeman before he have be long in the force have to face the fact that he be generally regard as a comic character the police be englishman and good fellow and they accept a situation which would rouse any continental gendarme to heroic indignation mayor alderman and justice of the peace be comic and take it not quite so well beadle be so wholly dedicate to the purpose of comedy that i suppose they find they position unendurable and go to earth at any rate it be very difficult to catch one in he official costume all this be reflect in shakespeare he know the country and he know the town and he have not leave it in doubt which be the cherish home of he imagination he prefer the field to the street but the arcadium of he choice be not agricultural or even pastoral it be rather a desert island or the uninhabited stretch of wild and woodland country indeed he have both describe it and name it ` where will the old duke live ' say oliver in _ as you like it _ ` they say he be already in the forest of arden ' say charle the wrestler ` and a many merry man with he and there they live like the old robin hood of england they say many young gentleman flock to he every day and fleet the time carelessly as they do in the golden world ' that be shakespeare 's arcadium and who that have read _ as you like it _ will deny that it breathe the air of paradise it be quite plain that the freedom that shakespeare value be in fact freedom not any of those ingenious mechanism to which that name have be apply by political theorist he think long and profoundly on the problem of society and anarchy have no place among he political ideal it be by all means to be avoid -- at a cost but what harm would anarchy do if it mean no more than freedom for all the impulse of the enlighten imagination and the tender heart the ideal of he heart be not political and when he indulge himself as he do in he latest play you must look for he in the wild whether on the road near the shepherd 's cottage or in the cave among the mountain of wale or on the seashore in the bermuda the law that be impose upon the intricate relation of man in society be a weariness to he and in this he be thoroughly english the englishman have always be a objector and he have a right to object though it may very well be hold that he be too fond of lard he objection with the plea of conscience but even this have a meaning in we annals as a mere question of right we be very slow to prefer the claim of the organize opinion of society to the claim of the individual conscience we know that there be no good in a man who be do what he do not will to do we be not like we poet or we man of action to be void of inspiration a gift be nothing if there be no benevolence in the giver : for to the noble mind rich gift wax poor when giver prove unkind we ask for the impulse as well as the deed even when he be speak of social obligation shakespeare make he strongest appeal not to force or command but to the natural piety of the heart : if ever you have look on better day if ever be where bell have knoll to church if ever sit at any good man 's feast if ever from you eyelid wipe a tear and know what ` tis to pity and be pity let gentleness my strong enforcement be : in the which hope i blush and hide my sword so speak orlando when the duke have meet he threat with fair word and he add a apology : pardon I i pray you i think that all thing have be savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment the ultimate law between man and man accord to shakespeare be the law of pity i suppose that most of we have have we ear so dull by early familiarity with portium 's famous speech which we probably know by heart long before we be fit to understand it that the heavenly quality of it equal to almost anything in the new testament be obscure and lose there be no remedy but to read it again to remember that it be conceive in passion and to notice how the meaning be raise and perfect as line follow line : _ portium _ then must the jew be merciful _ shylock _ on what compulsion must i tell I that _ portium _ the quality of mercy be not strain it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it be twice bless would it blesseth he that give and he that take : ` tis mightiest in the mightiest it become the throned monarch better than he crown he sceptre show the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of king but mercy be above this sceptred sway it be enthrone in the heart of king it be a attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god 's when mercy season justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of we should see salvation : we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach we all to render the deed of mercy that speech rise above the strife of nation it belong to humanity but a englishman write it and the author we may be sure if he ever meet with the doctrine that a man who be call on to help he own people be in duty bind to set aside the claim of humanity and to stop he ear to the call of mercy know that the doctrine be a invention of the devil stupid and angry as the devil commonly be there be hundred of thousand of englishman who though they could not have write the speech yet know all that it teach and act on the knowledge it be part of the creed of the navy we can speak more confidently than we could have speak three or four year ago we know that not the extremest pressure of circumstance could ever bring the people of england to forget all the natural piety to permit official duty to annul private charity and to join in the frenzied dance of hate and lust which lead to the mouth of the pit yet germany where all this seem to have happen be not very long ago a country where it be easy to find humanity and simplicity and kindness it be a country of quiet industry and content the home of fairy story which shakespeare himself would have love the german of we day have make a religion of war and terror and have use commerce as a means for the treacherous destruction of the independence and freedom of other they be not always like that in the fifteenth century they spread the art of printing through europe for the service of man by the method of peaceful penetration my friend mr john sampson recently express to I a hope that we air-force would not bomb mainz ` for mainz ' he say ` be a sacred place to the bibliographer ' accord to a statement publish in cologne in 1499 ` the highly valuable art of printing be invent first of all in germany at mainz on the rhine and it be a great honor to the german nation that such ingenious man be to be find among themand in the year of we lord 1450 it be a golden year and they begin to print and the first book they print be the bible in latin : it be print in a large character resemble the type with which the present mass-book be print ' gutenberg the printer of this bible never mention he own name and the only personal note we have of he in the colophon of the _ catholicon _ print in 1460 be a hymn in praise of he city : ` with the aid of the most high who unloose the tongue of infant and oft-time reveal to babe that which be hide from learn man this admirable book the _ catholicon _ be finish in the year of the incarnation of we savior mcccclx in the foster town of mainz a town of the famous german nation which god in he clemency by grant to it this high illumination of the mind have prefer before the other nation of the world ' there be something not quite unlike modern germany in that and yet these older activity of the german make a strange contrast with they work to-day it be in the city of cologne that caxton first make acquaintance with he craft everywhere the german spread printing like a new religion adapt it to exist condition in bavarium they use the skill of the wood-engraver and at augsburg ulm and nuremberg produce the first illustrated print book it be two german of the old school conrad sweynheym and arnold pannartz who carry the art to italy cast the first type in roman character and printing edition of the classic first in the benedictine monastery of st scholastica at subiaco and later at rome they also cast the first greek type it be three german ger kranz and freyburger who first print at paris in 1470 it be a german who set up the first printing-press in spain in 1474 the german be once the cherisher as now they be the destroyer of the inheritance of civilization i do not pretend to explain the change perhaps it be a tragedy of education that be a dangerous moment in the life of a child when he begin to be uneasily aware that he be value for he simplicity and innocence then he resolve to break with the past to put away childish thing to forgo affection and to earn respect by imitate the activity of he elder the strange power of word and the virtue of abstract thought begin to fascinate he he lose touch with the thing of sense and cease to speak as a child if he first attempt at argument and dogma win he praise and esteem if he prove himself a better fighter than a older boy next door who have often bully he and if at the same time he come into money he be on the road to ruin he very simplicity be a snare to he ` what a fool i be ' he think ` to let myself be put upon i now see that i be a great philosopher and a splendid soldier bear to subdue other rather than to agree with they and entitle to a chief share in all the luxury of the world it be for I to say what be good and true and if any of these people contradict I i shall knock they down ' he suit he behavior to he new conception of himself and be soon hate by all the neighbor then he turn bitter these people he think be all in a plot against he they must be blind to goodness and beauty or why do they dislike he he rage reach the point of madness he stab and poison the villager and burn down they house we be still wait to see what will become of he this outbreak have be long prepare seventy year before the war the german poet freiligrath write a poem to prove that germany be hamlet urge by the spirit of she father to claim she inheritance vacillate and lose in thought but destine before the fifth act end to strew the stage with the corpse of she enemy only a german could have hit on the idea that germany be hamlet the english for whom the play be write know that hamlet be hamlet and that shakespeare be think of a young man not of the pomposity of national ambition but if these clumsy allegory must be impose upon great poet germany need not go abroad to seek the likeness of she destiny germany be faust she desire science and power and pleasure and to get they on a short lease she pay the price of she soul for the present at any rate the best thing the german can do with shakespeare be to leave he alone they have divorce themselves from they own great poet to follow vulgar half-witted political prophet as for shakespeare they have study he assiduously with the complete apparatus of criticism for a hundred year and they do not understand the plainest word of all he teaching in england he have always be understand and it be only fair to he and to ourselves to add that he have never be regard first and foremost as a national poet he humanity be too calm and broad to suffer the prejudice and exclusion of international enmity the sovereignty that he hold have be allow to he by man of all party the school of literature have from the very first unite in he praise ben jonson who know he and love he be a classical scholar and disapprove of some of he romantic escapade yet no one will ever outgo ben jonson 's praise of shakespeare triumph my britain thou hast one to show to whom all scene of europe homage owe he be not-of a ago but for all time the sect of religion forget they dispute and recognize the spirit of religion in this profane author he can not be identify with any institution accord to the old say he give up the church and take to religion ho give up the state and take to humanity the formulary and breviary to which political and religious philosopher profess they allegiance be nothing to he these formulary be a convenient shorthand to save the trouble of thinking but shakespeare always think every question that he treat be bring out of the realm of abstraction and exhibit in its relation to daily life and the mind and heart of man he could never have be satisfy with such a smug phrase as ` the greatest happiness of the greatest number ' he mind would have be eager for detail in what do the greatest number find they happiness how far be the happiness of one consistent with the happiness of another what difficulty and miscarriage attend the business of transmute the recognize material for happiness into live human joy even these question he would not have be content to handle in high philosophic fashion he would have insist on instance and would have subscribe to no code that be not carefully build out of case-law he know that sanity be in the life of the sens and that if there be some philosopher who be not mad it be because they live a double life and have consolation and resource of which they book tell you nothing it be the part of they life which they do not think it worth they while to mention that would have interested shakespeare he love to reduce thing to they element ` be man no more than this ' say the old king on the heath as he gaze on the naked madman ` consider he well thou owest the worm no silk the beast no hide the sheep no wool the cat no perfume ha here 's three of we be sophisticated thou art the thing itself : unaccommodated man be no more but such a poor bare fork animal as thou art off off you lending ' that be how shakespeare lay the mind of man bare and strip he of he pretence to try if he be indeed noble and he find that man naked and weak hunt by misfortune liable to all the sin and all the evil that follow frailty still have faith leave to he and charity king lear be still every inch a king that be not a little discovery for when he mind come to grip with human life shakespeare do not deal in rhetoric so that the good he find be real good -- '' ti in grain ` twill endure wind and weather ' nothing be easier than to make a party of humanity and to exalt mankind by ignorantly vilify the rest of the animal creation which be full of strange virtue and ability shakespeare refuse that way he see man weak and wretched not able to maintain himself except as a pensioner on the bounty of the world curiously ignorant of he nature and he destiny yet endowed with certain gift in which he can find sustenance and rest brave by instinct so that courage be not so much he virtue as cowardice be he lamentable and exceptional fault ready to forget he pain or to turn they into pleasure by the alchemy of he mind quick to believe and slow to suspect or distrust generous and tender to other in so far as he thought and imagination which be the weakest thing about he enable he to bridge the space that separate man from man willing to make of life a great thing while he have it and a little thing when he come to lose it these be some of he gift and shakespeare would not have deny the say of a thinker with whom he have no very strong or natural affinity that ` the greatest of these be charity ' end of the project gutenberg ebook of england and the war by walter raleigh
