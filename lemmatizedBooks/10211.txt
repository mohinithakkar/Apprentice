the halt on the adirondack cabby where 's touch-and-go steve fellow why max he slip away with he little steel-jointed fishing-rod as soon as he hear you say we would stop here over night and i see he pick some fat white grub out of those old rotten stump we pass at the time we rest a hour back huh just like slippery steve to get out of the hard work we have go to have cut enough brush for make we shanty shelter tonight see that we do not fetch we bully old tent along this trip he be a nice one i should say n-n-never you m-m-mind about steve bandy-leg he t-t-tell I he _ know _ he c-c-could yank a m-m-mess of fine trout out of that c-c-creek where it look so s-s-shallow just back there he be m-m-meaning to w-w-wade in too i reckon and when you s-s-smell the fish c-c-cooking you 'll be s-s-sorry you say what you do well let 's get a move on and start that shanty i choose this place partly on account of there be so much brush handy you see sure you do max it take you to notice thing that miss we eye here let I handle the hatchet because you see i be such a truthful little shaver away back that my folk often regret they have not name I george washington all i c-c-can say then bandy-legs they b-b-build wiser than they know when they j-j-just let it g-g-go at regret a f-f-fine george washington you would m-m-make i be think the boy answer to the peculiar name of bandy-leg laugh good-naturedly as he begin to swing the sharp-edged hatchet and cut down some of the require brush which have camp many time before he know be suitable for they requirement besides this sturdy young chap with the lower limb that be a little bow and which fact have doubtless suggest such a nickname to he schoolmate there be two other busily engage in gather the material to be use in afford they a rude but effective shelter during the come night the one whom they call max seem to be look upon as a leader for it be absolutely necessary that in every pack of boy some one take the initiative he whole name be max hasting and on numberless occasion he have show a aptitude for do thing when the occasion arise that gain he the respect of he chum for a complete record of these achievement the reader be refer to earlier volume of this series where between the cover will be find much interesting and instructive read the third boy of the trio in sight be toby jucklin while toby be certainly agile enough when it come to acrobatic stunt and such thing as boy be fond of indulge in he vocal cord often love to play sad prank with he manner of speech as the reader have already discover toby be fain to stutter in the most agonizing fashion when one of these fit come upon he he would get red in the face and show the greatest difficulty in frame certain word then all of a sudden as though take a grip on himself toby would stop short draw in a long breath give a sharp whistle and strange to say start talk as plainly as the next one in time perhaps he would conquer this weakness which after all be only cause by nervousness and a desire to rattle out word there be a fourth chum also the steve speak of and who have slip away with he new steel-jointed bait-rod and a handful of fat grub as soon as he hear max say they have go far enough on they way steve be one of those hasty lad who do a thing while many people would be only figure it out have long ago fall heir to a number of suggestive nickname among other touch-and-go steve and old lightning these four lad be a long way from they home town of carson nestle on the evergreen river and near which we have see they in the earlier book of this series successfully carry out numerous of they undertaking in fact they be deep in the wildest part of the famous adirondack at the time we run across they on this particular occasion there be not a town within many mile nor for that matter a regular camp where summer guest be entertain the difficulty to be encounter along this carry be so great that ordinary excursionist avoid it severely indeed few fisherman ever invade these solitude although there be undoubtedly many place where trout of generous size might be pick up all this would make it seem a bit queer that max and he three chum should venture into this section of the wilderness without a guide along so perhaps it might be wise to enter upon explanation while the opportunity be open now these try and true chum have have strange thing happen to they before but they be well agree that they present undertaking far exceed everything else that have ever come they way at least so far as its be a romantic quest be concerned everything combine to make it seem a page tear from one of those old-time fairy book they use to love to read when much younger and more gullible in the first place it be a wonderful piece of luck that come they way when the school director agree after the summer be half over that the school building require considerable alteration in order to make they sanitary for the come winter and really a special providence that watch over the fortune of boy and girl must have cause the carpenter and mason to go on a protracted strike so that when this have be finally settle there be not nearly time enough left in which to complete the extensive repair school have start and go along in a rough-and-ready fashion for some week but everybody be sore about it the builder complain that they could not accomplish half the work they should because of the annoyance of have so many child trot around and bother they and the teacher be almost distract on account of the constant pound together with the presence of rough man who break in upon class and force they to vacate certain room because they have to do something there and so along about the first of October the school board wisely conclude that a vacation of some two week would do far less harm to the scholar than a continuation of these interruption besides the teacher on they part threaten to also strike unless relief come promptly imagine the delight of such fellow as max bandy-leg steve and toby jucklin all of whom love life in the open so much when they get the chance to further indulge this propensity especially at the most glorious time of the whole year when the nut crop be come on the tree turn red and yellow from the magical touch of jack frost 's cold finger with a tang in the air that make a fellow twice as hungry as he ever get in the hot old summer-time and then as though fate have determine to make this the most wonderful of period in all they checkered career a thing happen that seem just like one of those old but once much beloved fairy story perhaps by listen to the worker exchange comment as they gather the necessary brush which later on would be fashion into a shelter capable of shed even a moderate amount of rain we may be able to pick up enough general information to understand the nature of they mission up into the adirondack bandy-leg be speak at the time he have a little fault in the way of often show a disposition to look at the darker side of thing and doubtless be unusually tired after a hard day 's tramp with such a heavy pack on he back have something to do with he spirit of complain on the present occasion well all i can say fellow he remark as he carry a armful of the stuff he have be gather to the spot where max have already commence to erect the side of the squatty shelter by drive stake into the ground be that i hope we have not come all the way up here on a reg ` lar fool 's errand it would cost mr hopewell a pretty good sum and be a real disappointment to she if after all we do not find that good-for-nothing nephew of hers roland chase honest to goodness now i be a little inclined to believe he 'll be lead we a wild-goose chase if you want my opinion oh l-l-let up c-c-can ' t you bandy-legs splutter the indignant toby pause for a minute to wipe the bead of perspiration from he brow and regain he breath in the bargain you be g-g-get to be a regular old g-g-granny that be what with all you d-d-dismal p-p-prophesy tell I d-d-did we _ ever _ f-f-fail yet in anything we undertake c-c-course we have not right in the start we find all those b-b-bully p-p-pearl in those mussel we g-g-gather in the big sunflower river and lay away a n-n-nice n-n-nest-egg in bank for the crowd sure we 'll f-f-find roland chase we have just g-g-got to that be all all i want to say about it boy observe max be that i admire the grit of the boy they tell we he be something of a dude do not they and that he rich uncle be afraid he would never amount to much anyhow so what do he do but make a most _ extraordinary _ will at least everybody who be hear about that proviso say so i hear judge perkin say though he guess the old man know boy better than most folk and have take a wise course to prove whether this roland have any snap in he or not well he be leave just two thousand dollar cash down say bandy-leg in a thoughtful manner as though review the singular circumstance and if at the end of two year he could show that he have double that amount besides earn he own living why he be to come into two-third of he uncle 's fortune some of we carson people who know folk over in sagamore where the uncle live tell whopping big story about the size of that fortune i hear one man say he reckon it be as much as two hundred thousand dollar in all the funny part of it be resume max shake he head in a way rather odd for he that immediately after roland receive he two thousand in cash he disappear from the scene that be almost two year ago and from that day nobody in sagamore have ever have a peep at he the fact be he might almost be dead once he other aunt mr hopewell who live now in carson have a few line from roland he simply say he be alive and well and that he have hope of see she again one of these fine day yes that be r-r-right burst out toby in a disgusted tone but not a p-peep do he give about what he be d-d-doing or if he mean to show up and c-c-claim he f-f-fine f-f-fortune and all she could make out be that the p-p-postmark on the l-l-letter be piedmont ny which on look up we f-f-find be away up here in the h-h-heart of the old adirondack well say max still work industriously away mr hopewell be get very much concern about roland somehow she seem to fancy the boy though no one else think he would ever amount to anything because he use to like to wander around in the wood all the while or go fishing instead of study but i guess those people have not ever be boy themselves and all of we can appreciate this liking for the open that roland show and so pursued bandy-leg after the fashion of a story-teller who had-reach a crisis in he tale she ask max here if he would not be willing to undertake a trip to the mountain with several of he good chum mean we fellow to try and locate the miss roland and bring back some encouraging news for the good old soul be in great fear that the second year will soon be finish and unless roland be able to show four thousand dollar in cash most of the estate will go to he older cousin frederick mr hopewell dislike this chap very much because she say he be a bad man who drink and gamble and do all sort of thing old lady detest well we take she up in a jiffy as soon as we hear the glorious news about school be close for two week and as she foot all the bill we be bind to have a jolly time of it even if we do not run across roland and i think that be like look for a needle in a haystack that be a pretty long speech for even bandy-leg to make and yet it cover considerable of the ground and explain just how it come that max and he three comrade chance to be so far away from the home town the boy be just about to turn they attention once more to the work that have be undertake when all of they suddenly stop and listen that be steve yell then i reckon snap the owner of the bow leg but honest injun i do not make out what he say mebbe now he strike a whopper of a trout and be give one of he whoop you all know how excited steve do get if anything out of the way happen l-l-listen cry toby jncklin jump to he foot d-d-didn ' t it sound like he be yelpin ' help just what it seem like to I exclaim max something may have happen to steve because he be always get himself in trouble come along fellow and we 'll soon find out there he be whoop it up again and this time every one of the trio of run boy could plainly detect something approach agony in the thrilling cry of help oh hurry up fellow help chapter ii grip by a giant 's unseen hand that max bandy-leg and toby all keep they wit about they be manifest they action have make this clear enough for each of the trio before start on the jump as bandy-leg describe it have make sure to pick up something that accord to he mind be apt to be need max for instance have snatch a rope that hang from a broken branch of the tree and which one of the boy have fetch along simply because a rope often come in mighty handy for lot of thing besides a hang bee on he part toby have stoop down and possess himself of the camp hatchet if it prove that steve be be attack by a bobcat he fancy he could make pretty good use of such a tool in a emergency bandy-legs true to he hunter instinct make out to secure the only gun which have be bring with they on the trip as they run wildly in the direction from whence those appeal for assistance still come louder than ever every fellow be strain he vision to be the first to discover what it could be that be cause steve to let out such alarming whoop they do not have very far to go before suddenly all of they discover the object of they solicitude he seem to be stand nearly waist-deep in the stream and still hold on to he tough little steel rod oh shuck gasp bandy-leg almost out of breath from he violent exertion he be only strike a mud turtle or something like that and want we to come and see it be a burning shame to give we all such a scare over a measly turtle b-b-bet you it be a w-w-woppin ' b-b-big fish ejaculate toby keep on run snapped max he need help and in a hurry too this sort of talk amaze both the other so far as they could see steve stand there quite alone they look again but could see no savage animal attack they comrade nor be there any vast disturbance in the water as though some marine monster might be try to drag he down besides such thing as alligator or shark be utterly unknown up here in the adirondack but max he be all right as far as i can see expostulate bandy-leg in reality unwilling to keep up that violent exertion just to please some silly whim on the part of the fisherman who like as not would give they the laugh after they come up puffing and blow like porpoise look again snap max do not you see how deep he be in pretty nearly up to he waist be not he that be all right say bandy-leg but if the silly have go and wade deeper than he mean to why do not he just turn around and walk out again because he can not max tell he still run hey w-w-what 's hinder he stammer toby thrill by this new mystery that have so suddenly dawn upon they the sand 's get too tight a grip on he cry max and he be sink deeper all the time oh thunder it be quicksand then explode bandy-leg have now the key to the enigma explain steve 's strange action as well as he queer antic while flounder about out there in the little stream both boy could easily see that may evidently speak the truth so those envious spanish courtier find it easy to balance a egg on end after columbus show they how to do the trick in another half minute they arrive on the shore of the little stream steve out there with the shallow water come now up almost to he waist greet they arrival with a sickly grin sorry to bother you boy he say but seem like i have go and get into a nasty pickle please yank I out of this will not you impetuous bandy-leg be about to instantly start forward when max grip he by the arm do not be foolish bandy-leg he tell the other severely you would only get yourself in the same boat if you stand there and try to drag steve out and two would be harder to take care of than one but say do not be _ too _ slow about start something will you urge steve once again look nervous why i be sink right along i tell you every time i try to get one foot up t ' other go down three inch further because i have to bear all my weight on it this be no laughing matter boy i 'll be swallow up before you eye soon if you do not get busy max you ought to know how to extricate a fellow from the quicksand there be lot of way in which it can be do the other tell he meanwhile measure distance with he eye as though he already have a plan in mind if when you first discover that you be sink you have throw yourself sideways and start to crawl or roll regardless of how wet you get you might have make it for in that way you would have present more of you body to the action of the sand then a mattress could be make from branch weed or any old thing that would bear the weight of one or two of we but i have get even a better scheme than that to work please hurry plead the imprison boy keep cool steve advise max because there be positively no danger now that we be on deck but tell I what you mean to do max continue steve make use of this rope which you see i just happen to fetch along explain the other hold up the article in question it be go to save time too because one of we would have have to run back to camp and that must mean delay you be deep enough in as it be i guess a whole lot deeper than be pleasant i tell you steve instantly add why at the rate it be suck I down i guess in less 'n a quarter of a hour the water would be up to my chin and then oh fellow just imagine how i would feel when it begin to cover my mouth you be not go away i hope max this last almost frantic cry be cause by a movement on the part of the one on whom poor steve 's hope most depend i be go to shin up this big tree that send a limb out right over you head do not you see steve max tell he reassuringly once i get above you and we 'll make good use of this rope of mine the limb will act as a lever and when the boy get to pull at the other end of the rope you have just _ get _ to come out that be all there be about it hurrah that be the ticket shout bandy-leg see the game now for the first time steve you be as good as land bless that old rope it be already prove worth its weight in gold steve watch operation anxiously despite the positive assurance convey in these word from he chum the terrible grip of that clinging sand make he cold with apprehension he imagine all sort of thing from the rope break under the sudden and terrible strain to he arm be draw from they socket in the battle between the tenacious sand and the muscular ability of the two boy ashore when max manage to reach a point directly above the one in peril straddle the friendly limb as only a nimble boy could do he quickly fashion a slip-noose at one end of the rope this he lower until steve could snatch it which he do with all the eagerness show by the drown man who clutch at a straw fix the noose under you arm steve direct the master of ceremony calmly enough though possibly max be more excited than he choose to let the other see and get the knot around so it will be exactly in front then when i give the word for the boy to commence heave you work both leg as hard as ever you can it be go to help more or less you know i can not do much up here in the way of pull for i would lose my balance but make up you mind we be mean to yank you out of that in a jiffy steve oh i hope so max i surely hope so everything be soon ready steve have comply with the direction and now await the issue with all the fortitude he could command afterwards perhaps steve might sometime or other even laugh as he remember how scared he be but just then with the difficulty still unadjusted it be not at all humorous ready everybody call out max receive a affirmative reply from three pair of lip he go on to say : then get busy pull make it a steady haul and no jerk or you 'll hurt steve more than be necessary steady there bandy-leg no hurry remember -- just a regular increase pull good enough boy steve have obey instruction and by the way he work both foot as soon as he feel the strain one might think he be practice swimming lesson it must have give he more or less physical pain to feel the terrible drag of the rope under he arm but he shut he tooth hard together and keep back a groan now rest a bit toby and bandy-legs call out max how about it steve -- you move some do not you yes yes quite a little max cry the other please get busy again right away i be sick of stay in this old quicksand he still cling tenaciously to he steel fishing rod as though he mean that it should share he fate once more the team ashore start in now they task seem lighter as though have succeed in drag they chum up several inch with he whole weight now suspend by the rope the job be go to be finish in short order soon steve crow joyously be draw completely out of the water he give this a last suggestive kick and then dangle there in midair spin around like a teetotum hand I you rod steve command max then use you arm and pull yourself up on the limb after that you can easily hunch along like i do and get to the main trunk it be all over but the shout steve and you can consider yourself pretty lucky to get off as easily as you do with a pair of wet trousers i be thankful enough max you can make sure of that say the other carry out the suggestion and thus free both hand for the task of mount to the friendly limb before long he have reach the ground where he three chum each gravely shake hand with he steve be already get back he nerve that have be under a severe strain but anyway i do have bully good luck pull out fat trout boy he tell they you can pick up a dozen along this side of the stream fact be it be such splendid fun that i just stand too long in one place catch they and toss the beauty ashore and so when i try to move why i could not to save my life it feel like a giant have grip both foot and be hold I down the more i try the worse it get whee i would have be pretty badly scared if no one be near by i own up to that perhaps the other mentally consider that as it be steve have look a good deal concern at the time of they arrival but not wish to harrow he feeling any further just then they keep this to themselves though bandy-leg do give toby a suggestive wink to which the other reply in like kind it be find upon gather the trophy of steve 's skill as a angler that they have quite enough for a meal consequently steve announce that he guess he need not start in again with rod and hook and grub all of they be soon busily engage in fix up the camp since they have think it best not to try and fetch a heavy tent along with they they know it would be necessary to construct some such brush shanty shelter every night unless they could find a convenient ledge under which a camp could be make but all of these boy have often sleep under the star with the heaven for a canopy overhead so that they do not feel at all worry over the circumstance as the sun sink lower and lower toward the horizon the camp begin to assume a comfortable air the brush shelter have be finish and pronounced equal to any they have ever build before it might not prove wholly rain-proof but as for keep off the dew and protect they against the chilly night air it offer they all the comfort of home as steve put it then supper be start a fire have be build after the most approved method in vogue among guide and hunter of long experience indeed max and he companion be far from be green to the way of the wood they have learn heap through they many camping experience and some time before a visit to a old trapper have initiate they into dozen of secret of the craft that would never be forget -lrb- 1 -rrb- again the talk be of the strange mission that have bring they up to the adirondack bandy-leg could not seem to get over he belief that they be bind to have all they trouble for they pain what sort of a clue have we get to work on for a starter fellow tell I he go on to say just as they be start in to enjoy the supper that have be supervise by a trio of eager cook all as hungry as boy could well be and continue to exist all we know be that when this boy roland chase leave sagamere almost two year back he be a sickly white-faced chap and with only one decent trait about he which be he love for outdoors though up to then it have be mostly a _ yearning _ because they would not let he get away from the house much on account of he delicate constitution well we be look for some such chap but up to now we have not get on he track -lrb- 1 -rrb- with trapper jim in the north wood but hold on bandy-leg expostulate steve you forget that we do hear about a boy that answer that description though nobody seem to know he name he be sometimes see in the company of a half-drunken old guide name shank somewhere around mount tom district and now we have come up this way in the hope of cross he trail not that i have get much expectation myself that we 'll be sure to find this same roland who turn out to be a sort of will-o ' - the-wisp to we but since he old aunt be so kind as to finance this expedition why we be bind to do all we can to make it a bloom success that be what well comment max who seem to be the most confident one of the quartette remember if we fail to make connection it 'll be the first time on record that we have really be stump i do not believe in hard-luck story as a rule success come only to those who deserve it and we have still get most of that two week ' vacation ahead of we to hunt around for roland chase somehow max always seem to say thing calculate to make he chum feel more satisfied it be a mighty good thing to have a real optimist in camp especially when the weather get bad and everything else seem to go wrong even bandy-legs take on a more cheerful air and brighten up after hear max say this they have more or less reason to feel proud of the record they have make in the past so far as accomplish thing go and the people around carson would be apt to tell any one inquire about max and he crony that they have actually do several exceedingly smart thing and be boy far above the average the supper be vote a huge success and never have fish be fry a more delicious brown than those in the pan perhaps steve entertain a private opinion of he own to the effect that never have a higher price be pay for a mess of fish than he offer up when he find himself make a prisoner of the unseen giant reside under the quicksand but all the same steve devour he share of the fish as smartly as the next one he doubtless feel that he deserve have a feast after he adventure in supply the material they be almost through eating and feeling particularly well satisfied as be usually the case when the appetite have be take care of when toby jucklin be see to be stare straight ahead what ail you toby demand steve discover the mysterious action of the other think you see a ghost or be it a ` coon whisk past smell we fine spread here speak up can not you and tell we toby manage to find he tongue and as usual when excite make quite a mess of he explanation w-w-why y-y-you s-s-see i -- t-that be there be s-s-somebody -- oh look for yourselve and you 'll understand quicker 'n i c 'n tell you sometimes toby seem to become so provoke with he ungovernable vocal organ that he would get angry and wind up by speak as plainly as the next one but before then max and perhaps the other pair in the bargain have discover a figure advance slowly toward they eagerly bandy-legs stare perhaps he begin to already entertain a wild hope that the newcomer would prove to be the very boy whom they have come so far to find but if this be so he must have almost immediately discover he mistake for the other be a sun-burned and wind-tanned lad sturdily build and apparently the son of some wood guide for he carry a gun and be dress in rough though serviceable khaki trousers and blue flannel shirt chapter iii obe grime bob up howdy stranger say the other as he slowly approach the spot where max and he three chum still sit around the fire feast on they spread i happen to see yer blaze and guess i would drop in to see who yah might be ` taint often anybody come up this way though to be sure thar be two gentleman fishin ' hereabouts last summer somehow max like he manner of speech he also think he could detect something like a love for humor in those sparkling eye sit down and have a bite with we will not you he remark make a suggestive movement with he hand as though call attention to the fact that there be still plenty of room on the log which he and toby jucklin have occupy in common sorry the trout 's give out but we have get plenty of other grub and be sure you be welcome the sturdy wood boy be look they over bandy-legs suspicious as usual rather take umbrage at this action he eye the newcomer as though not yet quite willing to echo the warm invitation accord he by max but steve be already get a extra tin-cup for coffee and fortunately there still remain a abundant supply of the amber fluid in the capacious pot apparently the newcomer have determine that it would be prudent for he to comply with the invitation thus cordially give so he sit down and make himself at home up there in the wood there exist a genuine hospitality that never hesitate to extend the right hand of fellowship to any straggler who chance to enter the camp there seem to be something in the healthy ozone of the wilderness that make all man comrade for the time be the latchstring be always out in camp and never do a appeal for help go disregard max proceed to immediately introduce himself and he three chum by name he of course mention the fact that they come from a town name carson situate far away from that region but then of course the wood boy could never have hear of such a place before still he eyebrow arched and he seem to once again observe he entertainer with fresh interest but then when max hasting choose to exert himself to make a favorable impression every one fall under he spell and when bandy-legs toby and steve notice that max do not think fit to say a single word about the queer mission which have bring they to the mountain they too conclude that it would be just as well not to be too hasty about tell all they business to a stranger a little later on perhaps when they come to become better acquaint with the other they might ply he with question in order to find out if he chance to know such a weakly look fellow as roland chase of course after that it be up to the other to tell they whom he be he do not have any hesitation from which steve conclude there could be no reason for keep he identity a secret course i get a name too even if it be not _ quite _ so scrumptuous as yours but obe grime suit I just as well and it be not never keep I from eatin ' three square meal a day -- when i could get 'em he tell they soberly though that odd little gleam in he eye mystified max somewhat i suppose you live around this section then obe he remark as he clean out the frying-pan that have contain the ham and egg -- the latter have be carry all the way from the last small village they pass through and which supply would doubtless be the last they might enjoy for a long time to come oh yes thar 's a plenty of grimese up this way the other reply promptly fact be the grimese be a big family all tell thar 's grandad grime to start with and he be go on ninety now then there be uncle hiram uncle sila uncle job uncle sephus uncle _ nicodemus _ and a whole lot more besides aunt rebecca aunt sophium aunt hetebel and -- glory to goodness i could sit here for ten minute and string out the name of the grimese there be in the mountain but say i be _ awful _ hungry and you 'll excuse I if i get busy with this fine grub the other name will keep till next time i reckon whew it must feel funny to belong to such a big family remark steve who do not happen to have any close relative himself oh shuck none of 'em ever bother about _ I _ any say the boy as well as he could with he mouth stuff of the ham and bread which he presently wash down with a copious draught of hot coffee they just know that obe he c 'n take good care o ' hisself bandy-leg begin to show a rise interest in the other he suspicion be begin to give way under the genial way of the say obe that smile on the dusky face of the visitor in the camp have commence to get its work in by degree perhaps bandy-leg might even come to like obed grime though truth to tell he have always despise that last name for a boy answer to it have once treat bandy-leg in a most humiliating fashion and this still rankle in he memory although year have flee since the occurrence do you mean from that obe he go on to remark that you be all alone up here in the wood near old mount tom have not you any of the other grimese along with you the boy shake he head in the negative and grin again max be try to study he and he find the task one well worthy of he best effort in the beginning he determine that obed be no ordinary chap but possess of sterling characteristic he wait for the conversation to get further along confident that the other have a surprise up he sleeve which he might condescend to share with they after he have become fully satisfy they be to be trust and that he could look upon they in the light of friend nary a grime ` cept I inside o ' twenty mile o ' here and that be a fact he assure bandy-leg after finish he drinking fact be most o ' the family do not know jest where i be at and say between we i be not a carin ' about tellin ' 'em that look a bit singular bandy-leg think he suspicion return again though with diminish force for somehow he could not look into that frank and even merry face of the wood boy and actually believe he be off-color in any way but what do you do with yourself all alone i would like to know burst out impetuous steve be you make a live playing at guide for party of tourist or fisherman and hunter and say you do not mean to tell I you stay all alone up in this wilderness right through the winter obe grime nod he head cheerfully i be not get any choice in the matter yuh see he tell they mysteriously just _ get _ to stay why it would bust the hull business to smash if i ` lowed myself to skip out even for a week or two i be tie down to it that be right bandy-leg exchange a significant look toby jucklin he scratch he head with the air of one who find himself up against a hard knotty problem apparently if the stranger in camp be try to mystify they he have already succeed in tangle up the wit of bandy-leg completely max continue to sit there and take it all in there be no need of he say anything so long as the other fellow have embark on the task of draw obe out and learn just what he be do to keep he maroon up there summer and winter like a regular old recluse or woodchuck but there must be heap and heap of snow here winter suggest steve and i would think you would find it pretty hard get about oh not so bad when you have snow-shoe obed tell he with a shrug of he shoulder and another attack on the contents of he tin panninkin ` course not steve hasten to say as though he have guess that this would be the answer but when the law be on the deer and partridge it must be hard to keep to a regular diet of trout i c 'n stand they for a while but in the end i would get sick of the smell of 'em cooking oh i have plenty of good grub along chuckle obed i be on my way home at the time i glimpsed you fire and bein ' full o ' wonder concernin ' who could be around these digging right now i creep up to spy on ye but say soon 's i glimpse you crowd and see that you be only a bunch o ' boy why i feel easier 'cause i know then you could not mean to bother I any now that sound queer again bandy-legs thought why should any one take the trouble to bother obed grime unless indeed he have be do something that he have not ought to and hence expect to be visit sooner or later by emissary of the law possibly in the shape of angry game warden all sort of strange thought flash through that active brain of the boy with the bow leg he wonder whether obe could be a desperate young criminal have he family those excellent grime of whom he have speak in such proud accent cast he out as altogether beyond hope bandy-leg could hardly think this when he look again into that face and catch the gleam of those merry orb no obed might be a _ peculiar _ sort of fellow but really there do not seem to be much of guile in he make-up if it turn out to be so then he bandy-leg be ready to call himself a mighty poor reader of character so he too relapse into temporary silence and let steve carry on the interrogation which the say steve consider himself very well qualify to do since he aspire in he secret soul to some fine day study to be a lawyer but why should anybody want to bother you obe he ask to hear you talk in that way a fellow would think you have a lot of enemy hang around try the best they know how to give you trouble well i be not have any mix-up ever since i have be here admit the other with a slight frown cross he face but lately i get wind o ' some news that be worried I a heap fact be i be afraid i be goin ' to be right smart bother with a bunch o ' thief who have like to _ steal _ my outfit from I steve fairly gasp he could not make head or tail of what the other be so deliberately tell he max listen and watch that expressive face of obed secretly believe the newcomer be purposely draw steve on mean to surprise he when finally he choose to explain it all so max do not attempt to interfere but let thing go on as they be do satisfied that the answer to the conundrum would soon come steal you outfit from you echo steve when he could catch he breath do you mean that you be carry on some sort of business then up here in the wood reckon that be about right steve obe reply and he familiar use of the other 's name could be easily explain by that spirit of free masonry that exist among all boy i have get a business which look like it be goin ' to pan out right decent and make I some money in the bargain that be why they be meanin ' to rob I i guess anyhow it hinge on that same thing and i think you might be that crowd first but i soon see i be mistaken and that you would be my friend but what sort of business be it you be in obed ask steve boldly I oh i be only a farmer confess the other chuckle as he speak a farmer echo steve look blank but how could anybody steal you ground away or carry off you crop i would like to know why yuh do not jest understand steve i be not no regular hayseed i be a fur farmer you see and you could carry my crop of fox pelt away easy enough on you own back chapter iv bandy-leg suspect max hasting smile he at the same time draw a breath of relief satisfied to know that he first impression of the sturdy look young chap be confirm and convince that the say obe grime must be the right sort of fellow steve and bandy-leg fairly gasp as though they have receive a real shock at the same time the eye of the former glisten with newly-awakened interest a fur farmer do you say obed and raise fox for the market be you he burst out with delightedly now i have read a heap about that sort of thing in the papers and magazine but i never think i would actually run across anybody that have the nerve and confidence to go into it as a business and you say you be make good be you obe that be fine i have turn my ` tention to raisin ' real black fox first thing explain the other with a touch of genuine pride in he manner max could easily see and if the try turn out as profitable as i reckon she promise to be why then i be figgerin ' on tryin ' to raise mink and marten and sech other fur as fetch top-notch price then i guess you must have trap all sort of wild animal before now obe suggest steve eagerly so you know they habit to a fraction because of course only one who be post in that direction could ever hope to make a success of a fur farm obe grin and nod he head oh i reckon i be up a little bit in all sech thing he say airily enough and after all it be not so _ very _ hard to raise fox i be afraid fust off it might be what they tell I that black be not to be rely on to breed true to strain but shuck i have get some cub that be dandy wait till you see 'em boy that sound as though sooner or later obe mean to have they visit he fur farm and see with they own eye what he have be do bandy-leg skeptical once more tell himself he only hope the whole thing might not turn out to be a myth and that the say obe himself prove to be a deception and a fraud i understand that the pelt of black fox be worth a whole lot of money remark steve fact be we know that to be so because we once have such a skin give to we by a man who make a business of trapping it all depend on the quality of the pelt explain obe some be not worth as much as three hundred dollar because they have get defect yuh see then again a real fine skin have fetch as much as thirty-six hundred dollar in london market evidently obe be well post at any rate whether he really have such a fur farm of he own or not bandy-legs conclude and then he again allow himself to give imagination free rein and for a time even look on obe as the essence of truth doubly distilled sit there by the fire which one of he boy replenish every little while obed tell they many very interesting thing connect with that strange farm of he all this in he odd vernacular which max try to get the hang of in order to judge whether it signify that the country boy lack a education or not he continue to be more or less mystified however though conclude that obe be just one of those customary country boy often run across on farm who take especial delight in joking and play little trick which they consider humorous but he be not at all bad i 'll stake everything on that max also tell himself as he sit and listen to the really interesting description give by the other of he success and first failure along the difficult line of breed fox in captivity with score of thing against he which have to be overcome a hour pass by in this manner when max see they visitor show sign as if he mean to leave they he take a hand in the conversation which up to then have be almost wholly monopolize by bandy-leg steve and the wood boy it be very kind of you to invite we over to inspect this wonderful little fur farm of yours obe he go on to say but you 'll have to give we direction how we can get there unless you mean to accept we offer of a blanket by the fire here tonight when we could go along with you in the morning obe look sober i would like to stay longer with you boy he hasten to say as though he really mean it but i ought tuh be gettin ' back home thar 's some duty waitin ' for I to look after and then i be not quite easy in my mind ` bout they two feller that be up here in the wood they be not meanin ' to do any shootin ' even if they have get lem scott along as a guide and he the meanest skunk in the hull county lot o ' folk do say and a poacher in the bargain that the warden be layin ' to grab one o ' these fine day now i 'll jest up and tell yuh how to get to my place it be as easy as water runnin ' down-hill he enter into explicit direction and max pin they in he memory in fact obe simply tell they to follow the stream up three mile until they come to a bunch of seven birch tree on the right-hand bank there they be to pick up a trail they would find follow it half a mile and at that they would see a cabin under the hemlock and pine which would be he humble home wood we have get it all down pat obe say steve and like as not you 'll see the bunch of we trail along there some time tomorrow morning i have always be crazy to see a fur farm after read so much about they and you bet i do not mean to let this chance slip by I max now think it time to make a few inquiry himself he want to ask obed whether he have ever run across a boy by the name of roland chase a sickly look chap in the bargain it might possible to pick up a clue in this way and they have reach a point where they could not afford to let any opportunity for acquire information get past they in order to pursue this course however max realize that it would be necessary to enter into some sort of explanation concern the nature of the peculiar errand that have tempt they to come to the adirondack i want to ask you a question or two obe he begin but first of all i ought to tell you what bring we here accordingly max proceed to explain how the school have be close for two or more week in early October and what a singular thing come about to tempt they into take a outing he be watch the wood boy at the time he first mention mr hopewell and speak the name of roland chase but if the other give any unusual sign of interest max fail to catch the same still obe be listen with all he might and it seem as though the unusual story of the inheritance that be to be give to the say roland in case he make good interested he max in this manner explain just why he and he three chum have accept the generous offer of the elderly lady so deeply concern over the welfare of she nephew boland that she be ready to spend almost any reasonable sum in order to at least learn that the poor boy be alive and in fairly decent health they have be tell to assure he in case they ever manage to locate the elusive roland that he should not worry because of not be able to comply with the absurd condition of uncle jerry 's ridiculous will because she have enough of this world 's goods for both and she mean to leave it all to he roland so she beg he to come back to she and live he own life again even though he have spend the last penny of he two-thousand-dollar legacy and be as poor as job 's turkey all this make a interesting story and must have amuse the wood boy more or less because max know how to put considerable pathos in it obe sit there shade he eye with he hand to keep the glow of the fire from dazzling he occasionally he would interrupt to ask some natural question which make max think he be take a fair amount of interest in the account what i want to ask you conclude max be whether you would ever happen to run across this same roland chase in the mountain we hear about a fellow answer he description who be see in company with a dissipate guide name shank i think perhaps you might help we out obe obed look he straight in the face so far as i know on max he go on to say seriously i be not never meet any feller like yuh say face to face about that man shank i know he be say to be a tough un i see he some month back down at sawyer 's fork and by hokey now that you mention it thar _ be _ a sickly lookin ' young feller along with he then but say he name be bob jenk or somethin' like that and not roland chase oh well so far as that go say max he may have change he name some people think nothing of sailing under false color and if it turn out that roland have take up with such a disreputable character as this drunken guide seem to be i do not wonder at he want to hide he identity so you think you must be go home do you obe yep the other observe gain he foot and i wanter to thank all o ' ye for givin ' I sech a pleasant evenin ' i be not have sech a good time this long while back but then the grimese all be ` custome to roughin ' it granddad use to be away all by hisself for as much as two year trappin ' up in canada it be in the blood i reckon now yuh mean to drop in and visit I do not ye i 'll be expectin ' yuh and have something to eat awarmin ' though course i be not a good cook like you feller as have have so much experience so long boy he wave they a cheerful goodbye once more smile at each in turn whirl on he heel and be go seem to vanish in the shadow of the nearby wood like a wisp of smoke when the wind strike it as steve remark after the departure of they guest it be only natural that he should be the subject of conversation about the fire as the four chum lay there take thing easy max honest to goodness now bandy-legs remark do you really take any stock in that fairy story he tell we about a imaginary fur farm it strike I obe be givin to yarnin ' just for the love of it all that stuff about he relative may have be true and again only nonsense it be my opinion there be not any granddad grime or uncle hiram nicodemus and so forth he grin like everything when he be reel those name off so slick yes he be string we i bet you w-w-why burst out toby just then who would not have to s-s-snicker when he have a w-w-whole lot of relation with such f-f-funny name it would make I grin from ear to ear every time i h-h-happened to think of 'em you be the greatest hand to s-s-suspect anybody i ever s-s-saw bandy-leg now i want you to k-k-know that i think obe the s-s-straight g-g-goods and i be take a heap of s-s-stock in see that bully f-f-fur f-f-farm of he tomorrow be not you max certainly i be reply the other without a second 's hesitation in the first place bandy-leg you must understand that nobody could talk so interestingly on a subject unless he know a lot about it he tell we a dozen thing about fur farming that i never hear before huh and perhaps nobody else ever hear of they either max grunt the far from satisfied bandy-leg nothing will ever satisfy he except he see those kit fox with he own eye assert steve almost indignantly handle they with he own paw and ask every little critter whether he really belong to obe grime bandy-leg be the worst doubt thoma go when the fit come on he even this sort of talk do not convince the objector say what you will fellow bandy-leg go on stubbornly there be a wheen of queer thing connect with this same obed grime and i will not take that back till he show we he wonderful old farm where he raise black fox for the fur market stop and think how mysteriously he pop in on we will you why he as much as own up that he have be spy on we for a long time if toby here have not discover he peek and point that way chance be he would not have show up at all now what make he snoop around we camp like that say do not he explain all that just as straight as a die object steve who seem to have conceive quite a fancy for obed grime the wood boy he tell we he have reason to fear some unscrupulous fellow be hang around this region and mean to steal he pet when they get half a chance that be why he want to watch and make sure we do not belong to the same crowd oh yes a likely story too continue bandy-leg with a sneer why should anybody want to rob a poor boy who be try to earn he living by farm even if it be fur he raise instead of grain or hog or stock why you poor ninny the reason be as plain as the nose on you face bandy-leg and that be not invisible by a big sight when a black fox pelt will fetch a thousand dollar more or less and can not well be trace once it get mixed with other pelt it stand to reason that any thief would want to steal it as to you doubt that there be any other people up in this section you seem to forget bandy-leg that around noon today we sight a plain smoke some mile away which we opine must have be make by some advance hunter wait for the law to be off deer well why could not it have be the people obe say he fear who make that smoke now for my part i believe every word obe grime say he be the straight goods every time and you can see it in he eye for he look you direct in the face thereupon bandy-leg as though realize that he have raise a hornet 's nest about he ear deem it the part of discretion to shrug he shoulder after the manner of one who convince against he will be of the same opinion still we 'll let the subject drop steve he say hastily it be not worth quarrel over the proof of the pudding be in the eating of it and tomorrow we 'll _ know _ what be what but remember if it turn out that we have be bamboozle do not blame I because i have warn you all if we have a chill from every warning you have spring on we bandy-legs steve tell he witheringly why say we would have go all to piece long before now you be a regular old bad-weather prognosticator that be what you be that be right get to call name it be a habit with people who know they be in the wrong grumble bandy-leg but nevertheless he draw within he shell and say nothing further about obed grime or he suspicion concern the same chapter v packing over the carry later on the conversation begin to lag steve be notice drowsily nod he head in a suggestive way and then after a sudden start he would look around aggressively as if to remark : who say i be sleepy but within three minute he would be at it again in fact all of the boy be really tire out the day 's tramp have be a difficult one even for fellow accustom to such thing and those regular adirondack pack with a band cross the forehead in the usual way have seem doubly heavy before they decide to stop for the night of course there be sound to be hear all around they but familiarity breed contempt and from max down they be all accustom to hear similar noise whenever they spend night in the open the owl would whinny or hoot accord to he species the loon send forth he agonizing and weird shriek from some distant lake a fox might bark sharply and fretfully or two quarrelsome ` coon dispute over a bit of food they have discover -- all this go with the camping business and indeed it would have seem odd to those boy have the usual accompaniment be miss well what be the use of we stay up longer max finally announce in a authoritative fashion after steve have almost jerk he neck awry for about the seventh time with one of those spasmodic movement we blanket be call to we boy let 's turn in there be no negative vote record for every one seem ready to call it a day and quit max take it upon himself to look after the fire plenty of wood have be gather to last until morning and then some for as the night air be begin to feel pretty sharp it be conclude to keep the fire go i 'll look out for that part say max i generally wake up just so many time during the night when i be in camp and it be no trouble for I to crawl out and toss another stick on the fire so forget it fellow will you apparently the other take he at he word for not another sign of any of they be see while night last once they snuggle down in they warm comfortable blanket they must have become dead to the world as steve aptly term it several time while the night hold sway a figure would crawl noiselessly out of the crude brush shanty shelter and place another lot of wood upon the dwindle fire thus keep it go for another spell of several hour of course this be max who really like to take a observation concern the state of the weather note the change position of the heavenly body so that he could figure on the passage of time and then once more creep into the fold of he blanket to again fall into a deep sleep so the night pass nothing occur to disturb its serenity the little four-footed wood folk doubtless prowl all around the boy ' camp eye the glimmer fire with wonder and distrust for it could not be a familiar sight to any of they since mankind seldom visit this inaccessible region so far remove from the track of ordinary travel some of the more daring among they venturesome ` coon or ` possum perhaps may even have invade the precinct of the charm circle search with they keen little nose for trace of castaway food but if so they presence do not disturb the sleeper within that shelter so morning come on apace and presently from the brush shanty one after another of the fellow come creep forth to stretch and yawn and finally hasten they dress for the frosty air nip finger and toe quite lustily they be in no particular hurry and breakfast therefore be undertake in the best of humor with plenty of time give to its preparation everybody seem to be in the best of humor and he good sleep must have smooth even the spirit of the fretful bandy-leg for he no longer grumble or find fault perhaps as so frequently happen he be secretly ashamed of have show such a suspicious and argumentative disposition on the precede evening and mean to make amends for it by a unusually cheery manner it be determine to break camp soon after the matin meal have be comfortably dispatch this do not promise to be a extraordinary feat since they be try to go light-handed on this expedition and do not have many of they ordinary trap along from a tent down to certain cooking utensil that have be deem too heavy for tote mile after mile into the wilderness it make a whole lot of difference just how fellow mean to go when lay out the impediment for a trip if a wagon or a boat be available all sort of thing may as well be take along so as to insure the maximum of comfort but when it be know in the beginning that all they be mean to use must be pack every mile of the way on the back of the camper then it be high time to cut down the list to the last fraction so far as weight and bulk be concerned max and he chum have reduce this down to a real science for instance have a comfortable balance at the bank thanks to they thrift in the past -lrb- 2 -rrb- money do not enter into they calculation at all consequently they have purchase a complete little outfit of aluminum cooking vessel that nested within each other and weigh next to nothing while offer all the advantage of ordinary granite ware other camper ' comfort too have be secure so that they even carry a certain amount of condensed food in the shape of milk powder evaporate egg that could be use to make excellent omelet in case of necessity and even soup in double can with a layer of unslacked lime between which by the addition of a little water to the lime could be heat up beautifully without the aid of a fire -lrb- 2 -rrb- in camp on the big sunflower when all of they start in to get busy thing quickly assume a concentrated condition each article have its regular place where it would take up the least possible space why by now every fellow have find out just how to do up he pack so that no sharp and uncomfortable edge would cut into he back and when this condition have be reach it mean that the last word in packing have be learn max himself see to it that the fire be effectually kill before they quit the scene of they night encampment this he do by throw water on the hissing ember until it be quite dead if every party that spend a night in the wilderness take the same pain to put out they fire on leave many a magnificent stretch of timber would be spare from the ravages of a forest fire that leave only blacken tree trunk behind and ruin thousand of acre of wooded land every year although a fire may die down and seem to have little life in it there be no absolute surety unless water be use that a rise wind may not fan the ember into renew activity until a dangerous spark be carry into some nest of dead leaf near by and so the fire start that man-power can seldom control three mile he say up this stream observe bandy-leg as they start gaily forth max in the lead and toby bring up the rear and as no doubt the say stream meander considerably in its course that might mean only half the distance as the crow fly remark the leader turn once more to look back toward the desert camp after the fashion of a carpenter who consider it wise to measure he post _ once again _ before apply the saw because after the deed be do the part can never be put together again but everything seem still and not the faintest whisp of smoke creep lazily upward from the late camp-fire they walk along for a short distance and then upon cross a little rise in order to skirt a bad section of marshy ground it be discover that they have a good chance to look backward a rather pretty view reward they effort and as all the boy appreciate nature in she fall dress they stand for a minute drinking this in you can follow the course of the stream for quite a distance notice remark bandy-leg and i even see the place where we yank steve here out of that sand steve frown as he look and max could see that he have go a little white the memory of he harrowed feeling on that occasion would stay with steve for quite some time and produce a unpleasant sensation every time it come before he mental vision max also see he shut he tooth very hard together and be close enough to even catch a word or two the boy mutter savagely to himself never again from that max could judge the lesson have be impress on steve 's mind indelibly and that as long as he live he would be careful how he enter a unknown stream when fishing and especially how he become so engross in he sport as to stand a length of time in one spot without work he foot up and down so as to make sure they be free from cling sand they chat from time to time as they proceed and of course all sort of subject crop up to be discuss sometimes there be a little good-natured dispute concern something or other for boy have different mind and be apt to view thing from various angle but as time pass they make such good progress that max presently announce he belief they must presently glimpse the seven birch tree mention by obed grime as mark the place where they be to quit the bank of the stream at the time they stop to look backward max have scan the country behind they look for some trace of another camp smoke but see fond of work he way and often slip out of thing when he could manage it -- some fellow always do get hold of the smaller end of the log that be be carry as if by instinct though it would be hardly fair to call they shirker they rest for something like ten minute then max start up here be the trail obe tell we about he observe point down at he foot as though he have be look about he while recuperate after that three mile carry and i guess we might as well be go on for one i be begin to feel quite curious to see that lodge of he under the pine and hemlock as well as learn what he be do with he fox farm bandy-leg open he mouth and then consider it better not to voice the question he have on the tip of he tongue for he shut he jaw tight together again and do not speak max notice this it cause he to smile in quiet satisfaction that be a very disagreeable habit of bandy-leg always question thing and want double proof before he would put the stamp of he approval on they and max keep hope that in the process of time it could be break up it be not difficult to follow the trail even though at time this prove to be rather faint and undecided at least it turn out to be a easy task with the four chum simply because they be accustom to such thing a greenhorn might have lose the track many time and make a none he have in mind the story tell by obe concern the presence in the vicinity of another party and he suspicion concern they base intention apparently max must have believe what the wood boy say even though he could see no sign of a camp that morning i have get a idea the seven birch be just over yonder boy announce steve who possess good eyesight twice now i have glimpse something white among the thicket of undergrowth and you can see that the creek be begin to swing around so as to lead we in that direction g-g-guess you be about r-r-right steve declare toby jucklin instantly to t-t-tell you the t-t-truth i have be squint that same p-p-patch of white myself q-q-quite some little time now it turn out to be just as steve have prophesy they soon discover a bunch of birch grow from the stump of a larger tree that have long ago fall under the ax of a woodsman there be seven all right -- count 'em announce steve with a vein of exultation in he voice just as though by right of discovery those birch really belong to he let 's call a little rest before we tackle the last round begged bandy-leg as they arrive alongside the landmark mention by obed and without wait for the other to assent he drop he pack and throw himself down on a especially invite bit of moss heave a great sigh of relief for be it known bandy-leg be not especially mountain out of a mole-hill as steve aptly put it when refer to the matter soon they be cast eager glance ahead under the impression that they must certainly be draw near the object of they search even bandy-leg have by now apparently arrive at the belief that obe be straight and that he really do have some sort of home in this secluded region the direction have turn out to be exact from the three-mile tramp along the stream and the seven birch count 'em to the wind trail that lead from that point deeper into the wood looky there be not that some sort of high wire fence demand steve suddenly and say i get a plain whiff of sweet hickory wood smoke then believe I add bandy-leg in some excitement and evidently forget that not long before he have be skeptical regard the existence of any lodge or fox farm well there be the answer right before you laugh max and as they stare in the direction they leader be point the balance of the little party see what seem to be the cutest little cabin fashion from sawn log and nestle in a happy fashion directly under the clustering pine and hemlock that hang over it most protectingly as though with the intention of keep the winter snow from weigh down the sloping roof at one end be a chimney make of slab of wood with the chink fill in with mud that in the process of time aid by the heat of the fire have become as hard as cement or adamant and from this there curl wreath of lazily ascend blue smoke the source of that delightful odor that have drift to bandy-leg 's nostril chapter vi the lodge of many wonder there be obed right now wave at we from the doorway of he cabin announce steve even as they look at the picture make by the little log structure nestle so cozily under the dark foliage of the resinous tree that never lose they green look even when snow cover the mountain to the depth of several foot they hurry forward to join the owner of the wood lodge who have evidently expect they to put in a appearance about this time of day figure just when they would break camp and how long it would take they to make the carry he shake hand with each of he new-found friend in turn and warmly too even bandy-legs seem to feel that he unworthy suspicion of the other could have no foundation to judge from the hearty way in which he greet obed max be quick to see that obed look pleased at they come he also wonder why the other seem to raise he eyebrow now and then and smile as though certain thought he entertain be quite amusing but then see what a lonely life the young fur farmer must be lead so far away from he kind and wrap up in he singular call after all it be not so queer that he should act in this way upon have visitor and boy of he own age in the bargain they be usher inside the lodge and here another surprise greet they max in particular be astonish to find that the small building contain so much in the way of comfort if he have think of the matter at all he probably expect to find just a ordinary shack such as nine boy in ten would be contented with building and that obe be put up with all sort of discomfort the contrary prove to be the truth for there be numerous thing in sight to cause a visitor to express surprise why obe even use _ aluminum cooking utensil _ equal to theirs though not mean for camp particularly there be several rock chair and one big fireside chair that look mighty invite indeed as it flank the broad hearth where obe have a blaze go the kitchen lay at the back and actually have a wood stove in it capable of bake bread or biscuit on occasion water too have be pipe to the cabin from some spring farther up the rise though in the dead of winter a supply must of necessity be obtain from some other source since this would be freeze up these thing and many other along the same line cause max to survey obe with a new source of wonder who be this remarkable boy and how on earth do he come to possess such a magical lodge up here in the unpeopled wilderness why a rich man could hardly have surround himself with more in the way of comfort and yet accord to he language and he account of himself obe be only a ordinary child of the wood one of the very numerous grime tribe many of whom doubtless gain they living by serve as guide in season max after stare around he in due wonder and admiration turn again to obe he could see that the other be observe they with that merry twinkle in he eye and evidently expect he guest to express amazement at find so wonderful a habitation where they have anticipate so little its just splendid that be the only word i can find to express my feeling obe max hasten to say at which the other laugh aloud course now you-all be awonderin ' jest how a poor wood boy like I would ever git hold o ' such a clever cabin he go on to say but shuck that be a easy one to explain yuh see it be build by a man who have plenty o ' money and poor health he think he could get well by stayin ' here and so he fix she up to beat the band that big chair he love to sit in when the fire be agoin ' but jest as he get fix so nice he wife send for he to come back home and say he have to go so havin ' no use for he place here he turn it over tuh I for a song i c 'n show yuh the bill o ' sale yuh see i get to know mr coomb right well for he be interested in my ijee o ' startin ' a fur farm well he be dead now i often think when i be sittin ' here enjoyin ' what he build that somehow he spirit must be a hoverin ' around cause he certainly _ do _ love this place a heap the explanation entirely satisfied max though of course that skeptic of a bandy-leg have to let he eyebrow go up in a arch as he listen but then bandy-leg would doubt anything that savor of the uncommon max simply frown at he and pay no more attention to he manner you be certainly mighty lucky to fall heir to such a lovely little home as this obed steve be say with a streak of envy in he voice say i would just be tickled half to death now if i could spend a month up here with you there must be plenty of game around i reckon and it would be a real delight to keep house in a little palace like this but how be you go to tuck we away for the night obe if i might be so bold as to ask see that as yet we have not have a invite to stay over oh that be easily manage reply the other with another of he queer laugh you have not begin to see all the wonder o ' this lodge mr coomb amuse himself for a whole summer havin ' it build he put a heap o ' he own ijee into the same too yuh see he use to be a sea captain once on a time and that give he the notion to have table that fold against the wall so as tuh take mighty little room then seem ' as how he might expect to have company some time or other look how he fix the bunk along the wall with that obe turn a button that none of they have thus far notice fasten on the wall immediately a section slip down expose a cavity beyond that prove to be a regular sleep bunk fully capable of housing any ordinary person it be plain to be see that he sea education have give mr coomb the idea carry out in this remarkable fashion beat anything i ever strike admit the admiring steve as he push forward to peep inside the cavity that seem to offer such a comfortable bed but hardly big enough for the whole bunch of we i be afraid obed urge bandy-leg with the idea of course of draw the other out this be one bunk say obed calmly there be three jest like it along the two wall makin ' four in all so yuh see it be jest like mr coomb he figger on my have you-all stop over with I some fine day then i c 'n make up a bed on that ` ere couch which be softer 'n any o ' the bunk _ he _ use to sleep on it all the time do mr coomb well i must say this be a revelation to I admit max he face show how pleased he feel and you be lucky as steve here just say to fall in with such a fine man as mr coomb at the time you start you fur farm i suppose it be the interest he take in it that make he hand over this cabin when he learn that he plan for stay here could never be carry out why yes mostly that agree obed turn a little red p ` rap i ought to tell yuh that i chance to do mr coomb a little favor when we first meet yuh see i happen to come on he in the wood he would start out to find a certain kind o ' saple that he want right bad to use and not bein ' use to findin ' he way around he jest naturally get lose but that be not the wust o ' it in use he ax to chop down a sapling he kim across what do he do but cut he foot and it be bleed like fun when i ketched he shout and kim up course i soon fix that foot and since he be only a little dried-up speck o ' a man i manage to tote he on my back most way home here he choose to think i would do he a _ great _ favor and after that he be always sayin ' he mean to repay I some day well he certainly do when he turn over this here neat contraption at a price that be dirt cheap and which i would be ashamed to mention to yuh that be how it come i get this cabin how simple the explanation be after all and how bandy-leg must feel he cheek burn with shame at the thought of have suspect this same obed of try to deceive they max could easily picture the ex-sea captain seat in that capacious fireside chair with the tufted cushion and perhaps smoke he long-stemmed pipe with the air of a man who believe he have find what he have long seek peace and comfort combine only to have a summons come that he dare not disobey make yourselve to hum say obed cheerily here drop the pack over in this corner if later on so be yuh want to git anything out o ' the same it 'll be easy do and seein ' as i have get dinner start i guess we wont take a turn around the farm till it be be stow away although of course all of the boy be eager to see what a fur farm look like where those wonderful black fox that bring such a big price in the london market be be breed in captivity none of they object to sit down and take a rest bandy-leg and steve in particular make a bolt for the big chair though the latter be too quick for he competitor and manage to ensconce himself within its capacious embrace before bandy-leg arrive start earlier next time bandy-leg crow the proud possessor of the coveted seat as he spread himself so as to occupy it all but after i have try it out i 'll vacate because i expect to get busy in that bully little kitchen and help friend obe sling the grub for dinner so bandy-legs have to content himself with a seat on the couch he might have be observe sniff the air with avidity however as though he have catch some entice odor steal out of the oven of the cook stove that be not unlike fresh bread be well browned and there be nothing bandy-leg love better than the crust part of a fresh bake -- he always have a compact with the cook at home to save he the run-over portion which he look upon as a prize well worth have soon obed leave they there in the larger room and vanish within the kitchen it be a challenge to steve which he could not long resist bandy-legs keep watch he glance toward the connect door he whole manner be that of a boy who although make no sound might be sic one dog on another no sooner have steve leave the capacious fireside chair than bandy-legs slip into it and after that he be not mean ' to be dislodge until the summons come to gather about the table to discuss the midday meal bandy-leg like eat as well as the next one but he love he ease more and be well content to have some other fellow do the hard work of get the meal ready he time would come when he have to work he jaw in dispose of he portion of the spread the more max look about he the greater he wonder become all manner of thought surge through that active mind of he he have already conceive the greatest sort of secret admiration for the extraordinary wood boy even before he have glimpse that remarkable fur farm which the other be successfully run plainly then this same obed grime be bind to be a credit to he family and all those people bear the strange name give by obe would some day find cause to feel proud of have such a enterprising relative obed prove to be a pretty good cook despite the humility with which he have remark that of course he could not expect to compete on even term with fellow who have have so many better opportunity to acquire the knack of thing than have come he way the bread be as fine as any bandy-leg have ever eat in he own home where a high-priced cook hold sway over the kitchen there be also a meat pie that seem delicious both as to crust and contents when open though obed in-formed they that it be make of can beef and even display the recent tin jacket with its telltale label as confirmation to he assertion yuh see boy he remark laughingly i do not want yuh to think i would poach a deer in the close season and palm it off as mountain mutton like they do at some o ' the big hotel up here in the adirondack i be tell course i do shoot a deer once in a while in season and lot o ' pa ` tridge they bein ' so tame yuh c 'n knock they over as they sit on the lower limb o ' a tree after flushin ' i ketch wheens o ' trout too from time to time but i give yuh my word i never yet kill anything when the law be on it never when obe say a thing in he emphatic way he be to be rely on max think the wood boy could look very sober at time though as a rule there be that merry gleam in he eye that tell how much he love a joke altogether they have a delightful meal and what be even better there be a abundance to give every one three bountiful helping which fact pleased bandy-leg and steve in particular the former on pass he plate -- for they actually have such article at this wonderful lodge under the pine -- for the third help excuse himself by remark aside : it be queer what a _ terrible _ appetite tote a pack a few mile over a carry give a fellow now at home i be generally satisfy with one portion but once let I get into the harness and i seem to have no end of _ capacity _ say i would eat you out of house and home obe if i stay very long at you ranch no danger o ' that i guess bandy-leg reply the other for he have of course take quite naturally to call these new friend by they customary name just as boy always do get on quick term of familiarity last time i go to town i lay in quite a wheen o ' stuff then there be always the crick to git trout outen and in a short time you could shoot pa ` tridge without breakin ' the game law so do not let that worry yuh any i be on ' y too tickled to have some feller around it do git kinder lonely here sometimes i own up whew i should think it would obe say steve lose in admiration for the amazing nerve display by the wood boy in remain all by himself winter and summer seldom if ever see a human face and apparently devote all he energy to make he fur farm experiment turn out to be a success nothing would tempt I to stick it out here a whole winter why i would die of the blues and let the black fox go to the dickens while i make break for the nearest town so i could hear the sound of a human voice obe look at he gravely and heave a sigh yep i feel that way too sometimes steve he say presently and let I tell yuh the temptation be nigh more 'n i c 'n stand but i jest shut my tooth together and tell myself that i start in to do this job and i be agoin ' to stick it out or know the reason why then i git my second wind agin ' and it be all right once i use to give in right easy but i be broke now o ' that bad habit i guess chapter vii the young magician the more max listen to obe talk on the one subject that seem to be he pet hobby that of raise valuable fur-bearing animal for the market the deeper grow he conviction that the wood boy be well worth study he might talk after the manner of a uneducated boy but max know that this could not be the case even though the main lot of numerous grimese be follow the humble occupation of guide amidst the extensive stretch of the adirondack and possibly many of they would be find to be boor save along the line of woodcraft obe have manage to pick up considerable knowledge somehow or other when try to explain how this idea of successfully raise silver black fox take such a main grip on he imagination he bring out a batch of clipping which he have manage to get hold of in some manner max could not even guess how some of these be fantastic in they revelation while other be authentic interview with party who for year have be secretly engage in the business of fur farming this be away up on prince edward island beyond nova scotium say to be the place best situate geographically for the purpose as these animal require a severe climate in order that they pelt assume its richest and heaviest crop a black fox farm start down in florida would not produce fur worth offer for sale max be intensely interested with one account in particular connect with the extensive pioneer silver fox ranch he even ask the privilege of copy the same for future reference because he know that statement he might make later on would be skeptically receive by many people who have never dream that any species of fur be so valuable that young pup could be worth more than they weight in gold that the boy reader of this story may also stock up with information that will better enable he to understand what enterprising obed grime be try to do on a small scale i be tempt to give the main item in this newspaper article every word of which be say to be literally true since this account be first print some year ago other farm along similar line have be start away up near calgary in the canadian province of alberta and be say to be do excellently one ranch near midnapore report a start with twelve pair and the pack now count thirty-seven in all but here be the main part of the clipping well worth reading : there be something novel about a ranch which consist of space cover 150 foot of ground chappell now president of the sydney chamber of commerce nova scotium own seventy pair of silver black fox and he ranch be split up into small inclosure of that size cover with wire on four side the wire be bury four foot under ground attach to a concrete base and turn in several foot the silver black fox try to root its way to freedom and this be the way the breeder prevent he escape when the fox mate we also mate a pair of black cat of the ordinary domestic variety as soon as the young be bear we take the fox pup away from the mother fox and the kitten away from the mother cat and make the cat foster-mother to the fox cub in this way we be able to rear a more domesticated breed of fox for twenty year this business of raise fox of the silver black species be really keep under cover because of its great possibility for make big money with the last four or five year the business have become organize and today many million of dollar be invest in it the last lot of animal slaughter be in 1910 there be forty-three pelt send to london at that time they bring as high as $ 3800 the average fetch $ 1500 silver black fox be the rarest fur utilize by man the russian sable otter and south sea seal be practically eliminate for commercial purpose due to international law which prohibit the killing of these animal for the next ten or fifteen year so as to give they a chance to increase only 800 pair of live fox be place on sale last year fewer than 50 of that number be kill and they fur sell the rest go for breed purpose because fur farm be start up in many favorable place the man who raise silver fox on prince edward island know the game they start in it as boy many year ago in the province of prince edward nova scotium and new brunswick man and woman interested in breed fox have be make wealthy they be poor people ten year ago today they live in town house own they own automobile and yet continue to give the strictest attention to all the detail connect with they singular farming industry obe be extremely modest in what he tell concern he own small beginning max have also read in one of the clipping that a pair of gilt-edged silver black fox be worth all the way up to $ 30000 be of course doubly curious to learn whether those with which obe start could be the genuine article and if so how have he manage to obtain they it seem to be only a game in which rich person could enter obed understand just what must be pass in the mind of the other and at the first opportunity he hasten to explain i be just chock full o ' this business he go on to say when i run across mr coomb yuh remember i tell yuh about how that come about and that he seem to think i would save he life well he and I keep house together here for some month and then one day thar come the biggest surprise i ever have he fetch a crate along up from town in a wagon he hire and say inside the same be the finest pair o ' silver black i ever see then some more wagon begin to show up fetchin ' roll of wire net and bag o ' cement to make concrete with mr coomb have go into the fur raisin ' business for keep and i be to have a interest in the game he have a agreement all write out that both o ' we sign before a justice which fix thing up half the proceeds o ' the fur farm be to come to I while i stay here to look after thing well sir we work like fun to git the stockade build ` cording to form and we mate pair o ' fox plant in the same since then i have fix three more enclosure ready for a increase o ' stock mr coomb he call this the lone lodge black fox farm and i guess the name will stick even after i get to sell off some o ' the product it be simply wonderful all of the eager listener think max could hardly believe he ear and yet so far as he could make out obed seem in dead earnest besides he have the document to prove the truth of he story he say which he would spread before they a little later on as for that skeptic bandy-leg he roll he eye up many time while listen and seem to be swallow it with considerable difficulty toby and steve never question the veracity of the narrator they be simply amaze at the immensity of the enterprise that have spring up almost like a mushroom over night million on million of dollar invest in artificial fur farming and the general public utterly in the dark concern the fact until recently when its scope could no longer be conceal like a light hide under a bushel and now that you have kinder get a idea of what a big fur farm might be like the singular wood boy go on to say rise as he speak s ` pose yuh meander out and take a look at my humble beginnin ' i surely hope yuh will not run down my effort 'cause o ' course thing be not get to runnin ' full swing yet but the cub be nigh big enough to be take to market how many have you get obed ask max follow the other out of the cabin one pair nearly grow and another just two month old i have be mighty lucky in not lose a single pup so far come the reply over obed 's shoulder and he might be pardon for put just a mite of pride in he tone for he have accomplish something worth while for a new beginner at the business but if you expect to keep in this line say bandy-leg quickly as though he voice a suspicion that keep crop up in he mind why do you want to dispose of that first pair of pup obe laugh good-naturedly i 'll tell yuh bandy-leg he say confidentially in the first place breeder like to change they stock so as to bring new blood into the pen then again why i happen to need the money that be comin ' to I for my share a fellow have get to live up here in the mountain and grub cost a wheen o ' hard cash ` specially when yuh get a good appetite which seem to fit I all right but if i get what i be hopin ' for it 'll be all right and i reckon thar 'll come some year before we let more fox get away from this same farm so he take they to where he have he main enclosure in which the boy find the parent fox they may have become somewhat accustomed to see obed and hear the sound of he coax voice for even the most timid of wild animal in the process of time come to recognize the one who supply they want along the line of daily food but possibly bandy-leg or steve chance to laugh or speak out loud for the old fox take the alarm and it be only after constant effort on the part of obe with he familiar call to dinner that cause they to show themselves at all they be certainly beauty max wonder more than ever at the nerve of obe in try to start a silver black fox farm in this section with no one save himself apparently in charge he fear that the enterprise would be doom to certain disaster the smart wood boy might be successful in raise a crop of valuable youngster in the fox line but sooner or later some unscrupulous man guide out of a job perhaps and load with strong drink would try to make a secret raid on he preserve and clean he out in a single night fox pelt worth thousand of dollar must tempt some man beyond they fear or power of resistance max make up he mind he would talk about this with obe before he leave he wonder at the short-sighted policy of the executor of mr coomb ' estate in allow so much money to be tie up in this property without proper safeguard if it be intend to continue the fox farm now that it give all evidence of possible success surely the boy should have a assistant some strong woodsman who could by he presence and readiness to do battle awe any intended transgressor they next visit the enclosure where the two pair of little fox play and sleep and eat they fill daily increase in size and value they be also timid though in due time obe manage to get they to show themselves for hunger be a powerful inducement and the smell of favorite food a lure difficult to resist of course explain the young fur farmer while they be watch the inmate of the second enclosure i do not have black cat up here yet to carry out they direction exactly but i be aim to do that also pretty soon yep and after this set o ' pup have be sell if they fetch all i count on i be goin ' to have a talk with the lawyer that look after mr coomb ' estate he promise to come up and see what could be do about extendin ' the farm and then i guess it be goin ' to be time to hire a helper seein ' i can not do everything by myself that be just what i mean to speak to you about obed exclaimed max you ought not to try to stay here another winter all by yourself besides some unscrupulous man might raid you enclosure while you be off hunting or fishing and break up you business it be not safe obed and i know from what you say before about suspect stranger be around here right now that you be get anxious yourself the boy draw a long breath and nod he head into he eye creep a look quite the opposite of that merry gleam usually nestle there yes plainly obe _ be _ worry over something and max believe he have put he finger directly on the sore spot when he speak of a possible raid on the fur product of the singular farm can you find just such a reliable man as you want obed ask steve that part be not so hard he be tell fact be i have get he more 'n half engage a ` ready he name be jerry stock and he be a wood guide be a heap interested in this game ever since we start up fact be jerry have do a heap o ' thing for I from time to time 'cause yuh see i could not work it all he live ` bout ` leven mile off that way we have fix a way to signal to each other by flyin ' a little white flag from two low peak when i want jerry i run my flag up and if he be home why the next day or mebbe sooner he show up but shuck that would not keep I from losin ' my stock if there be a real raid he go on talk further and the boy pick up considerable more valuable information for obe be apparently well post on the subject which have occupy he thought night and day so he tell they that perhaps if all go well he might take up a companion industry be nothing more nor less than try to raise mink or otter in captivity ` course i know it be not do to any great extent yet he explain but that be no reason there should not be some ready money pick up in the business it would not pay anything like the fox and for that reason i would go slow about it oh i have get a heap o ' way for gettin ' the ready cash to keep up my share o ' the expense o ' the farm here i have find two bee tree and send the honey to market too get nigh twenty dollar for the honey then i dig ginseng root time when there be nothing else to do come over with I and see my frog pond last shipment o ' big fat saddle bring I a neat little wad o ' money and they do not cost I a cent if yuh want to know it the four boy look at each other in increase wonderment what manner of chap be this same obe to be able to wrest a living from a bounteous nature in the clever way he do steve in particular be loud in he praise why obe old fellow he burst out with you be just the same kind of a enterprising chap max here have always be why it be he grand idea about there be mussel aplenty in the big sunflower down we way that start we into make a try for fresh-water pearl in the river we find 'em too some thousand of dollar ' worth of they and when the news leak out whee the farmer all around have a tough time get they harvest home because every hand be tread for mussel in the creek and small river for thirty mile around carson why i bet you it would be as hard to find a fresh-water clam down we way now as a needle in a haystack they be all clean out you see max here have read about pearl be find out in indiana and other place and that give he the big idea just like you get set on the fur farm business by read about it they duly inspect the marsh where obed hunt he big greenback frog when he think the crop warrant a thin out they be always in demand down new york way whar they fetch a dollar a pound for the saddle he explain and let I tell yuh it do not take a great many o ' they to weigh that much i have get some granddaddy bouncer here that would make you stare to see 'em but they do not show up much at this time o ' day and how do you get they by the wholesale when you want to market any asked steve i have shoot many a one with a small flobert rifle or else catch they with a piece of red flannel fix on a small hook attach by a short cord to a stout pole well man in the regular frog-raising business could not go about it as slow as that say the other though i have shoot a few o ' the big un that way 'cause they be too tricky to be grab with my hand net if you stay with I a spell we 'll get more 'n one mess o ' frog leg if yuh like they bandy-leg be see to work he lip as though he month fairly water at the please prospect for those who be fond of the dish say that frog ' leg be more delicate than the best spring chicken with just a little taste of fish about they that rather add to the piquancy have by this time exhaust about all the sight of the wonderful farm the boy head back again toward the cabin max could not but notice that obe show sign of uneasiness while away and cast frequent glance in the direction where under those whisper pine and the dark green hemlock he lone lodge stand therefore max be not very much surprise when as he and obe stroll along in the rear of the other three who be chat and argue about certain matter the young fur farmer press he arm confidentially and go on to say : i would like to tell yuh something max 'cause i own up it be gettin ' on my nerve i think nothin ' could bother I any but now that the time be so close at hand when i mean tuh sell that pair o ' grow pup and get the money i need so bad why thing look kinder different fact be max he go on allow he voice to sink into a mysterious stage whisper somebody be lookin ' around in my cabin while i be down at you camp last evenin ' i know this because thing be more or less upset and i reckon my comin ' back scare the man away whoever he may have be chapter viii product of the fur farm that look bad obed max hasten to say feel a perceptible thrill at the very think of be on hand to assist this enterprising boy defend he property which he have make so valuable through he own effort in most part i see a smoke last evening too which must have be make by a camp-fire i wonder if there be deer hunter up here so early or if some man might be after you fox of course that idea only come to I after you have tell we about you enterprise and how valuable the pelt be it be mighty tough avowed obed between he set tooth to be so nigh success and then face failure i have be tempt to signal for jerry to come over and help I stand guard a spell yuh see i ought to be on my way to town with that pair o ' nearly-grown young black i know whar i c 'n get more for 'em alive than for they pelt if i take the time to cure the same which i do not want to do oh i have just _ get _ to sell 'em and that be all thar be about it i have dream about the day i would get that check and show -- er that lawyer managin ' mr coomb ' estate that all i tell he be true once i have the proof that thar 's big money in raisin ' silver black he be promise to do anything in reason i ask max make up he mind on the spot look here obe be the way he talk for max always believe that it be good policy to hit the nail directly on the head especially when the subject be of considerable importance what be to hinder you go off with that pair of live black and dispose of they while the four of we stay here and run you fur farm for you it would only take a few day and we have get the time to spare of course you would have to trust we to the limit to leave thing in we charge but we would surely be please to help you out and depend on it nobody would steal any of the other inmate of the pen while we be on deck we have get only one gun along but that be a repeat marlin always to be depend on to do its work the wood boy be visibly affect by hear max say this he reach for the other 's hand and squeeze it almost fiercely oh it be kind of you to say that max he exclaim as though the word spring directly from he heart and d'ye know i be tempt to take you at you word for i _ must _ get those pup deliver as i promise everything depend on that deal the man see they three month ago and we make a bargain i be to deliver the pup to he by the time first snow fly and it be due any day now you know a singular thing have happen and max while deeply interested in what obe be say could not help but notice that for once the wood boy have speak without a sign of the rude dialect which up to then have mark he manner of speech this further arouse the curiosity of max who to himself be say : i hit the mark when i guess obe be smarter than he let on and could talk just as well as the next fellow when he choose he be just fall into speak that way through he association with these rough people up here he own folk likely enough or else he like to pull the wool over we eye just for a joke aloud max continue to reassure the other then consider it as good as settle obe he say that we 'll hang around here a short while if you think best you can get that jerry to come over and keep he finger on the pulse perhaps it might be wise too because he would know just what to do in case there be any trouble among the fox leave in the pen and it be all new to we remember yuh have relieve my mind a heap max sure yuh have obe tell he again relapse into the vernacular that be usually a part of a wood guide 's language and tonight i 'll set the trap i have get fix mebbe if so be trespasser come a skulkin ' around they might git a little surprise but i 'll show yuh what i be mentionin ' later on jest now i on ' y want to tell yuh i be mighty glad i drop into yer camp last evenin ' ` stead o ' slippin ' away like i fust think o ' doin ' but you do not want I to look on this matter as a secret do you obe the other start max thought and look quickly at he now what might yuh be meanin ' by that max he presently ask a bit anxiously oh i only want to have you permission to tell my three chum what you have be say to I explain max of course i know what they answer will be when i put it up to they we have really come here on what bandy-leg call a wild goose hunt for there be not one chance in ten that we 'll ever be able to find roland chase so we time be really pretty much we own to do with as we will and obe all of we have take such a big interest in you enterprise up here that we 'll be only too happy to lend you a help hand you be so near success now that it would be a shame if you fall down through no fault of you own that be what i keep tellin ' myself too max do not you know exclaim the now excite obed i have hug that hope close to my heart month after month and now when i c 'n almost whiff the success i have pray for it would nearly kill I to lose everything oh i jest want a couple of week at the most and then i 'll show 'em yes i will they all say i would make a dead failure out o ' my fur farm but yuh c 'n see it be comin ' along right smart when they reach the cabin the boy throw themselves down on the soft yielding turf near-by to loaf as bandy-leg properly express it and surely he could do this as well as any boy who ever draw breath max take occasion to tell the other what he and obe have be talk about all of they be deeply interested they look angrily at each other when max explain how the wood boy have find trace of some intruder who have actually enter he lone cabin while he obe be away in they company also tell how the other strongly suspect that a dastardly plot have be hatch look to the rob of the pen connect with the silver fox fur farm obe be inside do something at the time and so max feel that he could talk freely he mean that he three chum should know everything in the beginning before he call on they to decide whether they would stay over a few day and guard the property while obe be market he first proceeds in a distant city for the pup be really too valuable to be trust to the tender mercy of a express company obe think i do not exactly understand how obed know that there _ be _ a conspiracy hatch up against he to complete the ruination of he enterprise continue max but he seem to think some party have a deep grudge against he it may be we 'll know more about this later on but for the present i have promise obed i would put up a proposition to you then let 's hear it max exclaim touch-and-go steve though i reckon we c 'n all give a pretty close guess at what be come why obe want to get away with that pair of grown pup so he can deliver they to the man he be bargain with and i have propose that we stay here a few day and guard he property while he be off be there any objection to that plan i tell he i expect i could count on my chum to stick by I i should say you could max chuckle bandy-leg why i be fairly count on depopulate that big frog marsh while we be hang around this section and say steve here could keep we supply with trout galore if only he fish from the bank and do not wade in both the other be equally prompt to agree indeed toby fall all over himself as steve term it in he eagerness to give assent and could only recover after come to a abrupt halt take one of he customary big breath and then give a sharp whistle after which he finish what he be say as nicely as anything and that settle it just as max have be confident would be the case for he know he chum too well to believe they would be willing to let such a brave fight be lose when the goal seem so near obed grime have prove to be a fellow after they own heart and they find themselves deeply interested in he fortune so when the wood boy come out again -- max suspect that he have purposely withdraw from the scene in order not to embarrass they while make they decision -- he be tell how they all feel and obe go around shake hand with the tear in he eye plainly he have he whole heart wrap up in the successful outcome of this odd venture and when the cloud begin to loom up overhead this proffer assistance on the part of the four chum be gratefully receive this be mighty nice o ' yuh boy he keep tell they as though really at a loss for appropriate word best calculate to express the state of he feeling and i be not goin ' to ever forget it either now i feel that i c 'n start out right away the day after tomorrow and deliver they pup to mr sheckard say mebbe i will not be a proud boy when he hand I that big check and i know that i have win out against all odds he eye glow at the very think and max be more than glad he and he comrade have the chance to render so resolute a chap slight assistance for it would really be a pleasure for they to stay there at that wonderful little lodge under the whisper pine and keep house while obe be away then too jerry would be on hand ready with he advice and knowledge so as to do the proper thing as to any rash prowler steal the valuable fox day or night well they would see to it a constant watch be keep and that the gun be always ready to block any nasty little game like that later on max amuse himself loll in mr coomb ' big fireside chair which he have move near one of the window he have run across a number of book on a shelf and be engage in look they over though hardly bother to actually read nevertheless he seem to be quite curious concern they and when obe chance to come in max naturally ask concern the volume oh yuh see some o ' they belong to I the wood boy remark without hesitation and t ` other they be leave here by mr coomb he be a great reader and besides he would travel all over the known world yuh remember i say he be a sea captain and that he make he fortune carryin ' cargo from the far east to england and america sometime i 'll tell yuh a few of the queer adventure he have in foreign country they have get lot o ' thrill about 'em too just so ventured max casually and i once hear some people talk about a mr coomb who have be a great traveler now i wonder if it could have be the same party be he first name robert oh no _ my _ mr coomb ' name be jare reply the other promptly then of course it could not have be the same add max smile as though he have attain the object of he question but the similarity in name and the fact that both man have travel considerably make I think it might be so he once more dip into the book he be hold although watch obed slily over the top of the volume and when the wood boy have pass outside again max hasting might have be see to hurriedly turn back to the blank page at the front of the book scan several initial that be plainly write there and then nod he head mysteriously with a smile that gradually creep across he whole face just as though something pleased he which for the time be he choose to keep to himself chapter ix lay plan to help obe it be only natural that steve always headstrong and impulsive should be eager to find out what kind of plan might be arrange look to keep watch and ward over the fur farm during the night to come he have be impress with the sign of anxiety which obe plainly betray when speaking of he belief concern some sort of plot be hatch up against he peace of mind and which would bring about the ultimate ruination of he unique and intensely interesting undertaking to steve the idea of a miserable rascal sneak up in the night to destroy all that poor hardworking obe have build up after many moon be simply terrible the more he consider it the greater become he secret anger and of course this mean that he liking for the boy fur farmer grow in proportion during the afternoon as the shadow begin to lengthen perceptibly steve find occasion to broach the subject to he three chum max have come out of the cabin evidently he have tire of look over the book which might do very well to pass away a long evening or a rainy day when time drag but could not chain he down long when the sun be shine the breeze rustling through the many-colored leaf still on the tree and with all nature beckon so steve crooked he finger toward bandy-leg and toby lounging near by and be in a humor themselves for any sort of thing the pair hasten to join he and max upon be pounce upon by the balance of the crowd look askance know that something be in the wind strike I fellow commence steve that we ought to be figure on what we expect to do tonight huh as for I quickly respond bandy-leg i be expect to do my share about slingin ' together a dandy spread with some of the fine grub we fetch along this mountain air be something terrible when it come to tone up _ jaded appetite _ i feel as if i have a vacuum down about my middle all the time i be begin to be alarm about my condition if it keep on it be go to mean bankruptcy for my folk that be all about I now add toby jucklin briskly i be hope to g-g-get a b-b-bully g-g-good sleep tonight unless max fix it so we have to t-t-take t-t-turn stand sentry duty steve look disgusted oh rat i do not mean anything like that and you both know it he tell the two grin chum what i be refer to be on the point of duty we have agree to stand back of we new friend obe and see to it that he be not rob of the proceeds of he industry by unscrupulous scoundrel and we have get to make good hear hear ejaculate toby pretend to clap he hand in applause steve you be exhaust all the big word in the dictionary with you high-flown language warn bandy-leg in mock severity but i get you mean all the same and i also agree with you noble sentiment sure we be expect to stand up for obe and he pet and we be likewise intend to make it hot for any old terrapin who come creep around here with the idea of make way with the wearer of that expensive fur how about it max that be a settled thing readily reply the one appeal to and whose opinion it be plain to be see would swing thing one way or another since the other fellow be in the habit of look up to max as they leader we can fix it up in regular orthodox style each fellow have two hour on duty and the rest of the night for sleep do that strike you as about right well remark steve proudly it will not be the first occasion when this bunch have have to stand guard not by a long sight i can look back and see many a night when we have to keep a anchor to windward or else lose something we prize a heap ever since we dig up all those mussel in the big sunflower and find dandy pearl inside some of they it seem to I we have have occasion from time to time to be envy by other people and have to keep watch so we would not be rob oh stand sentry be a old trick with we for my p-p-part remark toby yawn as he speak i would much rather think up some g-g-good s-s-scheme that would ease the s-s-strain and allow we to s-s-sleep through the entire night please explain what you mean by say that toby demand steve you do get off the most mysterious communication sometimes and muddle we all up but there be not anything q-q-queer about this steve protest toby all of you know i have be a g-g-great h-h-hand to make m-m-machinery take the place of h-h-hand power what be the need of we s-s-staying awake p-p-part of the night even if by cudgel we brain we c-c-could think up some g-g-good s-s-scheme that would answer the same purpose i can see _ you _ cudgel you poor brain all right toby sneer steve who apparently do not take a great deal of stock in the other 's ability for conceive clever idea : and a pretty mess you would make of it in the bargain take it from I they be cudgel enough as it be that will do for you steve say max i understand just what toby mean and it be along the right line too this be the age of progress and up-to-date people do not want to depend on the old-time method that be good enough for they grandfather toby think one of we might suggest a scheme whereby we could guard the fox farm and at the same time obtain we full quota of sleep in other word rig up a dummy to stand we trick as sentry be not that it toby j-j-just what i have in my mind max snap toby and any silly c-c-could easy see that sure and the wise one have to be tell chirp steve jauntily but never mind argue toby it be all right and i be only joking i get the idea and now have any one a scheme on tap that would apply to the case toby scratch he head as though he consider that have be the first to make the suggestion it be up to he to say something no matter how well there be the spring-gun trap you know he remark without once stutter which fact prove that he be deliberately take he time about answer what sort of arrangement do you call that i would like to know asked steve s-s-say you a hunter and never hear about the s-s-spring-gun trap exclaim toby scornfully well i 'll try to explain if you give I a little t-t-time and do not r-r-rush I too much you see a gun be f-f-fastened to the ground and aim along a certain avenue that the intended thief have just g-g-got to use in c-c-coming up to the b-b-bait then a c-c-cord be s-s-strung so the thief p-p-press against the s-s-same just like max here fix he c-c-camera night when he want to s-s-snap off a skunk or a ` coon by flashlight well the g-g-gun go off and f-f-fill mister thief with number twelve birdshot when you hear the c-c-crash and he howl why you just s-s-saunter out and f-f-fetch in the s-s-spoil there do you understand about the s-s-spring-gun trap now steve oh i know all that before only you mixed I up by give it that name the other hastily reply but it strike I that would be a pretty rough deal for we to play it might answer if the thief be a animal but a human being be different all the same retorted toby savagely he be a t-t-thief and outside the p-p-pale of the law just so steve go on and max be surprise at he moderation because as a rule steve have always be the most reckless one of the crowd but suppose now we find that we would do more than we calculate on toby a charge of small birdshot start out on its errand a whole lot like a bullet it do not commence to scatter till it get just so far away from the muzzle of the gun depend on the size of the bear and the way the barrel be choke i have know a charge of shot to tear a hole right through a board when fire at close range at a distance it would only have scatter out and pepper the whole fence and toby we might feel rather bad if we find we would kill a man even if he be a thief toby do not answer to that fling the truth of the matter be he shiver at the gruesome picture steve 's word draw before he mental vision for toby be not at all bloodthirsty max now take a hand in the conversation listen fellow he go on to say it strike I that when we set about discuss this matter we ought to remember that there be one chap who be considerably more interested in the outcome than any of we can ever be ` course you mean obe when you say that max venture bandy-leg he be the one the other admit and we ought to invite he to join we in figure out we plan now it may be obe will have a scheme of he own that would knock any we might think up all silly i 'll call he over and tell he what we be try to arrange it happen that just then obe be pass on he way to the cabin he have be work somewhere amidst he enclosure perhaps make certain preparation for insure the safety of he valuable furry pet should a descent on the farm come about during the hour of darkness obe hasten to join they he question look influence max to explain without hesitation and the wood boy smile broadly when he hear how he new-found friend be already take so decide a interest in he fortune now it might be he start to say again look serious that all this fuss be not worth the candle and that nothin ' 's go to happen but i believe in shuttin ' the door _ before _ the hoss be steal it be too late afterwards i have not get the time right now to tell yuh jest how i learn that my fox be agoin ' tuh be in danger somebody i know write I a letter and warn I which 'll have tuh be enuff jest now tuh explain since i get that same three day back i have be figgerin ' on how i could fix up a trap tuh ketch any two-legged varmint that chance tuh come sneakin ' around here of a night well i get one er two trick rig up that might fill the bill of course you mean to show they to we obe steve burst out with for if you do not and we be leave in charge here one of we might fall into the pit and get knock out which would be tough luck i be think oh i mean to show you steve assert the fur farmer quickly and if so be yuh 'll come along with I right now we 'll take a look at the contraption which of course yuh understand be only mean for night-time and tuh help out when jerry would not be around for I to sorter lean on be boy who do thing themselves it be only natural that the four chum should feel a decide interest in what obe have just say even max show a eagerness to go forth and examine the say trap he could speculate as to what they character might turn out to be but this only add a little more spice to the occasion so when obe turn and start off with a beckon finger that entice they to follow he lead none of the quartette hold back chapter x trap fob night prowler yuh see remark obed turn around as they draw near the first enclosure where the parent fox be confine behind the wire fencing i have just be add a few finish touch tuh this here trap scheme i get a little idea while i be alookin ' the ground over and reckon i could fix it up so there would be a heap right good chance that a feller creep around here o ' a night would step into the contraption i 'll show yuh how i ` range it with that he lead the way along a plain trail that seem to be the easiest route up to the enclosure three time out of four a stranger prowl around with meager light to guide he would be apt to follow that beaten track and this be evidently what the shrewd obed be count on well it be this way my little scheme be agoin ' to work he explain after reach a certain point see this rope -- i throw it across a limb o ' this tree yuh notice that it be get a easy runnin ' slip-noose at the end do not yuh that i be fix right here where there be a good chance the thief will put he foot in it as he take this step i be show you he prove that he be right and indeed it be really a difficult thing after obe have place the noose just as he want it close to the ground and on little wooden crotch he have arrange there for the purpose for any one to step across without get he foot entangled in the rope well let 's reckon then he do get catch in the noose and jerk it tight around he ankle continue obed very much interested himself in what he be say and as max quickly notice even neglect to speak as he usually do although he have show this odd trait before what happen i 'll show you how it be go to work out if everything run as i have plan accordingly he pick up a heavy piece of wood that chance to be lie close by and which doubtless obe have use before in order to test the accuracy of he figure this he insert in the noose and then give it a hunch that not only tighten the rope but carry out the further purpose of the inventor instantly thing begin to happen the boy hear a queer rattle sound near by and immediately the wooden dummy be jerk out of obed 's hand to be draw up until it strike against the limb of the tree fully ten foot above steve give a whoop my star but that work like a charm obe let I tell you grease lightning could hardly be quicker than the way you have arrange you trap and what be all that rattle sound about what be hold on to the other end of the rope which pull the log up on the run i want to know even if i be not from missourus the wood boy laugh as though quite pleased because he trap have work well enough to call forth such word of praise from these new friend come over and see he simply say they follow the line of rope now taut and resemble a huge fiddle string as bandy-leg remark testing it as he pass along it lead they to the brow of a abrupt little descent a sheer drop of perhaps twenty foot down this slope they follow the rope with they eye and then discover it be attach to a large and heavy barrel that could almost be call a hogshead evidently something which have be use as a crate to convey a portion of the previous owner of the cabin 's crockery ware thither when he move up from town as the boy be no simpleton they readily grasp the essential quality of obed 's little scheme it may have be original with he and then again possibly he have borrow the same from some book he have read but nevertheless it strike they as pretty clever not content with the heaviness of the big barrel he have place a number of stone inside so as to add to the swiftness of its flight down that declivity once it be release the rope act as starter and upon be jerk as must be the case should any one get a foot catch in the noose it release a stake that keep the heavy barrel poise there at the top of the descent the consequence be that it would plunge downward almost as though make a sheer drop the noose tighten about the leg or leg of the unhappy wight who have spring the trap he would be jerk off he foot and haul up head downward to dangle there in midair as helpless as a babe set it again and let I try the trick please obed plead steve who seem to be particularly charm with the arrangement i will if yuh help I git the barrel back up the hill again reply the other workin ' all by myself i have have tuh take the rock out each time before i could push the old thing back again tuh the top 'cause she be some heavy believe I steve yes and both bandy-leg and toby also hasten to comply with this reasonable request and between they all the heavy barrel be slowly push up again until the stake hold it poise there on the top of the sharp declivity max stand and watch operation not that he be unwilling to lend a hand also if necessary but just then he want to observe obed and draw certain conclusion in which he max seem to take considerable interest then steve be give the wooden dummy which have work so like a charm and instruct how to manage it so that it would take the place of a man 's lower extremity steve do so well that he too by a little jerk displace the delicately arrange trigger as obed call the stake and cause the barrel to pitch furiously down the steep slope steve have not be quite quick enough to snatch he hand away after work the trick the consequence be that when the billet of wood be pluck from he grasp with such swiftness and draw instantly aloft steve staggered and might have fall only that obed clutch hold of he wow do you see that gasp steve stare upward at the dangling dummy as though he could easily imagine it a kick squirm human figure and say it work as fine as silk do not it obe you have do yourself proud with this little game if that thief ever get a foot in you slip-noose he goose will be cook that be as plain as dirt he actually seem to be very proud of the fact that he have act as master of ceremony and set the trap off so successfully nothing would do but that bandy-leg and toby jucklin in addition should be give the same distinction so twice more be the barrel roll up the slope and on both occasion it work to a charm it seem to be next door to perfect for a fact assert max upon be appeal to for he opinion but he do not seem to hanker after try it out on he own account finally the weighted barrel be again push up to its appoint position and hold there with the stake when the proper time come it would be easy for the inventor to arrange the slip-noose and set the trap what be there anything more to be show ask steve when obe ask they to follow he a little further a few minute later and they be gravely examine a odd arrangement which consist for the most part of a very heavy log steve look it over critically and then venture to give he opinion : look a whole lot like a deadfall trap such as they use in most place to get bear in he go on to say obed chuckle as though pleased at the answer to he look of inquiry just what it be build on the pattern of steve if yuh want to know it he admit the only difference be that in the regular deadfall the log come down and smash the poor bear by its sheer weight now i have try to rig _ my _ trap up so it 'll simply make a prisoner o ' the creeper i 'll show yuh just how it work i have get a dummy here too that i use to test thing yuh see there be always just a little chance it might go wrong and i do not want to get catch and make a prisoner with nobody around to let I loose with that he demonstrate he idea the trap be spring just as he mean it should be and if the dummy have really be a man he would have find himself catch tightly in the log trap with but a poor chance of ever get out again unless external assistance come along any more trick like these two up you sleeve obe ask steve after they have further examine the deadfall and max have pronounce it skillfully construct well i be afraid i reach the end o ' my rope when i hatch up this second idea steve the other remark in a sort of apologetic tone of course i might think up a few more if i reckon it would be necessary but i have get a hunch that one o ' the lot be agoin ' tuh grab that thief providin ' he do come around here besides when yuh git right down to brass tack thar be not as much danger o ' my bein ' rob in the night-time as in the day and why not obe further ask steve i would think that be the very time you would feel scariest when it be dark and you could not see if anybody be prowl around the farm stop a ' think how fox have hole in the ground into which they c 'n burrow when scare the least mite explain obed readily and yuh 'll see how hard it would be for a stranger to lay hand on they now in the daytime if they come along with I away from the place a man with a rifle could knock over my pet as easy as turnin ' he hand but all the same i have fix my trap for one thing i would like to find out jest who the thief be max notice what emphasis he put on that last remark he could see the customary twinkle in obed 's eye give way to a sterner look as though he have brood more or less over this same subject and max himself nod he head as though he might in a measure understand just how obed feel so they return to the house bandy-leg at least rejoice because with all those clever contraption set and wait to give the intended thief a warm reception it do seem as though there would be hardly any necessity for they to waste they precious time in sit up and keep watch when they would be so much better off enjoy balmy sleep as he call it and all sleep be along that order accord to the mind of bandy-leg max and steve trail along well in the rear this may have simply happen but steve twice stop the other and point out something he wish max to see so possibly the delay be intentional on he part at least he presently make a remark that would make it seem so it certainly look as if obe be a pretty ingenious maker of snare that be sure max steve be say significantly that be right he be steve and we must give he great credit for it even if he trap fail to catch a thief in the act i be just think max pursue the other meditatively that it be evident this same obed must have inherit that strain from a long line of trapper ancestor or progenitor would not you think so too max look at he companion queerly and smile as he make reply you may be right steve of course but it strike I obe have a original streak of genius all he own which do not have to depend on any inherit trait thing be not _ always _ what they seem in this world you know lookey here max you have strike a scent which you do not think best to share with you boon companion that be as plain to I as two and two make four you have come to think a little the same way as bandy-leg perhaps and suspect obe of be more than he let on be that it max do you really believe he be play some sly trick on we be that yarn about mr coomb all moonshine do this fur farm belong to some company that obe be work for i wish you would tell I what you have get in you mind max i expect to a little later on steve never fear he be assure i be not more than half certain even now that it can be so and i never like to make a mess of thing besides you know it would not be just fair to obe to have we all suspect he of play trick just go on as you have be do take my word for it this new friend we have make be all to the good and will never turn out to be the wrong sort of fellow he start on after say this and steve follow look very much puzzle and shake he head as though he could not catch the right idea shortly afterwards however steve have apparently forget he newly awaken suspicion for he be enter into the general conversation as heartily as ever still max notice with amusement that from time to time steve would follow obed hungrily with he eye and on such occasion that double line of wrinkle expressive of bewilderment might again be see upon the boy 's forehead toby and bandy-leg be only too glad to take the preparation of supper into they hand completely they feel a certain amount of pride in they culinary skill and wish to show they host the full list of they accomplishment as camp cook besides they believe that among they abundant store they carry a number of thing which obe fail to possess and of course a new dish be apt to be a pleasant surprise to the wood boy the supper thus concoct and carry out be certainly a genuine triumph steve openly congratulate the two efficient cook on they masterly skill though max laughingly warn the other to beware of the greek bear gift for there might be a base motive hide behind all that glib praise steve protest that he mean every word of it but then it be well know that steve hate to do any cooking himself and hence be fain to laud the effort of other in that line doubtless in the hope of encourage they to keep right on do it after the bountiful meal have be enjoy and every one declare that it would be utterly impossible to eat another single bite for fear of the consequence they spend a very enjoyable evening alongside the fire that burn on the hearth at one end of the cabin obe as he have promise tell they some of the strange thing he have hear from the old sea captain who during he life on the seven sea have meet with many most remarkable adventure well worth repeat obed address they in he own language and max often smile as though some of the quaint expression use by the young narrator amuse he though perhaps there may have be still another reason for he quiet chuckle steve catch he at it several time and eye the other in perplexity as though he suspect max of add secretly to he fund of knowledge which thus far he obstinately decline to share with he mate later on when they begin to feel sleepy obe say he would go out and make sure he trap be set right max offer to keep he company and together they saunter forth to be follow with a wistful look from the envious steve who be mutter to himself : i wish i know what max have get in that mind of he right now i be dead certain he be figure out some sort of thing that be go to give the rest of we a big surprise when he see fit to spring it on we but for the life of I i can not guess what it can be oh shuck what be the use of bother any more about it if it turn out worth while max will tell we in good time and if he be on the wrong scent why he 'll just drop the game and no harm do after a while the other come in again say both trap be set and there do not seem to be any need of they lose sleep on account of possible unwelcome visitor obe show how the conceal bunk could be make ready and all of they be loud in they expression of satisfaction over have such comfortable lodgings for the night they mentally bless the memory of the say mr coomb whose forethought and inventive ingenuity have plan all these wonderful adjunct of the little forest lodge in due time they creep into they several berth just as if aboard ship and after that several of the fellow do not know a single thing until they be rudely arouse perhaps some hour later on the last thing steve remember hearing as he roll himself up in he blanket be the crackle of the fire the mournful sighing of the wind through the top of the whisper pine and then the distant call of a owl to its mate he awake with a suddenness that cause he to sit up and consequently crack he head against the board above he bunk the blow almost knock steve back again as he have be before and must have hurt considerably but he ignore this fact just then because from without there be come loud yell of fright in a man 's voice chapter xi a tree that bear strange fruit max -- obe we have get something almost shriek steve as he now tumble out of he odd bunk very much after the fashion of a dislodge log landing with a bump on the floor and steve be not alone in he circus stunt for several other fellow be make a hasty and undignified exit at the same time bandy-leg and toby jucklin for instance max somehow manage to get on he foot without so much scramble and as for obe as he have be sleep on the cot closer to the fire they could already see he hastily pull on some clothes get dress and in a hurry cry max suit he action to the word oh listen to he whoop it up will you exclaim bandy-leg as those loud call still smite the night air and in a way that cover the whole gamut of human utterance toby want to say something too but though he jaw work no audible sound come forth to explain the agitate state of he mind they have luckily prepare for such a sudden call and have they outer clothes handy so that in a incredibly brief space of time all of the boy manage to get something on then steve snatch up he marlin gun obe have already do the same with he rifle so that when the latter flung wide the door and they troop forth they be in a condition to do battle if necessary and at least strike terror into the heart of any skulk marauder max wise general that he be have think of something very essential to they success this be nothing more or less than a lantern they have be thoughtful enough to fetch one along a clever little contraption that take only a small amount of room and yet afford considerable light besides obed possess a lantern of the ordinary type together with a plentiful supply of oil look to the long winter evening when he might want to read in order to pass away some of the spare time that promise to drag heavily on he hand so they pour forth the cry still continue and as vociferous as ever indeed if anything there be a wilder strain to they now as though the fellow who give utterance to the shout might be get sorely alarm at he strange condition and fear the worst there be no trouble about decide which way to go even if they do not have obe to serve as guide and pilot the expedition they could easily have follow the loud note of alarm everybody be more or less excite from obe down to max himself and small wonder when the fact of they be arouse in the dead of the night by this fierce racket be take into consideration hastening in this manner toward the spot where the first trap have be set they speedily discover that the overhang tree bear strange fruit something grotesque be swing violently back and forth it be a human figure but hardly recognizable as such on account of the fact that it now hung head downward with one leg firmly grip by the tenacious slip-noose and the other together with a pair of wildly flung arm cut all sort of eccentric circle through the air never in all they varied experience have max and he three comrade look on a more remarkable spectacle than the one by which they be now greet the man 's face could not be plainly see on account of he coat sag down partly over he head so they could not immediately tell what he look like but he certainly possess a bull-like voice that properly train for opera use might have win he a fair amount of fame and money for it be more than usually lusty he seem to divine the fact that those in the cabin must have rush out in answer to he shout perhaps he detect the light they carry with they or it might be steve 's loud cry catch he strained hearing at such time as he own breath temporarily fail he help I somebody why do not yuh i be strangle to death i tell yuh all the blood 's run to my head i be see a million star already and i 'll _ die _ if yuh do not cut I down hurry hurry please do somebody obe look to max to say what ought to be do for already he seem to have come under the magical sway of the other 's leadership take hold of he and tie he hand behind he back before you think to let he down be the sensible advice give by max thereupon obe instantly produce some heavy cord and start operation while the boy deftly work the man continue to plead try to claw at he also but obe manage to get he job complete notwithstanding the interruption he be at the same time tell the unfortunate man to keep quiet and he would be let down presently steve stand by gun in hand he be cast uneasy look around as though suspect that if the fellow have companion near by as seem likely and they should recover from they alarm attempt he rescue it might be he duty to stand they off one and collectively bandy-leg and toby spring to where the man dangle max be already at the side of obe all ready obe he be hear to say i have splice he hand up in good style max come the reply good enough now toby and bandy-leg take hold of he and lift when i give you the word i 'll slip the rope off he ankle and you turn he right side up now go to it both of you -- yo-heave-o it be quickly do and the man upon find himself place once more on he foot stagger indeed he be so groggy after he recent strange experience at swimming in thin air that only for the support arm of max he would have fall flat the latter allow he to stagger backward until he lean against the body of the tree under which the novel man-trap have be arrange he be breathe hard but seem to be recover from he panic at least he cry have utterly cease which be one good thing so max flash the light into he face while obed lean forward and eagerly stare hard at he they see rough lineament seam and harden by exposure to the element but of course the face be that of a utter stranger to max as for obe he be hear to give a _ sigh _ of disappointment as though he too have fail to recognize any one whom he have reason to know the man by now seem to have recover in part he be look at the boy in a peculiar way max could not decide on the spur of the moment whether it be wonder or shrewdness that he see there as the predominant trait of the man 's feature but at any rate since he have recover he breath to some extent he should be capable of speak and explain how it come about he find himself in such a predicament well who be you anyway demand max throw as much sternness into he voice as he could give a account of yourself and tell we why you be creep about here like a thief in the night what I a thief shrill the man as though again excite by the very idea of such a base accusation i never have that name young feller they that know jake storm say he be a honest man if ever there be one i be only a guide and a trapper but nobody ever yet catch I thievin ' or poachin ' i would have yuh know where 's you home jake storm continue max if yuh mean whar do i hang out it be this way explain the other last summer i be up at paul smith 's place workin ' for the hotel i hear some tall story about the country around old mount tom how full of fur animal it be and so i make up my mind to spend the winter hereabouts i build I a cabin away up on the other side of the mountain and be agoin ' to start settin ' my trap when i get word that a gentleman want I to come down to lathrop and git he yuh see he doctor advise that he spend the winter in the mountain and he think of I beca ` se we would be in the wood a heap of time in past year so i be headin ' for lathrop by a trail i would run across that take around the mountain and meanin ' to keep on as long as i could durin ' the night when all at once something fly up and hit I ker-slap say i think it be a earthquake sure i do and then i find myself hangin ' upside down with all the blood runnin ' into my head what be it mean young feller i give yuh my word i do not get the hang o ' it at all max be not surprise to hear the man speak in this fashion he have already make up he mind after that one good look at the other 's face the prisoner of the barrel trap be a pretty slick article as steve would have express it and catch in the act as he have be it be to be expect that the fellow would have some kind of reasonable story to spin in order to explain he presence there all the same max do not give the yarn the least credence something tell he the other be deliberately lie and the fluency with which he deliver that remarkable story announce the self-named jake storm a accomplished fakir if ever there be one so max while not wish to deliberately tell the man to he face that he be a prevaricator set about catch he in a little trap the other have also hear the explanation give and be listen with puzzle look on they face at least bandy-leg and steve and toby be but obe be shake he head energetically as though he put no faith in fairy tale especially when come from such unworthy lip you say you be all alone do not you demand max why yes ` course i be splutter the other uneasily eye the speaker who be hold he light so that it shine directly on jake 's still flush face then what do you shout so loud for if you do not expect any one to come to you assistance continue max oh say yuh see ` course i knowed thar be _ somebody _ around i would just discover sign of a camp and sniff smoke but before i have half a chance to make out what it mean why something grab I by the leg and throw I up like i be agoin ' over the treetop who would not a yell tell I i own up i be rattle like everything anybody would be would not they i could not understand it all and right now i be still agropin ' in the dark what strike I and why do ye set such trap in the trail over on this side o ' mount tom be not the wood free for anybody to walk in what have i ever do to any o ' yuh to be treat like this and have my head nigh jerk from my body tell I that sonny max do not answer he question while the explanation might seem to be fairly plausible he feel positive the man be tell a downright lie and max believe he know a easy way to prove it watch he obe steve he say to those who be alongside never fear about that max snap out steve i have get he cover with my gun and if he try any slick game he name will be denni and not jake hear that mr fur thief do you well mind how you tempt I to let fly with a charge of birdshot i have get a quick temper and a quicker finger in the bargain so settle back where you be the man mutter between he set tooth he be evidently feel far from comfortable because something tell he these wideawake lad would not be so easily hoodwink as he have fancy he be watch the movement of max hasting who have drop to he hand and knee and seem to be hold he little lantern so that the light would show he the nature of the ground truth to tell max and obe when last at the trap have take the pain to smooth the ground over thus obliterate all previous footprint this be do from a double object it would conceal the fact that work have be carry on in that particular spot in case sharp eye be on the alert and also give a clear field for observation as be happen just then max quickly find what he be look for come here obe he remark quietly and as the other eagerly bent over max go on to say : you can see that here 's another footprint and quite different from the one make by he heavier boot so he _ do _ have at least one companion along perhaps two for all we know and that stamp he story a yarn make out of whole cloth he come here just as you expect to rob you of you fox kill they would not have fill the bill so well unless they make off with the pelt in the bargain how about it obe every word you say be true max breathe the other indignantly then we 'll certainly not let he go free that be a dead sure proposition venture max decidedly and in a voice that he mean should reach the prisoner glad to hear you settle it that way boy remark steve who have keep one eye on the prisoner and the other in the direction of he mate shall i march he over to the cabin right away max give a look around he wonder where that other man could be just then and whether he be watch they from some neighbor covert have by degree recover from the near panic into which he have be throw at the time he companion be snatch away from he side so mysteriously amidst a tremendous din cause by the shout of the seize man and the rattle of the stone inside the roll barrel but he could see nothing the little lantern only cover a certain amount of space with its meager illumination and much that be evil might lurk beyond the radius of its light circle yes we 'll change we base and go back to the cabin max say aloud keep the gun ready for business and if a attack be make shoot straight of course this admonition be deliver in a loud tone mostly to warn the unseen party who might be hover near but both gun-bearer give evidence of mean to profit by the advice chapter xii the tap on the cabin wall once more they be inside the cabin obe be look at the man again as though he believe the other be possess of certain information which he hope to obtain in turn max too be observe all these thing with considerable interest if the smile that appear on he face from time to time signify anything but he be study obe even more than he seem to pay attention to the man they have find turn upside down in the tree well one of you clever trap work like a charm obe steve be say and doubtless meaning to compliment the fur farmer but now that they know we be on to they be around it be hardly likely we 'll catch another victim tonight all the same something ought to be do to protect the fox pack that be easily arrange remark max we 'll follow out the plan we talk over two have better stand guard at a time and for several hour they can be relieve by another couple and in this way the balance of the night will be pass over those on duty be to carry the gun and with order to challenge any move thing that come along the man have make no resistance when order to fall in line and accompany he captor to the cabin under the pine once inside he have glance casually around but max notice that he do not seem greatly interested from this he guess that perhaps the other may have see the interior of the lodge before max remember obed tell they that some one have certainly be prowl about in he cabin at the time he be away though evidently frighten off by he return before have a chance to do any damage he be not look at these thing so strange to a ordinary cabin in the wood for the first time be what max be tell himself and consequently he heart harden toward the fellow have previously arrange all about signal that could be give in case of necessity there be now little more to be say of course steve have to be count on as one of the pair to be first place on duty he would have be mortally offend have max fail to honor he with this exhibition of trust then bandy-legs offer to share he vigil and steve eagerly accept the proposal take obe 's gun bandy-leg say max and remember what i tell you about use it shoot low so as to fill they leg full of lead if you have to fire at all and listen to we shout as we join you for we do not want a warm reception from we friend get that both of you steve and he fellow sentry admit that they understand what they direction be to be then they go out the man have be intently watch all these thing as though deeply interested since max have find the second series of footprint and thus prove the falsity of he claim of be alone jake storm so-called wood guide and trapper of fur-bearing animal have relapse into a sullen silence of course he know that the game for he be up so far as attempt to deceive these wide-awake boy be concerned max wonder what thought be teem through the brain of the man as he sit there on the bench before the fire and listen to what pass between he captor as for obe he cast many eager look in the direction of the big fellow and from the expression on he face max believe he must be slowly make up he mind toward some move therefore he be not much surprised to finally see the wood boy sit down alongside the man who turn a inquire face toward he there be also a tightening of the muscle around he mouth just as though he suspect he be about to be put to a severe test and would have to gather he wit in order not to make a false move look here jake storm as you say you name be commence obed once more either forget to speak in he usual wood dialect or not think it worth while to bother with it any longer i want to make you a proposition do you understand what a nice pickle you have get yourself into by prowl around my fur farm and evidently try to steal my silver black fox if we take you down to the nearest adirondack town it mean you 'll likely enough be send up as a thief how would you like that tell I huh guess jake storm ' get a reputation that would kerry he through all right sonny mutter the big man but max could see that he squirm uneasily likewise obe must have guess the truth also as he next remark prove a reputation may be one way or the other jake storm if that be really you name which i doubt very much perhaps some people might be glad to see you again for one i do not believe for a single minute that you be a trapper or that you ever work for paul smith who know the kind of man he have around he hotel too well to hire a thief i be as sure as i draw breath that you come here to steal my black yes and that you be _ hire _ to do this by another party what be the sum of money he promise you jake if you be successful and be he around here with you the man make no reply though various expressive change take place in the look on he face so obe after wait several minute to hear what the other might choose to say go on i say before that if we take you down to lathrop you 'll be lock up and when court be in session place on trial charge with attempt robbery you picture will be take and send broadcast to every city so if you be want for anything big the authority will know just where to find you that may not be pleasant for you to hear jake but it be what i mean to have do there be only one way you can escape it do you want to hear what that way be yuh be away off the track young feller blurt the man obstinately shake he head in a contrary way i be not do nawthin ' to make I askeered o ' the law officer jake storm be my name all right too and i be meanin ' to trap over on the cranberry creek section and i be on my way down to lathrop right now to meet a mr jasper who 'll vouch for my character sure he will but go ahead and say what yuh mean to boy it will not do I any harm to hear it i reckon this be the chance you 'll have to get scot free and the only chance say obed solemnly tell I who hire you to rob my fur farm and not leave a single black in the burrow and i 'll let you go free will you take my offer or risk a prison sentence jake the man hesitate that alone be enough to convince max that he be guilty for undoubtedly he must be weigh in the balance obe 's offer with the possibility of make he escape through the assistance of companion be not get nawthin ' to say boy he finally growl as though make up he mind obe start up and hasten over to a desk at one end of the room he hurriedly search through a drawer until he find what he be look for after which he again sit down beside the man with the tie hand it be a photograph which he hold up before the prisoner and max could see it be a man 's face on the card look at that jake storm and tell I do _ he _ put it into you head to come up here and clean my enclosure out so as to rob I of the work of nearly two year the man start when he allow he eye to fall upon the face on the card but recover he nerve instantly he laugh harshly and hurriedly snap : i tell yuh it be on the wrong track yuh be boy why i never set eye on such a person as that thar he be a utter stranger to I and i do not know he from adam and i want to warn yuh that i 'll turn around and have the law on yuh for playin ' such a low-down trick on a honest man just passin ' along through the wood and never thinkin ' no harm to a single soul i demand that yuh turn I loose to go my way the wood be free as the air to everybody that be the law further than that i be not get nawthin ' to say obe be plainly chagrin as max could see he evidently hope to obtain some valuable information from this man but it seem jake still cling to the hope that he might obtain he freedom without betray secret max take advantage of obed 's absent-mindedness for a minute or so manage to lean slightly forward and obtain a good look at the photograph it be that of a young man perhaps thirty year of age max be strike with the fact that the photograph certainly bear some little resemblance to obe himself and one could easily believe they must be relate in some way which accord to obe 's former recital of he widely flung family would make the other a grime also the wood boy look at the man several time as though wonder whether it would pay to make any further offer as a inducement to the other to betray the confidence of he employer but either obe do not have the ready cash to offer a bribe or else he deem it not worth while after the fellow have show such a stubborn disposition for presently he give a sigh and go back to return the photograph to the little desk once doubtless mr coomb ' property toby be nod before the fire and really pay very little attention to what be go on in fact he mean to crawl into he bunk shortly so as to get a little more sleep before be call upon to take he turn outside as sentry toby not have have he suspicion concern obed arouse at any time fail to take the same interest in the matter that steve for instance would have do have he be present i hope yuh do not mean to make I set here on this bench all night with my hand tie behind I so cruel like remark the man presently apply he word directly toward max as though he too have long ago discover how that energetic young chap seem to be the boss of the ranch why no we do not mean to be at all cruel return the other here 's a extra blanket you can have i 'll lay it out for you on the floor and you can drop down just when you please but do not expect that we be mean to unfasten you wrist jake we know a thing or two and we be expect to take you down to lathrop tomorrow to land you behind the bar you have have you chance to squeal and get off scot-free i doubt if another come you way he do just as he say spread the blanket so the man could manage to roll over and cover himself with its fold this jake presently accomplished max also notice how he lay with he foot against the outer wall of the lodge and wonder at it though without any clear idea that this have any positive significance but time be to tell toby have creep into he cell which be what bandy-leg have dub the several bunk build in the wall of the lodge so as to conserve room and not be in the way during the daytime max on he part do not mean to follow suit he think it would hardly pay to try and snatch a hour 's restless sleep when so much be go on around they and then besides he do not trust the prisoner wholly believe it would be just as well to keep a eye on he outside all seem as usual it be long after midnight now and if one listen carefully he could catch the customary noise of the wood at such a time from the soft crooning of the breeze as it sigh through the pine top to the occasional note of some night-bird call to its mate or the plaintive voice of a hungry young coon wait impatiently the return of its forage mother obe have throw himself down on the cot but max know he do not expect to lose himself in slumber several time he see the wood boy raise he head and look in the direction of the sprawl figure of the man under the spare blanket obe be undoubtedly think still of way whereby he might force a confession from the lip of the stubborn man apparently he seem to be intensely interested in discover whether there be a power behind this raid on he enterprise max remember some thing he have hear begin to believe he could see light in the darkness now and from the way in which he chuckle to himself every little while it might be judge that he thought be agreeable on the whole surely a whole hour and more must have pass since steve and bandy-leg start out to assume they duty as guard over the fox farm thus far nothing have be hear from the vidette who be undoubtedly carry out they order to the best of they ability max suddenly become aware that certain low sound come to he ear at first he think some branch of a tree must be tap the low eaves of the cabin be stir to and fro by the breeze as he listen further however it strike max that there be a strange continuity about the sound they seem to come in little fragment with a brief hush between the boy be instantly remind of certain experience he himself have have in use a telegraph key while send a message over the wire or listen to the sounder rattle off one from some distant point rude and uncouth though the dot and dash be max quickly find that he could make out a positive word and it be the significant one of free gently he manage to turn he head in the direction of the spot where the man have lie down he still seem to be sprawl there under the blanket a movement catch the eye of max and he see obed hold up a finger at he in mute warning thrill by a sense of impend tragedy perhaps max watch the wood boy slowly but constantly make toward he obe move with the noiseless nature of a black snake creep over the ground he footfall be so light that even a trained ear could not have detect they he keep on toward max until soon he have manage to reach the other 's side still those plain tap continue to sound in regular rotation first come from the outside and then closer max believe the man on the floor be make use of he shoe to send a message call for help and that some unknown party outside be give he word of hope but obe have now gain he side and mean to whisper something in he ear so max prepare to pay full attention at the same time he glance toward the door apprehensively and be please to discover that just as he believe have be the case the bar be in position so that entry could not be make by any enemy from without chapter xiii obe learn something there be something brooding obed whisper the first thing and then continue by say : what be those queer little tap max i be sure he have something to do with they he be tap the toe of he boot against the wall to send a message explain the other they be use the telegraphic code i read the one word ` free ' so you see there be some one outside the cabin and they be hatch up a scheme to get he loose obed grow very much excite he look toward the door as though incline to immediately issue forth and investigate max think the hope of capture another prisoner be the lure that tempt he on but what could have happen to steve and bandy-leg whisper the wood boy as though suddenly remember the pair suppose to be stand guard out there nothing have happen to they depend on it reply max but this fellow must have be slippery enough to get by they and reach the cabin that be all oh do not you think we might manage it some way or other begged obed vague though he question may have be max have no difficulty whatever in understand what he mean he own thought be already range in the same quarter and he could supply all the miss word obe be hope that by suddenly issue forth they might take the creeper by surprise and effect he capture such a possibility apparently give the wood boy considerable pleasure even in the anticipation max glance again towards the door they could creep noiselessly over in that direction while the man on the floor and he friend without continue they singular exchange of signal remove the bar from its place and open the door dash out to take the stoop fellow by surprise but then three would be better than two in such a adventure there be toby jucklin a stout fellow and usually well prime for anything that smack of excitement and peril he must be awaken and enlist in the game so max hold up a warning finger and stoop low again whisper : i 'll get toby wait by the door for we do not dream of go out until we join you with that he silently slip over to the opening in the wall occupy by the sleep toby jucklin the latter be easily arouse and when max whisper a word of caution in he ear he know enough not to cry out though of course the blood must have start bound like mad through he artery indeed it be a most singular thing to be arouse from sound sleep by be tell that danger hover over they head and that it would be necessary for the three of they to sally forth so as to surprise the enemy at work toby be game however he vocal cord might play trick with he frequently and give he heap of trouble but when it be a matter of action toby take nobody 's dust as he often boast obe have meanwhile manage to creep over to the door where he impatiently await the come of the other two the strange tap sound continue and evidently the man lie there under the blanket have become so deeply interested in what he be try to communicate or receive that so far he have fail to discover there be any movement in the cabin of course all of the boy be quiver with half-suppressed excitement though grimly determine to put they plan into operation obe have already reach up and take hold of the bar so as to be ready to remove it when join by he companion keep the bar whisper max it will make a fine club obe say when max come back from the tightly compress lip of the wood boy whose eye could be see glitter eagerly in the firelight open up max tell he perhaps the door may have make some creaking sound on be draw back either that or else the man chance to free he head from the muffle fold of the blanket just then and discover what be go on he give a shout of warning and the three boy shoot through the opening at the same instant max lead the way he have carefully note the location of the sound and judge that the interloper must be somewhere close to the wall where jake storm lay so it be in that direction he leap the star wear shine brightly above besides this a certain amount of light manage to come through that small window of the lodge and help to partially dispel the gloom without there he be cry obe as they turn the corner and discover a figure in the act of scramble erect pell-mell the trio rush at the unknown who just manage to gain a footing when he find himself furiously beset there be a tremendous struggle the man seem savage at the thought of be catch and strike furious blow toby at one time manage to cling to the other 's back for a brief moment but be dislodge by a clever fling that send he crash against a tree and make he grunt like a hog that receive a jolt one thing certain max could easily see that the party they be attack must be something of a athlete from the way in which he fight it be not easy to resist the assault of three enemy at once since they may attack from as many direction and confuse he defense still the way this man strike out dodge tear himself free from they clinging hand and conduct himself in general surprised max very much indeed this keep up for almost two full minute with vary fortune sometimes it appear as though they be get the upper hand of the unknown and then by a furious effort he would break free again only to be once more clutch in the midst of the fracas loud shout close at hand tell that steve and bandy-leg have hear the row be rush hurriedly to the spot astonish beyond measure at the racket the man must have hear they cry and the fact that he enemy be about to receive reinforcement seem to give he the strength of desperation for he suddenly tear himself free from max leave he coat in the hand of the boy oh he be go gasp obe almost entirely out of breath because of he recent tremendous exertion for a fact the man have vanish almost as though the ground have open and swallow he up even astute max hardly know which way to look for he then come the other pair rush up and demand to know what all the row be about as soon as he could recover he breath max try to explain he have to repeat it twice however before bandy-leg could grasp the astounding fact that some one have actually be carry on a telegraphic conversation with they prisoner tap on the wall of the cabin to spell out the word say you be string we i expect boy explode the doubter it sound just like a fairy story to I but then there _ be _ some one here because we glimpse he disappear like a fall star i want to give he a shot but i remember what max here say about shooting when in doubt and we do not just know but what it might be one of you but max he get away after all continue the disappointed obe as though to he mind that event overshadow all other and i do want to find out if it be any one i know i believe it be on my soul for at college he always have the reputation of be a all-round athlete huh grunt toby rub he head ruefully as he come up and limp in the bargain t-t-that be he all r-r-right then obe i do not know the f-f-fellow 's n-n-name but i have g-g-got he trade-mark on my c-c-cheek every k-k-knuckle of he fist huh he be a athlete every time but do not tell I we prisoner skip out cry steve in sore dismay not that we know of unless he be go since we dash from the cabin max inform he and as we can not accomplish anything standing here suppose we adjourn to the inside again toby will want a little soothing salve on he bruise and i have get a sore hand myself where i strike he harder than i mean to on the back of he head it be too bad too bad mourn obed follow the other toward the open door such a splendid chance may not come again and i would like to know i certainly would when they enter the cabin the first thing all of they do be to look eagerly to see if the man still lay there upon find that he have not try to escape during all the excitement possibly be afraid he be fire on they feel relieved anyhow we have still get he safe and sound declare steve exultantly and he may make up he mind to tell yet remark obed pick up fresh hope when he find that i mean all i say and that he be on the road to prison the man glower at they though apparently he seem fairly well pleased to find that they have not succeed in capture he ally max await development he be satisfy with the way thing be go and deep down in he heart believe the thrilling announcement he be store up with which to startle he three chum would not now be long delay i s ` pose we ought to go out again and resume we watch suggest steve after a short time have elapse it be too soon for a change and after all that excitement none of we feel a bit sleepy as for I venture bandy-leg i be that wide awake i feel as if i never could go to sleep again while we be up here in the mountain where such queer thing keep on happen right along s-s-say i be s-s-sorry for obed ventured toby who it seem have hear the lament of the wood boy and could sympathize with he he have h-h-hope to g-g-get a pointer by g-g-grabbing that streak of g-g-greased lightning but after all the fellow be too much for the whole b-b-bunch of we but it be make I feel pretty sure now say obe brighten up perceptibly that i know who be to blame for all this trouble i have a hint about it before you remember i tell you boy and while he keep he face hidden pretty much all the time he fight i surely hear he say something that strike I as familiar he be not a stranger i be certain of that well say max quietly perhaps there may be a way to prove that please tell I how max plead obed eagerly the mysterious stranger manage to get away chuckle the other but he be not so clever about take all he wardrobe along with he you remember oh he coat cry obe in thrilling accent i hang on to that like a leech now laugh max of course i should have be smart enough to keep my finger on the man inside but he have a slick way of just slip out of the coat first thing i know he be go leave I hold the bag as they say want to take a look at that article do not you obe sometimes man have a fashion of keep letter and document in they coat pocket and between we i believe you 'll find something like that here with these word the speaker take up the coat he have tear from the back of the unknown and toss it carelessly toward obe the wood boy snatch at the garment eagerly newly arouse hope could be see upon he face everybody watch to see what the outcome might turn out to be steve and bandy-legs ready to withdraw from the circle and resume they outside vigil stay they departure for a brief period in order to satisfy they curiosity even the so-called jake storm have he fishy eye fix on obe as though it matter something to he whether the latter learn the answer to the conundrum or be oblige to let it pass by unsolved so obed upon receive the coat proceed to ram a eager hand into the pocket one after another when he reach a inside one he find a bonanza just as max have anticipate there be some papers there as well as a bill book bend down nearer the fire so that he might the better see obed glue he eye on he find a few seconds pass the fire crackle as it begin to eat into the fresh fuel that have be toss to the red ember upon the incoming of the party toby grunt once or twice and continue to ruefully rub the side of he head he right arm one of he thigh and in fact as much of he entire person as he could conveniently cover in a short space of time then obe be hear to give a low exclamation he whole manner be a singular mixture of satisfaction and anger evidently he have accomplish he set purpose and the result have arouse conflict emotion within he breast well have you find out who the man be obed ask steve unable to curb he burn curiosity yes there be no longer any question about it return the other bitterly for here be letter address to he i may even take the privilege of read they tomorrow for in that way i can perhaps discover some evidence that will force he to stop this ugly business oh the meanness of robert to strike this cowardly blow at I he own cousin he be a disgrace to the whole family pity the poor grimese exclaim max look straight at obe with such a queer expression on he face that presently the wood boy could not keep from burst into a laugh max you be on to I i can see he cry rush up to the other and hold out he hand eagerly i have guess for some time that you have you suspicion and now i know it be so and max too throw back he head to indulge in a good laugh while steve toby and bandy-leg with month agape and eye that be as round as saucer simply gather around ' and stare at the two who be shake hand hey what be all this about i want to know spluttered steve just as though he mean to say that no one have any business to have secret from the rest looky here obe since when do you forget that grime wood lingo you have be give we right along i be begin to smell a rat that be what i be chapter xiv a big surprise evidently steve be commence to get on the scent of the explanation of the mystery but as for toby and bandy-leg they find themselves up against a blank wall for aught they could see instead of try to explain obed turn to max say meekly : you tell they please wax it be only you due after solve the puzzle as nearly as you have i see you turn back to that book again and scan my initial in the front that be why you ask I if mr coomb ' first name have be robert when it be not but it be all right and i be satisfied i have my peek of fun out of it let I tell you now introduce I to you chum max with the greatest of pleasure laugh the other as he take hold of obed and wave in a ceremonious fashion with the other hand he continue : friend toby and bandy-leg allow I to present some one to you whom you 'll be delighted to know -- _ this be roland chase _ bandy-leg stand as if rivet to the spot stare and hold he very breath through astonishment toby jucklin want to express he amazement and also he ecstatic delight over the wonderful outcome of they mission but alack and alas as so often happen with toby while the spirit be willing the flesh be lamentably weak and he could not make a sound except a sort of spluttering gasp while he eye blink and he face grow rosy red still laugh the so-called grime ' boy proceed to grip hand with he guest he act as though it might be a simon-pure introduction as it certainly be in one sense i be ashamed of the way i bamboozled you fine fellow and that be the honest truth he start to say but on the impulse of the moment i thought of that obe grime name and once i give it to you i have to follow up with the lingo i guess i get ball up more than once for max soon discover that i do not always speak as a true grime should and that give he he clue yes i be the same roland you start out to find just to please my dear old aunt bless she heart i be plan to surprise they all by appear in town with my five thousand dollar after i would sell the fox cub and then claim my share of uncle 's estate i guess it be all get plain enough to you now eh fellow bandy-leg could speak at last why it be as plain as the nose on my face obe -- i beg pardon roland and i can never forgive myself for be so easily take in and do for so you think to invest you two thousand dollar in start a silver-black fox farm do you well it be a daring venture and i hardly think you would have make the game if you have not be lucky enough to meet up with that splendid mr coomb that be a certainty bandy-leg admit the other who apparently be not at all give to boast over he achievement yes i be in great luck to be able to do mr coomb a favor and win he for a friend see what he be do for I but all the same i invest my money in this business and accord to we partnership agreement i be to have one-half the proceeds of any sale so there can be no slip of the law to beat I out of my inheritance if only i can get those precious pup to the man who be engage they and this rascal you call robert -- be he the elder cousin who would profit by you failure to win out ' ask max although he already understand that this must be true the expressive face of they new friend cloud immediately i be sorry to say that it be so max he admit those envelope of the letter i find in he coat give it away the temptation be too great for robert who always show considerable jealousy because we uncle rather favor I and so when he learn in some fashion i be sure i do not know how that i be in a fair way of carry out the provision of uncle 's will he must have determine to try and spoil my plan oh the cur snap the indignant steve now see the depravity of the miserable plotter in full i be glad that some of you manage to give he a few good lick before he break away and i 'll regret it to the last day of my life that i do not get a chance to show he and b-b-believe I exclaimed toby with a violent effort he be go to carry the scratch i g-g-gave he on he f-f-face for a w-w-while if i would know that he be roland 's c-c-cousin i would have dig a h-h-heap d-d-deeper too i be only hope roland as we must call he after this since he drop the grime family when he admit he identity say this will teach he a lesson and that he 'll leave I alone from now on but robert be a terribly persistent fellow and i be afraid he failure may only spur he on to try again never mind roland say steve dwelling almost affectionately on the name now that he know the one who claim it we be go to stand back of you through thick and thin if those fox pup do not eventually get to they prospective purchaser we 'll have to know the reason why be not that so fellow my sentiment exactly say max promptly I too exclaim toby ditto here add bandy-leg i want to say this observe roland with a suspicious moisture in he fine eye it be the luckiest hour of my life when i run across this bunch of royal good fellow why only for you i would as like as not have be _ ruin _ because alone and single-handed i never could have stand out against two clever and unscrupulous schemer and i 'll never forget it as long as i draw breath there 'll be some people mighty sorry though i bet you bandy-legs hasten to add as he look roguishly at roland by which i mean those poor grimese who have lose tonight the brightest star in the whole big grime constellation why i can just picture how they 'll all mourn -- uncle hiram uncle sila uncle nicodemus and all those other uncle and aunt with old granddaddy grime weep harder than any of the rest over the bereavement for obe be no longer in the flesh the comical way in which bandy-leg say this cause a general laugh why even the wonder prisoner on the floor who of course could hardly understand the joke have to grin at the humorous expression on the boy 's face oh i guess they 'll be able to stand it if i can venture roland please do not bear I any malice fellow for have my little joke you see i use to be quite a hand for such thing but live all alone up here do not give I much of a opportunity to try any prank and so i be just ache for a turn it do not do any harm and afford I some fun so please forget it but roland none of that story you tell we about you good friend mr coomb be make up of course ask steve that be every word of it true come the quick answer oh he be the finest old gentleman you ever hear about i grow very fond of he and when i receive word in a letter from he housekeeper that he have die shortly after he wife go it break I all up i moped around here for a whole week and come near throw the entire job up then i remember how he have always put such confidence in everything i attempt and so i just shut my tooth tighter together and say i would go through with it or know the reason why and i have for i be on the point of success if only that robert do not upset the fat in the fire at the last hour well he will not you can just depend on that say bandy-leg almost fiercely here be four standby who be book to gather around and see that you get the fox pup to market next time robert come where he be not want he may get a broken head or something just as bad for now we know he ugly game we be not apt to be over particular how hard we hit all of which must have be very comforting to the boy who have take such a big load upon he young shoulder in the effort to show what he be make of after all perhaps the eccentric uncle who leave such a strange provision in he will know human nature better than most people do for he have pick out the very thing calculate to spur a chap like roland to do he best well remark max since we have cast off the numerous grime tribe and discover the one we be in search of and as the hour be get fearfully late suppose we postpone further talk until morning there remain a few hour to be utilize in sleep steve you and bandy-leg have not fill out you time as sentry yet suppose you hold for another hour and then turn it over to I just as you say max reply the other i mean to propose that anyway for the alarm break out in the middle of we watch secretly i would like mr robert to take he courage in both fist and sneak back this way bent on further mischief do you ask I why well i would delight to make use of my scatter-gun and let he have a mess of number ten shot at say sixty yard they would pepper he good and plenty at that distance without actually endanger he miserable life max know the energetic nature of the speaker warn he against be too prompt at use he gun better go slow about that steve he remark many a fellow have be shoot by mistake every season dozen fall victim to hunter who see something move and blaze away recklessly it might be one of we for all you would know so do not think of firing without give we signal steve solemnly promise to remember he know the danger of handle firearm in a reckless fashion and be not likely to offend so presently with bandy-leg in tow he go forth to resume they interrupted vigil max and roland sit there by the resurrect fire for a short time exchange remark the prisoner lay on the floor and as far as they could tell seem to have give up all hope of a rescue for he heavy breathing be that of one whom sleep have overtake finally max point toward toby who could be see lie on he back in he bunk and evidently enjoy a fine time in dreamland we would do well to imitate he example roland he remark and as a last word i want to tell you again how delighted we all be over finding you not only that but discover that you have be busy all these month you aunt be worry she head off about you the last word she say be : ` if only you do find the boy and he be make a mess of he attempt to win he inheritance tell he aunt sarah have a place in she heart for he and that if only he 'll come back he can be she boy for keep because i find that i have grow to love he as my own ' roland appear to be deeply affect when he hear this for he wink violently a good many time and then smile manage to say : you do not know how happy you make I when you tell that max for she be a dear old soul and i certainly do care for she a great deal but it please I also to know i have make good and that i can hold up my head when i show those trustee what i have do the chase family need not blush just yet on account of roland though it ought to for robert 's mean action so they too seek they bed such as these be and try to forget all else in sweet sleep max have a peculiar habit almost any boy can acquire it through much practice and sometimes it come in very handy he be able to impress it upon he mind that he want to awaken at about a certain time once in a long while this might fail he but nine time out of ten he could hit it in a most surprising manner many person have prove this perfectly feasible and although max begin it as a experiment of the control of mind over matter it have long since pass that stage and become a regular habit with he accordingly in just a hour after steve and bandy-leg have go forth again max be out of he bunk and arouse toby who get up rather loth to abandon he good bed and pleasant dream still he make no complaint unless he frequent yawn could be count as such but trot at the heel of max when the other start forth the night remain calm high overhead the gentle breeze still sigh among the pine and whisper secret as it pass through the fragrant green needle with they attendant cone max take a single glance aloft at the star-studded heaven and this tell he pretty close on the hour for in addition to many other way of the forest nomad and believer in woodcraft max have master the position of the planet so that it be always possible for he to gauge the passage of time when the night grant he a survey of the constellation above when he and bandy-leg have advance a certain distance max stop and imitate the call of a screech-owl so like the whinny of a horse it end up with a peculiar twist and it be this that would tell any of the other fellow the sound be intend for a signal and do not proceed from the real bird itself a answer quickly come then a couple of dim form heave in sight be steve and he fellow vidette ready to hand over the gun to they successor and seek the shelter of the cabin for a little rest listen max say steve while this exchange be take place there be something queer out yonder away and i want you to try and make out what it can mean how be that demand the other why every little while we think we could hear a distant strange cry like somebody in pain of course it might come from a night-bird that we do not happen to be acquaint with but it be be worry we a heap i be afraid though the wind have shift latterly because we do not seem to catch it so well max hardly know what to think of what steve have tell he nevertheless he promise the other he and toby would listen for all they be worth and see if they might have any better success in recognize the strange sound but the minute drift along and at no time be they able to catch anything out of the common so finally they decide that either it must have be a night-bird that have fly away or else that change in the wind have keep the sound from come to they ear chapter xv steve 's dream come true do you hear anything max that be the very first thing steve ask on the follow morning when he poke he head out of he hole in the wall like a shrewd old tortoise look around to learn if the coast be clear we listen from time to time explain max but be never sure that we hear any strange sound it seem that you must have be impress with it considerably steve to have it on you mind so i be max and i be right now admit the other frankly listen to I while the rest be busy get breakfast ready over at the fire and he voice sink to a confidential whisper i have a dream it be not so queer that it should come to I after all that be happen i dream that we come on that bad cousin of roland 's robert chase he have fall over a precipice and be die there on the rock oh it be horribly real max and i wake up shiver he be sorry too because he have be so wicked and be ask roland to please forgive he and max i have be wonder whether that dream might not have come to I to let we know we might do a good deed if we walk out that way this morning you and I say nothing to the rest of the boy max be strike by the thought that steve must have have a pretty vivid dream to make he so tender-hearted at the same time he feel in accord with the sentiment so aptly express by the other steve i 'll go you there he hasten to say it can do no harm and may be a fine thing be you sure you know the direction fairly well yes because i be sharp enough to make a note of it last night max you see at the time the wind be come in a lazy sort of way right out of the west later on it swing around to the northwest which make it so sharp this morning good for you steve the other tell he then we 'll head direct into the west and cover the ground for say a mile come back over another route we can call out now and then so if any one hear we they might answer but you would better hurry and get you dud on because unless i be mistaken bandy-leg be mean to sing out that breakfast 's ready and you know the last to the feast be penalize when the supply run short no danger of that happen when bandy-leg have anything to do with the cooking chuckle steve confidently which remark prove how well those four chum know one another 's weak point of course at breakfast most of the conversation have to do with roland and he valiant attempt to make good he tell he new friend many thing that interest they exceedingly and which be connect with he struggle they question also bring they quite a fund of information concern the habit of fox and how those who aim to raise the valuable animal for the great london fur market go about the business as for I say bandy-leg who have be do considerable thinking while all this talk go on i mean to try and hunt up a few of those bouncer frog roland here say inhabit he marsh of course i know that at this time of year they be deep down in the mud and mean to lie there till spring thaw 'em out but it may be i can scare up just a mess i be awfully fond of frog ' leg you may remember boy they all wish he luck steve advise he to borrow a spade from the owner of the wood cabin for he might have to dig deep bandy-leg however only grin and show no sign of a change of mind for once he set he heart on a thing and he be apt to keep everlastingly at it until the realization that it be quite hopeless would compel he to throw up the sponge which bandy-leg always do with a bad grace so breakfast be finally finish and the boy separate true to he promise the would-be frog hunter set out valiantly on he errand urge by he love for a dainty dish toby have agree to assist roland look after he fox brood for there be many thing he do not yet understand concern they care and which he earnestly wish to know this arrangement quite suit steve and max for it leave they free to saunter forth they announce they intention of take a little look around steve of course pick up he gun before start say : you never know when you may want a shooting iron up in the wood there might be a old wildcat prowl around these digging which would take a dislike to the shape of my face so he would attack we and i be homely enough as it be right now without invite a cat to make the map of ireland over my phiz he and max show no sign of be in any unusual hurry as they leave the cabin they start directly toward the west and once out of sight of those leave behind steve quicken he pace a bit at least he chirk up and begin to show more animation a mile you say max do not you he ask why yes that ought to fully cover the distance come the reply i should not think you could have catch any ordinary sound even as far as that still when the night be calm it be wonderful how far even a groan will carry the atmosphere seem to be in a peculiar condition at such time and act as a splendid medium for convey sound they look to the right and to the leave as they advance nothing escape the eye of those two chum accustom to the great outdoors as they be and have long ago graduate in a knowledge of woodcraft some little time pass thus they have so far see and hear nothing calculate to impress they though steve be just as sure the sound he catch on the precede night must have be a human voice cry out in anguish doubtless that vivid dream be also make quite a impression on the mind of the boy for max find he unusually docile and thoughtful they have now go considerably over half a mile max feel that if any discovery be go to be make it must come very soon he raise he voice occasionally and give a half shout after which both of they would stand still and strain they hearing in hope of catch some answer hail squirrel bark at the intruder of they nut domain blue jay scream harshly as they flit from limb to limb among adjacent tree crow send forth many noisy caw from atop of some neighboring pine watch those move figure suspiciously the while and once a deer suddenly leap across the trail with a flip of its short tail to speedily vanish amidst the color foliage of some bush this last event cause steve to give a real yell he be so startled hardly have he do this than he grip the sleeve of he comrade do you hear that max be it a echo to my whoop or do somebody really call out in a weak voice anyway it seem to come from right over there and he point confidently as he speak max himself be of the same opinion for he feel almost certain that a human voice have try to attract they attention though possibly the person give utterance to the cry be so weak that he could not make much effort they change they course a little and head directly toward the region whence steve have point so positively when max hold the other up presently and call again all doubt be remove here this way i be in pretty bad shape i guess do not leave I please whoever you be i 'll pay you a hundred dollar to get I out of this scrape evidently the speaker whom max decide must be robert chase and no other suppose the person approach and whose voice he have hear must be wood guide who might consider themselves fortunate indeed to earn such a royal sum so easily two minute afterwards and the boy find he he must have fall into the hole while hurry through the forest after break away from the grip of the boy at the cabin he have be severely cut by a sharp flint-like rock and lose considerable blood which weaken he so that as he afterwards confess to they he must have swoon away and lain there for hour unaware of he perilous condition the two boy soon manage to get the young man up on level ground as often happen it be max who conceive the easiest way of do this to lift a dead weight of a hundred and fifty pound be no light task and so he start to break away one side of the pit thus raise the bottom of the interior until they be able to simply _ carry _ robert out of the hole steve be loud in he expression of admiration whoever else would have think up such a clever piece of business max but you he go on to say as they rest after they effort why if it would be I in charge now i reckon i would have go to all sort of trouble rig up some sort of block-and-tackle so as to hoist he up but you just knock down a part of the wall and there you be as neat as wax wherever do you learn that trick i want to know max you 'll laugh if i tell you chuckle the other one day in read about how some musty old professor be digging out all sort of weighty treasure belong to bygone day over in egypt i chance to learn how a certain arab contract to excavate a big stone weigh ever so many ton and which the learn savant could not see how they be ever go to get out of the deep hole well that arab just keep fill up the hole and lift the stone inch by inch when he finish there be no hole but the great rock stand on level ground and that steve they say be old-time mechanical engineering which have never be beat in these modern day the pyramid be build in that simple way human life and labor count for little in those old time all i can say be max it take you to apply whatever you read to work out you own problem but however be we go to get this man back to the cabin must we build a litter and carry he robert seem to be suffer from something more than physical anguish a tortured mind can stab even more keenly than painful bodily wound lie there and face possible death robert chase have evidently see a great light he beckon to the boy to bend over he and then in a weak voice go on to say : i do not know just how badly i be hurt young fellow but i do know that i be do with this miserable business i have get just what i deserve and it may be the best thing that ever happen to I during the time i lay here and have my sens i have make up my mind to ask my cousin roland to forgive I and let I make amends for the evil i have try to do i know now that it do not pay in the long run for i have come near lose all my self-respect yes get I to the camp if you can i want to face the music and have it over with something seem to tell I that the boy be not the one to hold a grudge against a chap who be be punish already for do a evil deed that sort of talk pleased max immensely he see that robert chase must have be have a terrible conflict between he better nature and the insatiate craving for wealth and now that a wise providence have step in to nip all he plot in the bud why thing begin to look very bright all around it be find that with one of the boy on either side robert could manage to walk fairly well although they often have to stop and let he rest it take they a full two hour to get back to the cabin where they arrival create considerable excitement at the moment roland be out somewhere attend to he pet and so the injured man be make as comfortable as possible by toby and bandy-leg the latter of whom have just come in carry a pretty fair mess of frog ' leg all dress for the frying-pan then when roland come along to be tell what have happen and how he cousin be anxious to see he alone he look actually please at the queer turn affair have take he go in and be with robert for quite a long time they must have have a good heart-to-heart talk for when roland appear again he be smile broadly and hasten to say : we have not only patch up a truce boy but make a enduring covenant after this there be not go to be any war in the chase family and now that robert have humble himself to confess he wrong-doing i believe we be go to be the best of friend i have promise he without he ask it that i 'll never tell a single soul about what happen up here you must agree to the same thing for my sake i feel sure you 'll all like robert when you get to know he who can tell muttered toby as if to himself in time we might even g-g-get _ familiar _ with he stranger thing than that have happen i only hope he will not hold a g-g-grudge against I when he see the mark of all my f-f-fingernail down he face just now toby he be not in a mood to bear anybody a grudge roland go on to say for he believe he do not get half that he merit but after all it be come out a thousand per cent better than i ever dream it would and when i start off with my pair of grown cub i need not be afraid of any one waylay I on the road all the same observe steve raise he heavy eyebrow suggestively we 'll see to it that you have plenty of company on the way since the object of we trip up here into the heart of the adirondack have be fulfil i rather reckon we 'll be want to go along with you to see the fox pup hand over and that lovely check receive afterwards we can all start for carson where you and you good old aunt may have a family reunion all to yourselve unless you see fit to invite uncle sephus uncle nicodemus uncle job or some of those old worthy to join with you so as to make thing hum they all laugh at steve 's humorous remark b-b-but what be to be d-d-done with this p-p-pretty thing demand toby point as he speak to they prisoner who be sit outside the door have one of he ankle hold fast with a trail rope so that he could not run away even if tempt to do so which consider he helpless condition with both hand tie behind he back he be hardly in the humor to do chapter xvi the fur farmer 's triumph -- conclusion while all this talk be go on the man have of course listen what he have just hear roland say about forgive he scheming cousin must have encourage the fellow more or less for surely if they mean to let the chief conspirator go scot-free it would hardly be fitting to take it out on the poor hire tool i hope you include I in that general amnesty order young fellow he now hasten to say with a wishful look on he face since the fat be in the fire i be ready to tell anything you want of I course my name be not jake storm though it be not necessary for I to inform you what it might be because that do not concern anybody around here i need money pretty badly and the gent tempt I beyond my limit so i agree to help he steal the fox cub i be to have all they would fetch when sell and so i come along but if you just cut these cord and tell I to clear out i 'll vamose the ranch instanter max nod he head in the affirmative you might as well make a early start he remark drily since thing have turn out the way they have we could not make any use of you but before you go understand one thing my friend what might that be young fellow ask the other though look very much pleased at hear he would be set free do not get it into you head that it be go to be a easy snap to come back here and rob this fox farm you would be a fool to try it for many reason in the first place silver black be so few in number that any one sell a cub or a pelt can be track and make to prove ownership there be also a association form that will insure these costly animal and chase a thief across the continent until they eventually get he just as the banker ' association do understand that oh do not bother about I the man hasten to tell they i be through with this sort of risky game i can make a living at something that bring in easier return only set I free and i 'll never come back here again never on you life there 'll be a guard here while we be go continued max sternly a man who can hit a silver quarter with he rifle as far as he can see it through the telescopic globe sight it would not be safe for prowler to show up here besides they could never find the fox hide deep down in they burrow during the night time steve set he free please the boy feel that they could afford to be magnanimous since thing have take such a glorious turn in they favor so they not only give the so-called jake storm he liberty but fill he pocket with such food as would serve he until he come to a town roland be see talk with he just before he leave and max feel sure the boy must have thrust some money into the man 's hand for the fellow act as though greatly confuse and shake he head while walk hastily away as though the kindness of those boy quite overwhelm he roland continue he work of make he cousin thoroughly ashamed of he recent mean action he wait on the injured man as though robert have always be one of he best friend if ever a fellow heap coal of fire on the head of he enemy roland chase certainly do during the three day they continue to linger at the lodge under the pine meanwhile the signal have be set for jerry stock to come over and when he arrive he turn out to be very much the kind of a man the boy expect to see a homely specimen of a woodsman honest as the day be long and fill to the brim as steve aptly express it with a accurate knowledge of all such thing as may prove of value to one who roam the wilderness he be to be leave in charge during the absence of the young fur farmer roland have long ago win the sincere admiration of the rugged woodsman who stand ready to do anything to show he regard besides he would be well pay for all he trouble and he family might even come over to visit he occasionally during the balance of they stay under the shelter roof of the wonderful little lodge under the whisper pine the boy make use of every hour in order to enjoy they limited holiday since success have crown they effort to find the miss one they be in constant high spirit it always produce a feeling of exultation to know that the goal have be attain for which a start be make and the four chum be only human they certainly have a great time of it visit all sort of strange nook under the guidance of either roland or jerry max find a number of opportunity to add to he interesting collection of flashlight picture he make a specialty of the fox farm and with the assistance of the young owner manage to snap off the timid occupant of the enclosure in the act of feeding as well as under various other equally instructive condition all of which would give a pretty good idea of how progressive fur farmer manage they outfit the wounded man grow better so that when it be time for they to leave he could take he part in the procession though the other decline to let he burden himself with any of the duffle since he be still weak max have be study robert and reach the conclusion that the young man be heartily ashamed of he miserable plot he hope it would be a good lesson calculate to serve robert the rest of he life and if this turn out to be so then that stumble of he unfortunate as it may have seem to he at the time be the best thing that have ever happen to he the two marketable fox pup be place securely in the cage that have be secure for this very purpose by roland when last in the city it weigh very little and could be easily transport like a ordinary pack on the back roland himself mean to carry it but of course the other insist on spell he from time to time really when the fateful morning hour come and they turn back to give a last fond look at the little lodge under the green pine max and he three chum be conscious of a strange feeling of keen regret around the region of they heart which prove how the wood home of roland have grow upon they i certainly do hope those picture will turn out to be daisy max steve be hear to say most earnestly because i 'll take a heap of satisfaction in recall many of the pleasant thing that have happen to we up here where the breeze be always tell tale to the pinetop and it be nice to be able to see what you mind be center on but look here say roland delighted to hear steve talk in that strain you must not think that even if i do succeed to that jolly little fortune leave by my real uncle and not one of the grimese that i be mean to drop this fox farm business by now it be get a deep hold on I and i be more bent than ever on make it a big success yes and i be also count on you fellow pay I another visit some other time the sooner the better they assure he it would please they beyond measure to contemplate spending part of they next summer vacation with he when they could investigate still further the many delightful mystery of the adirondack wilderness so the lovely nook be lose sight of and for some little time a silence seem to fall upon all the member of the group as they continue to trudge along the trail that eventually would fetch they to a road and after that to a village of course we story near its end now that we have see max and he chum accomplish the object of they search they mean to continue along in the company of roland and see that the pair of beautiful glossy silver black fox pup be safely deliver to the purchaser who intend to start a fur farm of he own in some other part of the country possibly away up in the canadian northwest and have take a great fancy for the particular strain of animal roland be propagate in due time they arrive at the city where this rich gentleman live he have it appear see and admire the fox pup while fishing in the neighborhood of the fur farm and make a contract with roland for the delivery of the pair at a certain time bind the bargain with a cash payment it all turn out as plan and when the boy receive the balance of the stipulate amount in a handsome check he feel that he have a right to feel proud of he accomplishment robert have long before then take he leave and in do so he squeeze the hand of he younger cousin and assure roland that he mean to see more of he in the future so far as max could observe the man appear to have turn over a new leaf and from that time forward be likely to show what be really in he besides he former desire to loaf and spend money and so in the fullness of time the five boy turn up in carson where a certain good woman whom roland claim as he aunt be wonderfully well pleased to find he arm about she wrinkled neck and he boyish kiss press upon she cheek she assure roland the first thing that there be no need of he worry about the future because she have determine to make he she heir regardless of whether he ever come into the money leave under such exacting condition by he deceased uncle naturally roland be proud to tell he aunt that while he appreciate she fresh interest in he career and would be only too glad to respond to she affection at the same time she must know he have not make a failure and that even now he be about to call upon the trustee of the will to show they he have faithfully carry out all the provision upon the fulfillment of which he legacy depend it all come out as plan indeed those same old trustee of the estate living in another town have the greatest surprise of they life when that troop of boy call upon they and the whole story be tell for of course max and the other trio eagerly snap at roland 's warm invitation to accompany he on this momentous occasion so as to witness he crowning triumph and add they testimony if need as witness to the successful outcome of he plan roland have take pain to gather all necessary document show how he invest the greater part of he two thousand dollar and how he be to draw half the proceeds on any sale he also have the contract for the delivery of the first of the silver black fox pup and after could in addition show the fat check cover that particular sale everything have be look after to a fraction the old man find it difficult to believe what at first to they mind seem so like a fairy story : but in the end they have to admit that roland chase have fully comply with every one of the condition impose on he in the strange will of he uncle and as the time limit have not yet expire he be fully entitle to he legacy which in due time be pay over to he after that roland again depart for the wonderful farm where the most valuable crop ever hear of be be grow successfully the other lad hear from he frequently during the winter month and there be no discouraging report forthcoming he now have jerry with he constantly as he assistant the guide have build a cabin near the farm where he install he family it be nicer for roland too since there be several child and he could spend many a evening sociably have take up a phonograph with he together with a fine supply of all sort of record suitable for amusing a mixed company max often allow he thought to bridge the many mile that separate carson from that lodge in the wilderness and it require no magician 's wand to enable he to see in he mind 's eye the delightful surroundings that make the strange fur farm a possible el dorado where fortune be liable to knock on the door and demand entrance it be with more or less regret that the writer find he have reach the point where he must say goodbye and he only do so with the understanding that just as soon as further stir event worth narrate come to pass it will be he pleasure as well as duty to place they between the cover of another book in this series the end + the oblong box + \* \* \* \* \* some year ago i engage passage from charleston sc to the city of new york in the fine packet-ship independence captain hardy we be to sail on the fifteenth of the month -lrb- June -rrb- weather permit and on the fourteenth i go on board to arrange some matter in my stateroom i find that we be to have a great many passenger include a more than usual number of lady on the list be several of my acquaintance and among other name i be rejoice to see that of mr cornelius wyatt a young artist for whom i entertain feeling of warm friendship he have be with I a fellow-student at c -- university where we be very much together he have the ordinary temperament of genius and be a compound of misanthropy sensibility and enthusiasm to these quality he unite the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom i observe that he name be card upon _ three _ stateroom and upon again refer to the list of passenger i find that he have engage passage for himself wife and two sister -- he own the stateroom be sufficiently roomy and each have two berth one above the other these berth to be sure be so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person still i could not comprehend why there be _ three _ stateroom for these four person i be just at this epoch in one of those moody frame of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifle : and i confess with shame that i busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjecture about this matter of the supernumerary stateroom it be no business of mine to be sure but with none the less pertinacity do i occupy myself in attempt to resolve the enigma at last i have not arrive at it before it be a servant of course i say what a fool i be not sooner to have think of so obvious a solution and then i again repair to the list -- but here i see distinctly that _ no _ servant be to come with the party although in fact it have be the original design to bring one -- for the word and servant have be first write and then overscore oh extra baggage to be sure i now say to myself -- something he wish not to be put in the hold -- something to be keep under he own eye -- ah i have it -- a painting or so -- and this be what he have be bargaining about with ficolino the italian jew this idea satisfy I and i dismiss my curiosity for the nonce wyatt 's two sister i know very well and most amiable and clever girl they be he wife he have newly marry and i have never yet see she he have often talk about she in my presence however and in he usual style of enthusiasm he describe she as of surpass beauty wit and accomplishment i be therefore quite anxious to make she acquaintance on the day in which i visit the ship -lrb- the fourteenth -rrb- wyatt and a party be also to visit it -- so the captain inform I -- and i wait on board a hour longer than i have design in hope of be present to the bride but then a apology come mr w be a little indisposed and would decline come on board until to-morrow at the hour of sail the morrow have arrive i be go from my hotel to the wharf when captain hardy meet I and say that owe circumstance -lrb- a stupid but convenient phrase -rrb- he rather think the independence would not sail for a day or two and that when all be ready he would send up and let I know this i think strange for there be a stiff southerly breeze but as the circumstance be not forthcoming although i pump for they with much perseverance i have nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure i do not receive the expect message from the captain for nearly a week it come at length however and i immediately go on board the ship be crowd with passenger and everything be in the bustle attendant upon make sail wyatt 's party arrive in about ten minute after myself there be the two sister the bride and the artist -- the latter in one of he customary fit of moody misanthropy i be too well use to these however to pay they any special attention he do not even introduce I to he wife this courtesy devolve per force upon he sister marian a very sweet and intelligent girl who in a few hurry word make we acquaint mr wyatt have be closely veil and when she raise she veil in acknowledge my bow i confess that i be very profoundly astonished i should have be much more so however have not long experience advise I not to trust with too implicit a reliance the enthusiastic description of my friend the artist when indulge in comment upon the loveliness of woman when beauty be the theme i well know with what facility he soar into the region of the purely ideal the truth be i could not help regard mr wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman if not positively ugly she be not i think very far from it she be dress however in exquisite taste -- and then i have no doubt that she have captivate my friend 's heart by the more enduring grace of the intellect and soul she say very few word and pass at once into she stateroom with mr w my old inquisitiveness now return there be _ no _ servant -- _ that _ be a settle point i look therefore for the extra baggage after some delay a cart arrive at the wharf with a oblong pine box which be everything that seem to be expect immediately upon its arrival we make sail and in a short time be safely over the bar and stand out to sea the box in question be as i say oblong it be about six foot in length by two and a half in breadth i observe it attentively and like to be precise now this shape be _ peculiar _ and no sooner have i see it than i take credit to myself for the accuracy of my guess i have reach the conclusion it will be remember that the extra baggage of my friend the artist would prove to be picture or at least a picture for i know he have be for several week in conference with nicolino and now here be a box which from its shape _ could _ possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of leonardo 's last supper and a copy of this very last supper do by rubinus the younger at florence i have know for some time to be in the possession of nicolino this point therefore i consider as sufficiently settle i chuckle excessively when i thought of my acumen it be the first time i ever know wyatt to keep from I any of he artistical secret but here he evidently intend to steal a march upon I and smuggle a fine picture to new york under my very nose expect I to know nothing of the matter i resolve to quiz he _ well _ now and hereafter one thing however annoy I not a little the box do _ not _ go into the extra stateroom it be deposit in wyatt 's own and there too it remain occupy nearly the whole of the floor -- no doubt to the exceed discomfort of the artist and he wife -- this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it be letter in sprawl capital emit a strong disagreeable and to _ my _ fancy a peculiarly disgusting odor on the lid be paint the word -- _ mr adelaide curti albany new york charge of cornelius wyatt esq this side up to be handle with care _ now i be aware that mr adelaide curti of albany be the artist 's wife 's mother but then i look upon the whole address as a mystification intend especially for myself i make up my mind of course that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend in chamber street new york for the first three or four day we have fine weather although the wind be dead ahead have chop round to the northward immediately upon we lose sight of the coast the passenger be consequently in high spirit and dispose to be social i _ must _ except however wyatt and he sister who behave stiffly and i could not help think uncourteously to the rest of the party _ wyatt 's _ conduct i do not so much regard he be gloomy even beyond he usual habit -- in fact he be _ morose _ -- but in he i be prepare for eccentricity for the sister however i could make no excuse they seclude themselves in they stateroom during the greater part of the passage and absolutely refuse although i repeatedly urge they to hold communication with any person on board mr wyatt herself be far more agreeable that be to say she be _ chatty _ and to be chatty be no slight recommendation at sea she become _ excessively _ intimate with most of the lady and to my profound astonishment evince no equivocal disposition to coquet with the man she amuse we all very much i say _ amuse _ -- and scarcely know how to explain myself the truth be i soon find that mr w be far oftener laugh _ at _ than _ with _ the gentleman say little about she but the lady in a little while pronounced she a good-hearted thing rather indifferent-looking totally uneducated and decidedly vulgar the great wonder be how wyatt have be entrap into such a match wealth be the general solution -- but this i know to be no solution at all for wyatt have tell I that she neither bring he a dollar nor have any expectation from any source whatever he have marry he say for love and for love only and he bride be far more than worthy of he love when i thought of these expression on the part of my friend i confess that i feel indescribably puzzle could it be possible that he be take leave of he sens what else could i think _ he _ so refine so intellectual so fastidious with so exquisite a perception of the faulty and so keen a appreciation of the beautiful to be sure the lady seem especially fond of _ he _ -- particularly so in he absence -- when she make herself ridiculous by frequent quotation of what have be say by she beloved husband mr wyatt the word husband seem forever -- to use one of she own delicate expression -- forever on the tip of she tongue in the meantime it be observe by all on board that he avoid _ she _ in the most pointed manner and for the most part shut himself up alone in he state-room where in fact he might have be say to live altogether leave he wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she think best in the public society of the main cabin my conclusion from what i saw and hear be that the artist by some unaccountable freak of fate or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion have be induce to unite himself with a person altogether beneath he and that the natural result entire and speedy disgust have ensue i pity he from the bottom of my heart -- but could not for that reason quite forgive he incommunicativeness in the matter of the last supper for this i resolve to have my revenge one day he come upon deck and take he arm as have be my wont i saunter with he backward and forward he gloom however -lrb- which i consider quite natural under the circumstance -rrb- seem entirely unabated he say little and that moodily and with evident effort i venture a jest or two and he make a sickening attempt at a smile poor fellow as i thought of _ he wife _ i wonder that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth at last i venture a home-thrust i determine to commence a series of covert insinuation or innuendo about the oblong box -- just to let he perceive gradually that i be _ not _ altogether the butt or victim of he little bit of pleasant mystification my first observation be by way of open a mask battery i say something about the peculiar shape of _ that _ box and as i speak the word i smile knowingly wink and touch he gently with my fore-finger in the rib the manner in which wyatt receive this harmless pleasantry convinced I at once that he be mad at first he stare at I as if he find it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark but as its point seem slowly to make its way into he brain he eye in the same proportion seem protrude from they socket then he grow very red -- then hideously pale -- then as if highly amuse with what i have insinuate he begin a loud and boisterous laugh which to my astonishment he keep up with gradually increase vigor for ten minute or more in conclusion he fall flat and heavily upon the deck when i run to uplift he to all appearance he be _ dead _ i call assistance and with much difficulty we bring he to himself upon revive he speak incoherently for some time at length we bleed he and put he to bed the next morning he be quite recover so far as regard he mere bodily health of he mind i say nothing of course i avoid he during the rest of the passage by advice of the captain who seem to coincide with I altogether in my view of he insanity but caution I to say nothing on this head to any person on board several circumstance occur immediately after this fit of wyatt 's which contribute to heighten the curiosity with which i be already possess among other thing this : i have be nervous -- drink too much strong green tea and sleep ill at night -- in fact for two night i could not be properly say to sleep at all now my stateroom open into the main cabin or dining-room as do those of all the single man on board wyatt 's three room be in the after-cabin which be separate from the main one by a slight slide door never lock even at night as we be almost constantly on a wind and the breeze be not a little stiff the ship heel to leeward very considerably and whenever she starboard side be to leeward the slide door between the cabin slide open and so remain nobody take the trouble to get up and shut it but my berth be in such a position that when my own stateroom door be open as well as the slide door in question -lrb- and my own door be _ always _ open on account of the heat -rrb- i could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly and just at that portion of it too where be situate the stateroom of mr wyatt well during two night -lrb- _ not _ consecutive -rrb- while i lay awake i clearly see mr w about eleven o'clock each night steal cautiously from the stateroom of mr w and enter the extra room where she remain until daybreak when she be call by she husband and go back that they be virtually separate be clear they have separate apartment -- no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce and here after all i thought be the mystery of the extra stateroom there be another circumstance too which interested I much during the two wakeful night in question and immediately after the disappearance of mr wyatt into the extra stateroom i be attract by certain singular cautious subdue noise in that of she husband after listen to they for some time with thoughtful attention i at length succeed perfectly in translate they import they be sound occasion by the artist in prying open the oblong box by means of a chisel and mallet -- the latter be muffle or deaden by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head be envelop in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengage the lid -- also that i could determine when he remove it altogether and when he deposit it upon the lower berth in he room this latter point i know for example by certain slight tap which the lid make in striking against the wooden edge of the berth as he endeavor to lay it down _ very _ gently -- there be no room for it on the floor after this there be a dead stillness and i hear nothing more upon either occasion until nearly daybreak unless perhaps i may mention a low sobbing or murmur sound so very much suppress as to be nearly inaudible -- if indeed the whole of this latter noise be not rather produce by my own imagination i say it seem to _ resemble _ sobbing or sighing -- but of course it could not have be either i rather think it be a ringing in my own ear mr wyatt no doubt accord to custom be merely give the rein to one of he hobby -- indulge in one of he fit of artistic enthusiasm he have open he oblong box in order to feast he eye on the pictorial treasure within there be nothing in this however to make he _ sob _ i repeat therefore that it must have be simply a freak of my own fancy distemper by good captain hardy 's green tea just before dawn on each of the two night of which i speak i distinctly hear mr wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box and force the nail into they old place by means of the muffle mallet have do this he issue from he stateroom fully dress and proceed to call mr w from hers we have be at sea seven day and be now off cape hattera when there come a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest we be in a measure prepare for it however as the weather have be hold out threat for some time everything be make snug alow and aloft and as the wind steadily freshen we lay to at length under spanker and foretopsail both double-reefed in this trim we ride safely enough for forty-eight hour -- the ship prove herself a excellent sea boat in many respects and ship no water of any consequence at the end of this period however the gale have freshen into a hurricane and we after-sail split into ribbon bring we so much in the trough of the water that we ship several prodigious sea one immediately after the other by this accident we lose three man overboard with the caboose and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwark scarcely have we recover we sens before the foretopsail go into shred when we get up a storm stay-sail and with this do pretty well for some hour the ship head the sea much more steadily than before the gale still hold on however and we see no sign of its abate the rigging be find to be ill-fitted and greatly strain and on the third day of the blow about five in the afternoon we mizzen-mast in a heavy lurch to windward go by the board for a hour or more we try in vain to get rid of it on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship and before we have succeed the carpenter come aft and announce four foot water in the hold to add to we dilemma we find the pump choke and nearly useless all be now confusion and despair -- but a effort be make to lighten the ship by throw overboard as much of she cargo as could be reach and by cut away the two mast that remain this we at last accomplished -- but we be still unable to do anything at the pump and in the meantime the leak gain on we very fast at sundown the gale have sensibly diminish in and as the sea go down with it we still entertain faint hope of save ourselves in the boat at eight pm the cloud break away to windward and we have the advantage of a full moon -- a piece of good fortune which serve wonderfully to cheer we droop spirit after incredible labor we succeed at length in get the long-boat over the side without material accident and into this we crowd the whole of the crew and most of the passenger this party make off immediately and after undergo much suffering finally arrive in safety at ocracoke inlet on the third day after the wreck fourteen passenger with the captain remain on board resolve to trust they fortune to the jolly-boat at the stern we lower it without difficulty although it be only by a miracle that we prevent it from swamp as it touch the water it contain when afloat the captain and he wife mr wyatt and party a mexican officer wife four child and myself with a negro valet we have no room of course for anything except a few positively necessary instrument some provision and the clothes upon we back no one have think of even attempt to save anything more what must have be the astonishment of all then when have proceed a few fathom from the ship mr wyatt stand up in the stern-sheet and coolly demand of captain hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of take in he oblong box sit down mr wyatt reply the captain somewhat sternly you will capsize we if you do not sit quite still we gunwale be almost in the water now the box vociferate mr wyatt still stand -- the box i say captain hardy you can not you _ will _ not refuse I its weight will be but a trifle -- it be nothing -- mere nothing by the mother who bear you -- for the love of heaven -- by you hope of salvation i _ implore _ you to put back for the box the captain for a moment seem touch by the earnest appeal of the artist but he regain he stern composure and merely say : mr wyatt you be _ mad _ i can not listen to you sitdown i say or you will swamp the boat stay -- hold he -- seize he he be about to spring overboard there -- i know it -- he be over as the captain say this mr wyatt in fact spring from the boat and as we be yet in the lee of the wreck succeed by almost superhuman exertion in get hold of a rope which hang from the fore-chain in another moment he be on board and rush frantically down into the cabin in the meantime we have be sweep astern of the ship and be quite out of she lee be at the mercy of the tremendous sea which be still run we make a determine effort to put back but we little boat be like a feather in the breath of the tempest we see at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist be seal as we distance from the wreck rapidly increase the madman -lrb- for as such only could we regard he -rrb- be see to emerge from the companion-way up which by dint of a strength that appear gigantic he drag bodily the oblong box while we gaze in the extremity of astonishment he pass rapidly several turn of a three-inch rope first around the box and then around he body in another instant both body and box ware in the sea -- disappear suddenly at once and forever we linger awhile sadly upon we oar with we eye rivet upon the spot at length we pull away the silence remain unbroken for a hour finally i hazard a remark do you observe captain how suddenly they sink be not that a exceedingly singular thing i confess that i entertain some feeble hope of he final deliverance when i see he lash himself to the box and commit himself to the sea they sink as a matter of course reply the captain and that like a shot they will soon rise again however -- _ but not till the salt melt _ the salt i ejaculate hush say the captain point to the wife and sister of the decease we must talk of these thing at some more appropriate time \* \* \* \* \* we suffer much and make a narrow escape but fortune befriend _ we _ as well as we mate in the long boat we land in fine more dead than alive after four day of intense distress upon the beach opposite roanoke island we remain there a week be not ill-treated by the wrecker and at length obtain a passage to new york about a month after the loss of the independence i happen to meet captain hardy in broadway we conversation turn naturally upon the disaster and especially upon the sad fate of poor wyatt i thus learn the follow particulars the artist have engage passage for himself wife two sister and a servant he wife be indeed as she have be represent a most lovely and most accomplished woman on the morning of the fourteenth of June -lrb- the day in which i first visit the ship -rrb- the lady suddenly sicken and die the young husband be frantic with grief -- but circumstance imperatively forbid the defer he voyage to new york it be necessary to take to she mother the corpse of he adored wife and on the other hand the universal prejudice which would prevent he do so openly be well know nine-tenth of the passenger would have abandon the ship rather than take passage with the dead body in this dilemma captain hardy arrange that the corpse be first partially embalmed and packed with a large quantity of salt in a box of suitable dimension should be convey on board as merchandise nothing be to be say of the lady 's decease and as it be well understand that mr wyatt have engage passage for he wife it become necessary that some person should personate she during the voyage this the decease 's lady 's maid be easily prevail on to do the extra state-room originally engage for this girl during she mistress ' life be now merely retain in this state-room the pseudo-wife sleep of course every night in the daytime she perform to the best of she ability the part of she mistress -- whose person it have be carefully ascertain be unknown to any of the passenger on board my own mistake arise naturally enough through too careless too inquisitive and too impulsive a temperament but of late it be a rare thing that i sleep soundly at night there be a countenance which haunt I turn as i will there be a hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ear end of project gutenberg 's at whisper pine lodge by lawrence j leslie
