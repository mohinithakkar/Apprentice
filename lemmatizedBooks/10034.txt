object like a loose vegetable on a sluggish current of tidal gravy and the spire of the ritualistic church shooting-up at one end like a incorrigibly perpendicular leg of magnify mutton hotter and hotter come the breath fiery of nature 's cookery until some of the stuff boil out of one cottage in the shape of the oldest inhabitant who make he usual annual remark that this be the warmest day in ninety-eight year and then simmer away to some cooler nook amongst the green more and more intolerably quiver the atmosphere of the sylvan oven with stifle fervency until there ooze from beneath the shingled crust of a vegetarian country-boarding-house a parboiled guest from the city who believe himself almost ready to turn drift feebly to where the road fork and there be a shade more dun while to the speculative mind each glowing field of corn or buckwheat be a incipient meal and each chimney or barn a mere temptation to guess how many swallow there may be in it upon the afternoon of such a day as this miss pott be inform by a servant that mr bumstead have arrive and send she he love would be please to have she come down stair to he and bring he a fan why do not you tell he i be not at home you absurd thing cry the young girl hurriedly practice a series of agitate look and pensive smile before she mirror so i do miss answer the attach menial but he would see you look at he with a opera-glass as he come up the path and say that he could hear you take a clean handkerchief out of tho drawer on purpose to receive he with before he would get to the door oh what shall i do my hand be so red to-day sigh flcka hold she arm above she head that the blood may retire from the too pinkish member after a pause and a adjustment of a curl over she right eye and the scarf at she waist to make they look innocent she yield to the meteorological mania so strikingly prevalent amongst all the other character of this narrative and say that she will receive the visitor in the yard near the pump then cast carelessly over she shoulder that web-like shawl without which no woman nor spider be complete she arrange she lip in the glass for the last time and with a garden-hat hang from the elbow latest singed go down hum un-suspiciously into the open-air with the guileless bearing of one wholly unprepared for company rest a elbow upon a low iron patent-pump near a rustic seat the ritualistic organist in he vast linen coat and impose straw hat look not unlike a eccentric garden statue upon which some prudish slave of modern conventionality have place the summer attire of a western editor the great heat of the sun upon he back make he irritable and when miss pott sharply smite with she fan the knuckle of the hand which he have affably extend to take she by the chin more than the usual symptom of acute inflammation appear at the end of he nose and he blow hurriedly upon he wounded digit that hurt like the mischief he remark in some anger i do not know when i have feel anything smart so then do not be so horrid return the pensive girl take a seat before he upon the rustic settee and abstractedly arrange she dress so that only two-third of a gaiter-boot can be see munch clove the aroma of which laden the air all around he mr bumstead contemplate she with a calmness which would be enthralling but for the nervous twist of he feature under the torment of a singularly adhesive fly i have come dear he observe slowly to know how soon you will be ready for I to give you you next music-lesson i prefer that you would not call I you ` dear ' be the chilling answer the organist think for a moment and then nod he head intelligently you be right he say gravely -- there _ might _ be somebody listen who could not enter into we real feeling and now how about those music-lesson i do not want any more thank you say flora coldly while we be all in mourning for we poor dear absurd eddy it seem like a perfectly ridiculous mockery to be practice the scale fan himself with he straw hat mr bumstead shake he bushy head several time you do not discriminate sufficiently he reply there be kind of music which when perform rapidly upon the violin fife or kettle-drum certainly fill the mind with sentiment unfavorable to the deeper anguish of human sorrow of such however be not the kind make by young girl which be at all time a help to the intensity of judicious grief let I assure you with the candor of a idolize friend that some of the saddest hour of my life have be spend in teaching you to try to sing a humorous aria from donizettus and the moment in which i have most sincerely regret ever have be bear be those in which you have play in my hear the drinking-song from _ la traviata _ believe I then my devoted pupil there can be nothing at all inconsistent with a prevalence of profound melancholy in you continue piano-playing whereas on the contrary you sudden and permanent cessation might at least surprise you friend and the neighborhood into a light-heartedness temporarily oblivious of the memory of that dear miss boy to whom you could not i hear give the love already bestow upon I i love he ridiculously absurdly with my whole heart cry flora not altogether like what she have hear i be real sorry too that they think somebody have kill he mr bumstead fold he brown linen arm as he tower before she and the dark circle around he eye appear to shrink with the intensify of he gaze there be occasion in life he remark when to acknowledge that we last meeting with a friend who have since mysteriously disappear be to reject he and imply a preference for he uncle may be calculate to associate we unpleasantly with that disappearance in the mind of the censorious and invite suspicion tend to we early cross-examination by we irish local magistrate i do not say of course that you actually destroy my nephew for fear he should try to prejudice I against you but i can not withhold my earnest approval of you judicious pretence of a sentiment palpably incompatible with the shed of the blood of its depart object if you will move you dress a little so that i can sit beside you and allow you head to rest upon my shoulder that fan will do for both of we and we may converse in whisper my head upon _ you _ shoulder exclaim miss pott stare swiftly about to see if anybody be look i prefer to keep my head upon my own shoulder sir two head be better than one the ritualistic organist remind she if a little hair-oil and powder _ do _ come off upon my coat the latter will wash i suppose come dearest if it be we fate to never get through this hot day alive let we be sunstruck together she shrink timidly from the brown linen arm which he begin insinuate along the back of the rustic settee and tell he that she could not have believe that he could be so absurd he draw back he arm and seem hurt flora he say tenderly how beautiful you be especially when fix up the more i see of yon the less sorry i be that i have conclude to be yours all the time that my dear boy be try to induce you to relase he from he engagement i be think how much better you might do yet beyond a occasional encouraging wink i never give the least sign of reciprocate you attachment i do not think it would be right the assertion though superficially true be so imperfect in its delineation of habitual conduct liable to another construction that the agitate flowerpot return with quick indignation you arm be always reach out whenever you sit in a chair anywhere near I and whenever i sing you always keep look straight into my mouth until it tickle I you know you do you hateful thing besides it be not you that i prefer at all it be -- oh it be too ridiculous to tell in she bashful confusion she be about to arise and trip shyly away from he into the house when he speak again miss pott be you friendship for miss pendragon and she brother such that they execution upon some Friday of next month would be a spectacle to which you could give no pleased attention what do you mean you absurd creature i mean continue mr bumstead simply this : you know my double loss you know that upon the person of the male pendragon be find a apple look and tasting like one which my nephew once have you know that when miss pendragon go from here she wear a alpaca waist which look as though it have be expose more than once to the rain -- see the point flora give a startled look and say : i do not see it suppose he go on -- suppose that i go to a magistrate and say : ` judge i vote for you and can influence a large foreign vote for you again i have lose a nephew who be very fond of apple and a black alpaca umbrella of great value a young southerner who have not live in this state long enough to vote have be find in possession of a apple singularly like the kind generally eat by my miss relative and he sister have come out in a waist make of second-hand alpaca ' -- see the point now mr bumstead exclaim flora affright by the terrible menace of he manner i do not any more believe that mr pendragon be guilty than i myself be and as for you old umbrella -- stop woman interrupt the bereaved organist imperiously not even you lip shall speak disrespectfully of my lose bone-handled friend by a chain of unanswerable argument i have show you that i hold the fate of you southern acquaintance in my hand and shall be particularly sorry if you force I to hang mr pendragon as a rival flora put she hand to she temple to soothe she throbbing head and display a bracelet oh what shall i do i do not want anybody to be hang it must be so perfectly awful she touching display of generous feeling do not soften he on the contrary he stand more erect and smile rather triumphantly under he straw hat beloved one he murmur in a rich voice i find that i can not induce you to make the first advance toward the mutual avowal we be both longing for and must therefore precipitate we happiness myself my poor boy would not have give you perfect satisfaction and you momentary liking for the male pendragon be but the effect of a temporary despair undoubtedly produce by my seeming coldness that coldness have nothing to do with my heart but result partially from my habit of wear a wet towel on my head i now propose to you -- propose to I ejaculate miss pott with heighten color -- that you pick out a worthy man belong to you own section of the union he continue hastily here 's my heart he add go through the motion of take something from a pocket and place it in he outstretched palm and here 's my hand -- place therein a equally imaginary object from another pocket -- try the h and h of j bumstead he manner be as though he be commend some patent article of unquestionable utility but i can not bear the sight of you she cry push away the brown linen arm come after she again take away she fan he pat she on the head with it and seem momentarily surprise at the hollow sound future mr bumstead he cheerfully reply at last my observation and knowledge of the woman of america teach I that there never be a wife go to indiana for a divorce who have not at first swear to love as well as honor and obey she husband such be woman that if she have feel and say at the altar that she could not bear the sight of he it would not have be in the power of masculine brutality and dissipate habit to drive she from he side through all they life there can be no better sign of we future happiness than for you to say beforehand that you utterly detest the man of you choice there be something terrible to the young girl in the original turn of thought of this fascinating man say what she may he at once turn it into virtual devotion to himself he appear to have a perfectly dreadful power to hang everybody he consider she strongest avowal of present personal dislike the most promising indication she can give of eternal future infatuation with he and he powerful mode of reasoning be more profound and composing than a article in a new york newspaper on a war in europe render dizzy by he metaphysical conversation she arise from the rustic seat and be fly giddily into the house when he leap athletically after she and catch she in the doorway i merely wish to request he say quietly that you place sufficient restraint upon you naturally happy feeling to keep we engagement a secret

george August 30 dear punchinello : -- i arrive here last Saturday and as i would be the last person to allow a commendable enterprise to languish for want of proper encouragement and in order to put the hotel proprietor out of suspense i think i would let you know without further delay that i consider lake george a success not be expect as i suppose i must admit i be somewhat gratified to find a full band playing on the veranda as the coach i be in drive up it be a sort of delicate attention you know i notice however that they continue play in the afternoon since then i suppose it strike they as a good idea at the time the fort william henry hotel be a gorgeous affair in every respect it be situate very near the old original fort just where the french troops advance to capture it and make they celebrated charge perhaps the present proprietor can not discount they at that sort of thing perhaps not look over one 's bill remind you a good deal of the police court five dollar fine twenty-five dollar cost the cost they make here be very good however altho ' they do put a little too much mint in they i must say lg be all right though it be supply with all the modern convenience it be not within five minute walk of the post office but its water convenience be apparent to all there be no end to its belle and as for its range it have two of they -- both adirondack yesterday i take a trip up the lake and across to its neighbor champlain everybody take this trip because its the thing and it be therefore particularly necessary to take it ostensibly you go to view the scenery really to be inveigle into pay for a low comedy of a dinner at the other end the first place we boat stop at be call the trout pavillion principally so far as i can learn on account of the immense number of pickerel catch there and from the fact that it be unquestionably a good site for a pavillion whenever the esteem proprietor turn up jack enough at he favorite game to build one the next place be set down in the guide book as the three sister island a appellation arise from the fact that there be precisely _ four _ of they i mention this apparent discrepancy to the boat clerk this young man who belong to a base ball club inform I that these island invariably travel with a substitute as one occasionally get soak this certainly seem a little curious but as the young man say he be bear here i suppose he know this same young man point out a beautiful spot call green island and ask I if i would not like to live there he say he think it would just suit I the attention of these people be really delightful some of these place however have very inappropriate name for instance another little gem be call hog island no one know why it be so call the clerk of the boat do not either he want to know if i have ever dine there i always make it a point to get on the right side of these steamboat fellow always about half way up the lake be a place call tongue mountain a long time ago a colony of strong-minded woman settle there that may have have something to do with its name nobody ever go there now people go very near the mountain in boat however as it be note for something very extraordinary in the echo line it have what be call a double echo i fully expect something of this kind now if there be anything i be particularly down on it be those unmitigated fraud know as echo and if i ever throw four six it be when i be tackle some unsuspecting old ass of a watering place echo i consider they _ holler _ mockery of course we steam within proper distance and i seize the opportunity to put a head on this venerable two-ply nuisance as follow : first i read a page of a patent office report i go arm with this the echo with very little hesitation repeat in duplicate as usual from one side of the rock in english and from the other in fair french i see at once that old ek be pretty well fill next i sing listen to the mock bird which it repeat very creditably indeed drop but two note on the third verse this it make up for i be bind to admit by throw in some original variation in the chorus but i have not play from my sleeve yet so i recite hamlet 's soliloquy from the wooded slope on we right come the familiar _ to be _ of booth while from the sloping wood on we left proceed a finely render imitation of the teutonic fechter in the same
