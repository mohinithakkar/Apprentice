introduction i division of the subject ii personality or what a man be iii property or what a man have iv position or a man 's place in the estimation of other -- sect 1 reputation 2 pride 3 rank 4 honor 5 fame introduction in these page i shall speak of _ the wisdom of life _ in the common meaning of the term as the art namely of order we life so as to obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success a art the theory of which may be call _ eudaemonology _ for it teach we how to lead a happy existence such a existence might perhaps be define as one which look at from a purely objective point of view or rather after cool and mature reflection -- for the question necessarily involve subjective consideration -- would be decidedly preferable to non-existence imply that we should cling to it for its own sake and not merely from the fear of death and further that we should never like it to come to a end now whether human life correspond or could possibly correspond to this conception of existence be a question to which as be well-known my philosophical system return a negative answer on the eudaemonistic hypothesis however the question must be answer in the affirmative and i have show in the second volume of my chief work -lrb- ch 49 -rrb- that this hypothesis be base upon a fundamental mistake accordingly in elaborate the scheme of a happy existence i have have to make a complete surrender of the higher metaphysical and ethical standpoint to which my own theory lead and everything i shall say here will to some extent rest upon a compromise in so far that be as i take the common standpoint of every day and embrace the error which be at the bottom of it my remark therefore will possess only a qualify value for the very word _ eudaemonology _ be a euphemism further i make no claim to completeness partly because the subject be inexhaustible and partly because i should otherwise have to say over again what have be already say by other the only book compose as far as i remember with a like purpose to that which animate this collection of aphorism be cardan 's _ de utilitate ex adversis capienda _ which be well worth reading and may be use to supplement the present work aristotle it be true have a few word on eudaemonology in the fifth chapter of the first book of he _ rhetoric _ but what he say do not come to very much as compilation be not my business i have make no use of these predecessor more especially because in the process of compile individuality of view be lose and individuality of view be the kernel of work of this kind in general indeed the wise in all age have always say the same thing and the fool who at all time form the immense majority have in they way too act alike and do just the opposite and so it will continue for as voltaire say _ we shall leave this world as foolish and as wicked as we find it on we arrival _ the wisdom of life chapter i division of the subject aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- divide the blessing of life into three class -- those which come to we from without those of the soul and those of the body keep nothing of this division but the number i observe that the fundamental difference in human lot may be reduce to three distinct class : -lrb- footnote 1 : _ eth nichom _ i 8 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- what a man be : that be to say personality in the widest sense of the word under which be include health strength beauty temperament moral character intelligence and education -lrb- 2 -rrb- what a man have : that be property and possession of every kind -lrb- 3 -rrb- how a man stand in the estimation of other : by which be to be understand as everybody know what a man be in the eye of he fellowman or more strictly the light in which they regard he this be show by they opinion of he and they opinion be in its turn manifest by the honor in which he be hold and by he rank and reputation the difference which come under the first head be those which nature herself have set between man and man and from this fact alone we may at once infer that they influence the happiness or unhappiness of mankind in a much more vital and radical way than those contain under the two follow head which be merely the effect of human arrangement compare with _ genuine personal advantage _ such as a great mind or a great heart all the privilege of rank or birth even of royal birth be but as king on the stage to king in real life the same thing be say long ago by metrodorus the earliest disciple of epicurus who write as the title of one of he chapter _ the happiness we receive from ourselves be greater than that which we obtain from we surroundings _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and it be a obvious fact which can not be call in question that the principal element in a man 's well-being -- indeed in the whole tenor of he existence -- be what he be make of he inner constitution for this be the immediate source of that inward satisfaction or dissatisfaction result from the sum total of he sensation desire and thought whilst he surroundings on the other hand exert only a mediate or indirect influence upon he this be why the same external event or circumstance affect no two people alike even with perfectly similar surroundings every one live in a world of he own for a man have immediate apprehension only of he own idea feeling and volition the outer world can influence he only in so far as it bring these to life the world in which a man live shape itself chiefly by the way in which he look at it and so it prove different to different man to one it be barren dull and superficial to another rich interesting and full of mean on hearing of the interesting event which have happen in the course of a man 's experience many people will wish that similar thing have happen in they life too completely forget that they should be envious rather of the mental aptitude which lend those event the significance they possess when he describe they to a man of genius they be interesting adventure but to the dull perception of a ordinary individual they would have be stale everyday occurrence this be in the highest degree the case with many of goethe 's and byron 's poem which be obviously found upon actual fact where it be open to a foolish reader to envy the poet because so many delightful thing happen to he instead of envy that mighty power of phantasy which be capable of turn a fairly common experience into something so great and beautiful -lrb- footnote 1 : cf clemen alex strom ii 21 -rrb- in the same way a person of melancholy temperament will make a scene in a tragedy out of what appear to the sanguine man only in the light of a interesting conflict and to a phlegmatic soul as something without any meaning -- all of which rest upon the fact that every event in order to be realize and appreciate require the co-operation of two factor namely a subject and a object although these be as closely and necessarily connect as oxygen and hydrogen in water when therefore the objective or external factor in a experience be actually the same but the subjective or personal appreciation of it vary the event be just as much a different one in the eye of different person as if the objective factor have not be alike for to a blunt intelligence the fairest and best object in the world present only a poor reality and be therefore only poorly appreciate -- like a fine landscape in dull weather or in the reflection of a bad _ camera obscura _ in plain language every man be pen up within the limit of he own consciousness and can not directly get beyond those limit any more than he can get beyond he own skin so external aid be not of much use to he on the stage one man be a prince another a minister a third a servant or a soldier or a general and so on -- mere external difference : the inner reality the kernel of all these appearance be the same -- a poor player with all the anxiety of he lot in life it be just the same difference of rank and wealth give every man he part to play but this by no means imply a difference of inward happiness and pleasure here too there be the same be in all -- a poor mortal with he hardship and trouble though these may indeed in every case proceed from dissimilar cause they be in they essential nature much the same in all they form with degree of intensity which vary no doubt but in no wise correspond to the part a man have to play to the presence or absence of position and wealth since everything which exist or happen for a man exist only in he consciousness and happen for it alone the most essential thing for a man be the constitution of this consciousness which be in most case far more important than the circumstance which go to form its contents all the pride and pleasure of the world mirror in the dull consciousness of a fool be poor indeed compare with the imagination of cervante write he _ don quixote _ in a miserable prison the objective half of life and reality be in the hand of fate and accordingly take various form in different case : the subjective half be ourself and in essential be always remain the same hence the life of every man be stamp with the same character throughout however much he external circumstance may alter it be like a series of variation on a single theme no one can get beyond he own individuality a animal under whatever circumstance it be place remain within the narrow limit to which nature have irrevocably consign it so that we endeavor to make a pet happy must always keep within the compass of its nature and be restrict to what it can feel so it be with man the measure of the happiness he can attain be determine beforehand by he individuality more especially be this the case with the mental power which fix once for all he capacity for the higher kind of pleasure if these power be small no effort from without nothing that he fellowman or that fortune can do for he will suffice to raise he above the ordinary degree of human happiness and pleasure half animal though it be he only resource be he sensual appetite -- a cozy and cheerful family life at the most -- low company and vulgar pastime even education on the whole can avail little if anything for the enlargement of he horizon for the highest most varied and lasting pleasure be those of the mind however much we youth may deceive we on this point and the pleasure of the mind turn chiefly on the power of the mind it be clear then that we happiness depend in a great degree upon what we _ be _ upon we individuality whilst lot or destiny be generally take to mean only what we _ have _ or we _ reputation _ we lot in this sense may improve but we do not ask much of it if we be inwardly rich : on the other hand a fool remain a fool a dull blockhead to he last hour even though he be surround by houri in paradise this be why goethe in the _ west-östliclien divan _ say that every man whether he occupy a low position in life or emerge as its victor testify to personality as the greatest factor in happiness : -- _ volk und knecht und uberwinder sie gestehen zu jeder zeit höchtes glück der erdenkinder sei nur die persönlichkeit _ everything confirm the fact that the subjective element in life be incomparably more important for we happiness and pleasure than the objective from such saying as _ hunger be the best sauce _ and _ youth and age can not live together _ up to the life of the genius and the saint health outweigh all other blessing so much that one may really say that a healthy beggar be happier than a ail king a quiet and cheerful temperament happy in the enjoyment of a perfectly sound physique a intellect clear lively penetrate and see thing as they be a moderate and gentle will and therefore a good conscience -- these be privilege which no rank or wealth can make up for or replace for what a man be in himself what accompany he when he be alone what no one can give or take away be obviously more essential to he than everything he have in the way of possession or even what he may be in the eye of the world a intellectual man in complete solitude have excellent entertainment in he own thought and fancy while no amount of diversity or social pleasure theater excursion and amusement can ward off boredom from a dullard a good temperate gentle character can be happy in needy circumstance whilst a covetous envious and malicious man even if he be the richest in the world go miserable nay more to one who have the constant delight of a special individuality with a high degree of intellect most of the pleasure which be run after by mankind be simply superfluous they be even a trouble and a burden and so horace say of himself that however many be deprive of the fancy-goods of life there be one at least who can live without they : -- _ gemmas marmor ebur tyrrhena sigilla tabellas argentum vestes gaetulo murice tinctas sunt qui non habeant est quus non curat habere _ and when socrate saw various article of luxury spread out for sale he exclaim : _ how much there be in the world i do not want _ so the first and most essential element in we life 's happiness be what we be -- we personality if for no other reason than that it be a constant factor come into play under all circumstance : besides unlike the blessing which be describe under the other two head it be not the sport of destiny and can not be wrest from we -- and so far it be endowed with a absolute value in contrast to the merely relative worth of the other two the consequence of this be that it be much more difficult than people commonly suppose to get a hold on a man from without but here the all-powerful agent time come in and claim its rights and before its influence physical and mental advantage gradually waste away moral character alone remain inaccessible to it in view of the destructive effect of time it seem indeed as if the blessing name under the other two head of which time can not directly rob we be superior to those of the first another advantage might be claim for they namely that be in they very nature objective and external they be attainable and every one be present with the possibility at least of come into possession of they whilst what be subjective be not open to we to acquire but make its entry by a kind of _ divine right _ it remain for life immutable inalienable a inexorable doom let I quote those line in which goethe describe how a unalterable destiny be assign to every man at the hour of he birth so that he can develop only in the line lay down for he as it be by the conjunction of the star : and how the sybil and the prophet declare that _ himself _ a man can never escape nor any power of time avail to change the path on which he life be cast : -- _ wie a dem tag der dich der welt verliehen dïe sonne stand zum grusse der planeten bist alsobald und fort und fort gediehen nach dem gesetz wonach du angetreten so musst du sein dir kannst du nicht entfliehen so tagten schon sybillen und propheten und keine zeit und keine macht zerstückelt geprägte form die lebend sich entwickelt _ the only thing that stand in we power to achieve be to make the most advantageous use possible of the personal quality we possess and accordingly to follow such pursuit only as will call they into play to strive after the kind of perfection of which they admit and to avoid every other consequently to choose the position occupation and manner of life which be most suitable for they development imagine a man endow with herculean strength who be compel by circumstance to follow a sedentary occupation some minute exquisite work of the hand for example or to engage in study and mental labor demand quite other power and just those which he have not get -- compel that be to leave unused the power in which he be pre-eminently strong a man place like this will never feel happy all he life through even more miserable will be the lot of the man with intellectual power of a very high order who have to leave they undeveloped and unemployed in the pursuit of a call which do not require they some bodily labor perhaps for which he strength be insufficient still in a case of this kind it should be we care especially in youth to avoid the precipice of presumption and not ascribe to ourselves a superfluity of power which be not there since the blessing describe under the first head decidedly outweigh those contain under the other two it be manifestly a wiser course to aim at the maintenance of we health and the cultivation of we faculty than at the amassing of wealth but this must not be mistake as mean that we should neglect to acquire a adequate supply of the necessaries of life wealth in the strict sense of the word that be great superfluity can do little for we happiness and many rich people feel unhappy just because they be without any true mental culture or knowledge and consequently have no objective interest which would qualify they for intellectual occupation for beyond the satisfaction of some real and natural necessity all that the possession of wealth can achieve have a very small influence upon we happiness in the proper sense of the word indeed wealth rather disturb it because the preservation of property entail a great many unavoidable anxiety and still man be a thousand time more intent on become rich than on acquire culture though it be quite certain that what a man _ be _ contribute much more to he happiness than what he _ have _ so you may see many a man as industrious as a ant ceaselessly occupy from morning to night in the endeavor to increase he heap of gold beyond the narrow horizon of means to this end he know nothing he mind be a blank and consequently unsusceptible to any other influence the highest pleasure those of the intellect be to he inaccessible and he try in vain to replace they by the fleeting pleasure of sense in which he indulge lasting but a brief hour and at tremendous cost and if he be lucky he struggle result in he have a really great pile of gold which he leave to he heir either to make it still larger or to squander it in extravagance a life like this though pursue with a sense of earnestness and a air of importance be just as silly as many another which have a fool 's cap for its symbol _ what a man have in himself _ be then the chief element in he happiness because this be as a rule so very little most of those who be place beyond the struggle with penury feel at bottom quite as unhappy as those who be still engage in it they mind be vacant they imagination dull they spirit poor and so they be drive to the company of those like they -- for _ simili similus gaudet _ -- where they make common pursuit of pastime and entertainment consist for the most part in sensual pleasure amusement of every kind and finally in excess and libertinism a young man of rich family enter upon life with a large patrimony and often run through it in a incredibly short space of time in vicious extravagance and why simply because here too the mind be empty and void and so the man be bore with existence he be send forth into the world outwardly rich but inwardly poor and he vain endeavor be to make he external wealth compensate for he inner poverty by try to obtain everything _ from without _ like a old man who seek to strengthen himself as king david or maréchal de rex try to do and so in the end one who be inwardly poor come to be also poor outwardly i need not insist upon the importance of the other two kind of blessing which make up the happiness of human life now-a-day the value of possess they be too well know to require advertisement the third class it be true may seem compare with the second of a very ethereal character as it consist only of other people 's opinion still every one have to strive for reputation that be to say a good name rank on the other hand should be aspire to only by those who serve the state and fame by very few indeed in any case reputation be look upon as a priceless treasure and fame as the most precious of all the blessing a man can attain -- the golden fleece as it be of the elect : whilst only fool will prefer rank to property the second and third class moreover be reciprocally cause and effect so far that be as petronius ' maxim _ habe habeberi _ be true and conversely the favor of other in all its form often put we in the way of get what we want chapter ii personality or what a man be we have already see in general that what a man _ be _ contribute much more to he happiness than what he _ have _ or how he be regard by other what a man be and so what he have in he own person be always the chief thing to consider for he individuality accompany he always and everywhere and give its color to all he experience in every kind of enjoyment for instance the pleasure depend principally upon the man himself every one admit this in regard to physical and how much truer it be of intellectual pleasure when we use that english expression to enjoy one 's self we be employ a very striking and appropriate phrase for observe -- one say not he enjoy pari but he enjoy himself in pari to a man possess of a ill-conditioned individuality all pleasure be like delicate wine in a mouth make bitter with gall therefore in the blessing as well as in the ill of life less depend upon what befall we than upon the way in which it be meet that be upon the kind and degree of we general susceptibility what a man be and have in himself -- in a word personality with all it entail be the only immediate and direct factor in he happiness and welfare all else be mediate and indirect and its influence can be neutralize and frustrated but the influence of personality never this be why the envy which personal quality excite be the most implacable of all -- as it be also the most carefully dissemble further the constitution of we consciousness be the ever present and lasting element in all we do or suffer we individuality be persistently at work more or less at every moment of we life : all other influence be temporal incidental fleeting and subject to every kind of chance and change this be why aristotle say : _ it be not wealth but character that last _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- greek : -- hae gar phusis bebion ou ta chraema -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : eth eud vii 2 37 : -rrb- and just for the same reason we can more easily bear a misfortune which come to we entirely from without than one which we have draw upon ourselves for fortune may always change but not character therefore subjective blessing -- a noble nature a capable head a joyful temperament bright spirit a well-constituted perfectly sound physique in a word _ men sana in corpore sano _ be the first and most important element in happiness so that we should be more intent on promote and preserve such quality than on the possession of external wealth and external honor and of all these the one which make we the most directly happy be a genial flow of good spirit for this excellent quality be its own immediate reward the man who be cheerful and merry have always a good reason for be so -- the fact namely that he be so there be nothing which like this quality can so completely replace the loss of every other blessing if you know anyone who be young handsome rich and esteemed and you want to know further if he be happy ask be he cheerful and genial -- and if he be what do it matter whether he be young or old straight or humpbacked poor or rich -- he be happy in my early day i once open a old book and find these word : _ if you laugh a great deal you be happy if you cry a great deal you be unhappy _ -- a very simple remark no doubt but just because it be so simple i have never be able to forget it even though it be in the last degree a truism so if cheerfulness knock at we door we should throw it wide open for it never come inopportunely instead of that we often make scruple about let it in we want to be quite sure that we have every reason to be contented then we be afraid that cheerfulness of spirit may interfere with serious reflection or weighty care cheerfulness be a direct and immediate gain -- the very coin as it be of happiness and not like all else merely a cheque upon the bank for it alone make we immediately happy in the present moment and that be the highest blessing for being like we whose existence be but a infinitesimal moment between two eternity to secure and promote this feeling of cheerfulness should be the supreme aim of all we endeavor after happiness now it be certain that nothing contribute so little to cheerfulness as riches or so much as health be it not in the lower class the so-called work class more especially those of they who live in the country that we see cheerful and contented face and be it not amongst the rich the upper class that we find face full of ill-humor and vexation consequently we should try as much as possible to maintain a high degree of health for cheerfulness be the very flower of it i need hardly say what one must do to be healthy -- avoid every kind of excess all violent and unpleasant emotion all mental overstrain take daily exercise in the open air cold bath and such like hygienic measure for without a proper amount of daily exercise no one can remain healthy all the process of life demand exercise for the due performance of they function exercise not only of the part more immediately concerned but also of the whole body for as aristotle rightly say _ life be movement _ it be its very essence ceaseless and rapid motion go on in every part of the organism the heart with its complicated double systole and diastole beat strongly and untiringly with twenty-eight beat it have to drive the whole of the blood through artery vein and capillary the lung pump like a steam-engine without intermission the intestine be always in peristaltic action the gland be all constantly absorb and secrete even the brain have a double motion of its own with every beat of the pulse and every breath we draw when people can get no exercise at all as be the case with the countless number who be condemn to a sedentary life there be a glaring and fatal disproportion between outward inactivity and inner tumult for this ceaseless internal motion require some external counterpart and the want of it produce effect like those of emotion which we be oblige to suppress even tree must be shake by the wind if they be to thrive the rule which find its application here may be most briefly express in latin : _ omni motus quo celerior eo magis motus _ how much we happiness depend upon we spirit and these again upon we state of health may be see by compare the influence which the same external circumstance or event have upon we when we be well and strong with the effect which they have when we be depressed and trouble with ill-health it be not what thing be objectively and in themselves but what they be for we in we way of look at they that make we happy or the reverse as epictetus say _ man be not influence by thing but by they thought about thing _ and in general nine-tenth of we happiness depend upon health alone with health everything be a source of pleasure without it nothing else whatever it may be be enjoyable even the other personal blessing -- a great mind a happy temperament -- be degrade and dwarf for want of it so it be really with good reason that when two people meet the first thing they do be to inquire after each other 's health and to express the hope that it be good for good health be by far the most important element in human happiness it follow from all this that the greatest of folly be to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness whatever it may be for gain advancement learning or fame let alone then for fleeting sensual pleasure everything else should rather be postpone to it but however much health may contribute to that flow of good spirit which be so essential to we happiness good spirit do not entirely depend upon health for a man may be perfectly sound in he physique and still possess a melancholy temperament and be generally give up to sad thought the ultimate cause of this be undoubtedly to be find in innate and therefore unalterable physical constitution especially in the more or less normal relation of a man 's sensitiveness to he muscular and vital energy abnormal sensitiveness produce inequality of spirit a predominate melancholy with periodical fit of unrestrained liveliness a genius be one whose nervous power or sensitiveness be largely in excess as aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- have very correctly observe _ man distinguish in philosophy politics poetry or art appear to be all of a melancholy temperament _ this be doubtless the passage which cicero have in he mind when he say as he often do _ aristotele ait omne ingenioso melancholico esse _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- shakespeare have very neatly express this radical and innate diversity of temperament in those line in _ the merchant of venice _ : -lrb- footnote 1 : probl xxx ep 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : tusc i 33 -rrb- _ nature have frame strange fellow in she time some that will evermore peep through they eye and laugh like parrot at a bag-piper and other of such vinegar aspect that they 'll not show they tooth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable _ this be the difference which plato draw between -lrb- greek : eukolo -rrb- and -lrb- greek : dyskolo -rrb- -- the man of _ easy _ and the man of _ difficult _ disposition -- in proof of which he refer to the vary degree of susceptibility which different people show to pleasurable and painful impression so that one man will laugh at what make another despair as a rule the stronger the susceptibility to unpleasant impression the weaker be the susceptibility to pleasant one and _ vice versa _ if it be equally possible for a event to turn out well or ill the -lrb- greek : dyskolo -rrb- will be annoyed or grieve if the issue be unfavorable and will not rejoice should it be happy on the other hand the -lrb- greek : eukolo -rrb- will neither worry nor fret over a unfavorable issue but rejoice if it turn out well if the one be successful in nine out of ten undertaking he will not be pleased but rather annoy that one have miscarry whilst the other if only a single one succeed will manage to find consolation in the fact and remain cheerful but here be another instance of the truth that hardly any evil be entirely without its compensation for the misfortune and suffering which the -lrb- greek : auskolous -rrb- that be people of gloomy and anxious character have to overcome be on the whole more imaginary and therefore less real than those which befall the gay and careless for a man who paint everything black who constantly fear the worst and take measure accordingly will not be disappoint so often in this world as one who always look upon the bright side of thing and when a morbid affection of the nerve or a derangement of the digestive organ play into the hand of a innate tendency to gloom this tendency may reach such a height that permanent discomfort produce a weariness of life so arise a inclination to suicide which even the most trivial unpleasantness may actually bring about nay when the tendency attain its worst form it may be occasion by nothing in particular but a man may resolve to put a end to he existence simply because he be permanently unhappy and then coolly and firmly carry out he determination as may be see by the way in which the sufferer when place under supervision as he usually be eagerly wait to seize the first unguarded moment when without a shudder without a struggle or recoil he may use the now natural and welcome means of effect he release -lrb- 1 -rrb- even the healthiest perhaps even the most cheerful man may resolve upon death under certain circumstance when for instance he suffering or he fear of some inevitable misfortune reach such a pitch as to outweigh the terror of death the only difference lie in the degree of suffer necessary to bring about the fatal act a degree which will be high in the case of a cheerful and low in that of a gloomy man the greater the melancholy the lower need the degree be in the end it may even sink to zero but if a man be cheerful and he spirit be support by good health it require a high degree of suffer to make he lay hand upon himself there be countless step in the scale between the two extreme of suicide the suicide which spring merely from a morbid intensification of innate gloom and the suicide of the healthy and cheerful man who have entirely objective grounds for put a end to he existence -lrb- footnote 1 : for a detailed description of this condition of mind _ cf _ esquirol _ des maladies mentales _ -rrb- beauty be partly a affair of health it may be reckon as a personal advantage though it do not properly speak contribute directly to we happiness it do so indirectly by impress other people and it be no unimportant advantage even in man beauty be a open letter of recommendation predispose the heart to favor the person who present it as be well say in these line of homer the gift of beauty be not lightly to be throw away that glorious gift which none can bestow save the god alone -- -lrb- greek : outous hapoblaet ertus theon erikuoea dora os ken autous dosin ekon douk a ti eloito -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ iliad _ 3 65 -rrb- the most general survey show we that the two foe of human happiness be pain and boredom we may go further and say that in the degree in which we be fortunate enough to get away from the one we approach the other life present in fact a more or less violent oscillation between the two the reason of this be that each of these two pole stand in a double antagonism to the other external or objective and inner or subjective needy surroundings and poverty produce pain while if a man be more than well off he be bore accordingly while the lower class be engage in a ceaseless struggle with need in other word with pain the upper carry on a constant and often desperate battle with boredom -lrb- 1 -rrb- the inner or subjective antagonism arise from the fact that in the individual susceptibility to pain vary inversely with susceptibility to boredom because susceptibility be directly proportionate to mental power let I explain a dull mind be as a rule associate with dull sensibility nerve which no stimulus can affect a temperament in short which do not feel pain or anxiety very much however great or terrible it may be now intellectual dullness be at the bottom of that _ vacuity of soul _ which be stamp on so many face a state of mind which betray itself by a constant and lively attention to all the trivial circumstance in the external world this be the true source of boredom -- a continual panting after excitement in order to have a pretext for give the mind and spirit something to occupy they the kind of thing people choose for this purpose show that they be not very particular as witness the miserable pastime they have recourse to and they idea of social pleasure and conversation : or again the number of people who gossip on the doorstep or gape out of the window it be mainly because of this inner vacuity of soul that people go in quest of society diversion amusement luxury of every sort which lead many to extravagance and misery nothing be so good a protection against such misery as inward wealth the wealth of the mind because the greater it grow the less room it leave for boredom the inexhaustible activity of thought finding ever new material to work upon in the multifarious phenomenon of self and nature and able and ready to form new combination of they -- there you have something that invigorate the mind and apart from moment of relaxation set it far above the reach of boredom -lrb- footnote 1 : and the extreme meet for the lowest state of civilization a nomad or wander life find its counterpart in the highest where everyone be at time a tourist the earlier stage be a case of necessity the latter be a remedy for boredom -rrb- but on the other hand this high degree of intelligence be root in a high degree of susceptibility greater strength of will greater passionateness and from the union of these quality come a increase capacity for emotion a enhance sensibility to all mental and even bodily pain greater impatience of obstacle greater resentment of interruption -- all of which tendency be augment by the power of the imagination the vivid character of the whole range of thought include what be disagreeable this apply in various degree to every step in the long scale of mental power from the veriest dunce to the greatest genius that ever live therefore the nearer anyone be either from a subjective or from a objective point of view to one of those source of suffer in human life the farther he be from the other and so a man 's natural bent will lead he to make he objective world conform to he subjective as much as possible that be to say he will take the greatest measure against that form of suffer to which he be most liable the wise man will above all strive after freedom from pain and annoyance quiet and leisure consequently a tranquil modest life with as few encounter as may be and so after a little experience of he so-called fellowman he will elect to live in retirement or even if he be a man of great intellect in solitude for the more a man have in himself the less he will want from other people -- the less indeed other people can be to he this be why a high degree of intellect tend to make a man unsocial true if _ quality _ of intellect could be make up for by quantity it might be worth while to live even in the great world but unfortunately a hundred fool together will not make one wise man but the individual who stand at the other end of the scale be no sooner free from the pang of need than he endeavor to get pastime and society at any cost take up with the first person he meet and avoid nothing so much as himself for in solitude where every one be throw upon he own resource what a man have in himself come to light the fool in fine raiment groan under the burden of he miserable personality a burden which he can never throw off whilst the man of talent people the

sirach _ the life of a fool be worse than death _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and as a rule it will be find that a man be sociable just in the degree in which he be intellectually poor and generally vulgar for one 's choice in this world do not go much beyond solitude on one side and vulgarity on the other it be say that the most sociable of all people be the negro and they be at the bottom of the scale in intellect i remember reading once in a french paper -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the black in north america whether free or enslaved be fond of shut themselves up in large number in the smallest space because they can not have too much of one another 's snub-nosed company -lrb- footnote 1 : ecclesiasticus xxii 11 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ le commerce _ oct 19th 1837 -rrb- the brain may be regard as a kind of parasite of the organism a pensioner as it be who dwell with the body : and leisure that be the time one have for the free enjoyment of one 's consciousness or individuality be the fruit or produce of the rest of existence which be in general only labor and effort but what do most people 's leisure yield -- boredom and dullness except of course when it be occupy with sensual pleasure or folly how little such leisure be worth may be see in the way in which it be spend : and as ariosto observe how miserable be the idle hour of ignorant man -- _ ozio lungo d'uomini ignoranti _ ordinary people think merely how they shall _ spend _ they time a man of any talent try to _ use _ it the reason why people of limited intellect be apt to be bore be that they intellect be absolutely nothing more than the means by which the motive power of the will be put into force : and whenever there be nothing particular to set the will in motion it rest and they intellect take a holiday because equally with the will it require something external to bring it into play the result be a awful stagnation of whatever power a man have -- in a word boredom to counteract this miserable feeling man run to triviality which please for the moment they be take up hope thus to engage the will in order to rouse it to action and so set the intellect in motion for it be the latter which have to give effect to these motive of the will compare with real and natural motive these be but as paper money to coin for they value be only arbitrary -- card game and the like which have be invent for this very purpose and if there be nothing else to be do a man will twirl he thumb or beat the devil 's tattoo or a cigar may be a welcome substitute for exercise he brain hence in all country the chief occupation of society be card-playing -lrb- 1 -rrb- and it be the gauge of its value and a outward sign that it be bankrupt in thought because people have no thought to deal in they deal card and try and win one another 's money idiot but i do not wish to be unjust so let I remark that it may certainly be say in defense of card-playing that it be a preparation for the world and for business life because one learn thereby how to make a clever use of fortuitous but unalterable circumstance -lrb- card in this case -rrb- and to get as much out of they as one can : and to do this a man must learn a little dissimulation and how to put a good face upon a bad business but on the other hand it be exactly for this reason that card-playing be so demoralizing since the whole object of it be to employ every kind of trick and machination in order to win what belong to another and a habit of this sort learn at the card-table strike root and push its way into practical life and in the affair of every day a man gradually come to regard _ meum _ and _ tuum _ in much the same light as card and to consider that he may use to the utmost whatever advantage he possess so long as he do not come within the arm of the law example of what i mean be of daily occurrence in mercantile life since then leisure be the flower or rather the fruit of existence as it put a man into possession of himself those be happy indeed who possess something real in themselves but what do you get from most people 's leisure -- only a good-for-nothing fellow who be terribly bored and a burden to himself let we therefore rejoice dear brethren for _ we be not child of the bondwoman but of the free _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- card-playing to this extent be now no doubt a thing of the past at any rate amongst the nation of northern europe the present fashion be rather in favor of a dilettante interest in art or literature -rrb- further as no land be so well off as that which require few import or none at all so the happiest man be one who have enough in he own inner wealth and require little or nothing from outside for he maintenance for import be expensive thing reveal dependence entail danger occasion trouble and when all be say and do be a poor substitute for home produce no man ought to expect much from other or in general from the external world what one human be can be to another be not a very great deal : in the end every one stand alone and the important thing be _ who _ it be that stand alone here then be another application of the general truth which goethe recognize in _ dichtung und wahrheit _ -lrb- bk iii -rrb- that in everything a man have ultimately to appeal to himself or as goldsmith put it in _ the traveller _ : _ still to ourselves in every place consign would we own felicity we make or find _ himself be the source of the best and most a man can be or achieve the more this be so -- the more a man find he source of pleasure in himself -- the happier he will be therefore it be with great truth that aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- say _ to be happy means to be self-sufficient _ for all other source of happiness be in they nature most uncertain precarious fleeting the sport of chance and so even under the most favorable circumstance they can easily be exhaust nay this be unavoidable because they be not always within reach and in old age these source of happiness must necessarily dry up : -- love leave we then and wit desire to travel delight in horse aptitude for social intercourse friend and relation too be take from we by death then more than ever it depend upon what a man have in himself for this will stick to he longest and at any period of life it be the only genuine and lasting source of happiness there be not much to be get anywhere in the world it be fill with misery and pain and if a man escape these boredom lie in wait for he at every corner nay more it be evil which generally have the upper hand and folly make the most noise fate be cruel and mankind be pitiable in such a world as this a man who be rich in himself be like a bright warm happy room at christmastide while without be the frost and snow of a December night therefore without doubt the happiest destiny on earth be to have the rare gift of a rich individuality and more especially to be possess of a good endowment of intellect this be the happiest destiny though it may not be after all a very brilliant one -lrb- footnote 1 : eth eud vii 2 -rrb- there be a great wisdom in that remark which queen christina of sweden make in she nineteenth year about descarte who have then live for twenty year in the deepest solitude in holland and apart from report be know to she only by a single essay : _ m descarte _ she say _ be the happiest of man and he condition seem to I much to be envy -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ of course as be the case with descarte external circumstance must be favorable enough to allow a man to be master of he life and happiness or as we read in _ ecclesiaste _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- -- _ wisdom be good together with a inheritance and profitable unto they that see the sun _ the man to whom nature and fate have grant the blessing of wisdom will be most anxious and careful to keep open the fountain of happiness which he have in himself and for this independence and leisure be necessary to obtain they he will be willing to moderate he desire and harbor he resource all the more because he be not like other restricted to the external world for he pleasure so he will not be mislead by expectation of office or money or the favor and applause of he fellowman into surrender himself in order to conform to low desire and vulgar taste nay in such a case he will follow the advice that horace give in he epistle to maecena -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb-

honor this be what goethe do my good luck draw I quite in the other direction the truth which i be insist upon here the truth namely that the chief source of human happiness be internal be confirm by that most accurate observation of aristotle in the _ nichomachean ethic _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- that every pleasure presuppose some sort of activity the application of some sort of power without which it can not exist the doctrine of aristotle 's that a man 's happiness consist in the free exercise of he highest faculty be also enunciate by stobaeus in he exposition of the peripatetic philosophy -lrb- 2 -rrb- : _ happiness _ he say _ mean vigorous and successful activity in all you undertaking _ and he explain that by _ vigor -lrb- greek : areta -rrb- _ he mean _ mastery _ in any thing whatever it be now the original purpose of those force with which nature have endowed man be to enable he to struggle against the difficulty which beset he on all side but if this struggle come to a end he unemployed force become a burden to he and he have to set to work and play with they -- to use they i mean for no purpose at all beyond avoid the other source of human suffering boredom to which he be at once expose it be the upper class people of wealth who be the greatest victim of boredom lucretius long ago describe they miserable state and the truth of he description may be still recognize to-day in the life of every great capital -- where the rich man be seldom in he own hall because it bore he to be there and still he return thither because he be no better off outside -- or else he be away in post-haste to he house in the country as if it be on fire and he be no sooner arrive there than he be bore again and seek to forget everything in sleep or else hurry back to town once more

unlike those of the mind can not maintain they full degree of vigor very long and in later year they either have no mental power at all or can not develop any for want of employment which would bring they into play so that they be in a wretched plight _ will _ however they still possess for this be the only power that be inexhaustible and they try to stimulate they will by passionate excitement such as game of chance for high stake -- undoubtedly a most degrading form of vice and one may say generally that if a man find himself with nothing to do he be sure to choose some amusement suit to the kind of power in which he excel -- bowl it may be or chess hunting or painting horse-racing or music card or poetry heraldry philosophy or some other dilettante interest we might classify these interest methodically by reduce they to expression of the three fundamental power the factor that be to say which go to make up the physiological constitution of man and further by consider these power by themselves and apart from any of the definite aim which they may subserve and simply as afford three source of possible pleasure out of which every man will choose what suit he accord as he excel in one direction or another first of all come the pleasure of _ vital energy _ of food drink digestion rest and sleep and there be part of the world where it can be say that these be characteristic and national pleasure secondly there be the pleasure of _ muscular energy _ such as walk run wrestling dancing fencing ride and similar athletic pursuit which sometimes take the form of sport and sometimes of a military life and real warfare thirdly there be the pleasure of sensibility such as observation think feeling or a taste for poetry or culture music learn reading meditation invention philosophy and the like as regard the value relative worth and duration of each of these kind of pleasure a great deal might be say which however i leave the reader to supply but every one will see that the nobler the power which be bring into play the greater will be the pleasure which it give for pleasure always involve the use of one 's own power and happiness consist in a frequent repetition of pleasure no one will deny that in this respect the pleasure of sensibility occupy a higher place than either of the other two fundamental kind which exist in a equal nay in a greater degree in brute it be this preponderating amount of sensibility which distinguish man from other animal now we mental power be form of sensibility and therefore a preponderate amount of it make we capable of that kind of pleasure which have to do with mind so-called intellectual pleasure and the more sensibility predominate the greater the pleasure will be -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : nature exhibit a continual progress start from the mechanical and chemical activity of the inorganic world proceed to the vegetable with its dull enjoyment of self from that to the animal world where intelligence and consciousness begin at first very weak and only after many intermediate stage attain its last great development in man whose intellect be nature 's crowning point the goal of all she effort the most perfect and difficult of all she work and even within the range of the human intellect there be a great many observable difference of degree and it be very seldom that intellect reach its highest point intelligence properly so-called which in this narrow and strict sense of the word be nature 's most consummate product and so the rarest and most precious thing of which the world can boast the highest product of nature be the clearest degree of consciousness in which the world mirror itself more plainly and completely than anywhere else a man endow with this form of intelligence be in possession of what be noblest and best on earth and accordingly he have a source of pleasure in comparison with which all other be small from he surroundings he ask nothing but leisure for the free enjoyment of what he have get time as it be to polish he diamond all other pleasure that be not of the intellect be of a lower kind for they be one and all movement of will -- desire hope fear and ambition no matter to what direct : they be always satisfy at the cost of pain and in the case of ambition generally with more or less of illusion with intellectual pleasure on the other hand truth become clearer and clearer in the realm of intelligence pain have no power knowledge be all in all further intellectual pleasure be accessible entirely and only through the medium of the intelligence and be limit by its capacity _ for all the wit there be in the world be useless to he who have none _ still this advantage be accompany by a substantial disadvantage for the whole of nature show that with the growth of intelligence come increase capacity for pain and it be only with the highest degree of intelligence that suffer reach its supreme point -rrb- the normal ordinary man take a vivid interest in anything only in so far as it excite he will that be to say be a matter of personal interest to he but constant excitement of the will be never a unmixed good to say the least in other word it involve pain card-playing that universal occupation of good society everywhere be a device for provide this kind of excitement and that too by means of interest so small as to produce slight and momentary instead of real and permanent pain card-playing be in fact a mere tickling of the will -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ vulgarity _ be at bottom the kind of consciousness in which the will completely predominate over the intellect where the latter do nothing more than perform the service of its master the will therefore when the will make no demand supply no motive strong or weak the intellect entirely lose its power and the result be complete vacancy of mind now _ will without intellect _ be the most vulgar and common thing in the world possess by every blockhead who in the gratification of he passion show the stuff of which he be make this be the condition of mind call _ vulgarity _ in which the only active element be the organ of sense and that small amount of intellect which be necessary for apprehend the datum of sense accordingly the vulgar man be constantly open to all sort of impression and immediately perceive all the little trifling thing that go on in he environment : the lightest whisper the most trivial circumstance be sufficient to rouse he attention he be just like a animal such a man 's mental condition reveal itself in he face in he whole exterior and hence that vulgar repulsive appearance which be all the more offensive if as be usually the case he will -- the only factor in he consciousness -- be a base selfish and altogether bad one -rrb- on the other hand a man of powerful intellect be capable of take a vivid interest in thing in the way of mere _ knowledge _ with no admixture of _ will _ nay such a interest be a necessity to he it place he in a sphere where pain be a alien -- a diviner air where the god live serene _ -lrb- greek : phusis bebion ou ta chraematatheous reium xoonte -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ -lrb- footnote 1 : odyssey iv 805 -rrb- look on these two picture -- the life of the mass one long dull record of struggle and effort entirely devote to the petty interest of personal welfare to misery in all its form a life beset by intolerable boredom as soon as ever those aim be satisfied and the man be throw back upon himself whence he can be rouse again to some sort of movement only by the wild fire of passion on the other side you have a man endow with a high degree of mental power lead a existence rich in thought and full of life and meaning occupy by worthy and interesting object as soon as ever he be free to give himself to they bear in himself a source of the noblest pleasure what external prompting he want come from the work of nature and from the contemplation of human affair and the achievement of the great of all age and country which be thoroughly appreciate by a man of this type alone as be the only one who can quite understand and feel with they and so it be for he alone that those great one have really live it be to he that they make they appeal the rest be but casual hearer who only half understand either they or they follower of course this characteristic of the intellectual man imply that he have one more need than the other the need of read observe study meditate practise the need in short of undisturbed leisure for as voltaire have very rightly say _ there be no real pleasure without real need _ and the need of they be why to such a man pleasure be accessible which be deny to other -- the varied beauty of nature and art and literature to heap these pleasure round people who do not want they and can not appreciate they be like expect gray hair to fall in love a man who be privileged in this respect lead two live a personal and a intellectual life and the latter gradually come to be look upon as the true one and the former as merely a means to it other people make this shallow empty and troubled existence a end in itself to the life of the intellect such a man will give the preference over all he other occupation : by the constant growth of insight and knowledge this intellectual life like a slowly-forming work of art will acquire a consistency a permanent intensity a unity which become ever more and more complete compare with which a life devote to the attainment of personal comfort a life that may broaden indeed but can never be deepen make but a poor show : and yet as i have say people make this baser sort of existence a end in itself the ordinary life of every day so far as it be not move by passion be tedious and insipid and if it be so move it soon become painful those alone be happy whom nature have favor with some superfluity of intellect something beyond what be just necessary to carry out the behest of they will for it enable they to lead a intellectual life as well a life unattended by pain and full of vivid interest mere leisure that be to say intellect unoccupied in the service of the will be not of itself sufficient : there must be a real superfluity of power set free from the service of the will and devote to that of the intellect for as seneca say _ otium sine litteri mor est et vivi hominis sepultura _ -- illiterate leisure be a form of death a living tomb vary with the amount of the superfluity there will be countless development in this second life the life of the mind it may be the mere collection and labeling of insect bird mineral coin or the highest achievement of poetry and philosophy the life of the mind be not only a protection against boredom it also ward off the pernicious effect of boredom it keep we from bad company from the many danger misfortune loss and extravagance which the man who place he happiness entirely in the objective world be sure to encounter my philosophy for instance have never bring I in a six-penny but it have spare I many a expense the ordinary man place he life 's happiness in thing external to he in property rank wife and child friend society and the like so that when he lose they or find they disappointing the foundation of he happiness be destroy in other word he center of gravity be not in himself it be constantly change its place with every wish and whim if he be a man of means one day it will be he house in the country another buy horse or entertaining friend or travel -- a life in short of general luxury the reason be that he seek he pleasure in thing outside he like one whose health and strength be go he try to regain by the use of jelly and drug instead of by develop he own vital power the true source of what he have lose before proceed to the opposite let we compare with this common type the man who come midway between the two endowed it may be not exactly with distinguished power of mind but with somewhat more than the ordinary amount of intellect he will take a dilettante interest in art or devote he attention to some branch of science -- botany for example or physics astronomy history and find a great deal of pleasure in such study and amuse himself with they when external force of happiness be exhaust or fail to satisfy he any more of a man like this it may be say that he center of gravity be partly in himself but a dilettante interest in art be a very different thing from creative activity and a amateur pursuit of science be apt to be superficial and not to penetrate to the heart of the matter a man can not entirely identify himself with such pursuit or have he whole existence so completely fill and permeate with they that he lose all interest in everything else it be only the highest intellectual power what we call _ genius _ that attain to this degree of intensity make all time and existence its theme and strive to express its peculiar conception of the world whether it contemplate life as the subject of poetry or of philosophy hence undisturbed occupation with himself he own thought and work be a matter of urgent necessity to such a man solitude be welcome leisure be the highest good and everything else be unnecessary nay even burdensome this be the only type of man of whom it can be say that he center of gravity be entirely in himself which explain why it be that people of this sort -- and they be very rare -- no matter how excellent they character may be do not show that warm and unlimited interest in friend family and the community in general of which other be so often capable for if they have only themselves they be not inconsolable for the loss of everything else this give a isolation to they character which be all the more effective since other people never really quite satisfy they as be on the whole of a different nature : nay more since this difference be constantly force itself upon they notice they get accustom to move about amongst mankind as alien being and in thinking of humanity in general to say _ they _ instead of _ we _ so the conclusion we come to be that the man whom nature have endow with intellectual wealth be the happiest so true it be that the subjective concern we more than the objective for whatever the latter may be it can work only indirectly secondly and through the medium of the former -- a truth finely express by lucian : -- -lrb- greek : _ aelouto ho tae psychae ploutus mono estin alaethae talla dechei ataen pleiona ton kteanon _ -- -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : epigrammata 12 -rrb- the wealth of the soul be the only true wealth for with all other riches come a bane even greater than they the man of inner wealth want nothing from outside but the negative gift of undisturbed leisure to develop and mature he intellectual faculty that be to enjoy he wealth in short he want permission to be himself he whole life long every day and every hour if he be destine to impress the character of he mind upon a whole race he have only one measure of happiness or unhappiness -- to succeed or fail in perfect he power and complete he work all else be of small consequence accordingly the greatest mind of all age have set the highest value upon undisturbed leisure as worth exactly as much as the man himself _ happiness appear to consist in leisure _ say aristotle -lrb- 1 -rrb- and diogene laertius report that _ socrate praise leisure as the fairest of all possession _ so in the _ nichomachean ethic _ aristotle conclude that a life devote to philosophy be the happiest or as he say in the _ politics -lrb- 2 -rrb- the free exercise of any power whatever it may be be happiness _ this again tally with what goethe say in _ wilhelm meister : the man who be bear with a talent which he be mean to use find he greatest happiness in use it _ -lrb- footnote 1 : eth nichom x 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : iv 11 -rrb- but to be in possession of undisturbed leisure be far from be the common lot nay it be something alien to human nature for the ordinary man 's destiny be to spend life in procure what be necessary for the subsistence of himself and he family he be a son of struggle and need not a free intelligence so people as a rule soon get tire of undisturbed leisure and it become burdensome if there be no fictitious and forced aim to occupy it play pastime and hobby of every kind for this very reason it be full of possible danger and _ difficili in otio quie _ be a true say -- it be difficult to keep quiet if you have nothing to do on the other hand a measure of intellect far surpass the ordinary be as unnatural as it be abnormal but if it exist and the man endow with it be to be happy he will want precisely that undisturbed leisure which the other find burdensome or pernicious for without it he be a pegasus in harness and consequently unhappy if these two unnatural circumstance external and internal undisturbed leisure and great intellect happen to coincide in the same person it be a great piece of fortune and if the fate be so far favorable a man can lead the higher life the life protect from the two opposite source of human suffering pain and boredom from the painful struggle for existence and the incapacity for endure leisure -lrb- which be free existence itself -rrb- -- evil which may be escape only by be mutually neutralized but there be something to be say in opposition to this view great intellectual gift mean a activity pre-eminently nervous in its character and consequently a very high degree of susceptibility to pain in every form further such gift imply a intense temperament larger and more vivid idea which as the inseparable accompaniment of great intellectual power entail on its possessor a corresponding intensity of the emotion make they incomparably more violent than those to which the ordinary man be a prey now there be more thing in the world productive of pain than of pleasure again a large endowment of intellect tend to estrange the man who have it from other people and they doings for the more a man have in himself the less he will be able to find in they and the hundred thing in which they take delight he will think shallow and insipid here then perhaps be another instance of that law of compensation which make itself feel everywhere how often one hear it say and say too with some plausibility that the narrow-minded man be at bottom the happiest even though he fortune be unenviable i shall make no attempt to forestall the reader 's own judgment on this point more especially as sophocle himself have give utterance to two diametrically opposite opinion : -- -lrb- greek : pollo to phronein eudaimonia proton uparcheus -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- he say in one place -- wisdom be the greatest part of happiness and again in another passage he declare that the life of the thoughtless be the most pleasant of all -- -lrb- greek : en ta phronein gar maeden aedisto bio -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- the philosopher of the _ old testament _ find themselves in a like contradiction _ the life of a fool be worse than death _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- and -- _ in much wisdom be much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : antigone 1347-8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : ajax 554 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : ecclesiasticus xxii 11 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : ecclesiaste i 18 -rrb- i may remark however that a man who have no mental need because he intellect be of the narrow and normal amount be in the strict sense of the word what be call a _ philistine _ -- a expression at first peculiar to the german language a kind of slang term at the university afterwards use by analogy in a higher sense though still in its original meaning as denote one who be not _ a son of the muse _ a philistine be and remain -lrb- greek : amouso anaer -rrb- i should prefer to take a higher point of view and apply the term _ philistine _ to people who be always seriously occupy with reality which be no reality but as such a definition would be a transcendental one and therefore not generally intelligible it would hardly be in place in the present treatise which aim at be popular the other definition can be more easily elucidate indicate as it do satisfactorily enough the essential nature of all those quality which distinguish the philistine he be define to be _ a man without mental need _ from this be follow firstly _ in relation to himself _ that he have _ no intellectual pleasure _ for as be remark before there be no real pleasure without real need the philistine 's life be animated by no desire to gain knowledge and insight for they own sake or to experience that true aeesthetic pleasure which be so nearly akin to they if pleasure of this kind be fashionable and the philistine find himself compel to pay attention to they he will force himself to do so but he will take as little interest in they as possible he only real pleasure be of a sensual kind and he think that these indemnify he for the loss of the other to he oyster and champagne be the height of existence the aim of he life be to procure what will contribute to he bodily welfare and he be indeed in a happy way if this cause he some trouble if the luxury of life be heap upon he he will inevitably be bore and against boredom he have a great many fancy remedy ball theater party card gamble horse woman drink travel and so on all of which can not protect a man from be bore for where there be no intellectual need no intellectual pleasure be possible the peculiar characteristic of the philistine be a dull dry kind of gravity akin to that of animal nothing really please or excite or interest he for sensual pleasure be quickly exhaust and the society of philistine soon become burdensome and one may even get tire of play card true the pleasure of vanity be leave pleasure which he enjoy in he own way either by feel himself superior in point of wealth or rank or influence and power to other people who thereupon pay he honor or at any rate by go about with those who have a superfluity of these blessing sun himself in the reflection of they splendor -- what the english call a _ snob _ from the essential nature of the philistine it follow secondly _ in regard to other _ that as he possess no intellectual but only physical need he will seek the society of those who can satisfy the latter but not the former the last thing he will expect from he friend be the possession of any sort of intellectual capacity nay if he chance to meet with it it will rouse he antipathy and even hatred simply because in addition to a unpleasant sense of inferiority he experience in he heart a dull kind of envy which have to be carefully conceal even from himself nevertheless it sometimes grow into a secret feeling of rancor but for all that it will never occur to he to make he own idea of worth or value conform to the standard of such quality he will continue to give the preference to rank and riches power and influence which in he eye seem to be the only genuine advantage in the world and he wish will be to excel in they himself all this be the consequence of he be a man _ without intellectual need _ the great affliction of all philistine be that they have no interest in _ idea _ and that to escape be bore they be in constant need of _ reality _ but reality be either unsatisfactory or dangerous when they lose they interest they become fatiguing but the ideal world be illimitable and calm _ something afar from the sphere of we sorrow _ note -- in these remark on the personal quality which go to make happiness i have be mainly concern with the physical and intellectual nature of man for a account of the direct and immediate influence of _ morality _ upon happiness let I refer to my prize essay on _ the foundation of moral _ -lrb- sec 22 -rrb- chapter iii property or what a man have epicurus divide the need of mankind into three class and the division make by this great professor of happiness be a true and a fine one first come natural and necessary need such as when not satisfied produce pain -- food and clothing _ victus et amictus _ need which can easily be satisfied secondly there be those need which though natural be not necessary such as the gratification of certain of the sens i may add however that in the report give by diogene laertius epicurus do not mention which of the sens he mean so that on this point my account of he doctrine be somewhat more definite and exact than the original these be need rather more difficult to satisfy the third class consist of need which be neither natural nor necessary the need of luxury and prodigality show and splendor which never come to a end and be very hard to satisfy -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : cf diogene laertius bk x ch xxvii pp 127 and 149 also cicero _ de finibus _ i 13 -rrb- it be difficult if not impossible to define the limit which reason should impose on the desire for wealth for there be no absolute or definite amount of wealth which will satisfy a man the amount be always relative that be to say just so much as will maintain the proportion between what he want and what he get for to measure a man 's happiness only by what he get and not also by what he expect to get be as futile as to try and express a fraction which shall have a numerator but no denominator a man never feel the loss of thing which it never occur to he to ask for he be just as happy without they whilst another who may have a hundred time as much feel miserable because he have not get the one thing he want in fact here too every man have a horizon of he own and he will expect as much as he think it be possible for he to get if a object within he horizon look as though he could confidently reckon on get it he be happy but if difficulty come in the way he be miserable what lie beyond he horizon have no effect at all upon he so it be that the vast possession of the rich do not agitate the poor and conversely that a wealthy man be not console by all he wealth for the failure of he hope riches one may say be like sea-water the more you drink the thirstier you become and the same be true of fame the loss of wealth and prosperity leave a man as soon as the first pang of grief be over in very much the same habitual temper as before and the reason of this be that as soon as fate diminish the amount of he possession he himself immediately reduce the amount of he claim but when misfortune come upon we to reduce the amount of we claim be just what be most painful once that we have do so the pain become less and less and be feel no more like a old wound which have heal conversely when a piece of good fortune befall we we claim mount higher and higher as there be nothing to regulate they it be in this feeling of expansion that the delight of it lie but it last no longer than the process itself and when the expansion be complete the delight cease we have become accustomed to the increase in we claim and consequently indifferent to the amount of wealth which satisfy they there be a passage in the _ odyssey _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- illustrate this truth of which i may quote the last two line : -lrb- greek : toio gar noo estin epichthonion anthropon oion eth aemar ageus pataer andron te theou te -rrb- -- the thought of man that dwell on the earth be as the day grant he by the father of god and man discontent spring from a constant endeavor to increase the amount of we claim when we be powerless to increase the amount which will satisfy they -lrb- footnote 1 : xviii 130-7 -rrb- when we consider how full of need the human race be how its whole existence be base upon they it be not a matter for surprise that _ wealth _ be hold in more sincere esteem nay in greater honor than anything else in the world nor ought we to wonder that gain be make the only good of life and everything that do not lead to it push aside or throw overboard -- philosophy for instance by those who profess it people be often reproach for wish for money above all thing and for love it more than anything else but it be natural and even inevitable for people to love that which like a unwearied proteus be always ready to turn itself into whatever object they wander wish or manifold desire may for the moment fix upon everything else can satisfy only _ one _ wish _ one _ need : food be good only if you be hungry wine if you be able to enjoy it drug if you be sick fur for the winter love for youth and so on these be all only relatively good -lrb- greek : agatha pro ti -rrb- money alone be absolutely good because it be not only a concrete satisfaction of one need in particular it be a abstract satisfaction of all if a man have a independent fortune he should regard it as a bulwark against the many evil and misfortune which he may encounter he should not look upon it as give he leave to get what pleasure he can out of the world or as render it incumbent upon he to spend it in this way people who be not bear with a fortune but end by make a large one through the exercise of whatever talent they possess almost always come to think that they talent be they capital and that the money they have gain be merely the interest upon it they do not lay by a part of they earnings to form a permanent capital but spend they money much as they have earn it accordingly they often fall into poverty they earnings decrease or come to a end altogether either because they talent be exhaust by become antiquated -- as for instance very often happen in the case of fine art or else it be valid only under a special conjunction of circumstance which have now pass away there be nothing to prevent those who live on the common labor of they hand from treat they earnings in that way if they like because they kind of skill be not likely to disappear or if it do it can be replace by that of they fellow-workmen morever the kind of work they do be always in demand so that what the proverb say be quite true _ a useful trade be a mine of gold _ but with artist and professional of every kind the case be quite different and that be the reason why they be well pay they ought to build up a capital out of they earnings but they recklessly look upon they as merely interest and end in ruin on the other hand people who inherit money know at least how to distinguish between capital and interest and most of they try to make they capital secure and not encroach upon it nay if they can they put by at least a eighth of they interest in order to meet future contingency so most of they maintain they position these few remark about capital and interest be not applicable to commercial life for merchant look upon money only as a means of further gain just as a workman regard he tool so even if they capital have be entirely the result of they own effort they try to preserve and increase it by use it accordingly wealth be nowhere so much at home as in the merchant class it will generally be find that those who know what it be to have be in need and destitution be very much less afraid of it and consequently more inclined to extravagance than those who know poverty only by hearsay people who have be bear and breed in good circumstance be as a rule much more careful about the future more economical in fact than those who by a piece of good luck have suddenly pass from poverty to wealth this look as if poverty be not really such a very wretched thing as it appear from a distance the true reason however be rather the fact that the man who have be bear into a position of wealth come to look upon it as something without which he could no more live than he could live without air he guard it as he do he very life and so he be generally a lover of order prudent and economical but the man who have be bear into a poor position look upon it as the natural one and if by any chance he come in for a fortune he regard it as a superfluity something to be enjoy or waste because if it come to a end he can get on just as well as before with one anxiety the less or as shakespeare say in henry vi -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ the adage must be verify that beggar mount run they horse to death _ -lrb- footnote 1 : part iii act 1 sc 4 -rrb- but it should be say that people of this kind have a firm and excessive trust partly in fate partly in the peculiar means which have already raise they out of need and poverty -- a trust not only of the head but of the heart also and so they do not like the man bear rich look upon the shallows of poverty as bottomless but console themselves with the thought that once they have touch ground again they can take another upward flight it be this trait in human character which explain the fact that woman who be poor before they marriage often make greater claim and be more extravagant than those who have bring they husband a rich dowry because as a rule rich girl bring with they not only a fortune but also more eagerness nay more of the inherit instinct to preserve it than poor girl do if anyone doubt the truth of this and think that it be just the opposite he will find authority for he view in ariosto 's first satire but on the other hand dr johnson agree with my opinion _ a woman of fortune _ he say _ be use to the handling of money spend it judiciously but a woman who get the command of money for the first time upon she marriage have such a gusto in spend it that she throw it away with great profusion _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and in any case let I advise anyone who marry a poor girl not to leave she the capital but only the interest and to take especial care that she have not the management of the child 's fortune -lrb- footnote 1 : boswell 's life of johnson : ann : 1776 aetat : 67 -rrb- i do not by any means think that i be touch upon a subject which be not worth my while to mention when i recommend people to be careful to preserve what they have earn or inherit for to start life with just as much as will make one independent that be allow one to live comfortably without have to work -- even if one have only just enough for oneself not to speak of a family -- be a advantage which can not be over-estimate for it mean exemption and immunity from that chronic disease of penury which fasten on the life of man like a plague it be emancipation from that force labor which be the natural lot of every mortal only under a favorable fate like this can a man be say to be bear free to be in the proper sense of the word _ suus juri _ master of he own time and power and able to say every morning _ this day be my own _ and just for the same reason the difference between the man who have a hundred a year and the man who have a thousand be infinitely smaller than the difference between the former and a man who have nothing at all but inherit wealth reach its utmost value when it fall to the individual endowed with mental power of a high order who be resolve to pursue a line of life not compatible with the making of money for he be then doubly endowed by fate and can live for he genius and he will pay he debt to mankind a hundred time by achieve what no other could achieve by produce some work which contribute to the general good and redound to the honor of humanity at large another again may use he wealth to further philanthropic scheme and make himself well-deserving of he fellowman but a man who do none of these thing who do not even try to do they who never attempt to learn the rudiment of any branch of knowledge so that he may at least do what he can towards promote it -- such a one bear as he be into riches be a mere idler and thief of time a contemptible fellow he will not even be happy because in he case exemption from need deliver he up to the other extreme of human suffering boredom which be such martyrdom to he that he would have be better off if poverty have give he something to do and as he be bore he be apt to be extravagant and so lose the advantage of which he show himself unworthy countless number of people find themselves in want simply because when they have money they spend it only to get momentary relief from the feeling of boredom which oppress they it be quite another matter if one 's object be success in political life where favor friend and connection be all-important in order to mount by they aid step by step on the ladder of promotion and perhaps gain the topmost ring in this kind of life it be much better to be cast upon the world without a penny and if the aspirant be not of noble family but be a man of some talent it will redound to he advantage to be a absolute pauper for what every one most aim at in ordinary contact with he fellow be to prove they inferior to himself and how much more be this the case in politics now it be only a absolute pauper who have such a thorough conviction of he own complete profound and positive inferiority from every point of view of he own utter insignificance and worthlessness that he can take he place quietly in the political machine -lrb- 1 -rrb- he be the only one who can keep on bow low enough and even go right down upon he face if necessary he alone can submit to everything and laugh at it he alone know the entire worthlessness of merit he alone use he loudest voice and he boldest type whenever he have to speak or write of those who be place over he head or occupy any position of influence and if they do a little scribble he be ready to applaud it as a masterwork he alone understand how to beg and so betime when he be hardly out of he boyhood he become a high priest of that hidden mystery which goethe bring to light _ uber 's niederträchtige niemand sich beklage : denn e ist da machtige be man dir auch sage _ : -- it be no use to complain of low aim for whatever people may say they rule the world -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- schopenhauer be probably here make one of he most virulent attack upon hegel in this case on account of what he think to be the philosopher 's abject servility to the government of he day though the hegelian system have be the fruitful mother of many liberal idea there can be no doubt that hegel 's influence in he own lifetime be a effective support of prussian bureaucracy -rrb- on the other hand the man who be bear with enough to live upon be generally of a somewhat independent turn of mind he be accustom to keep he head up he have not learn all the art of the beggar perhaps he even presume a little upon the possession of talent which as he ought to know can never compete with cringe mediocrity in the long run he come to recognize the inferiority of those who be place over he head and when they try to put insult upon he he become refractory and shy this be not the way to get on in the world nay such a man may at least incline to the opinion freely express by voltaire : _ we have only two day to live it be not worth we while to spend they _ in cringe to contemptible rascal but alas let I observe by the way that _ contemptible rascal _ be a attribute which may be predicate of a abominable number of people what juvenal say -- it be difficult to rise if you poverty be greater than you talent -- _ haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat re angusta domus _ -- be more applicable to a career of art and literature than to a political and social ambition wife and child i have not reckon amongst a man 's possession : he be rather in they possession it would be easier to include friend under that head but a man 's friend belong to he not a whit more than he belong to they chapter iv position or a man 's place in the estimation of other _ section 1 -- reputation _ by a peculiar weakness of human nature people generally think too much about the opinion which other form of they although the slightest reflection will show that this opinion whatever it may be be not in itself essential to happiness therefore it be hard to understand why everybody feel so very pleased when he see that other people have a good opinion of he or say anything flattering to he vanity if you stroke a cat it will purr and as inevitably if you praise a man a sweet expression of delight will appear on he face and even though the praise be a palpable lie it will be welcome if the matter be one on which he pride himself if only other people will applaud he a man may console himself for downright misfortune or for the pittance he get from the two source of human happiness already discuss : and conversely it be astonishing how infallibly a man will be annoyed and in some case deeply pained by any wrong do to he feeling of self-importance whatever be the nature degree or circumstance of the injury or by any depreciation slight or disregard if the feeling of honor rest upon this peculiarity of human nature it may have a very salutary effect upon the welfare of a great many people as a substitute for morality but upon they happiness more especially upon that peace of mind and independence which be so essential to happiness its effect will be disturbing and prejudicial rather than salutary therefore it be advisable from we point of view to set limit to this weakness and duly to consider and rightly to estimate the relative value of advantage and thus temper as far as possible this great susceptibility to other people 's opinion whether the opinion be one flattering to we vanity or whether it cause we pain for in either case it be the same feeling which be touch otherwise a man be the slave of what other people be pleased to think -- and how little it require to disconcert or soothe the mind that be greedy of praise : _ sic leve sic parvum est animum quod laudi avarum subruit ac reficit _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : horace epist : ii 1 180 -rrb- therefore it will very much conduce to we happiness if we duly compare the value of what a man be in and for himself with what he be in the eye of other under the former cony everything that fill up the span of we existence and make it what it be in short all the advantage already consider and sum up under the head of personality and property and the sphere in which all this take place be the man 's own consciousness on the other hand the sphere of what we be for other people be they consciousness not ours it be the kind of figure we make in they eye together with the thought which this arouse -lrb- 1 -rrb- but this be something which have no direct and immediate existence for we but can affect we only mediately and indirectly so far that be as other people 's behavior towards we be direct by it and even then it ought to affect we only in so far as it can move we to modify _ what we be in and for ourselves _ apart from this what go on in other people 's consciousness be as such a matter of indifference to we and in time we get really indifferent to it when we come to see how superficial and futile be most people 's thought how narrow they idea how mean they sentiment how perverse they opinion and how much of error there be in most of they when we learn by experience with what depreciation a man will speak of he fellow when he be not oblige to fear he or think that what he say will not come to he ear and if ever we have have a opportunity of see how the greatest of man will meet with nothing but slight from half-a-dozen blockhead we shall understand that to lay great value upon what other people say be to pay they too much honor -lrb- footnote 1 : let I remark that people in the highest position in life with all they brilliance pomp display magnificence and general show may well say : -- we happiness lie entirely outside we for it exist only in the head of other -rrb- at all event a man be in a very bad way who find no source of happiness in the first two class of blessing already treat of but have to seek it in the third in other word not in what he be in himself but in what he be in the opinion of other for after all the foundation of we whole nature and therefore of we happiness be we physique and the most essential factor in happiness be health and next in importance after health the ability to maintain ourselves in independence and freedom from care there can be no competition or compensation between these essential factor on the one side and honor pomp rank and reputation on the other however much value we may set upon the latter no one would hesitate to sacrifice the latter for the former if it be necessary we should add very much to we happiness by a timely recognition of the simple truth that every man 's chief and real existence be in he own skin and not in other people 's opinion and consequently that the actual condition of we personal life -- health temperament capacity income wife child friend home be a hundred time more important for we happiness than what other people be pleased to think of we : otherwise we shall be miserable and if people insist that honor be dearer than life itself what they really mean be that existence and well-being be as nothing compare with other people 's opinion of course this may be only a exaggerated way of state the prosaic truth that reputation that be the opinion other have of we be indispensable if we be to make any progress in the world but i shall come back to that presently when we see that almost everything man devote they life to attain spare no effort and encounter a thousand toil and danger in the process have in the end no further object than to raise themselves in the estimation of other when we see that not only office title decoration but also wealth nay even knowledge -lrb- 1 -rrb- and art be strive for only to obtain as the ultimate goal of all effort greater respect from one 's fellowman -- be not this a lamentable proof of the extent to which human folly can go to set much too high a value on other people 's opinion be a common error everywhere a error it may be root in human nature itself or the result of civilization and social arrangement generally but whatever its source it exercise a very immoderate influence on all we do and be very prejudicial to we happiness we can trace it from a timorous and slavish regard for what other people will say up to the feeling which make virginius plunge the dagger into he daughter 's heart or induce many a man to sacrifice quiet riches health and even life itself for posthumous glory undoubtedly this feeling be a very convenient instrument in the hand of those who have the control or direction of they fellowman and accordingly we find that in every scheme for train up humanity in the way it should go the maintenance and strengthening of the feeling of honor occupy a important place but it be quite a different matter in its effect on human happiness of which it be here we object to treat and we should rather be careful to dissuade people from set too much store by what other think of they daily experience show we however that this be just the mistake people persist in make most man set the utmost value precisely on what other people think and be more concerned about it than about what go on in they own consciousness which be the thing most immediately and directly present to they they reverse the natural order -- regard the opinion of other as real existence and they own consciousness as something shadowy make the derivative and secondary into the principal and consider the picture they present to the world of more importance than they own self by thus try to get a direct and immediate result out of what have no really direct or immediate existence they fall into the kind of folly which be call _ vanity _ -- the appropriate term for that which have no solid or instrinsic value like a miser such people forget the end in they eagerness to obtain the means -lrb- footnote 1 : _ scire tuum nihil est nisus te scire hoc sciat alter _ -lrb- persin i 27 -rrb- -- knowledge be no use unless other know that you have it -rrb- the truth be that the value we set upon the opinion of other and we constant endeavor in respect of it be each quite out of proportion to any result we may reasonably hope to attain so that this attention to other people 's attitude may be regard as a kind of universal mania which every one inherit in all we do almost the first thing we think about be what will people say and nearly half the trouble and bother of life may be trace to we anxiety on this score it be the anxiety which be at the bottom of all that feeling of self-importance which be so often mortified because it be so very morbidly sensitive it be solicitude about what other will say that underlie all we vanity and pretension yes and all we show and swagger too without it there would not be a tenth part of the luxury which exist pride in every form _ point d'honneur _ and _ punctilio _ however vary they kind or sphere be at bottom nothing but this -- anxiety about what other will say -- and what sacrifice it cost one can see it even in a child and though it exist at every period of life it be strongest in age because when the capacity for sensual pleasure fail vanity and pride have only avarice to share they dominion frenchman perhaps afford the best example of this feeling and amongst they it be a regular epidemic appear sometimes in the most absurd ambition or in a ridiculous kind of national vanity and the most shameless boast however they frustrate they own gain for other people make fun of they and call they _ la grande nation _ by way of specially illustrate this perverse and exuberant respect for other people 's opinion let I take passage from the _ time _ of march 31st 1846 give a detailed account of the execution of one thoma wix a apprentice who from motive of vengeance have murder he master here we have very unusual circumstance and a extraordinary character though one very suitable for we purpose and these combine to give a striking picture of this folly which be so deeply root in human nature and allow we to form a accurate notion of the extent to which it will go on the morning of the execution say the report _ the rev ordinary be early in attendance upon he but wix beyond a quiet demeanor betray no interest in he ministration appear to feel anxious only to acquit himself bravely before the spectator of he ignomininous end in the procession wix fall into he proper place with alacrity and as he enter the chapel-yard remark sufficiently loud to be hear by several person near he now then as dr dodd say i shall soon know the grand secret on reach the scaffold the miserable wretch mount the drop without the slightest assistance and when he get to the center he bow to the spectator twice a proceeding which call forth a tremendous cheer from the degraded crowd beneath _ this be a admirable example of the way in which a man with death in the most dreadful form before he very eye and eternity beyond it will care for nothing but the impression he make upon a crowd of gaper and the opinion he leave behind he in they head there be much the same kind of thing in the case of lecompte who be execute at frankfurt also in 1846 for a attempt on the king 's life at the trial he be very much annoy that he be not allow to appear in decent attire before the upper house and on the day of the execution it be a special grief to he that he be not permit to shave it be not only in recent time that this kind of thing have be know to happen mateo aleman tell we in the introduction to he celebrated romance _ juzman de alfarache _ that many infatuated criminal instead of devote they last hour to the welfare of they soul as they ought to have do neglect this duty for the purpose of prepare and commit to memory a speech to be make from the scaffold i take these extreme case as be the best illustration to what i mean for they give we a magnify reflection of we own nature the anxiety of all of we we worry vexation bother trouble uneasy apprehension and strenuous effort be due in perhaps the large majority of instance to what other people will say and we be just as foolish in this respect as those miserable criminal envy and hatred be very often traceable to a similar source now it be obvious that happiness which consist for the most part in peace of mind and contentment would be serve by nothing so much as by reduce this impulse of human nature within reasonable limit -- which would perhaps make it one fiftieth part of what it be now by do so we should get rid of a thorn in the flesh which be always cause we pain but it be a very difficult task because the impulse in question be a natural and innate perversity of human nature tacitus say _ the lust of fame be the last that a wise man shake off _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- the only way of put a end to this universal folly be to see clearly that it be a folly and this may be do by recognize the fact that most of the opinion in man 's head be apt to be false perverse erroneous and absurd and so in themselves unworthy of attention further that other people 's opinion can have very little real and positive influence upon we in most of the circumstance and affair of life again this opinion be generally of such a unfavorable character that it would worry a man to death to hear everything that be say of he or the tone in which he be speak of and finally among other thing we should be clear about the fact that honor itself have no really direct but only a indirect value if people be generally convert from this universal folly the result would be such a addition to we piece of mind and cheerfulness as at present seem inconceivable people would present a firmer and more confident front to the world and generally behave with less embarrassment and restraint it be observable that a retired mode of life have a exceedingly beneficial influence on we peace of mind and this be mainly because we thus escape have to live constantly in the sight of other and pay everlasting regard to they casual opinion in a word we be able to return upon ourselves at the same time a good deal of positive misfortune might be avoid which we be now draw into by strive after shadow or to speak more correctly by indulge a mischievous piece of folly and we should consequently have more attention to give to solid reality and enjoy they with less interruption that at present but -lrb- greek : chalepa ga kalum -rrb- -- what be worth do be hard to do -lrb- footnote 1 : hist iv 6 -rrb- _ section 2 -- pride _ the folly of we nature which we be discuss put forth three shoot ambition vanity and pride the difference between the last two be this : _ pride _ be a established conviction of one 's own paramount worth in some particular respect while _ vanity _ be the desire of rouse such a conviction in other and it be generally accompany by the secret hope of ultimately come to the same conviction oneself pride work _ from within _ it be the direct appreciation of oneself vanity be the desire to arrive at this appreciation indirectly _ from without _ so we find that vain people be talkative proud and taciturn but the vain person ought to be aware that the good opinion of other which he strive for may be obtain much more easily and certainly by persistent silence than by speech even though he have very good thing to say anyone who wish to affect pride be not therefore a proud man but he will soon have to drop this as every other assumed character it be only a firm unshakeable conviction of pre-eminent worth and special value which make a man proud in the true sense of the word -- a conviction which may no doubt be a mistaken one or rest on advantage which be of a adventitious and conventional character : still pride be not the less pride for all that so long as it be present in real earnest and since pride be thus root in conviction it resemble every other form of knowledge in not be within we own arbitrament pride 's worst foe -- i mean its greatest obstacle -- be vanity which court the applause of the world in order to gain the necessary foundation for a high opinion of one 's own worth whilst pride be base upon a pre-existing conviction of it it be quite true that pride be something which be generally find fault with and cry down but usually i imagine by those who have nothing upon which they can pride themselves in view of the impudence and foolhardiness of most people anyone who possess any kind of superiority or merit will do well to keep he eye fix on it if he do not want it to be entirely forget for if a man be good-natured enough to ignore he own privilege and hob-nob with the generality of other people as if he be quite on they level they will be sure to treat he frankly and candidly as one of themselves this be a piece of advice i would specially offer to those whose superiority be of the highest kind -- real superiority i mean of a purely personal nature -- which can not like order and title appeal to the eye or ear at every moment as otherwise they will find that familiarity breed contempt or as the roman use to say _ sus minervam joke with a slave and he 'll soon show he heel _ be a excellent arabian proverb nor ought we to despise what horace say _ sume superbiam quaesitam meritis _ -- usurp the fame you have deserve no doubt when modesty be make a virtue it be a very advantageous thing for the fool for everybody be expect to speak of himself as if he be one this be level down indeed for it come to look as if there be nothing but fool in the world the cheapest sort of pride be national pride for if a man be proud of he own nation it argue that he have no quality of he own of which he can be proud otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he share with so many million of he fellowman the man who be endowed with important personal quality will be only too ready to see clearly in what respect he own nation fall short since they failing will be constantly before he eye but every miserable fool who have nothing at all of which he can be proud adopt as a last resource pride in the nation to which he belong he be ready and glad to defend all its fault and folly tooth and nail thus reimburse himself for he own inferiority for example if you speak of the stupid and degrading bigotry of the english nation with the contempt it deserve you will hardly find one englishman in fifty to agree with you but if there should be one he will generally happen to be a intelligent man the german have no national pride which show how honest they be as everybody know and how dishonest be those who by a piece of ridiculous affectation pretend that they be proud of they country -- the _ deutsche bruder _ and the demagogue who flatter the mob in order to mislead it i have hear it say that gunpowder be invent by a german i doubt it lichtenberg ask _ why be it that a man who be not a german do not care about pretend that he be one and that if he make any pretence at all it be to be a frenchman or a englishman _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ -- it should be remember that these remark be write in the earlier part of the present century and that a german philosopher now-a-day even though he be as apt to say bitter thing as schopenhauer could hardly write in a similar strain -rrb- however that may be individuality be a far more important thing than nationality and in any give man deserve a thousand-fold more consideration and since you can not speak of national character without refer to large mass of people it be impossible to be loud in you praise and at the same time honest national character be only another name for the particular form which the littleness perversity and baseness of mankind take in every country if we become disgusted with one we praise another until we get disgust with this too every nation mock at other nation and all be right the contents of this chapter which treat as i have say of what we represent in the world or what we be in the eye of other may be further distribute under three head : honor rank and fame _ section 3 -- rank _ let we take rank first as it may be dismiss in a few word although it play a important part in the eye of the mass and of the philistine and be a most useful wheel in the machinery of the state it have a purely conventional value strictly speak it be a sham its method be to exact a artificial respect and as a matter of fact the whole thing be a mere farce order it may be say be bill of exchange draw on public opinion and the measure of they value be the credit of the drawer of course as a substitute for pension they save the state a good deal of money and besides they serve a very useful purpose if they be distribute with discrimination and judgment for people in general have eye and ear it be true but not much else very little judgment indeed or even memory there be many service of the state quite beyond the range of they understanding other again be appreciate and make much of for a time and then soon forget it seem to I therefore very proper that a cross or a star should proclaim to the mass of people always and everywhere _ this man be not like you he have do something _ but order lose they value when they be distribute unjustly or without due selection or in too great number : a prince should be as careful in confer they as a man of business be in sign a bill it be a pleonasm to inscribe on any order _ for distinguished service _ for every order ought to be for distinguished service that stand to reason _ section 4 -- honor _ honor be a much larger question than rank and more difficult to discuss let we begin by try to define it if i be to say _ honor be external conscience and conscience be inward honor _ no doubt a good many people would assent but there would be more show than reality about such a definition and it would hardly go to the root of the matter i prefer to say _ honor be on its objective side other people 's opinion of what we be worth on its subjective side it be the respect we pay to this opinion _ from the latter point of view to be _ a man of honor _ be to exercise what be often a very wholesome but by no mean a purely moral influence the feeling of honor and shame exist in every man who be not utterly depraved and honor be everywhere recognize as something particularly valuable the reason of this be as follow by and in himself a man can accomplish very little he be like robinson crusoe on a desert island it be only in society that a man 's power can be call into full activity he very soon find this out when he consciousness begin to develop and there arise in he the desire to be look upon as a useful member of society as one that be who be capable of play he part as a man -- _ pro parte virilus _ -- thereby acquire a right to the benefit of social life now to be a useful member of society one must do two thing : firstly what everyone be expect to do everywhere and secondly what one 's own particular position in the world demand and require but a man soon discover that everything depend upon he be useful not in he own opinion but in the opinion of other and so he try he best to make that favorable impression upon the world to which he attach such a high value hence this primitive and innate characteristic of human nature which be call the feeling of honor or under another aspect the feeling of shame -- _ verecundium _ it be this which bring a blush to he cheek at the thought of have suddenly to fall in the estimation of other even when he know that he be innocent nay even if he remissness extend to no absolute obligation but only to one which he have take upon himself of he own free will conversely nothing in life give a man so much courage as the attainment or renewal of the conviction that other people regard he with favor because it mean that everyone join to give he help and protection which be a infinitely stronger bulwark against the ill of life than anything he can do himself the variety of relation in which a man can stand to other people so as to obtain they confidence that be they good opinion give rise to a distinction between several kind of honor rest chiefly on the different bearing that _ meum _ may take to _ tuum _ or again on the performance of various pledge or finally on the relation of the sex hence there be three main kind of honor each of which take various form -- civic honor official honor and sexual honor _ civic honor _ have the widest sphere of all it consist in the assumption that we shall pay unconditional respect to the rights of other and therefore never use any unjust or unlawful means of get what we want it be the condition of all peaceable intercourse between man and man and it be destroy by anything that openly and manifestly militate against this peaceable intercourse anything accordingly which entail punishment at the hand of the law always suppose that the punishment be a just one the ultimate foundation of honor be the conviction that moral character be unalterable : a single bad action imply that future action of the same kind will under similar circumstance also be bad this be well express by the english use of the word _ character _ as mean credit reputation honor hence honor once lose can never be recover unless the loss rest on some mistake such as may occur if a man be slander or he action view in a false light so the law provide remedy against slander libel and even insult for insult though it amount to no more than mere abuse be a kind of summary slander with a suppression of the reason what i mean may be well put in the greek phrase -- not quote from any author -- -lrb- greek : estin hae loidoria diabolae -rrb- it be true that if a man abuse another he be simply show that he have no real or true cause of complaint against he as otherwise he would bring these forward as the premise and rely upon he hearer to draw the conclusion themselves : instead of which he give the conclusion and leave out the premise trust that people will suppose that he have do so only for the sake of be brief civic honor draw its existence and name from the middle class but it apply equally to all not except the highest no man can disregard it and it be a very serious thing of which every one should be careful not to make light the man who break confidence have for ever forfeit confidence whatever he may do and whoever he may be and the bitter consequence of the loss of confidence can never be avert there be a sense in which honor may be say to have a _ negative _ character in opposition to the _ positive _ character of fame for honor be not the opinion people have of particular quality which a man may happen to possess exclusively : it be rather the opinion they have of the quality which a man may be expect to exhibit and to which he should not prove false honor therefore mean that a man be not exceptional fame that he be fame be something which must be win honor only something which must not be lose the absence of fame be obscurity which be only a negative but loss of honor be shame which be a positive quality this negative character of honor must not be confuse with anything _ passive _ for honor be above all thing active in its work it be the only quality which proceed _ directly _ from the man who exhibit it it be concerned entirely with what he do and leave undo and have nothing to do with the action of other or the obstacle they place in he way it be something entirely in we own power -- -lrb- greek : ton ephemon -rrb- this distinction as we shall see presently mark off true honor from the sham honor of chivalry slander be the only weapon by which honor can be attack from without and the only way to repel the attack be to confute the slander with the proper amount of publicity and a due unmasking of he who utter it the reason why respect be pay to age be that old people have necessarily show in the course of they life whether or not they have be able to maintain they honor unblemished while that of young people have not be put to the proof though they be credit with the possession of it for neither length of year -- equal as it be and even excel in the case of the lower animal -- nor again experience which be only a closer knowledge of the world 's way can be any sufficient reason for the respect which the young be everywhere require to show towards the old : for if it be merely a matter of year the weakness which attend on age would call rather for consideration than for respect it be however a remarkable fact that white hair always command reverence -- a reverence really innate and instinctive wrinkle -- a much surer sign of old age -- command no reverence at all you never hear any one speak of _ venerable wrinkle _ but _ venerable white hair _ be a common expression honor have only a indirect value for as i explain at the beginning of this chapter what other people think of we if it affect we at all can affect we only in so far as it govern they behavior towards we and only just so long as we live with or have to do with they but it be to society alone that we owe that safety which we and we possession enjoy in a state of civilization in all we do we need the help of other and they in they turn must have confidence in we before they can have anything to do with we accordingly they opinion of we be indirectly a matter of great importance though i can not see how it can have a direct or immediate value this be a opinion also hold by cicero i _ quite agree _ he write _ with what chrysippus and diogene use to say that a good reputation be not worth raise a finger to obtain if it be not that it be so useful _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- this truth have be insist upon at great length by helvetius in he chief work _ de l'esprit _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- the conclusion of which be that _ we love esteem not for its own sake but solely for the advantage which it bring _ and as the means can never be more than the end that say of which so much be make _ honor be dearer than life itself _ be as i have remark a very exaggerated statement so much then for civic honor -lrb- footnote 1 : _ de finilus _ iii 17 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ disc _ : iii 17 -rrb- _ official honor _ be the general opinion of other people that a man who fill any office really have the necessary quality for the proper discharge of all the duty which appertain to it the greater and more important the duty a man have to discharge in the state and the higher and more influential the office which he fill the stronger must be the opinion which people have of the moral and intellectual quality which render he fit for he post therefore the higher he position the greater must be the degree of honor pay to he express as it be in title order and the generally subservient behavior of other towards he as a rule a man 's official rank imply the particular degree of honor which ought to be pay to he however much this degree may be modify by the capacity of the mass to form any notion of its importance still as a matter of fact greater honor be pay to a man who fulfil special duty than to the common citizen whose honor mainly consist in keep clear of dishonor official honor demand further that the man who occupy a office must maintain respect for it for the sake both of he colleague and of those who will come after he this respect a official can maintain by a proper observance of he duty and by repel any attack that may be make upon the office itself or upon its occupant : he must not for instance pass over unheeded any statement to the effect that the duty of the office be not properly discharge or that the office itself do not conduce to the public welfare he must prove the unwarrantable nature of such attack by enforce the legal penalty for they subordinate to the honor of official personage come that of those who serve the state in any other capacity as doctor lawyer teacher anyone in short who by graduate in any subject or by any other public declaration that he be qualify to exercise some special skill claim to practice it in a word the honor of all those who take any public pledge whatever under this head come military honor in the true sense of the word the opinion that people who have bind themselves to defend they country really possess the requisite quality which will enable they to do so especially courage personal bravery and strength and that they be perfectly ready to defend they country to the death and never and under any circumstance desert the flag to which they have once swear allegiance i have here take official honor in a wider sense than that in which it be generally use namely the respect due by citizen to a office itself in treat of _ sexual honor _ and the principle on which it rest a little more attention and analysis be necessary and what i shall say will support my contention that all honor really rest upon a utilitarian basis there be two natural division of the subject -- the honor of woman and the honor of man in either side issue in a well-understood _ esprit de corps _ the former be by far the more important of the two because the most essential feature in woman 's life be she relation to man female honor be the general opinion in regard to a girl that she be pure and in regard to a wife that she be faithful the importance of this opinion rest upon the follow consideration woman depend upon man in all the relation of life man upon woman it might be say in one only so a arrangement be make for mutual interdependence -- man undertaking responsibility for all woman 's need and also for the child that spring from they union -- a arrangement on which be base the welfare of the whole female race to carry out this plan woman have to band together with a show of _ esprit de corps _ and present one undivided front to they common enemy man -- who possess all the good thing of the earth in virtue of he superior physical and intellectual power -- in order to lay siege to and conquer he and so get possession of he and a share of those good thing to this end the honor of all woman depend upon the enforcement of the rule that no woman should give herself to a man except in marriage in order that every man may be force as it be to surrender and ally himself with a woman by this arrangement provision be make for the whole of the female race this be a result however which can be obtain only by a strict observance of the rule and accordingly woman everywhere show true _ esprit de corps _ in carefully insist upon its maintenance any girl who commit a breach of the rule betray the whole female race because its welfare would be destroy if every woman be to do likewise so she be cast out with shame as one who have lose she honor no woman will have anything more to do with she she be avoid like the plague the same doom be award to a woman who break the marriage tie for in so do she be false to the term upon which the man capitulate and as she conduct be such as to frighten other man from make a similar surrender it imperil the welfare of all she sister nay more this deception and coarse breach of troth be a crime punishable by the loss not only of personal but also of civic honor this be why we minimize the shame of a girl but not of a wife because in the former case marriage can restore honor while in the latter no atonement can be make for the breach of contract once this _ esprit de corps _ be acknowledge to be the foundation of female honor and be see to be a wholesome nay a necessary arrangement as at bottom a matter of prudence and interest its extreme importance for the welfare of woman will be recognize but it do not possess anything more than a relative value it be no absolute end lie beyond all other aim of existence and value above life itself in this view there will be nothing to applaud in the force and extravagant conduct of a lucretium or a virginius -- conduct which can easily degenerate into tragic farce and produce a terrible feeling of revulsion the conclusion of _ emilium galottus _ for instance make one leave the theater completely ill at ease and on the other hand all the rule of female honor can not prevent a certain sympathy with clara in _ egmont _ to carry this principle of female honor too far be to forget the end in thinking of the means -- and this be just what people often do for such exaggeration suggest that the value of sexual honor be absolute while the truth be that it be more relative than any other kind one might go so far as to say that its value be purely conventional when one see from thomasius how in all age and country up to the time of the reformation irregularity be permit and recognize by law with no derogation to female honor -- not to speak of the temple of mylitta at babylon -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : heroditus i 199 -rrb- there be also of course certain circumstance in civil life which make external form of marriage impossible especially in catholic country where there be no such thing as divorce ruling prince everywhere would in my opinion do much better from a moral point of view to dispense with form altogether rather than contract a morganatic marriage the descendant of which might raise claim to the throne if the legitimate stock happen to die out so that there be a possibility though perhaps a remote one that a morganatic marriage might produce a civil war and besides such a marriage conclude in defiance of all outward ceremony be a concession make to woman and priest -- two class of person to whom one should be most careful to give as little tether as possible it be further to be remark that every man in a country can marry the woman of he choice except one poor individual namely the prince he hand belong to he country and can be give in marriage only for reason of state that be for the good of the country still for all that he be a man and as a man he like to follow whither he heart lead it be a unjust ungrateful and priggish thing to forbid or to desire to forbid a prince from follow he inclination in this matter of course as long as the lady have no influence upon the government of the country from she point of view she occupy a exceptional position and do not come under the ordinary rule of sexual honor for she have merely give herself to a man who love she and whom she love but can not marry and in general the fact that the principle of female honor have no origin in nature be show by the many bloody sacrifice which have be offer to it -- the murder of child and the mother 's suicide no doubt a girl who contravene the code commit a breach of faith against she whole sex but this faith be one which be only secretly take for grant and not swear to and since in most case she own prospects suffer most immediately she folly be infinitely greater than she crime the corresponding virtue in man be a product of the one i have be discuss it be they _ esprit de corps _ which demand that once a man have make that surrender of himself in marriage which be so advantageous to he conqueror he shall take care that the term of the treaty be maintain both in order that the agreement itself may lose none of its force by the permission of any laxity in its observance and that man have give up everything may at least be assure of they bargain namely exclusive possession accordingly it be part of a man 's honor to resent a breach of the marriage tie on the part of he wife and to punish it at the very least by separate from she if he condone the offence he fellowmen cry shame upon he but the shame in this case be not nearly so foul as that of the woman who have lose she honor the stain be by no means of so deep a dye -- _ leviori notae maculum _ -- because a man 's relation to woman be subordinate to many other and more important affair in he life the two great dramatic poet of modern time have each take man 's honor as the theme of two play shakespeare in _ othello _ and _ the winter 's tale _ and calderon in _ el medico de su honra _ -lrb- the physician of he honor -rrb- and _ a secreto agravio secreta venganza _ -lrb- for secret insult secret vengeance -rrb- it should be say however that honor demand the punishment of the wife only to punish she paramour too be a work of supererogation this confirm the view i have take that a man 's honor originate in _ esprit de corps _ the kind of honor which i have be discuss hitherto have always exist in its various form and principle amongst all nation and at all time although the history of female honor show that its principle have undergo certain local modification at different period but there be another species of honor which differ from this entirely a species of honor of which the greek and roman have no conception and up to this day it be perfectly unknown amongst chinese hindoo or mohammedan it be a kind of honor which arise only in the middle age and be indigenous only to christian europe nay only to a extremely small portion of the population that be to say the higher class of society and those who ape they it be _ knightly honor _ or _ point d'honneur _ its principle be quite different from those which underlie the kind of honor i have be treat until now and in some respects be even oppose to they the sort i be refer to produce the _ cavalier _ while the other kind create the _ man of honor _ as this be so i shall proceed to give a explanation of its principle as a kind of code or mirror of knightly courtesy -lrb- 1 -rrb- to begin with honor of this sort consist not in other people 's opinion of what we be worth but wholly and entirely in whether they express it or not no matter whether they really have any opinion at all let alone whether they know of reason for have one other people may entertain the worst opinion of we in consequence of what we do and may despise we as much as they like so long as no one dare to give expression to he opinion we honor remain untarnished so if we action and quality compel the highest respect from other people and they have no option but to give this respect -- as soon as anyone no matter how wicked or foolish he may be utter something depreciatory of we we honor be offend nay go for ever unless we can manage to restore it a superfluous proof of what i say namely that knightly honor depend not upon what people think but upon what they say be furnish by the fact that insult can be withdraw or if necessary form the subject of a apology which make they as though they have never be utter whether the opinion which underlay the expression have also be rectify and why the expression should ever have be use be question which be perfectly unimportant : so long as the statement be withdraw all be well the truth be that conduct of this kind aim not at earn respect but at extort it -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the second place this sort of honor rest not on what a man do but on what he suffer the obstacle he encounter differ from the honor which prevail in all else in consist not in what he say or do himself but in what another man say or do he honor be thus at the mercy of every man who can talk it away on the tip of he tongue and if he attack it in a moment it be go for ever -- unless the man who be attack manage to wrest it back again by a process which i shall mention presently a process which involve danger to he life health freedom property and peace of mind a man 's whole conduct may be in accordance with the most righteous and noble principle he spirit may be the purest that ever breathe he intellect of the very highest order and yet he honor may disappear the moment that anyone be pleased to insult he anyone at all who have not offend against this code of honor himself let he be the most worthless rascal or the most stupid beast a idler gambler debtor a man in short of no account at all it be usually this sort of fellow who like to insult people for as seneca -lrb- 1 -rrb- rightly remark _ ut quisque contemtissimus et ludibrio est ita solutissimae est _ the more contemptible and ridiculous a man be -- the readier he be with he tongue he insult be most likely to be direct against the very kind of man i have describe because people of different taste can never be friend and the sight of pre-eminent merit be apt to raise the secret ire of a ne'er - do-well what goethe say in the _ westöstlicher divan _ be quite true that it be useless to complain against you enemy for they can never become you friend if you whole be be a standing reproach to they : -- _ be klagst du über feinde sollten solche je warden freunde denen da wesen wie du bist im stillen ein ewiger vorwurf ist _ -lrb- footnote 1 : _ de constantia _ 11 -rrb- it be obvious that people of this worthless description have good cause to be thankful to the principle of honor because it put they on a level with people who in every other respect stand far above they if a fellow likes to insult any one attribute to he for example some bad quality this be take _ prima facie _ as a well-founded opinion true in fact a decree as it be with all the force of law nay if it be not at once wipe out in blood it be a judgment which hold good and valid to all time in other word the man who be insult remains -- in the eye of all _ honorable people _ -- what the man who utter the insult -- even though he be the greatest wretch on earth -- be pleased to call he for he have _ put up with _ the insult -- the technical term i believe accordingly all _ honorable people _ will have nothing more to do with he and treat he like a leper and it may be refuse to go into any company where he may be find and so on this wise proceeding may i think be trace back to the fact that in the middle age up to the fifteenth century it be not the accuser in any criminal process who have to prove the guilt of the accuse but the accuse who have to prove he innocence -lrb- 1 -rrb- this he could do by swearing he be not guilty and he backer -- _ consacramentale _ -- have to come and swear that in they opinion he be incapable of perjury if he could find no one to help he in this way or the accuser take objection to he backer recourse be have to trial by _ the judgment of god _ which generally mean a duel for the accuse be now _ in disgrace _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- and have to clear himself here then be the origin of the notion of disgrace and of that whole system which prevail now-a-days amongst _ honorable people _ -- only that the oath be omit this be also the explanation of that deep feeling of indignation which _ honorable people _ be call upon to show if they be give the lie it be a reproach which they say must be wipe out in blood it seldom come to this pass however though lie be of common occurrence but in england more than elsewhere it be a superstition which have take very deep root as a matter of order a man who threaten to kill another for tell a lie should never have tell one himself the fact be that the criminal trial of the middle age also admit of a shorter form in reply to the charge the accuse answer : _ that be a lie _ whereupon it be leave to be decide by _ the judgment of god _ hence the code of knightly honor prescribe that when the lie be give a appeal to arm follow as a matter of course so much then for the theory of insult -lrb- footnote 1 : see cg von waehter 's _ beiträge zur deutschen geschichte _ especially the chapter on criminal law -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ translator 's note _ -- it be true that this expression have another special meaning in the technical terminology of chivalry but it be the nearest english equivalent which i can find for the german -- _ ein bescholtener _ -rrb- but there be something even worse than insult something so dreadful that i must beg pardon of all _ honorable people _ for so much as mention it in this code of knightly honor for i know they will shiver and they hair will stand on end at the very think of it -- the _ summum malum _ the greatest evil on earth worse than death and damnation a man may give another -- _ horrible dictu _ -- a slap or a blow this be such a awful thing and so utterly fatal to all honor that while any other species of insult may be heal by blood-letting this can be cure only by the _ coup-de-grace _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the third place this kind of honor have absolutely nothing to do with what a man may be in and for himself or again with the question whether he moral character can ever become better or worse and all such pedantic inquiry if you honor happen to be attack or to all appearance go it can very soon be restore in its entirety if you be only quick enough in have recourse to the one universal remedy -- _ a duel _ but if the aggressor do not belong to the class which recognize the code of knightly honor or have himself once offend against it there be a safer way of meet any attack upon you honor whether it consist in blow or merely in word if you be arm you can strike down you opponent on the spot or perhaps a hour later this will restore you honor but if you wish to avoid such a extreme step from fear of any unpleasant consequence arise therefrom or from uncertainty as to whether the aggressor be subject to the law of knightly honor or not there be another means of make you position good namely the _ avantage _ this consist in return rudeness with still greater rudeness and if insult be no use you can try a blow which form a sort of climax in the redemption of you honor for instance a box on the ear may be cure by a blow with a stick and a blow with a stick by a thrash with a horsewhip and as the approve remedy for this last some people recommend you to spit at you opponent -lrb- 1 -rrb- if all these means be of no avail you must not shrink from draw blood and the reason for these method of wipe out insult be in this code as follow : -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ it must be remember that schopenhauer be here describe or perhaps caricature the manners and custom of the german aristocracy of half a century ago now of course _ nous avon change tout celum _ -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- to receive a insult be disgraceful to give one honorable let I take a example my opponent have truth right and reason on he side very well i insult he thereupon right and honor leave he and come to I and for the time be he have lose they -- until he get they back not by the exercise of right or reason but by shooting and sticking I accordingly rudeness be a quality which in point of honor be a substitute for any other and outweigh they all the rudest be always right what more do you want however stupid bad or wicked a man may have be if he be only rude into the bargain he condone and legitimize all he fault if in any discussion or conversation another man show more knowledge greater love of truth a sounder judgment better understanding than we or generally exhibit intellectual quality which cast ours into the shade we can at once annul he superiority and we own shallowness and in we turn be superior to he by be insulting and offensive for rudeness be better than any argument it totally eclipse intellect if we opponent do not care for we mode of attack and will not answer still more rudely so as to plunge we into the ignoble rivalry of the _ avantage _ we be the victor and honor be on we side truth knowledge understanding intellect wit must beat a retreat and leave the field to this almighty insolence _ honorable people _ immediately make a show of mount they war-horse if anyone utter a opinion adverse to theirs or show more intelligence than they can muster and if in any controversy they be at a loss for a reply they look about for some weapon of rudeness which will serve as well and come readier to hand so they retire master of the position it must now be obvious that people be quite right in applaud this principle of honor as have ennoble the tone of society this principle spring from another which form the heart and soul of the entire code -lrb- 5 -rrb- fifthly the code imply that the highest court to which a man can appeal in any difference he may have with another on a point of honor be the court of physical force that be of brutality every piece of rudeness be strictly speak a appeal to brutality for it be a declaration that intellectual strength and moral insight be incompetent to decide and that the battle must be fight out by physical force -- a struggle which in the case of man whom franklin define as _ a tool-making animal _ be decide by the weapon peculiar to the species and the decision be irrevocable this be the well-known principle of _ right of might _ -- irony of course like _ the wit of a fool _ a parallel phrase the honor of a knight may be call the glory of might -lrb- 6 -rrb- lastly if as we see above civic honor be very scrupulous in the matter of _ meum _ and _ tuum _ pay great respect to obligation and a promise once make the code we be here discuss display on the other hand the noblest liberality there be only one word which may not be break _ the word of honor _ -- upon my _ honor _ as people say -- the presumption being of course that every other form of promise may be break nay if the worst come to the worst it be easy to break even one 's word of honor and still remain honorable -- again by adopt that universal remedy the duel and fight with those who maintain that we pledge we word further there be one debt and one alone that under no circumstance must be leave unpaid -- a gamble debt which have accordingly be call _ a debt of honor _ in all other kind of debt you may cheat jew and christian as much as you like and you knightly honor remain without a stain the unprejudiced reader will see at once that such a strange savage and ridiculous code of honor as this have no foundation in human nature nor any warrant in a healthy view of human affair the extremely narrow sphere of its operation serve only to intensify the feeling which be exclusively confine to europe since the middle age and then only to the upper class officer and soldier and people who imitate they neither greek nor roman know anything of this code of honor or of its principle nor the highly civilized nation of asia ancient or modern amongst they no other kind of honor be recognize but that which i discuss first in virtue of which a man be what he show himself to be by he action not what any wag tongue be pleased to say of he they think that what a man say or do might perhaps affect he own honor but not any other man 's to they a blow be but a blow -- and any horse or donkey could give a harder one -- a blow which under certain circumstance might make a man angry and demand immediate vengeance but it have nothing to do with honor no one keep account of blow or insulting word or of the _ satisfaction _ which be demand or omit to be demand yet in personal bravery and contempt of death the ancient be certainly not inferior to the nation of christian europe the greek and roman be thorough hero if you like but they know nothing about _ point d'honneur _ if _ they _ have any idea of a duel it be totally unconnected with the life of the noble it be merely the exhibition of mercenary gladiator slave devote to slaughter condemn criminal who alternately with wild beast be set to butcher one another to make a roman holiday when christianity be introduce gladiatorial show be do away with and they place take in christian time by the duel which be a way of settle difficulty by _ the judgment of god _ if the gladiatorial fight be a cruel sacrifice to the prevail desire for great spectacles dueling be a cruel sacrifice to exist prejudice -- a sacrifice not of criminal slave and prisoner but of the noble and the free -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ translator 's note _ these and other remark on dueling will no doubt wear a belated look to english reader but they be hardly yet antiquated for most part of the continent -rrb- there be a great many trait in the character of the ancient which show that they be entirely free from these prejudice when for instance marius be summon to a duel by a teutonic chief he return answer to the effect that if the chief be tire of he life he might go and hang himself at the same time he offer he a veteran gladiator for a round or two plutarch relate in he life of themistocle that eurybiade who be in command of the fleet once raise he stick to strike he whereupon themistocle instead of draw he sword simply say : _ strike but hear I _ how sorry the reader must be if he be a _ honorable _ man to find that we have no information that the athenian officer refuse in a body to serve any longer under themistocle if he act like that there be a modern french writer who declare that if anyone consider demosthene a man of honor he ignorance will excite a smile of pity and that cicero be not a man of honor either -lrb- 1 -rrb- in a certain passage in plato 's _ law _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- the philosopher speak at length of -lrb- greek : aikium -rrb- or _ assault _ show we clearly enough that the ancient have no notion of any feeling of honor in connection with such matter socrate ' frequent discussion be often follow by he be severely handle and he bear it all mildly once for instance when somebody kick he the patience with which he take the insult surprise one of he friend _ do you think _ say socrate _ that if a ass happen to kick I i should resent it _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- on another occasion when he be ask _ have not that fellow abused and insult you no _ be he answer _ what he say be not address to I _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- stobaeus have preserve a long passage from musonius from which we can see how the ancient treat insult they know no other form of satisfaction than that which the law provide and wise people despise even this if a greek receive a box on the ear he could get satisfaction by the aid of the law as be evident from plato 's _ gorgia _ where socrate ' opinion may be find the same thing may be see in the account give by gellius of one lucius veratius who have the audacity to give some roman citizen whom he meet on the road a box on the ear without any provocation whatever but to avoid any ulterior consequence he tell a slave to bring a bag of small money and on the spot pay the trivial legal penalty to the man whom he have astonish by he conduct -lrb- footnote 1 : _ litteraire _ : par c durand rouen 1828 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : bk ix -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : diogene laertius ii 21 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ ibid _ 36 -rrb- crate the celebrated cynic philosopher get such a box on the ear from nicodromus the musician that he face swell up and become black and blue whereupon he put a label on he forehead with the inscription _ nicodromus fecit _ which bring much disgrace to the fluteplayer who have commit such a piece of brutality upon the man whom all athen honor as a household god -lrb- 1 -rrb- and in a letter to melesippus diogene of sinope tell we that he get a beating from the drunken son of the athenian but he add that it be a matter of no importance -lrb- 2 -rrb- and seneca devote the last few chapter of he _ de constantia _ to a lengthy discussion on insult -- _ contumelium _ in order to show that a wise man will take no notice of it in chapter xiv he say _ what shall a wise man do if he be give a blow what cato do when some one strike he on the mouth -- not fire up or avenge the insult or even return the blow but simply ignore it _ -lrb- footnote 1 : diogene laertius vi 87 and apul : flor : p 126 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : cf casaubon 's note diog laert vi 33 -rrb- _ yes _ you say _ but these man be philosopher _ -- and you be fool eh precisely it be clear that the whole code of knightly honor be utterly unknown to the ancient for the simple reason that they always take a natural and unprejudiced view of human affair and do not allow themselves to be influence by any such vicious and abominable folly a blow in the face be to they a blow and nothing more a trivial physical injury whereas the modern make a catastrophe out of it a theme for a tragedy as for instance in the _ cid _ of corneille or in a recent german comedy of middle-class life call _ the power of circumstance _ which should have be entitle _ the power of prejudice _ if a member of the national assembly at paris get a blow on the ear it would resound from one end of europe to the other the example which i have give of the way in which such a occurrence would have be treat in classic time may not suit the idea of _ honorable people _ so let I recommend to they notice as a kind of antidote the story of monsieur desgland in diderot 's masterpiece _ jacque le fataliste _ it be a excellent specimen of modern knightly honor which no doubt they will find enjoyable and edifying -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote : 1 : _ translator 's note _ the story to which schopenhauer here refer be briefly as follow : two gentleman one of whom be name desgland be pay court to the same lady as they sit at table side by side with the lady opposite desgland do he best to charm she with he conversation but she pretend not to hear he and keep look at he rival in the agony of jealousy desgland as he be hold a fresh egg in he hand involuntarily crush it the shell break and its contents bespatter he rival 's face see he raise he hand desgland seize it and whisper : _ sir i take it as give _ the next day desgland appear with a large piece of black sticking-plaster upon he right cheek in the duel which follow desgland severely wound he rival upon which he reduce the size of the plaster when he rival recover they have another duel desgland draw blood again and again make he plaster a little smaller and so on for five or six time after every duel desgland ' plaster grow less and less until at last he rival -rrb- from what i have say it must be quite evident that the principle of knightly honor have no essential and spontaneous origin in human nature it be a artificial product and its source be not hard to find its existence obviously date from the time when people use they fist more than they head when priestcraft have enchain the human intellect the much bepraised middle age with its system of chivalry that be the time when people let the almighty not only care for they but judge for they too when difficult case be decide by a ordeal a _ judgment of god _ which with few exception mean a duel not only where noble be concerned but in the case of ordinary citizen as well there be a neat illustration of this in shakespeare 's henry vi -lrb- 1 -rrb- every judicial sentence be subject to a appeal to arm -- a court as it be of higher instance namely _ the judgment of god _ : and this really mean that physical strength and activity that be we animal nature usurp the place of reason on the judgment seat decide in matter of right and wrong not by what a man have do but by the force with which he be oppose the same system in fact as prevail to-day under the principle of knightly honor if any one doubt that such be really the origin of we modern duel let he read a excellent work by jb millingen _ the history of duel _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- nay you may still find amongst the supporter of the system -- who by the way be not usually the most educate or thoughtful of man -- some who look upon the result of a duel as really constitute a divine judgment in the matter in dispute no doubt in consequence of the traditional feeling on the subject but leave aside the question of origin it must now be clear to we that the main tendency of the principle be to use physical menace for the purpose of extort a appearance of respect which be deem too difficult or superfluous to acquire in reality a proceeding which come to much the same thing as if you be to prove the warmth of you room by hold you hand on the thermometer and so make it rise in fact the kernel of the matter be this : whereas civic honor aim at peaceable intercourse and consist in the opinion of other people that _ we deserve full confidence _ because we pay unconditional respect to they rights knightly honor on the other hand lay down that _ we be to be fear _ as be determine at all cost to maintain we own as not much reliance can be place upon human integrity the principle that it be more essential to arouse fear than to invite confidence would not perhaps be a false one if we be live in a state of nature where every man would have to protect himself and directly maintain he own rights but in civilized life where the state undertake the protection of we person and property the principle be no longer applicable : it stand like the castle and watch-tower of the age when might be right a useless and forlorn object amidst well-tilled field and frequented road or even railway accordingly the application of knightly honor which still recognize this principle be confine to those small case of personal assault which meet with but slight punishment at the hand of the law or even none at all for _ de minimis non _ -- mere trivial wrong commit sometimes only in jest the consequence of this limited application of the principle be that it have force itself into a exaggerated respect for the value of the person -- a respect utterly alien to the nature constitution or destiny of man -- which it have elate into a species of sanctity : and as it consider that the state have impose a very insufficient penalty on the commission of such trivial injury it take upon itself to punish they by attack the aggressor in life or limb the whole thing manifestly rest upon a excessive degree of arrogant pride which completely forget what man really be claim that he shall be absolutely free from all attack or even censure those who determine to carry out this principle by main force and announce as they rule of action _ whoever insult or strike I shall die _ ought for they pain to be banish the country -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : knightly honor be the child of pride and folly and it be _ needy _ not pride which be the heritage of the human race it be a very remarkable fact that this extreme form of pride should be find exclusively amongst the adherent of the religion which teach the deepest humility still this pride must not be put down to religion but rather to the feudal system which make every nobleman a petty sovereign who recognize no human judge and learn to regard he person as sacred and inviolable and any attack upon it or any blow or insulting word as a offence punishable with death the principle of knightly honor and of the duel be at first confine to the noble and later on also to officer in the army who enjoy a kind of off-and-on relationship with the upper class though they be never incorporate with they be anxious not to be behind they it be true that duel be the product of the old ordeal but the latter be not the foundation but rather the consequence and application of the principle of honor : the man who recognize no human judge appeal to the divine ordeal however be not peculiar to christendom : they may be find in great force among the hindoo especially of ancient time and there be trace of they even now -rrb- as a palliative to this rash arrogance people be in the habit of give way on everything if two intrepid person meet and neither will give way the slightest difference may cause a shower of abuse then fisticuffs and finally a fatal blow : so that it would really be a more decorous proceeding to omit the intermediate step and appeal to arm at once a appeal to arm have its own special formality and these have develop into a rigid and precise system of law and regulation together form the most solemn farce there be -- a regular temple of honor dedicate to folly for if two intrepid person dispute over some trivial matter -lrb- more important affair be deal with by law -rrb- one of they the cleverer of the two will of course yield and they will agree to differ that this be so be prove by the fact that common people -- or rather the numerous class of the community who do not acknowledge the principle of knightly honor let any dispute run its natural course amongst these class homicide be a hundredfold rarer than amongst those -- and they amount perhaps in all to hardly one in a thousand -- who pay homage to the principle : and even blow be of no very frequent occurrence then it have be say that the manners and tone of good society be ultimately base upon this principle of honor which with its system of duel be make out to be a bulwark against the assault of savagery and rudeness but athen corinth and rome could assuredly boast of good nay excellent society and manners and tone of a high order without any support from the bogey of knightly honor it be true that woman do not occupy that prominent place in ancient society which they hold now when conversation have take on a frivolous and trifling character to the exclusion of that weighty discourse which distinguish the ancient this change have certainly contribute a great deal to bring about the tendency which be observable in good society now-a-day to prefer personal courage to the possession of any other quality the fact be that personal courage be really a very subordinate virtue -- merely the distinguishing mark of a subaltern -- a virtue indeed in which we be surpass by the lower animal or else you would not hear people say _ as brave as a lion _ far from be the pillar of society knightly honor afford a sure asylum in general for dishonesty and wickedness and also for small incivility want of consideration and unmannerliness rude behavior be often pass over in silence because no one care to risk he neck in correct it after what i have say it will not appear strange that the dueling system be carry to the highest pitch of sanguinary zeal precisely in that nation whose political and financial record show that they be not too honorable what that nation be like in its private and domestic life be a question which may be best put to those who be experience in the matter they urbanity and social culture have long be conspicuous by they absence there be no truth then in such pretext it can be urge with more justice that as when you snarl at a dog he snarl in return and when you pet he he fawn so it lie in the nature of man to return hostility by hostility and to be embittered and irritated at any sign of depreciatory treatment or hatred : and as cicero say _ there be something so penetrate in the shaft of envy that even man of wisdom and worth find its wound a painful one _ and nowhere in the world except perhaps in a few religious sect be a insult or a blow take with equanimity and yet a natural view of either would in no case demand anything more than a requital proportionate to the offence and would never go to the length of assign _ death _ as the proper penalty for anyone who accuse another of lie or stupidity or cowardice the old german theory of _ blood for a blow _ be a revolting superstition of the age of chivalry and in any case the return or requital of a insult be dictate by anger and not by any such obligation of honor and duty as the advocate of chivalry seek to attach to it the fact be that the greater the truth the greater the slander and it be clear that the slightest hint of some real delinquency will give much greater offence than a most terrible accusation which be perfectly baseless : so that a man who be quite sure that he have do nothing to deserve a reproach may treat it with contempt and will be safe in do so the theory of honor demand that he shall show a susceptibility which he do not possess and take bloody vengeance for insult which he can not feel a man must himself have but a poor opinion of he own worth who hasten to prevent the utterance of a unfavorable opinion by give he enemy a black eye true appreciation of he own value will make a man really indifferent to insult but if he can not help resent it a little shrewdness and culture will enable he to save appearance and dissemble he anger if he could only get rid of this superstition about honor -- the idea i mean that it disappear when you be insult and can be restore by return the insult if we could only stop people from think that wrong brutality and insolence can be legalize by express readiness to give satisfaction that be to fight in defense of it we should all soon come to the general opinion that insult and depreciation be like a battle in which the loser win and that as vincenzo montus say abuse resemble a church-procession because it always return to the point from which it set out if we could only get people to look upon insult in this light we should no longer have to say something rude in order to prove that we be in the right now unfortunately if we want to take a serious view of any question we have first of all to consider whether it will not give offence in some way or other to the dullard who generally show alarm and resentment at the merest sign of intelligence and it may easily happen that the head which contain the intelligent view have to be pit against the noodle which be empty of everything but narrowness and stupidity if all this be do away with intellectual superiority could take the lead place in society which be its due -- a place now occupy though people do not like to confess it by excellence of physique mere fight pluck in fact and the natural effect of such a change would be that the best kind of people would have one reason the less for withdraw from society this would pave the way for the introduction of real courtesy and genuinely good society such as undoubtedly exist in athen corinth and rome if anyone want to see a good example of what i mean i should like he to read xenophon 's _ banquet _ the last argument in defense of knightly honor no doubt be that but for its existence the world -- awful thought -- would be a regular bear-garden to which i may briefly reply that nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand who do not recognize the code have often give and receive a blow without any fatal consequence : whereas amongst the adherent of the code a blow usually mean death to one of the party but let I examine this argument more closely i have often try to find some tenable or at any rate plausible basis -- other than a merely conventional one -- some positive reason that be to say for the rooted conviction which a portion of mankind entertain that a blow be a very dreadful thing but i have look for it in vain either in the animal or in the rational side of human nature a blow be and always will be a trivial physical injury which one man can do to another prove thereby nothing more than he superiority in strength or skill or that he enemy be off he guard analysis will carry we no further the same knight who regard a blow from the human hand as the greatest of evil if he get a ten time harder blow from he horse will give you the assurance as he limp away in suppress pain that it be a matter of no consequence whatever so i have come to think that it be the human hand which be at the bottom of the mischief and yet in a battle the knight may get cut and thrust from the same hand and still assure you that he wound be not worth mention now i hear that a blow from the flat of a sword be not by any means so bad as a blow from a stick and that a short time ago cadet be liable to be punish by the one but not the other and that the very greatest honor of all be the _ accolade _ this be all the psychological or moral basis that i can find and so there be nothing leave I but to pronounce the whole thing a antiquated superstition that have take deep root and one more of the many example which show the force of tradition my view be confirm by the well-known fact that in china a beating with a bamboo be a very frequent punishment for the common people and even for official of every class which show that human nature even in a highly civilized state do not run in the same groove here and in china on the contrary a unprejudiced view of human nature show that it be just as natural for a man to beat as it be for savage animal to bite and rend in piece or for horn beast to butt or push man may be say to be the animal that beat hence it be revolt to we sense of the fitness of thing to hear as we sometimes do that one man bite another on the other hand it be a natural and everyday occurrence for he to get blow or give they it be intelligible enough that as we become educate we be glad to dispense with blow by a system of mutual restraint but it be a cruel thing to compel a nation or a single class to regard a blow as a awful misfortune which must have death and murder for its consequence there be too many genuine evil in the world to allow of we increase they by imaginary misfortune which bring real one in they train : and yet this be the precise effect of the superstition which thus prove itself at once stupid and malign it do not seem to I wise of government and legislative body to promote any such folly by attempt to do away with flogging as a punishment in civil or military life they idea be that they be act in the interest of humanity but in point of fact they be do just the opposite for the abolition of flogging will serve only to strengthen this inhuman and abominable superstition to which so many sacrifice have already be make for all offence except the worst a beating be the obvious and therefore the natural penalty and a man who will not listen to reason will yield to blow it seem to I right and proper to administer corporal punishment to the man who possess nothing and therefore can not be fine or can not be put in prison because he master 's interest would suffer by the loss of he service there be really no argument against it : only mere talk about _ the dignity of man _ -- talk which proceed not from any clear notion on the subject but from the pernicious superstition i have be describe that it be a superstition which lie at the bottom of the whole business be prove by a almost laughable example not long ago in the military discipline of many country the cat be replace by the stick in either case the object be to produce physical pain but the latter method involve no disgrace and be not derogatory to honor by promote this superstition the state be play into the hand of the principle of knightly honor and therefore of the duel while at the same time it be try or at any rate it pretend it be try to abolish the duel by legislative enactment as a natural consequence we find that this fragment of the theory that _ might be right _ which have come down to we from the most savage day of the middle age have still in this nineteenth century a good deal of life leave in it -- more shame to we it be high time for the principle to be drive out bag and baggage now-a-day no one be allow to set dog or cock to fight each other -- at any rate in england it be a penal offence -- but man be plunge into deadly strife against they will by the operation of this ridiculous superstitious and absurd principle which impose upon we the obligation as its narrow-minded supporter and advocate declare of fight with one another like gladiator for any little trifle let I recommend we purist to adopt the expression _ bait _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- instead of _ duel _ which probably come to we not from the latin _ duellum _ but from the spanish _ duelo _ -- mean suffer nuisance annoyance -lrb- footnote 1 : _ ritterhetze _ -rrb- in any case we may well laugh at the pedantic excess to which this foolish system have be carry it be really revolting that this principle with its absurd code can form a power within the state -- _ imperium in imperio _ -- a power too easily put in motion which recognize no right but might tyrannize over the class which come within its range by keep up a sort of inquisition before which any one may be hale on the most flimsy pretext and there and then be try on a issue of life and death between himself and he opponent this be the lurk place from which every rascal if he only belong to the class in question may menace and even exterminate the noblest and best of man who as such must of course be a object of hatred to he we system of justice and police-protection have make it impossible in these day for any scoundrel in the street to attack we with -- _ you money or you life _ a end should be put to the burden which weigh upon the higher class -- the burden i mean of have to be ready every moment to expose life and limb to the mercy of anyone who take it into he rascally head to be coarse rude foolish or malicious it be perfectly atrocious that a pair of silly passionate boy should be wound maim or even kill simply because they have have a few word the strength of this tyrannical power within the state and the force of the superstition may be measure by the fact that people who be prevent from restore they knightly honor by the superior or inferior rank of they aggressor or anything else that put the person on a different level often come to a tragic-comic end by commit suicide in sheer despair you may generally know a thing to be false and ridiculous by find that if it be carry to its logical conclusion it result in a contradiction and here too we have a very glaring absurdity for a officer be forbid to take part in a duel but if he be challenge and decline to come out he be punish by be dismiss the service as i be on the matter let I be more frank still the important distinction which be often insist upon between kill you enemy in a fair fight with equal weapon and lie in ambush for he be entirely a corollary of the fact that the power within the state of which i have speak recognize no other right than might that be the right of the stronger and appeal to a _ judgment of god _ as the basis of the whole code for to kill a man in a fair fight be to prove that you be superior to he in strength or skill and to justify the deed _ you must assume that the right of the stronger be really a right _ but the truth be that if my opponent be unable to defend himself it give I the possibility but not by any mean the right of kill he the _ right _ the _ moral justification _ must depend entirely upon the _ motive _ which i have for take he life even suppose that i have sufficient motive for take a man 's life there be no reason why i should make he death depend upon whether i can shoot or fence better than he in such a case it be immaterial in what way i kill he whether i attack he from the front or the rear from a moral point of view the right of the stronger be no more convincing than the right of the more skillful and it be skill which be employ if you murder a a man treacherously might and skill be in this case equally right in a duel for instance both the one and the other come into play for a feint be only another name for treachery if i consider myself morally justify in take a man 's life it be stupid of I to try first of all whether he can shoot or fence better than i as if he can he will not only have wrong I but have take my life into the bargain it be rousseau 's opinion that the proper way to avenge a insult be not to fight a duel with you aggressor but to assassinate he -- a opinion however which he be cautious enough only to barely indicate in a mysterious note to one of the book of he _ emile _ this show the philosopher so completely under the influence of the mediaeval superstition of knightly honor that he consider it justifiable to murder a man who accuse you of lie : whilst he must have know that every man and himself especially have deserve to have the lie give he time without number the prejudice which justify the killing of you adversary so long as it be do in a open contest and with equal weapon obviously look upon might as really right and a duel as the interference of god the italian who in a fit of rage fall upon he aggressor wherever he find he and despatch he without any ceremony act at any rate consistently and naturally : he may be cleverer but he be not worse than the duelist if you say i be justified in kill my adversary in a duel because he be at the moment do he best to kill I i can reply that it be you challenge which have place he under the necessity of defend himself and that by mutually put it on the ground of self-defence the combatant be seek a plausible pretext for commit murder i should rather justify the deed by the legal maxim _ volentus non fit injurium _ because the party mutually agree to set they life upon the issue this argument may however be rebut by show that the injured party be not injure _ volen _ because it be this tyrannical principle of knightly honor with its absurd code which forcibly drag one at least of the combatant before a bloody inquisition i have be rather prolix on the subject of knightly honor but i have good reason for be so because the augean stable of moral and intellectual enormity in this world can be clean out only with the besom of philosophy there be two thing which more than all else serve to make the social arrangement of modern life compare unfavorably with those of antiquity by give we age a gloomy dark and sinister aspect from which antiquity fresh natural and as it be in the morning of life be completely free i mean modern honor and modern disease -- _ par nobile fratrum _ -- which have combine to poison all the relation of life whether public or private the second of this noble pair extend its influence much farther than at first appear to be the case as be not merely a physical but also a moral disease from the time that poison arrow have be find in cupid 's quiver a estrange hostile nay devilish element have enter into the relation of man and woman like a sinister thread of fear and mistrust in the warp and woof of they intercourse indirectly shake the foundation of human fellowship and so more or less affect the whole tenor of existence but it would be beside my present purpose to pursue the subject further a influence analogous to this though work on other line be exert by the principle of knightly honor -- that solemn farce unknown to the ancient world which make modern society stiff gloomy and timid force we to keep the strictest watch on every word that fall nor be this all the principle be a universal minotaur and the goodly company of the son of noble house which it demand in yearly tribute come not from one country alone as of old but from every land in europe it be high time to make a regular attack upon this foolish system and this be what i be try to do now would that these two monster of the modern world might disappear before the end of the century let we hope that medicine may be able to find some means of prevent the one and that by clear we ideal philosophy may put a end to the other : for it be only by clear we idea that the evil can be eradicate government have try to do so by legislation and fail still if they be really concern to stop the dueling system and if the small success that have attend they effort be really due only to they inability to cope with the evil i do not mind propose a law the success of which i be prepare to guarantee it will involve no sanguinary measure and can be put into operation without recourse either to the scaffold or the gallows or to imprisonment for life it be a small homeopathic pilule with no serious after effect if any man send or accept a challenge let the corporal take he before the guard house and there give he in broad daylight twelve stroke with a stick _ a la chinoise _ a non-commissioned officer or a private to receive six if a duel have actually take place the usual criminal proceedings should be institute a person with knightly notion might perhaps object that if such a punishment be carry out a man of honor would possibly shoot himself to which i should answer that it be better for a fool like that to shoot himself rather than other people however i know very well that government be not really in earnest about put down duel civil official and much more so officer in the army -lrb- except those in the highest position -rrb- be pay most inadequately for the service they perform and the deficiency be make up by honor which be represent by title and order and in general by the system of rank and distinction the duel be so to speak a very serviceable extra-horse for people of rank : so they be train in the knowledge of it at the university the accident which happen to those who use it make up in blood for the deficiency of the pay just to complete the discussion let I here mention the subject of _ national honor _ it be the honor of a nation as a unit in the aggregate of nation and as there be no court to appeal to but the court of force and as every nation must be prepare to defend its own interest the honor of a nation consist in establish the opinion not only that it may be trust -lrb- its credit -rrb- but also that it be to be fear a attack upon its rights must never be allow to pass unheeded it be a combination of civic and knightly honor _ section 5 -- fame _ under the head of place in the estimation of the world we have put _ fame _ and this we must now proceed to consider fame and honor be twin and twin too like castor and pollux of whom the one be mortal and the other be not fame be the undying brother of ephemeral honor i speak of course of the highest kind of fame that be of fame in the true and genuine sense of the word for to be sure there be many sort of fame some of which last but a day honor be concerned merely with such quality as everyone may be expect to show under similar circumstance fame only of those which can not be require of any man honor be of quality which everyone have a right to attribute to himself fame only of those which should be leave to other to attribute whilst we honor extend as far as people have knowledge of we fame run in advance and make we know wherever it find its way everyone can make a claim to honor very few to fame as be attainable only in virtue of extraordinary achievement these achievement may be of two kind either _ action _ or _ work _ and so to fame there be two path open on the path of action a great heart be the chief recommendation on that of work a great head each of the two path have its own peculiar advantage and detriment and the chief difference between they be that action be fleeting while work remain the influence of a action be it never so noble can last but a short time but a work of genius be a living influence beneficial and ennobling throughout the age all that can remain of action be a memory and that become weak and disfigured by time -- a matter of indifference to we until at last it be extinguish altogether unless indeed history take it up and present it fossilize to posterity work be immortal in themselves and once commit to write may live for ever of alexander the great we have but the name and the record but plato and aristotle homer and horace be alive and as directly at work to-day as they be in they own lifetime the _ veda _ and they _ upanishad _ be still with we : but of all contemporaneous action not a trace have come down to we -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : accordingly it be a poor compliment though sometimes a fashionable one to try to pay honor to a work by call it a action for a work be something essentially higher in its nature a action be always something base on motive and therefore fragmentary and fleeting -- a part in fact of that will which be the universal and original element in the constitution of the world but a great and beautiful work have a permanent character as be of universal significance and spring from the intellect which rise like a perfume above the fault and folly of the world of will the fame of a great action have this advantage that it generally start with a loud explosion so loud indeed as to be hear all over europe : whereas the fame of a great work be slow and gradual in its beginning the noise it make be at first slight but it go on grow greater until at last after a hundred year perhaps it attain its full force but then it remain because the work remain for thousand of year but in the other case when the first explosion be over the noise it make grow less and less and be hear by fewer and fewer person until it end by the action have only a shadowy existence in the page of history -rrb- another disadvantage under which action labor be that they depend upon chance for the possibility of come into existence and hence the fame they win do not flow entirely from they intrinsic value but also from the circumstance which happen to lend they importance and lustre again the fame of action if as in war they be purely personal depend upon the testimony of fewer witness and these be not always present and even if present be not always just or unbiased observer this disadvantage however be counterbalance by the fact that action have the advantage of be of a practical character and therefore within the range of general human intelligence so that once the fact have be correctly report justice be immediately do unless indeed the motive underlie the action be not at first properly understand or appreciate no action can be really understand apart from the motive which prompt it it be just the contrary with work they inception do not depend upon chance but wholly and entirely upon they author and whoever they be in and for themselves that they remain as long as they live further there be a difficulty in properly judge they which become all the harder the higher they character often there be no person competent to understand the work and often no unbiased or honest critic they fame however do not depend upon one judge only they can enter a appeal to another in the case of action as i have say it be only they memory which come down to posterity and then only in the traditional form but work be hand down themselves and except when part of they have be lose in the form in which they first appear in this case there be no room for any disfigurement of the fact and any circumstance which may have prejudice they in they origin fall away with the lapse of time nay it be often only after the lapse of time that the person really competent to judge they appear -- exceptional critic sit in judgment on exceptional work and give they weighty verdict in succession these collectively form a perfectly just appreciation and though there be case where it have take some hundred of year to form it no further lapse of time be able to reverse the verdict -- so secure and inevitable be the fame of a great work whether author ever live to see the dawn of they fame depend upon the chance of circumstance and the higher and more important they work be the less likelihood there be of they do so that be a incomparable fine saying of seneca 's that fame follow merit as surely as the body cast a shadow sometimes fall in front and sometimes behind and he go on to remark that _ though the envy of contemporary be show by universal silence there will come those who will judge without enmity or favor _ from this remark it be manifest that even in seneca 's age there be rascal who understand the art of suppress merit by maliciously ignore its existence and of conceal good work from the public in order to favor the bad : it be a art well understand in we day too manifest itself both then and now in _ a envious conspiracy of silence _ as a general rule the longer a man 's fame be likely to last the later it will be in come for all excellent product require time for they development the fame which last to posterity be like a oak of very slow growth and that which endure but a little while like plant which spring up in a year and then die whilst false fame be like a fungus shooting up in a night and perish as soon and why for this reason the more a man belong to posterity in other word to humanity in general the more of a alien he be to he contemporary since he work be not mean for they as such but only for they in so far as they form part of mankind at large there be none of that familiar local color about he production which would appeal to they and so what he do fail of recognition because it be strange people be more likely to appreciate the man who serve the circumstance of he own brief hour or the temper of the moment -- belong to it live and die with it the general history of art and literature show that the highest achievement of the human mind be as a rule not favorably receive at first but remain in obscurity until they win notice from intelligence of a high order by whose influence they be bring into a position which they then maintain in virtue of the authority thus give they if the reason of this should be ask it will be find that ultimately a man can really understand and appreciate those thing only which be of like nature with himself the dull person will like what be dull and the common person what be common a man whose idea be mixed will be attract by confusion of thought and folly will appeal to he who have no brain at all but best of all a man will like he own work as be of a character thoroughly at one with himself this be a truth as old as epicharmus of fabulous memory -- -lrb- greek : thaumaston ouden estus I tauth outo legein kal andanein autoisin autous kal dokein kalos pethukenai kal gar ho kuon kuni kalloton eimen phainetai koi bous boi onos dono kalliston -lrb- estin -rrb- we dut -rrb- the sense of this passage -- for it should not be lose -- be that we should not be surprise if people be please with themselves and fancy that they be in good case for to a dog the best thing in the world be a dog to a ox a ox to a ass a ass and to a sow a sow the strongest arm be unavailing to give impetus to a featherweight for instead of speeding on its way and hit its mark with effect it will soon fall to the ground have expend what little energy be give to it and possess no mass of its own to be the vehicle of momentum so it be with great and noble thought nay with the very masterpiece of genius when there be none but little weak and perverse mind to appreciate they -- a fact which have be deplore by a chorus of the wise in all age jesus the son of sirach for instance declare that _ he that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in slumber : when he have tell he tale he will say what be the matter _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and hamlet say _ a knavish speech sleep in a fool 's ear _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- and goethe be of the same opinion that a dull ear mock at the wisest word _ da glücktichste wort e wird verhöhnt wenn der hörer ein schiefohr ist _ : and again that we should not be discourage if people be stupid for you can make no ring if you throw you stone into a marsh _ du iwirkest nicht alle bleibt so stumpf : seus guter dinge der stein in sumpf macht keine ringe _ -lrb- footnote 1 : ecclesiasticus xxii 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : act iv sc 2 -rrb- lichtenberg ask : _ when a head and a book come into collision and one sound hollow be it always the book _ and in another place : _ work like this be as a mirror if a ass look in you can not expect a apostle to look out _ we should do well to remember old gellert 's fine and touch lament that the best gift of all find the fewest admirer and that most man mistake the bad for the good -- a daily evil that nothing can prevent like a plague which no remedy can cure there be but one thing to be do though how difficult -- the foolish must become wise -- and that they can never be the value of life they never know they see with the outer eye but never with the mind and praise the trivial because the good be strange to they : -- _ nie kennen sie den werth der dinge ihr auge schliesst nicht ihr verstand sie loben ewig da geringe weil sie da gute nie gekannt _ to the intellectual incapacity which as goethe say fail to recognize and appreciate the good which exist must be add something which come into play everywhere the moral baseness of mankind here take the form of envy the new fame that a man win raise he afresh over the head of he fellow who be thus degrade in proportion all conspicuous merit be obtain at the cost of those who possess none or as goethe have it in the _ westöstlicher divan _ another 's praise be one 's own depreciation -- _ wenn wir andern ehre geben müssen wir uns selbst entadeln _ we see then how it be that whatever be the form which excellence take mediocrity the common lot of by far the greatest number be league against it in a conspiracy to resist and if possible to suppress it the pass-word of this league be _ à bas le mérite _ nay more those who have do something themselves and enjoy a certain amount of fame do not care about the appearance of a new reputation because its success be apt to throw theirs into the shade hence goethe declare that if we have to depend for we life upon the favor of other we should never have live at all from they desire to appear important themselves people gladly ignore we very existence : -- _ hätte ich gezaudert zu werden bi man mir 's leben geögnut ich wäre noch nicht auf erden wie ihr begreifen könnt wenn ihr seht wie sie sich geberden die um etwas zu scheinen mich gerne mochten verneinen _ honor on the contrary generally meet with fair appreciation and be not expose to the onslaught of envy nay every man be credit with the possession of it until the contrary be prove but fame have to be win in despite of envy and the tribunal which award the laurel be compose of judge bias against the applicant from the very first honor be something which we be able and ready to share with everyone fame suffer encroachment and be render more unattainable in proportion as more people come by it further the difficulty of win fame by any give work stand in reverse ratio to the number of people who be likely to read it and hence it be so much harder to become famous as the author of a learn work than as a writer who aspire only to amuse it be hardest of all in the case of philosophical work because the result at which they aim be rather vague and at the same time useless from a material point of view they appeal chiefly to reader who be work on the same line themselves it be clear then from what i have say as to the difficulty of win fame that those who labor not out of love for they subject nor from pleasure in pursue it but under the stimulus of ambition rarely or never leave mankind a legacy of immortal work the man who seek to do what be good and genuine must avoid what be bad and be ready to defy the opinion of the mob nay even to despise it and its misleader hence the truth of the remark -lrb- especially insist upon by osorius _ de gloria _ -rrb- that fame shun those who seek it and seek those who shun it for the one adapt themselves to the taste of they contemporary and the other work in defiance of it but difficult though it be to acquire fame it be a easy thing to keep when once acquire here again fame be in direct opposition to honor with which everyone be presumably to be accredit honor have not to be win it must only not be lose but there lie the difficulty for by a single unworthy action it be go irretrievably but fame in the proper sense of the word can never disappear for the action or work by which it be acquire can never be undo and fame attach to its author even though he do nothing to deserve it anew the fame which vanish or be outlive prove itself thereby to be spurious in other word unmerited and due to a momentary overestimate of a man 's work not to speak of the kind of fame which hegel enjoy and which lichtenberg describe as _ trumpet forth by a clique of admire undergraduate _ -- _ the resounding echo of empty head _ -- _ such a fame as will make posterity smile when it light upon a grotesque architecture of word a fine nest with the bird long ago fly it will knock at the door of this decayed structure of conventionality and find it utterly empty _ -- _ not even a trace of think there to invite the passer-by _ the truth be that fame mean nothing but what a man be in comparison with other it be essentially relative in character and therefore only indirectly valuable for it vanish the moment other people become what the famous man be absolute value can be predicate only of what a man possess under any and all circumstance -- here what a man be directly and in himself it be the possession of a great heart or a great head and not the mere fame of it which be worth have and conducive to happiness not fame but that which deserve to be famous be what a man should hold in esteem this be as it be the true underlie substance and fame be only a accident affect its subject chiefly as a kind of external symptom which serve to confirm he own opinion of himself light be not visible unless it meet with something to reflect it and talent be sure of itself only when its fame be noised abroad but fame be not a certain symptom of merit because you can have the one without the other or as lessing nicely put it _ some people obtain fame and other deserve it _ it would be a miserable existence which should make its value or want of value depend upon what other people think but such would be the life of a hero or a genius if its worth consist in fame that be in the applause of the world every man live and exist on he own account and therefore mainly in and for himself and what he be and the whole manner of he be concern himself more than anyone else so if he be not worth much in this respect he can not be worth much otherwise the idea which other people form of he existence be something secondary derivative expose to all the chance of fate and in the end affect he but very indirectly besides other people 's head be a wretched place to be the home of a man 's true happiness -- a fanciful happiness perhaps but not a real one and what a mixed company inhabit the temple of universal fame -- general minister charlatan juggler dancer singer millionaire and jew it be a temple in which more sincere recognition more genuine esteem be give to the several excellency of such folk than to superiority of mind even of a high order which obtain from the great majority only a verbal acknowledgment from the point of view of human happiness fame be surely nothing but a very rare and delicate morsel for the appetite that feed on pride and vanity -- a appetite which however carefully conceal exist to a immoderate degree in every man and be perhaps strongest of all in those who set they heart on become famous at any cost such people generally have to wait some time in uncertainty as to they own value before the opportunity come which will put it to the proof and let other people see what they be make of but until then they feel as if they be suffer secret injustice -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : we greatest pleasure consist in be admire but those who admire we even if they have every reason to do so be slow to express they sentiment hence he be the happiest man who no matter how manage sincerely to admire himself -- so long as other people leave he alone -rrb- but as i explain at the beginning of this chapter a unreasonable value be set upon other people 's opinion and one quite disproportionate to its real worth hobbe have some strong remark on this subject and no doubt he be quite right _ mental pleasure _ he write _ and ecstacy of any kind arise when on compare ourselves with other we come to the conclusion that we may think well of ourselves _ so we can easily understand the great value which be always attach to fame as worth any sacrifice if there be the slightest hope of attain it _ fame be the spur that the clear spirit doth raise _ _ -lrb- that have infirmity of noble mind -rrb- _ _ to scorn delight and live laborious day _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- and again : _ how hard it be to climb the height where fame 's proud temple shine afar _ -lrb- footnote 1 : milton _ lycida _ -rrb- we can thus understand how it be that the vainest people in the world be always talk about _ la gloire _ with the most implicit faith in it as a stimulus to great action and great work but there can he no doubt that fame be something secondary in its character a mere echo or reflection -- as it be a shadow or symptom -- of merit : and in any case what excite admiration must be of more value than the admiration itself the truth be that a man be make happy not by fame but by that which bring he fame by he merit or to speak more correctly by the disposition and capacity from which he merit proceed whether they be moral or intellectual the best side of a man 's nature must of necessity be more important for he than for anyone else : the reflection of it the opinion which exist in the head of other be a matter that can affect he only in a very subordinate degree he who deserve fame without get it possess by far the more important element of happiness which should console he for the loss of the other it be not that a man be think to be great by mass of incompetent and often infatuated people but that he really be great which should move we to envy he position and he happiness lie not in the fact that posterity will hear of he but that he be the creator of thought worthy to be treasured up and study for hundred of year besides if a man have do this he possess something which can not be wrest from he and unlike fame it be a possession dependent entirely upon himself if admiration be he chief aim there would be nothing in he to admire this be just what happen in the case of false that be unmerited fame for its recipient life upon it without actually possess the solid substratum of which fame be the outward and visible sign false fame must often put its possessor out of conceit with himself for the time may come when in spite of the illusion bear of self-love he will feel giddy on the height which he be never mean to climb or look upon himself as spurious coin and in the anguish of threaten discovery and well-merited degradation he will read the sentence of posterity on the forehead of the wise -- like a man who owe he property to a forge will the truest fame the fame that come after death be never hear of by its recipient and yet he be call a happy man he happiness lay both in the possession of those great quality which win he fame and in the opportunity that be grant he of develop they -- the leisure he have to act as he please to dedicate himself to he favorite pursuit it be only work do from the heart that ever gain the laurel greatness of soul or wealth of intellect be what make a man happy -- intellect such as when stamp on its production will receive the admiration of century to come -- thought which make he happy at the time and will in they turn be a source of study and delight to the noblest mind of the most remote posterity the value of posthumous fame lie in deserving it and this be its own reward whether work destine to fame attain it in the lifetime of they author be a chance affair of no very great importance for the average man have no critical power of he own and be absolutely incapable of appreciate the difficulty of a great work people be always sway by authority and where fame be widespread it mean that ninety-nine out of a hundred take it on faith alone if a man be famed far and wide in he own lifetime he will if he be wise not set too much value upon it because it be no more than the echo of a few voice which the chance of a day have touch in he favor would a musician feel flatter by the loud applause of a audience if he know that they be nearly all deaf and that to conceal they infirmity they set to work to clap vigorously as soon as ever they see one or two person applaud and what would he say if he get to know that those one or two person have often take bribe to secure the loudest applause for the poorest player it be easy to see why contemporary praise so seldom develop into posthumous fame d'alembert in a extremely fine description of the temple of literary fame remark that the sanctuary of the temple be inhabit by the great dead who during they life have no place there and by a very few live person who be nearly all eject on they death let I remark in pass that to erect a monument to a man in he lifetime be as much as declare that posterity be not to be trust in its judgment of he if a man do happen to see he own true fame it can very rarely be before he be old though there have be artist and musician who have be exception to this rule but very few philosopher this be confirm by the portrait of people celebrate by they work for most of they be take only after they subject have attain celebrity generally depict they as old and gray more especially if philosophy have be the work of they life from the eudaemonistic standpoint this be a very proper arrangement as fame and youth be too much for a mortal at one and the same time life be such a poor business that the strictest economy must be exercise in its good thing youth have enough and to spare in itself and must rest content with what it have but when the delight and joy of life fall away in old age as the leaf from a tree in autumn fame bud forth opportunely like a plant that be green in winter fame be as it be the fruit that must grow all the summer before it can be enjoy at yule there be no greater consolation in age than the feeling of have put the whole force of one 's youth into work which still remain young finally let we examine a little more closely the kind of fame which attach to various intellectual pursuit for it be with fame of this sort that my remark be more immediately concerned i think it may be say broadly that the intellectual superiority it denote consist in form theory that be new combination of certain fact these fact may be of very different kind but the better they be know and the more they come within everyday experience the greater and wider will be the fame which be to be win by theorize about they for instance if the fact in question be number or line or special branch of science such as physics zoology botany anatomy or corrupt passage in ancient author or undecipherable inscription write it may be in some unknown alphabet or obscure point in history the kind of fame that may be obtain by correctly manipulate such fact will not extend much beyond those who make a study of they -- a small number of person most of whom live retire life and be envious of other who become famous in they special branch of knowledge but if the fact be such as be know to everyone for example the fundamental characteristic of the human mind or the human heart which be share by all alike or the great physical agency which be constantly in operation before we eye or the general course of natural law the kind of fame which be to be win by spread the light of a new and manifestly true theory in regard to they be such as in time will extend almost all over the civilized world : for if the fact be such as everyone can grasp the theory also will be generally intelligible but the extent of the fame will depend upon the difficulty overcome and the more generally know the fact be the harder it will be to form a theory that shall be both new and true : because a great many head will have be occupy with they and there will be little or no possibility of say anything that have not be say before on the other hand fact which be not accessible to everybody and can be get at only after much difficulty and labor nearly always admit of new combination and theory so that if sound understanding and judgment be bring to bear upon they -- quality which do not involve very high intellectual power -- a man may easily be so fortunate as to light upon some new theory in regard to they which shall be also true but fame win on such path do not extend much beyond those who possess a knowledge of the fact in question to solve problem of this sort require no doubt a great ideal of study and labor if only to get at the fact whilst on the path where the greatest and most widespread fame be to be win the fact may be grasp without any labor at all but just in proportion as less labor be necessary more talent or genius be require and between such quality and the drudgery of research no comparison be possible in respect either of they intrinsic value or of the estimation in which they be hold and so people who feel that they possess solid intellectual capacity and a sound judgment and yet can not claim the highest mental power should not be afraid of laborious study for by its aid they may work themselves above the great mob of humanity who have the fact constantly before they eye and reach those secluded spot which be accessible to learn toil for this be a sphere where there be infinitely fewer rival and a man of only moderate capacity may soon find a opportunity of proclaim a theory which shall be both new and true nay the merit of he discovery will partly rest upon the difficulty of come at the fact but applause from one 's fellow-student who be the only person with a knowledge of the subject sound very faint to the far-off multitude and if we follow up this sort of fame far enough we shall at last come to a point where fact very difficult to get at be in themselves sufficient to lay a foundation of fame without any necessity for form a theory -- travels for instance in remote and little-known country which make a man famous by what he have see not by what he have think the great advantage of this kind of fame be that to relate what one have see be much easier than to impart one 's thought and people be apt to understand description better than idea read the one more readily than the other : for as asmus say _ when one go forth a-voyaging he have a tale to tell _ and yet for all that a personal acquaintance with celebrated traveler often remind we of a line from horace -- new scene do not always mean new idea -- _ caelum non animum mutant quus trans mare currunt _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : epist i ii -rrb- but if a man find himself in possession of great mental faculty such as alone should venture on the solution of the hardest of all problem -- those which concern nature as a whole and humanity in its widest range he will do well to extend he view equally in all direction without ever stray too far amid the intricacy of various by-path or invade region little know in other word without occupy himself with special branch of knowledge to say nothing of they petty detail there be no necessity for he to seek out subject difficult of access in order to escape a crowd of rival the common object of life will give he material for new theory at once serious and true and the service he render will be appreciate by all those -- and they form a great part of mankind -- who know the fact of which he treat what a vast distinction there be between student of physics chemistry anatomy mineralogy zoology philology history and the man who deal with the great fact of human life the poet and the philosopher end of the project gutenberg ebook of the essay of arthur schopenhauer : the wisdom of life by arthur
