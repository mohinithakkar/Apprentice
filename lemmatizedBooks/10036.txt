by orpheus c kerr chapter xxi bentham to the rescue european traveller in this country -- especially if one economical condition of they come hither have not be the composition of work of imagination on america sufficiently contemptuous to pay all the expense of the trip -- have occasionally -- and particularly if they have be invite to write for new york magazine take professorship in native college or lecture on the encouraging continental progress of scientific atheism before boston audience -- such traveller we say convinced that they shall lose no money by it but on the contrary rather sanguine of make a little thereby in the long run have occasionally remark that in the united state woman journey alone be treat with a chivalric courtesy and deference not so habitually practice in any other second-class new nation on the face of the earth -lrb- 1 -rrb- what oh what can be more true than this a lady well stricken in year and of adequate protraction of nose and rectilinear undeviation of figure can travel alone from maine to florida with as perfect immunity from offensive masculine intrusion as though she be guard by a regiment while a somewhat younger girl with curl and a innocent look can not appear unaccompanied by a escort in a american omnibus car ferry-boat or hotel without appeal at once to the finest fatherly feeling of every manly middle-aged observer whose wife be not watch he and exciting as general a desire to make she trip socially delightful as though each gentlemanly eye seek hers be indeed that of a tender sire thus although miss pott 's lonely stay in she hotel have be so brief the mysterious american instinct of chivalry have discover it very early on the first morning after she arrival and she arise from she delicious sleep to find at least half a dozen write offer of hospitality from generous stranger stick under she door understand that she be sojourn without natural protector in a strange city the thoughtful writer who appear to be chiefly western man of imply immense fortune beg she -lrb- by the delicate name of fair unknown -rrb- to take comfort in the thought that they be stop at the same hotel and would protect she from all harm with they life in proof of this unselfish disposition on they part several of they be respectively ready to take she to a circus-matinee or to drive in central park on that very day : and she prompt acceptance of these signal evidence of a disinterested friendship for womanhood without a natural protector could not be more simply indicate to those who now freely offer such friendship than by she drop she fork _ twice _ at the public breakfast table or send the waiter back _ three _ time with the boil egg to have they cook rightly flora have complete she chemical toilet put all the bottle jar and small round box back into she satchel again and sit down to a second reading of these gratify intimation that a prepossessing female orphan be not necessarily without assiduous paternal guardianship at she command wherever there be western father when mr dibble appear as he have promise accompany by gospeler simpson miss carowther be so excite by you sudden flight miss pott say the latter that she come at once to I and oldy with you farewell note and would not stop say ` do you ever ' until to restrain my aggravate mother from fit i promise to follow you to you guardian 's and ascertain what you good-bye note would have mean if it have actually be punctuate we reverend friend reach I about a hour ago add mr dibble say that a farewell note without a comma colon semi-colon or period in it and with every other word begin with a capital and underscore be calculate to drive friend to distraction i take the liberty of remind he my dear that young girl from boarding-school should hardly be expect to have advance as far as english composition in they french and musical study and i also related to he what you have tell I of mr bumstead and i do not know that under the circumstance you could do a better thing than you have do continue the gospeler mr bumstead himself explain you flight upon the supposition that you be possibly engage with myself my mother mr dibble and the pendragon in kill poor mr drood oh ought not he to be ashamed of himself when he know that i never do kill any absurd creature cry the flowerpot in earnest deprecation and just think of darling magnolia too with she poor ridiculous brother you be a lawyer mr dibble and i should think you could get they a _ habea corpus _ or a divorce or some other perfectly absurd thing about court that would make the judge tell the jury to bring they in not guilty fix upon the lovely young reasoner a look expressive of he affectionate wonder at she inspired perception of legal possibility the old lawyer say that the first thing in order be a meeting between herself and miss pendragon which as it could scarcely take place -lrb- all thing consider -rrb- with propriety in the private room of that lady 's brother nor without publicity in he own office or in a hotel he hardly know how to bring about and here we have a example of that difference between novel and real life which have be illustrate more than once before in this conscientious american adaptation of what all we profoundly critical native journal pronounce the most elaborately artistic work of the grandest of english novelist in a equivalent situation of real life mr dibble 's quandary would not have be easily relieved but by the magic of artistic fiction the particular kind of extemporized character absolutely necessary to help he and the novel continuously along be at that moment come up the stair of the hotel -lrb- 2 -rrb- at the critical instant a servant knock to say that there be a gentleman below with a face as long I arrum sir who ax I be there a man here av the name av simpson miss it be john -- it be mr bumstead shriek flora hasten involuntarily towards a mirror -- and just see how my dress be wrinkle my name be bentham -- jeremy bentham say a deep voice in the doorway and there enter a gloomy figure with smoky light hair a curiously long countenance and black worsted glove simpson -- old octavius -- do you never never see I before if i be not greatly mistaken return the gospeler sternly i saw you stand in the bar-room of the hotel just now as we come up yes sigh the stranger i be there -- wait for a western friend -- when you pass in and have sorrow then so change I that you do not know I alas alack woe 's I bentham you say cry the ritualistic clergyman with a start and sudden change of countenance surely you be not the rollick fellow-student who save my life at yale i be i be sob the other smite he bosom while study theology you would go to sleep in bed read the decameron i in the next room suddenly smell a smell of wood burning break into you apartment i see you candle fall upon you pillow and you head on fire believe that if neglect the flame would spread to some vital part i seize a water-pitcher and dash the contents upon you up you instantly spring with a theological expression on you lip and engage I in violent single combat madman roar i be it thus you treat one who have save you life fall upon the floor with a black eye you at once consent to be reconcile and from that hour forth we be both member of the same secret society leap forward the reverend octavius wring both the black worsted glove of mr bentham and introduce the latter to the old lawyer and he ward he do indeed save all but my head from the conflagration and extinguish that even before it be much char cry the grateful ritualist with marked emotion -- but jeremy why this aspect of depression octavius old friend say bentham he hollow voice quiver let no man boast himself upon the gaiety of he youth and fondly dream -- poor self-deceiver -- that he maturity may be one of revelry you know what i once be now i be conduct a first-class american comic paper commiseration earnest and unaffected appear upon every countenance and mr dibble be the first to break the ensue deep silence if i be not mistaken then observe the good lawyer quietly the scene of you daily loss of spirit be in the same building with we young friend mr pendragon whom you may know i do know he sir and that he sister have lately come unto he he room by means of outside shutter be once a refuge to I from the man -- here mr bentham 's face flame with inconceivable hatred -- who come to tell I just how a american first-class comic paper _ should _ be conduct at what time do you rush of subscriber cease as soon as i begin to charge anything for my paper and the newsman who take it by the week -- what be they usual time for swarm in you office on the day appoint for the return of unsold copy then i _ have _ a idea say mr dibble it appear to I mr bentham that you office besides be so near mr pendragon 's quarter furnish all the condition for a perfectly private confidential interview between this young lady here and she friend miss pendragon mr simpson if you approve be kind enough to acquaint mr bentham with miss pott 's history without mention name and explain to he also why the lady ' interview should take place in a spot whither that singular young man mr bumstead would not be likely to prowl if in town in he inspection of umbrella the gospeler hurriedly related the material point of flora 's history to he recovered friend who moan with all the more cheerful part and seem to think that the serious one might be worked-up in comic miss-spelling for he paper -- for there be nothing more humorous in human life say he gloomily than the defective orthography of a fashionable young girl 's education for the solemnity of matrimony finally they all set off for the appoint place of retirement upon near which mr dibble volunteer to remain outside as a guard against any possible interruption the gospeler lead the way up the dark stair of the building when they have gain it and the flowerpot follow on jeremy bentham 's arm could not help glance shyly up into the melancholy face of she escort occasionally do you _ never _ smile she could not help ask yes he say mournfully sometimes : when i clean my tooth no more be say for they be enter the room of which the tone and atmosphere be those of a receiving-vault -lrb- footnote 1 : shades of quintilian and dr johnson what a sentence -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : quite independently of any specific design to that end by the adapter this adaptation carefully follow the original english narrative as it do can not avoid act as a kind of practical -- and of course somewhat exaggerative -- commentary upon what be strained force or out of the line of average probability in the work adapt -rrb- chapter xxii a confused state of thing the principal office of the comic paper be one of those amazingly unsympathetic room in which the wall window and door all have a stiff unsalient aspect of the most hard-finished indifference to every emotion of humanity and a perfectly rigid insensibility to the pleasure or pain of the tenant within they impassive shelter in the whole configuration of the heartless uncharacterized place there be not one gracious inequality to lean against not a ledge to rest elbow upon not a panel not even a stove-pipe hole to become dearly familiar to the wistful eye not so much as a genial crack in the plastering or a companionable rattle in a casement or a little human obstinacy in a door to base some kind of a acquaintance upon and make one less lonely through the grim untwinkling window gaping sullenly the wrong way with iron shutter come a discourage light strain through the narrow interval of the dusty roof above to discover a large coffin-colored desk surmount by ghastly bust of hervey keble and blair -lrb- 3 -rrb- a smaller desk over which hang a picture of the tomb of washington and at which sit a pallid assistant-editor in deep mourning open the comic contribution receive by last mail a still smaller desk for the nominal writer of subscription-wrappers file of the _ evangelist _ _ observer _ and _ christian union _ hang along the wall a dead carpet of churchyard-green on the floor and a print of mr parke godwin just above the mantel of momumental marble upon find themselves in this temple of momus and observe that its peculiar arrangement of sunshine make they complexion look as though they have be dead a few day gospeler simpson and the flowerpot involuntarily speak in whisper behind they hand do that room belong to you establishment also bentham whisper the gospeler point rather fearfully as he speak towards a side-door lead apparently into a adjoining ' apartment yes be the low response be there -- be there anybody dead in there whisper mr simpson tremulously no -- not yet then whisper the ritualistic clergyman you might step in there miss pott and have you interview with miss pendragon whom mr bentham will i be sure cause to be summon from up-stair the assistant-editor of the comic paper steal softly from the office to call the other young lady down mr jeremy bentham make a sign that flora should follow he to the supplementary room indicate he low-spirited manner be as though he have say : if you wish to look at the body miss i will now show you the way leave the gospeler lose in dark abstraction near the black mantel the flowerpot allow the sexton of the establishment to conduct she funereally into the place assign for she interview and stop aghast before a huge black object standing therein what be this she gasp almost hysterically only a safe say mr bentham with inexplicable bitterness of tone merely we fire-and-burglar-proof receptacle for the money constantly pour in from first-class american comic journalism -- here mr bentham slap he forehead passionately check something like a sob in he throat and abruptly return to the main office scarcely however have he close the door of communication behind he when another door open from the hall be noiselessly unlatched and magnolia pendragon glide into the arm of she friend flora murmur the southern girl i can scarcely credit my eye it seem so long since we last meet you have be get a new bonnet i see it be like a absurd dream respond the flowerpot wonderingly caress she i have think of you and you poor ridiculous brother twenty time a day how much you must have go through here be they wear skirt full or scant this season about medium dear but how do you happen to be here in mr bentham 's office in answer to this question flora related all that bad happen at bumsteadville and since she flight from thence conclude by warn magnolia that she possession of a black alpaca waist slightly wear have subject she to the ominous suspicion of the ritualistic organist i scorn and defy the suspicion of that enemy of the persecute south and high-handed wooer of exclusively northern woman exclaim miss pendragon vehemently be this mr bentham marry i suppose not be he visit any one i should not think so dear then add magnolia thoughtfully if dear mr dibble approve he might be a friend to montgomery and myself and by be so near we protect we both from mr bumstead just think dear flora what heap of sorrow i should endure if that base man 's suspicion about my alpaca waist should be only a pretence to frighten I into ultimately receive he address i do not think there be any danger love say miss pott rather sharply why flora precious oh because he be so absurdly fastidious you know about regularity of feature in woman more than he be about brain i should think dear from what you tell I of he make love to you here both young lady tremble very much and say they never never would have believe it of each other and be only reconcile when flora sob that she be a poor unmarried orphan and miss pendragon moan piteously that a unwedded southern girl without money have better go away somewhere in the desert with she crushed brother and die at once for they down-trodden section then indeed they embrace tearfully and in proof of the perfect restoration of they devoted friendship agree never to marry if they could avoid it and tell each other the price of all they best clothes you _ will not _ tell you brother that i have be here say the flowerpot i be so absurdly afraid that he can not help blame I for cause some of he trouble can not i tell he even if it would serve to amuse he in he desolation ask the sister persuasively i want to see he smile again just as he do some day when a hand-organ-man 's

any other mortal poet it be call the duodekameter perhaps it may be proper to add that the following be _ poetry _ i you see everybody in we town be run around get fat job and position and pick up a million dollar or so so i feel it incumbent on I to shake myself up and see if there be not a good butter firkin well fill loaf around idle in which could conveniently locate my center of gravity and so i say to myself i 'll go to washington and see say ichabod bogg say i ii now do not you see you might just as well ask for a big position at first and then take what you can get at least that have be my rule so far for as i say to myself if you can only get a very high position with a sort of nabob 's salary and lot of perquisite run in annually you need not do anything you bet but puff at you cigar say ichabod bogg say i iii so i put on my best clothes and a sort of a big blue necktie and shortly thereafter show myself to mr grant and say that there have be quite enough of this give away big office to people who have not big reputation and that he have other fish to fry and that as he would not give the custom house to my son i would take it myself and then i stop and he look i sha not but all he say be -- puff say general grant say he iv then all the smoke get in my nose and i sneeze and snort a bit and then i just simply remark and say that he need not go and get into a huff and if he do not like to give I that office could not he make I minister to england as i be a big feeder or if that do not suit why if he would do it i would not object to be minister to cuba when the cuban have be all kill and be thoroughly dead but all be say be -- puff say general grant say he v well then i get kind of discourage but i think that i would better try again and not get up so far but ask for what he would give beyond doubt so i ask for a position as night watchman at the navy yard and think i would get it and he would answer my request for i would notice that he havana be gradually grow smaller and he do answer I just as he would throw away the end of he cigar he simply say get out say general grant say he vi so i get out as fast as a pair of leg with a number twelve boot kick at the place where they be join would permit and wander off just about as far as i conveniently could and then i sit down on a milestone and raise my voice to heaven and cry aloud that

mr punchinello make he _ debut _ as a candidate for the honor of the turf to put the matter more concisely it be just six day since he drive he horse creep peter on the track at monmouth park long branch the only object which mr p have in view when he purchase he celebrated trotter and put he into training be the improvement of the breed of american horse while we bonner vanderbilt and grant be devote all they surplus time and mean to this great end mr p in place the name of he yellow horse in the hand of the poolseller would scorn to have a less noble aim but this great object need not interfere with other of less importance and therefore mr p will not deny that after have exhibit to he friend and the sport fraternity in general he little investment in fancy horseflesh he make up a very satisfactory betting-book now mr p believe -- and event prove he to be correct -- that when he friend and the sport fraternity see he horse they would bet heavily against he mr p however in all the pride of amateur ownership bet quite as heavily _ upon _ he noble steed he friend and the above-mentioned fraternity chuckle and wink behind he back but although mr p hear they chuckle and know that they be wink he belief in he final success never waver any ordinary observer might be expect to remark that creep peter be not entirely without blemish besides be spavine and have three of he hoof injure by sand-crack he have poll-evil fistula malander ring-bone cap hock curb splint and several other malady which make he a very suitable horse for the general public to bet against but mr p 's courage never quail when he make he appearance on the track -lrb- for he drive he horse himself -rrb- he be the object of general attention the follow view -lrb- from a photograph by rockwood -rrb- give a excellent idea of the horse and driver -lrb- illustration -rrb- nearly everybody on the ground advise mr p to leave he cloth in the stable for it would certainly interfere with the speed of he horse and probably get wrap up in the wheel and cause a accident but mr p would listen to nothing of the sort he tell everybody that he be not go to catch cold in he knee even if he lose the race and that he be perfectly willing to run the risk of accident for the benefit of he reader however mr p will lift up this heavily shotted lap-cloth and show what be under it -lrb- illustration -rrb- here be arrange a steam-engine which drive the wheel of the vehicle and which will of course propel the whole turnout horse and all at a great rate of speed it will now be easily perceive why mr p persist in keep he lap-cloth over he knee the entry be as follow : robert bonner 's b h dexter deren o sue 's b m lady thorn punchinello 's y h creep peter when the word be give the horse all get off well and dexter immediately take the lead -- buzz through the air like a humming-top -- follow closely by lady thorn she nose just lap he off jaw for the first few seconds mr p fall behind owe to he fire not yet be properly under way but the water soon bubble merrily in he boiler and he wheel begin to revolve with great rapidity and now he speed merrily never do the war trumpet inspire the fiery charger or hound and horn excite the mettled hunter as the steam-engine in he rear wake all the energy of creep peter swift as revolving pin-wheel or rapid peg-top those spavin those ring-bone those bulbous hock those sand-cracked hoof and those rattle rib go whistle o'er the track mid the shout and yell of the excited multitude he pass lady thorn overtook dexter and shot ahead of he but he can not stand that tremendous pace and down go creep peter on he knee every man who have bet against he set up a howl of rapture but mr p never relax a muscle and on go creep peter just as fast as ever he horny bone dash away the sand and gravel like spray from the cut-water of a scud yacht and amid the wildest clamor he shoot past the judge ' stand on he nose and one leg make he mile in two minute and two seconds -lrb- illustration -rrb- it be needless to dwell upon the result of this race mr p now owe no man anything nor be he even indebted to he noble steed behold he testimony to the merit of that

from gummidge to dickinson we be unable to discover there be no record of the event in the musty tome we have wade through at the astor library in search of reliable datum one thing must be apparent even to the most violently prejudice and brutish bigot -- namely that miss dickinson no longer confess to the name of gummidge however disrespectful this may be to the memory of mr gummidge 's father -- but on reflection be it not possible that mr gummidge 's maiden name be dickinson there may be something in this let we see mr gummidge be bear of the brain of mr c dickens mr dickens may be say to be the father of the whole gummidge family this of course include gummidge _ père _ gummidge _ père _ be therefore dickens ' son hence the name of dickenson very good so far now -- but it be unnecessary to press the argument if the prejudiced bigot be not yet convinced nothing would convince he short of a horse-whipping the poet when he write thou wilt come no more gentle annie be clearly
