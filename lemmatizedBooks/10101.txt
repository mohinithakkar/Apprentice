many trade shepherd soldier sailor ploughman carter -- one could go on all day name without get to the end of they for myself boy and man i have be many thing work for a living and sometimes do thing just for pleasure but somehow whatever i do it never seem quite the right and proper thing to do -- it never quite satisfied I i always want to do something else -- i want to be a carpenter it seem to I that to stand among wood-shaving and sawdust make thing at a bench with bright beautiful tool out of nice-smelling wood be the cleanest healthiest prettiest work that any man can do now all this have nothing or very little to do with my story : i only speak of it because i have to begin somehow and it strike I that i would make a start that way and for another reason too _ he father be a carpenter _ i mean martin 's father -- martin the little boy lose he father 's name be john and he be a very good man and a good carpenter and he love to do he carpentering better than anything else in fact as much as i should have love it if i have be teach that trade he live in a seaside town name southampton where there be a great harbor where he see great ship come and go to and from all part of the world now no strong brave man can live in a place like that see the ship and often talk to the people who voyage in they about the distant land where they have be without wish to go and see those distant country for himself when it be winter in england and it rain and rain and the east wind blow and it be gray and cold and the tree be bare who do not think how nice it would be to fly away like the summer bird to some distant country where the sky be always blue and the sun shine bright and warm every day and so it come to pass that john at last when he be a old man sell he shop and go abroad they go to a country many thousand of mile away -- for you must know that mr john go too and when the sea voyage end they travel many day and week in a wagon until they come to the place where they want to live and there in that lonely country they build a house and make a garden and plant a orchard it be a desert and they have no neighbor but they be happy enough because they have as much land as they want and the weather be always bright and beautiful john too have he carpenter 's tool to work with when he feel inclined and best of all they have little martin to love and think about but how about martin himself you might think that with no other child to prattle to and play with or even to see it be too lonely a home for he not a bit of it no child could have be happier he do not want for company he playfellow be the dog and cat and chicken and any creature in and about the house but most of all he love the little shy creature that live in the sunshine among the flower -- the small bird and butterfly and little beastie and creep thing he be accustom to see outside the gate among the tall wild sunflower there be acre of these plant and they be taller than martin and cover with flower no bigger than marigold and here among the sunflower he use to spend most of the day as happy as possible he have other amusement too whenever john go to he carpenter 's shop -- for the old man still dearly love he carpentering -- martin would run in to keep he company one thing he like to do be to pick up the longest wood-shaving to wind they round he neck and arm and leg and then he would laugh and dance with delight happy as a young indian in he ornament a wood-shaving may seem a poor plaything to a child with all the toyshop in london to pick and choose from but it be really very curious and pretty bright and smooth to the touch pencil with delicate wavy line while in its spiral shape it remind one of wind plant and tendril by means of which vine and creeper support themselves and flower with curl petal and curl leaf and sea-shell and many other pretty natural object one day martin run into the house look very flushed and joyous hold up he pinafore with something heavy in it what have you get now cry he father and mother in a breath get up to peep at he treasure for martin be always fetch in the most curious out-of-the-way thing to show they my pretty shaving say martin proudly -lrb- illustration : -rrb- when they look they be amaze and horrify to see a spotted green snake coil comfortably up in the pinafore it do not appear to like be look at by they for it raise its curious heart-shaped head and flick its little red fork tongue at they he mother give a great scream and drop the jug she have in she hand upon the floor while john rush off to get a big stick drop it martin -- drop the wicked snake before it sting you and i 'll soon kill it martin stare surprised at the fuss they be make then still tightly hold the end of he pinafore he turn and run out of the room and away as fast as he could go away go he father after he stick in hand and out of the gate into the thicket of tall wild sunflower where martin have vanish from sight after hunting about for some time he find the little run-away sit on the ground among the weed where 's the snake he cry go say martin wave he little hand around i let it go and you must not look for it john pick the child up in he arm and march back to the room and pop he down on the floor then give he a good scolding it be a mercy the poisonous thing do not sting you he say you be a naughty little boy to play with snake because they be dangerous bad thing and you die if they bite you and now you must go straight to bed that be the only punishment that have any effect on such a harebrained little butterfly martin pucker up he face for a cry creep away to he little room it be very hard to have to go to bed in the daytime when he be not sleepy and when the bird and butterfly be out in the sunshine have such a good time it be not a bit of use scold he -- i find that out long ago say mr john shake she head do you know john i can not help think sometimes that he be not we child at all whose child do you think he be then say john who have a cup of water in he hand for the chase after martin have make he hot and he want cool i do not know -- but i once have a very curious dream people often do have curious dream say wise old john but this be a very curious one and i remember say to myself if this do not mean something that be go to happen then dream do not count for much no more they do say john it be in england just when we be get ready for the voyage and it be autumn when the bird be leave we i dream that i go out alone and walk by the sea and stand watch a great number of swallow fly by and out over the sea -- fly away to some distant land by-and-by i notice one bird come down lower and lower as if he want to alight and i watch it and it come down straight to I and at last fly right into my bosom i put my hand on it and look close saw that it be a martin all pure white on its throat and breast and with a white patch on its back then i wake up and it be because of that dream that i name we child martin instead of john as you wish to do now when i watch swallow fly about come and go round the house i sometimes think that martin come to we like that one in the dream and that some day he will fly away from we when he get bigger i mean when he get littler you mean say john with a laugh no no he be too big for a swallow -- a michaelmas goose would be nothing to he for size but here i be listen to you silly dream instead of water the melon and cucumber and out he go to he garden but in a minute he put he head in at the door and say you may go and tell he to get up if you like poor little fellow only make he promise not to go chum with spotted snake any more and not to bring they into the house because somehow they disagree with I -lrb- illustration : -rrb- chapter ii the spoonbill and the cloud as martin grow in year and strength he age be now about seven he ramble begin to extend beyond the waste grounds outside of the fenced orchard and gate these waste grounds be a wilderness of weed : here be the sunflower that martin like best the wild cock 's - comb flaunt great crimson tuft the yellow flowering mustard taller than the tallest man giant thistle and wild pumpkin with spotted leave the huge hairy fox-glove with yellow bell feathery fennel and the big grey-green thorn-apple with prickly bur full of bright red seed and long white wax-like flower that bloom only in the evening he could never get high enough on anything to see over the top of these plant but at last he find he way through they and discover on they further side a wide grassy plain with scarcely a tree on it stretch away into the blue distance on this vast plain he gaze with wonderment and delight behind the orchard and weedy waste the ground slope down to a stream of run water full of tall rush with dark green polished stem and yellow water-lily all along the moist bank grow other flower that be never see in the dry ground above -- the blue star and scarlet and white verbena and sweet-pea of all color and the delicate red vinegar flower and angel 's hair and the small fragrant lily call mary 's - tear and tall scatter flag flaunt they yellow blossom high above the meadow grass every day martin run down to the stream to gather flower and shell for many curious water-snail be find there with brown purple-striped shell and he also like to watch the small bird that build they nest in the rush there be three of these small bird that do not appear to know that martin love they for no sooner would he present himself at the stream than forth they would flutter in a great state of mind one the prettiest be a tiny green-backed little creature with a crimson crest and a velvet-black band across a bright yellow breast : this one have a soft low complain voice clear as a silver bell the second be a brisk little gray and black fellow with a loud indignant chuck and a broad tail which he incessantly open and shut like a spanish lady play with she fan the third be a shy mysterious little brown bird peer out of the clustering leave and make a sound like the soft ticking of a clock they be like three little man a italian a dutchman and a hindoo talk together each in he own language and yet well able to understand each other martin could not make out what they say but suspect that they be talk about he and he fear that they remark be not always of a friendly nature at length he make the discovery that the water of the stream be perpetually run away if he drop a leaf on the surface it would hasten down stream and toss about and fret impatiently against anything that stand in its way until make its escape it would quickly hurry out of sight whither do this ripple run water go he be anxious to find out at length lose all fear and fire with the sight of many new and pretty thing he find while follow it he run along the bank until mile from home he come to a great lake he could hardly see across it be so broad it be a wonderful place full of bird not small fretful creature flit in and out of the rush but great majestic bird that take very little notice of he far out on the blue surface of the water float number of wild fowl and chief among they for grace and beauty be the swan pure white with black head and neck and crimson bill there also be stately flamingo stalk along knee-deep in the water which be shallow and nearer to the shore be flock of rose-coloured spoonbill and solitary big gray heron stand motionless also group of white egret and a great multitude of glossy ibis with dark green and purple plumage and long sickle-like beak the sight of this water with its bed of rush and tall flowering reed and its great company of bird fill martin with delight and other joy be soon to follow throw off he shoe he dash with a shout into the water frightening a number of ibis up they fly each bird utter a cry repeat many time that sound just like he old father 's laugh when he laugh loud and heartily then what be martin 's amazement to hear he own shout and this chorus of bird ha ha ha 's repeat by hundred of voice all over the lake at first he think that the other bird be mock the ibis but presently he shout again and again he shout be repeat by dozen of voice this delighted he so much that he spend the whole day shout himself hoarse at the waterside when he relate he wonderful experience at home and hear from he father that the sound he have hear be only echo from the bed of rush he be not a bit wiser than before so that the echo remain to he a continual wonder and source of never-failing pleasure every day he would take some noisy instrument to the lake to startle the echo a whistle he father make he serve for a time after that he march up and down the bank rattle a tin canister with pebble in it then he get a large frying-pan from the kitchen and beat on it with a stick every day for about a fortnight when he grow tired of all these sound and begin cast about for some new thing to wake the echo with he all at once remember he father 's gun -- just what he want for it be the noisiest thing in the world watch he opportunity he get secretly into the room where it be keep loaded and succeed in carry it out of the house without be see then full of joyful anticipation he run as fast as the heavy gun would let he to he favorite haunt when he arrive at the lake three or four spoonbill -- those beautiful tall rose-coloured bird -- be stand on the bank quietly doze in the hot sunshine they do not fly away at he approach for the bird be now so accustomed to martin and he harmless noise that they take very little notice of he he kneel on one knee and point the gun at they -lrb- illustration : -rrb- now birdy you do not know what a fright i be go to give you -- off you go he cry and pull the trigger the roar of the loud report travel all over the wide lake create a great commotion among the feathered people and they rise up with a general scream into the air all this be of no benefit to martin the recoil of the gun have send he fly over he heel in the air and before he recover himself the echo be silent and all the frightened bird be settle on the water again but there just before he lay one of the spoonbill beat its great rose-coloured wing against the ground martin run to it full of keen distress but be powerless to help its life 's blood be fast run away from the shot wound it have receive in its side stain the grass with crimson presently it close its beautiful ruby-coloured eye and the quiver wing grow still then martin sit down on the grass by its side and begin to cry oh that great bird half as tall as himself and so many time more lovely and strong and beautiful in its life -- he have kill it and it would never fly again he raise it up very tenderly in he arm and kiss it -- kiss its pale green head and rosy wing then out of he arm it tumble back again on to the grass oh poor bird he cry suddenly open you wing and fly away but it be dead then martin get up and stare all round he at the wide landscape and everything look strange and dim and sorrowful a shadow pass over the lake and a murmur come up out of the rush that be like a voice say something that he could not understand a great cry of pain rise from he heart and die to a whisper on he lip he be awed into silence sink down upon the grass again he hide he face against the rosy-breasted bird and begin to sob how warm the dead bird feel against he cheek -- oh so warm -- and it could not live and fly about with the other at length he sit up and know the reason of that change that have come over the earth a dark cloud have spring up in the south-west far off as yet and near the horizon but its fringe already touch and obscure the low-hanging sun and a shadow fly far and vast before it over the lake fly that great shadow : the water look cold and still reflect as in a polished glass the motionless rush the glassy bank and martin sit on it still clasp in he arm the dead rose-coloured bird swifter and vaster follow close upon the fly shadow come the mighty cloud change from black to slaty gray and then as the sun break forth again under its lower edge it be all flush with a brilliant rise color but what a marvellous thing it be when the cloud cover a third of the wide heaven almost touch the horizon on either side with its wing-like extremity martin gaze steadily at it see that in its form it be like a immense spoonbill fly through the air he would gladly have run away then to hide himself from its sight but he dare not stir for it be now directly above he so lie down on the grass and hide he face against the dead bird he wait in fear and tremble -lrb- illustration : -rrb- he hear the rush sound of the mighty wing : the wind they create smote on the water in a hurricane so that the reed be beat flat on the surface and a great cry of terror go up from all the wild bird it pass and when martin raise he bow head and look again the sun just about to touch the horizon with its great red globe shine out shed a rich radiance over the earth and water while far off on the opposite side of the heaven the great cloud-bird be rapidly fading out of sight chapter iii chase a fly figure after what have happen martin could never visit the waterside and look at the great bird wade and swim there without a feeling that be like a sudden coldness in the blood of he vein the rosy spoonbill he have kill and cry over and the great bird-cloud that have frighten he be never forget he grow tired of shout to the echo : he discover that there be even more wonderful thing than the marsh echo in the world and that the world be bigger than he have think it when spring with its moist verdure and frail sweet-smelling flower have go when the great plain begin to turn to a rusty-brown color and the dry hard earth be full of crack and the day grow longer and the heat greater there come a appearance of water that quiver and glitter and dance before he wonder sight and would lead he mile from home every day in he vain effort to find out what it be he could talk of nothing else and ask endless question about it and they tell he that this strange thing be nothing but the mirage but of course that be not tell he enough so that he be leave to puzzle he little boy-brain over this new mystery just as they have puzzle before over the mystery of the echo now this mirage be a glittering whiteness that look just like water always shine and dance before he and all round he on the dry level plain where there be no water it be never quiet but perpetually quiver and run into wavelet that throw up crest and jet of spray as from a fountain and shower of brilliant drop that flash like molten silver in the sunlight before they break and vanish only to be renew again it appear every day when the sun be high and the air hot and it be often call _ the false water _ and false it be since it always fly before he as he run so that although he often seem to be get nearer to it he could never quite overtake it but martin have a very determine spirit for a small boy and although this appearance of water mock he effort a hundred time every day with its vanish brightness and beauty he would not give up the pursuit now one day when there be not a cloud on the great hot whitey-blue sky nor a breath of air stir when it be all silent for not even a grass-hopper creak in the dead yellow motionless grass the whole level earth begin to shine and sparkle like a lake of silvery water as martin have never see it shine before he have wander far away from home -- never have he be so far -- and still he run and run and run and still that whiteness quiver and glitter and fly on before he and ever it look more temptingly near urge he to fresh exertion at length tire out and overcome with heat he sit down to rest and feel very much hurt at the way he have be deceive and lead on he shed one little tear there be no mistake about that tear he feel it run like a small spider down he cheek and finally he see it fall it fall on to a blade of yellow grass and run down the blade then stop so as to gather itself into a little round drop before touch the ground just then out of the root of the grass beneath it creep a tiny dusty black beetle and begin drink the drop wave its little horn up and down like donkey 's ear apparently very much pleased at its good fortune in finding water and have a good drink in such a dry thirsty place probably it take the tear for a drop of rain just fall out of the sky you _ be _ a funny little thing exclaim martin feeling now less like cry than laugh the wee beetle satisfied and refresh climb up the grass-blade and when it reach the tip lift its dusty black wing-case just enough to throw out a pair of fine gauzy wing that have be neatly fold up beneath they and fly away -lrb- illustration : -rrb- martin follow its flight have he eye quite dazzle by the intense glitter of the false water which now seem to be only a few yard from he : but the strangest thing be that in it there appear a form -- a bright beautiful form that vanish when he gaze steadily at it again he get up and begin run harder than ever after the fly mock mirage and every time he stop he fancy that he could see the figure again sometimes like a pale blue shadow on the brightness sometimes shine with its own excessive light and sometimes only see in outline like a figure grave on glass and always vanish when look at steadily perhaps that white water-like glitter of the mirage be like a looking-glass and he be only chase he own reflection i can not say but there it be always before he a face as of a beautiful boy with tumbled hair and laugh lip its figure clothe in a flutter dress of light and shadow it also seem to beckon to he with its hand and encourage he to run on after it with its bright merry glance -lrb- illustration : -rrb- at length when it be past the hour of noon martin sit down under a small bush that give just shade enough to cover he and none to spare it be only a little spot of shade like a island in a sea of heat and brightness he be too hot and tired to run more too tired even to keep he eye open and so prop he back against the stem of the small bush he close he tired hot eye chapter iv martin be find by a deaf old man martin keep he eye shut for only about a minute as he think but he must have be asleep some time for when he open they the false water have vanish and the sun look very large and crimson be just about to set he start up feeling very thirsty and hungry and bewildered for he be far far from home and lose on the great plain presently he spy a man come towards he on horseback a very funny-looking old man he prove to be with a face wrinkled and tan by sun and wind until it resemble a piece of ancient shoe-leather left lie for year on some neglect spot of ground a brazil nut be not darker nor more wrinkled than be the old man 's face he long matted beard and hair have once be white but the sun out of door and the smoke in he smoky hut have give they a yellowish tinge so that they look like dry dead grass he wear big jack-boot patch all over and full of crack and hole and a great pea-jacket rusty and ragged fasten with horn button big as saucer he old brimless hat look like a dilapidated tea-cosy on he head and to prevent it from be carry off by the wind it be keep on with a old flannel shirtsleeve tie under he chin he saddle too like he clothes be old and full of rent with wisp of hair and straw-stuffing sticking out in various place and he foot be thrust into a pair of big stirrup make of piece of wood and rusty iron tie together with string and wire -lrb- illustration : -rrb- boy what may you be a do of here bawl this old man at the top of he voice : for he be as deaf as a post and like a good many deaf people think it necessary to speak very loud to make himself hear play answer martin innocently but he could not make the old man hear until he stand up on tip-toe and shout out he answer as loud as he could play exclaim the old man well i never in all my life when there be not a house ` cept my own for league and league and he say he be play what may you be now he shout again a little boy scream martin i know that afore i axed say the other then he slap he leg and hold up he hand with astonishment and at last begin to chuckle will you come home along o ' I he shout will you give I something to eat asked martin in return haw haw haw guffaw the old fellow it be a tremendous laugh so loud and hollow it astonished and almost frightened martin to hear it well i never he say he be not no fool neither now old jacob just you take you time and think a bit afore you make you answer to that this curious old man whose name be jacob have live so long by himself that he always think out loud -- louder than other people talk : for be deaf he could not hear himself and never have a suspicion that he could be hear by other he be lose that be what he be continue old jacob aloud to himself and what be more he be be and go and forget all about he own home and all he want be summat to eat i 'll take he and keep he that be what i 'll do : for he be a stray lamb and belong to he that find he like any other lamb i find i 'll make he believe i be he old dad for he be little and will believe most anything you tell he i 'll learn he to do thing about the house -- to boil the kettle and cook the wittel and gather the firewood and mend the clothes and do the wash and draw the water and milk the cow and dig the potato and mind the sheep and -- and -- and that be what i 'll learn he then jacob you can sit down and smoke you pipe ` cos you 'll have some one to do you work for you martin stand quietly listen to all this not quite understand the old man 's kind intention then old jacob promise to give he something to eat pull he up on to he horse and start home at a gallop soon they arrive at a mud hovel thatch with rush the roof slope down so low that one could almost step on to it it be surround with a ditch and have a potato patch and a sheep enclosure for old jacob be a shepherd and have a flock of sheep there be several big dog and when martin get down from the horse they begin jump round he bark with delight as if they know he half-smothering he with they rough caress jacob lead he into the hut which look extremely dirty and neglect and have only one room in the corner against the wall be pile of sheep-skin that have a strong and rather unpleasant smell : the thatch above be cover with dusty cobweb hang like old rag and the clay floor be litter with bone stick and other rubbish the only nice thing to see be a teakettle singing and steam away merrily on the fire in the grate old jacob set about prepare the evening meal and soon they sit down at a small deal table to a supper of cold mutton and potato and tea which do not taste very nice as it be sweeten with moist black sugar martin be too hungry to turn up he nose at anything and while he eat and drink the old man chuckle and talk aloud to himself about he good fortune in find the little boy to do he work for he after supper he clear the table and put two mug of tea on it and then get out he clay pipe and tobacco now little boy he cry let 's have a jolly evening together you very good health little boy and here he jingle he mug against martin 's and take a sip of tea would you like to hear a song little boy he say after finish he pipe no say martin who be get sleepy but jacob take no to mean yes and so he stand up on he leg and sing this song : -- my name be jacob that be my name and tho ' i be old the old man 's game -- the air it be so good d'ye see : and on the plain my flock i keep and sing all day to please my sheep and never lose they like bo-peep beco the way of they be know to I when winter come and wind do blow unto my sheep so good i go -- i be always good to they d'ye see -- ho sheep say i both ram both ewe i have sing you song all summer through now lend to I a skin or two to keep the cold and wet from out o ' I this song accompany with loud rap on the table be bellow forth in a dreadfully discordant voice and very soon all the dog rush into the room and begin to bark and howl most dismally which seem to please the old man greatly for to he it be a kind of applause but the noise be too much for martin so he stop up he ear and only remove he finger from they when the performance be over after the song the old man offer to dance for he have not yet have amusement enough boy can you play on this he shout hold up a frying-pan and a big stick to beat it with of course martin could play on _ that _ instrument : he have often enough play on one like it to startle the echo on the lake in other day and so when he have be lift on to the table he take the frying-pan by the handle and begin vigorously beat on it with the stick he do not mind the noise now since he be help to make it meanwhile old jacob begin fling he arm and leg about in all direction look like a scarecrow make to tumble about by means of spring and wire he pound the clay floor with he ponderous old boot until the room be fill with a cloud of dust then in he excitement he kick over chair pot kettle and whatever come in he way while he keep on revolving round the table in a kind of crazy fandango martin think it fine fun and scream with laughter and beat he gong louder than ever then to make matter worse old jacob at interval utter whoop and yell which the dog answer with long howl from the door until the din be something tremendous -lrb- illustration : -rrb- at length they both grow tired and then after rest and sip some more cold tea prepared to go to bed some sheep-skin be pile up in a corner for martin to sleep on and old jacob cover he with a horse-rug and tuck he in very carefully then the kind old man withdraw to he own bed on the opposite side of the room about midnight martin be waken by loud horrible noise in the room and start up on bed tremble with fear the sound come from the old man 's nose and resemble a succession of blast on a ram 's horn which on account of its roughness and twisted shape make a very bad trumpet as soon as martin discover the cause of the noise he creep out of bed and try to waken the old snorer by shout at he tug at he arm and leg and finally pull he beard he refuse to wake then martin have a bright idea and grope he way to the bucket of cold water standing beside the fire-place he manage to raise it up in he arm and pour it over the sleeper the snore change to a series of loud choke snort then cease martin well pleased at the success of he experiment be about to return to he bed when old jacob struggle up to a sit posture hullo wake up little boy he shout my bed 's all full o ' water -- goodness know where it come from i pour it over you to wake you up do not you know you be make a noise with you nose cry martin at the top of he voice you -- you -- you throw it over I you -- o you most wicked little villain you you throw it over I do you and here he pour out such a torrent of abusive word that martin be horrify and cry out o what a naughty wicked bad old man you be it be too dark for old jacob to see he but he know he way about the room and take up the wet rug that serve he for cover he grope he way to martin 's bed and begin pound it with the rug think the naughty little boy be there you little rascal you -- i hope you like that -- and that -- and that he shout pound away i 'll learn you to throw water over you poor old dad and such a -- a affectionate father as i have be too give he sich nice wittel -- and -- and

my bed ` co it be wet d'ye see and i 'll sleep on yourn ` co it be dry then he get into martin 's bed and mutter and grumble himself to sleep martin come out from under the table and after dress himself with great secrecy creep to the door to make he escape it be lock and the key take away but he be determine to make he escape somehow and not wait to be whip so by and by he draw the little deal table close against the wall and get on to it begin pick the rush one by one out of the lower part of the thatch after work for half-an-hour like a mouse eat he way out of a soft wooden box he begin to see the light come through the hole and in another half hour it be large enough for he to creep through when he have get out he slip down to the ground where the dog be lie they seem very glad to see he and begin press round to lick he face but he push they off and run away over the plain as fast as he could the star be shine but it be very dark and silent only in moist place where the grass grow tall he hear the cricket strum sadly on they little harp at length tire with run he coil himself in a large tussock of dry grass and go to sleep just as if he have be accustom to sleep out of door all he life chapter v the people of the mirage in that remote land where martin be bear with its bright warm climate and rich soil no person need go very long hungry -- not even a small boy alone and lose on the great grassy plain for there be a little useful plant in that place with small leaf like clover leave and a pretty yellow flower which bear a wholesome sweet root about as big as a pigeon 's egg and of a pearly white color it be so well know to the settler ' child in that desert country that they be always wander off to the plain to look for it just as the child in a town be always run off with they halfpenny to the sweet-stuff shop this pretty white root be watery so that it satisfy both hunger and thirst at the same time now when martin wake next morning he find a great many of the little three-leaved plant grow close to the spot where he have sleep and they supply he with a nice sweet breakfast after he have eat enough and have amuse himself by roll over and over several time on the grass he start once more on he travels go towards the sunrise as fast as he could run he could run well for a small boy but he get tire at last and sit down to rest then he jump up and go on again at a trot : this pace he keep up very steadily only pause from time to time to watch a flock of small white bird that follow he all the morning out of curiosity at length he begin to feel so hot and tired that he could only walk still he keep on he could see no flower nor anything pretty in that place -- why should he stay in it he would go on and on and on in spite of the heat until he come to something but it grow hotter as the day advance and the ground about he more dry and barren and desolate until at last he come to grind where there be scarcely a blade of grass : it be a great barren level plain cover with a slight crust of salt crystal that glitter in the sun so brightly that it dazzle and pained he eyesight here be no sweet watery root for refreshment and no berry nor could martin find a bush to give he a little shade and protection from the burning noonday sun he see one large dark object in the distance and mistake it for a bush cover with thick foliage he run towards it but suddenly it start up when he be near and wave its great gray and white wing like sail flee across the plain it be a ostrich now this hot shadeless plain seem to be the very home and dwelling-place of the false water it sparkle and dance all round he so close that there only appear to be a small space of dry ground for he to walk on only he be always exactly in the center of the dry spot for as he advance the glittering whiteness that look so like shiny water fly mockingly before he step but he hope to get to it at last as every time he flag in the chase the mysterious figure of the day before appear again to lure he still further on at length unable to move another step martin sit right down on the bare ground : it be like sit on the floor of a heated oven but there be no help for it he be so tired the air be so thick and heavy that he could hardly breathe even with he mouth wide open like a little gasping bird and the sky look like metal heat to a white heat and so low down as to make he fancy that if he be to throw up he hand he would touch it and burn he finger and the mirage -- oh how it glisten and quiver here where he have sit down half blind he with its brightness now that he could no longer run after it nor even walk it come to he break round and over he in a thousand fantastic shape fill the air with a million white flake that whirl about as if drive by a furious wind although not a breath be stir they look like whitest snow-flake yet sting he cheek like spark of fire not only do he see and feel he could even _ hear _ it now : he ear be fill with a hum sound grow louder and louder every minute like the noise make by a large colony of bumble-bee when a person carelessly tread on they nest and they be angered and throw into a great commotion and swarm out to defend they home very soon out of this confused murmur louder clearer sound begin to rise and these could be distinguish as the note of numberless musical instrument and voice of people sing talk and laugh then all at once there appear running and skip over the ground towards he a great company of girl -- score and hundred of they scatter over the plain exceed in loveliness all lovely thing that he have ever behold they face be whiter than lily and they loose flutter hair look like a mist of pale shine gold and they skirt that rustle as they run be also shine like the wing of dragon-fly and be touch with brown reflection and change beautiful tint such as be see on soap-bubble each of they carry a silver pitcher and as they run and skip along they dip they finger in and sprinkle the desert with water the bright drop they scatter fall all around in a grateful shower and fly up again from the heated earth in the form of a white mist touch with rainbow color fill the air with a refreshing coolness at martin 's side there grow a small plant its grey-green leave lie wilt on the ground and one of the girl pause to water it and as she sprinkle the drop on it she sing : -- little weed little weed in such need must you pain ask in vain die for rain never bloom never seed little weed o no no you shall not die from the sky with my pitcher down i fly drink the rain grow again bloom and seed little weed martin hold up he hot little hand to catch some of the fall drop then the girl raise she pitcher pour a stream of cool water right into he face and laughing at what she have do go away with a hop skip and jump after she companion the girl with pitcher have all go and be succeed by troops of boy just as beautiful many of they singing and some playing on wind and stringed instrument and some be run other quietly walk and still other ride on various animal -- ostrich sheep goat fawn and small donkey all pure white one boy be ride on a ram and as he come by strum-strumming on a little silver-stringed banjo he sing a very curious song which make martin prick up he ear to listen it be about a speckled snake that live far away on a piece of waste ground how day after day he seek for he lose playmate -- the little boy that have leave he how he glide this way and that on he smooth bright belly wind in and out among the tall wild sunflower how he listen for the dear footstep -- listen with he green leaf-shaped little head raise high among the leaf but he playmate be far away and come no more to feed he from he basin of bread and milk and caress he cold smooth coil with he warm soft little hand close after the boy on the ram march four other little boy on foot hold up long silver trumpet in readiness to blow one of they stop and put he trumpet down close to martin 's ear puff out he little round cheek and blow a blast that make he jump laugh at the joke they pass on and be succeed by other and still other singing shout twang they instrument and some of they stop for a few moment to look at martin or play some pretty little trick on he but now all at once martin cease to listen or even look at they for something new and different be come something strange which make he curious and afraid at the same time it be a sound very deep and solemn of man 's voice singing together a song that be like a dirge and come nearer and nearer and it be like the come of a storm with wind and rain and thunder soon he could see they march through the great crowd of people -- old man move in a slow procession and they have pale dark face and they hair and long beard be whiter than snow and they long flow robe be of the silvery dark color of a rain-cloud then he see that the leader of the procession be follow by other who carry a couch of mother-o ' - pearl rest on they shoulder that on the couch repose a pale sweet-looking youth dress in silk clothes of a delicate rose-colour he also wear crimson shoe and a tight-fitting apple-green skull cap which make he head look very small he eye be ruby-red and he have a long slender nose like a snipe 's bill only broad and flatten at the tip and then martin see that he be wound for he have one white hand press to he side and it be stain with blood and drop of blood be trickle through he finger he be trouble at the sight and he gaze at he and listen to the word of that solemn song the old man be singing but could not understand they not because he be a child for no person however aged and wise and fill with all learn he might be could have understand that strange song about wonderful life and wonderful death yet there be something in it too which any one who hear it man or child could understand and he understand it and it go into he heart to make it so heavy and sad that he could have put he little face down on the ground and cry as he have never cry before but he do not put he face down and cry for just then the wounded youth look down on he as they carry he past and smile a very sweet smile : then martin feel that he love he above all the bright and beautiful being that have pass before he then when he be go from sight when the solemn sound of the voice begin to grow fainter in the distance like the sound of a storm when it pass away he heaviness of heart and sorrow leave he and he begin to listen to the shout and cry and clanging of noisy instrument of music swiftly come nearer and nearer and then all round and past he come a vast company of youth and maiden singing and playing and shout and dance as they move onwards they be the most beautiful being he have ever see in they shine dress some all in white other in amber-colour other in sky-blue and some in still other lovely color the queen the queen they be shout stand up little boy and bow to the queen the queen kneel to the queen little boy cry other then many other in the company begin cry out together the queen lie down flat on the ground little boy the queen shut you eye and open you mouth little boy the queen run away as fast as you can little boy stand on you head to the queen little boy crow like a cock and bark like a dog little boy try to obey all these conflict command at one and the same time poor martin make strange noise and tumble about this way and that and set they all laugh at he the queen wish to speak to you -- stand up little boy say one of the brightest being touch martin on the cheek there before he surround by all that beautiful company stand the horse that draw she -- great milk-white horse impatiently paw the dusty ground with they hoof and proudly champ they gold bridle toss the white froth from they mouth but when he lift he eye timidly to the majestic be seat in she chariot before he he be dazzle and overcome with the sight she face have a brightness that be like that of the mirage at noon and the eye that gaze on he be like two great opal she appear clothe in a white shine mist and she hair spread wide on she shoulder look white -- whiter than a lamb 's fleece and powdered with fine gold that sparkle and quiver and run through it like spark of yellow fire : and on she head she wear a crown that be like a diamond see by candle-light or like a dewdrop in the sun and every moment it change its color and by turn be a red flame then a green then a yellow then a violet -lrb- illustration : -rrb- child you have follow I far say the queen and now you be reward for you have look on my face and i have refresh you and the sun my father will never more hurt you for my sake he be a naughty boy and unworthy of

laughter even the queen laugh when she say that she forgive he that too and martin when he remember old jacob and see that they only make a joke of it laugh with they but the accuse voice still go on : and when the good old shepherd go to sleep a second time then the naughty little boy climb on the table and pick a hole in the thatch and get out and run away another burst of laughter follow then a youth in a shine violet-coloured dress suddenly begin twang on he instrument and wildly caper about in imitation of old jacob 's dancing and while he play and dance he sing -- ho sheep whose way be

be it say the queen and to you two gift i shall add a third let all man love he go now martin you be well equip and satisfy you heart with the sight of all the strange and beautiful thing the world contain kneel and thank the queen for she gift say a voice to martin he drop on to he knee but could speak no word when he raise he eye again the whole glorious company have vanish -lrb- illustration : -rrb- the air be cool and fragrant the earth moist as if a shower have just fall he get up and slowly walk onward until near sunset thinking of nothing but the beautiful people of the mirage he have leave the barren salt plain behind by now the earth be cover with yellow grass and he find and eat some sweet root and berry then feel very tired he stretch himself out on he back and begin to wonder if what he have see be nothing but a dream yes it be surely a dream but then -- in he life dream and reality be so mixed -- how be he always to know one from the other which be most strange the mirage that glitter and quiver round he and fly mockingly before he or the people of the mirage he have see if you be lie quite still with you eye shut and some one come softly up and stand over you somehow you know it and open you eye to see who it be just in that way martin know that some one have come and be stand over he still he keep he eye shut feeling sure that it be one of those bright and beautiful being he have lately see perhaps the queen herself and that the sight of she shine countenance would dazzle he eye then all at once he think that it might be old jacob who would punish he for run away he open he eye very quickly then what do you think he see a ostrich -- that same big ostrich he have see and startle early in the day it be stand over he stare down with its great vacant eye gradually its head come lower and lower down until at last it make a sudden peck at a metal button on he jacket and give such a vigorous tug at it that martin be almost lift off the ground he scream and give a jump but it be nothing to the jump the ostrich give when he discover that the button belong to a living boy he jump six foot high into the air and come down with a great flop then feel rather ashamed of himself for be frighten at such a insignificant thing as martin he stalk majestically away glance back first over one shoulder then the other and kick up he heel behind he in a somewhat disdainful manner martin laugh and in the middle of he laugh he fall asleep chapter vi martin meet with savage when on wake next morning martin take he first peep over the grass there directly before he loom the great blue hill or sierra as they be call in that country he have often see they long ago in he distant home on clear morning when they have appear like a blue cloud on the horizon he have even wish to get to they to tread they beautiful blue summit that look as if they would be soft to he foot -- softer than the moist springy turf on the plain but he wish it only as one wish to get to some far-off impossible place -- a white cloud for instance or the blue sky itself now all at once he unexpectedly find himself near they and the sight fire he with a new desire the level plain have nothing half so enchanting as the cloud-like blue airy hill and very soon he be up on he foot and hurry towards they in spite of hurry he do not seem to get any nearer still it be pleasant to be always go on and on know that he would get to they at last he have now leave the drier plain behind the earth be clothe with green and yellow grass easy to the foot and during the day he find many sweet root to refresh he he also find quantity of cam-berry a round fruit a little less than a cherry in size bright yellow in color and each berry inside a green case or sheath shape like a heart they be very sweet at night he sleep once more in the long grass and when daylight return he travel on feeling very happy there alone -- happy to think that he would get to the beautiful hill at last but only in the early morning would they look distinct and near later in the day when the sun grow hot they would seem further off like a cloud rest on the earth which make he think sometimes that they move on as he go towards they on the third day he come to a high piece of ground and when he get to the top and look over to the other side he see a broad green valley with a stream of water run in it : on one hand the valley with its gleaming water stretch away as far as he could see or until it lose itself in the distant haze but on the other hand on look up the valley there appear a great forest look blue in the distance and this be the first forest martin have ever see close by down in the green valley before he there be something else to attract he attention and this be a large group of man and horse no sooner have he catch sight of they than he set off at a run towards they greatly excited and as he draw near they all rise up from the grass where they have be sit or lie to stare at he fill with wonder at the sight of that small boy alone in the desert there be about twenty man and woman and several child the man be very big and tall and be dress only in robe make of the skin of some wild animal they have broad flat face and dark copper-coloured skin and they long black hair hang down loose on they back these strange rude-looking people be savage and be suppose to be cruel and wicked and to take pleasure in torture and kill any lose or stray person that fall into they hand but indeed it be not so as you shall shortly find poor ignorant little martin who have never read a book in he life have always refuse to learn he letter know nothing about savage and fear they no more than he have fear old jacob or the small spotted snake the very sight of which have make grown-up people scream and run away so he march boldly up and stare at they and they in turn stare at he out of they great dark savage eye -lrb- illustration : -rrb- they have just be eat they supper of deer 's flesh roasted on the coal and after a time one of the savage as a experiment take up a bone of meat and offer it to he be very hungry he gladly take it and begin gnawing the meat off the bone when he have satisfy he hunger he begin to look round he still stare at by the other then one of the woman who have a good-humoured face catch he up and seat he on she knee try to talk to he melu-melumia quiltahou papa shanus cha silma she speak gaze very earnestly into he face they have all be talk among themselves while he be eat but he do not know that savage have a language of they own different from ours and so think that they have only be amusing themselves with a kind of nonsense talk which mean nothing now when the woman address this funny kind of talk to he he answer she in she own way as he imagine readily enough : hey diddle-diddle the cat 's in the fiddle fe fo fus fum chumpty-chumpty-chum with bing on she ringer and tell on she bo they all listen with grave attention as if he have say something very important then the woman continue : huanatopa ana ana quiltahou to which martin answer theophilus thistle the thistle-sifter sift a sieve of unsifted thistle and if theophilus -- oh i will not say any more then she say quira-holata silhoa marus changa changa cock-a-doodle-do cry martin get tired and impatient baa baa black sheep bow wow wow goosey goosey gander see-saw mary daw chick-a-dee-dee will you listen to I and now let I go but she hold he fast and keep on talk she nonsense language to he until become vex he catch hold of she hair and pull it she only laugh and toss he up into the air and catch he again just as he might have toss and catch a small kitten at length she release he for now they be all begin to lie down by the fire to sleep as it be get dark martin be very tired settle himself down among they and as one of the woman throw a skin over he he sleep very comfortably next morning the hill look nearer than ever just across the river but little he care for hill now and when the little savage child go out to hunt for berry and sweet root he follow and spend the day agreeably enough in they company on the afternoon of the second day he new playfellow all throw off they little skin cloak and plunge into the stream to bathe and martin see how much they seem to enjoy be in the water undressed himself and go in after they the water be not too deep in that place and as it be rare fun splash about and try to keep he leg in the swift current and clamber over slippery rock he go out some distance from the bank all at once he discover that the other have leave he and look back he see that they be all scramble out on to the bank and fight over he clothes back he dash in haste to rescue he property but by the time he reach the spot they have finish divide the spoil and jump up they run away and scatter in all direction one wear he jacket another he knickerbockers another he shirt and one sock another he cap and shoe and the last the one remain sock only in vain he pursue and call after they and at last he be compel to follow they unclothed to the camping ground where he present himself cry piteously but the woman who have be so kind to he would not help he now and only laugh to see how white he skin look by contrast with the dark copper-coloured skin of the other child at length one of they compassionately give he a small soft-furred skin of some wild animal and fasten it on he like a cloak and this he be compel to wear with shame and grief feeling very strange and uncomfortable in it but the feeling of discomfort in that new savage dress be nothing to the sense of injury that sting he and in he secret heart he be determine not to lose he own clothes when the child go out next day he follow they watch and wait for a chance to recover anything that belong to he and at last see the little boy who wear he cap off he guard he make a sudden rush and snatch it off the young savage 's head put it firmly upon he own but the little savage now regard that cap as he very own : he have take it by force or stratagem and have wear it on he head since the day before and that make it he property and so at martin he go and they fight stoutly together and be nearly of a size he could not conquer the little white boy then he cry out to the other to help he and they come and overthrow martin and deprive he not only of he cap but of he little skin cloak as well and then punish he until he scream aloud with pain leave he cry on the ground they run back to the camp he follow shortly afterwards but get no sympathy for as a rule grown-up savage do not trouble themselves very much about these little matter : they leave they child to settle they own dispute during the rest of that day martin sulk by himself behind a great tussock of grass refuse to eat with the other and when one of the woman go to he and offer he a piece of meat he strike it vindictively out of she hand she only laugh a little and leave he now when the sun be set and he be begin to feel very cold and miserable in he nakedness the man be see return from the hunt but instead of ride slowly to the camp as on other day they come ride furiously and shout the moment they be see and they shout hear the woman jump up and begin hastily pack the skin and all they belongings into bundle and in less than ten minute the whole company be mount on horseback and ready for flight one of the man pick martin up and place he on the horse 's back before he and then they all start at a swift canter up the valley towards that great blue forest in the distance in about a hour they come to it : it be then quite dark the sky powdered with numberless star but when they get among the tree the blue dusky sky and brilliant star disappear from sight as if a black cloud have come over they so dark be it in the forest for the tree be very tall and mingle they branch overhead but they have get into a narrow path know to they and move slowly in single file they keep on for about two hour longer then stop and dismount under the great tree and lie down all close together go to sleep martin lie among they creep under the edge of one of the large skin robe and feeling warm he soon fall fast asleep and do not wake till daylight -lrb- illustration : -rrb- chapter vii alone in the great forest imagine to yourself one accustom to live in the great treeless plain accustomed to open he eye each morning to the wide blue sky and the brilliant sunlight now for the first time open they in that vast gloomy forest where neither wind nor sunlight come and no sound be hear and twilight last all day long all round he be tree with straight tall gray trunk and behind and beyond they yet other tree -- tree everywhere that stand motionless like pillar of stone support the dim green roof of foliage far above it be like a vast gloomy prison in which he have be shut and he long to make he escape to where he could see the rise sun and feel the fanning wind on he cheek he look round at the other : they be all stretch on the ground still in a deep sleep and it frighten he a little to look at they great broad dark face frame in mass of black hair he feel that he hate they for they have treat he badly : the child have take he clothes compelling he to go naked and have beat and bruise he and he have not be pity and help by they elder by and by very quietly and cautiously he creep away from among they and make he escape into the gloomy wood on one side the forest shadow look less dark than the other and on that side he go for it be the side on which the sun rise and the direction he have be travel when he first meet with the savage on and on he go over the thick bed of dark decay leaf which make no rustling sound look like a little white ghost of a boy in that great gloomy wood but he come to no open place nor do he find anything to eat when hunger press he for there be no sweet root and berry there nor any plant that he have ever see before it be all strange and gloomy and very silent not a leaf tremble for if one have tremble near he he would have hear it whisper in that profound stillness that make he hold he breath to listen but sometimes at long interval the silence would be break by a sound that make he start and stand still and wonder what have cause it for the rare sound in the forest be unlike any sound he have hear before three or four time during the day a burst of loud hollow confused laughter sound high up among the tree but he see nothing although most likely the creature that have laugh see he plainly enough from its hiding-place in the deep shadow as it run up the trunk of the tree -lrb- illustration : -rrb- at length he come to a river about thirty or forty yard wide and this be the same river that he have bath in many league further down in the open valley it be call by the savage co-viota-co-chamanga which mean that it run partly in the dark and partly in the light here it be in the dark the tree grow thick and tall on its bank and they wide branch meet and intermingle above its water that flow on without a ripple black to the eye as a river of ink how strange it seem when hold on to a twig he bent over and see himself reflect -- a white naked child with a scared face -- in that black mirror overcome by thirst he venture to creep down and dip he hand in the stream and be astonish to see that the black water look as clear as crystal in he hollow hand after quench he thirst he go on follow the river now for it have make he turn aside but after walk for a hour or more he come to a great tree that have fall across the stream and climb on to the slippery trunk he creep cautiously over and then go gladly on in the old direction now after he have cross the river and walk a long distance he come to a more open part but though it be nice to feel the sunshine on he again the underwood and grass and creeper trail over the ground make it difficult and tiring to walk and in this place a curious thing happen pick he way through the tangled herbage a animal he footstep have startle scuttle away in great fear and as it go he catch a glimpse of it it be a kind of weasel but very large -- larger than a big tom-cat and all over as black as the blackest cat look down he discover that this strange animal have be feast on egg the egg be nearly as large as fowl ' of a deep green color with polished shell there have be about a dozen in the nest which be only a small hollow in the ground line with dry grass but most of they have be break and the contents devour by the weasel only two remain entire and these he take and tempt by he hunger soon break the shell at the small end and suck they clean they be raw but never have egg boil fry or poach taste so nice before he have just finish he meal and be wish that a third egg have remain in the ruin nest when a slight sound like the buzz of a insect make he look round and there within a few foot of he be the big black weasel once more look strangely bold and savage-tempered it keep stare fixedly at martin out of its small wicked beady black eye and snarl so as to show its white sharp tooth and very white they look by contrast with the black lip and nose and hair martin stare back at it but it keep move and come nearer now sit straight up then drop its fore-foot and gather its leg in a bunch as if about to spring and finally stretch itself straight out towards he again its round flat head and long smooth body make it look like a great black snake crawl towards he and all the time it keep on snarl and click its sharp tooth and utter its low buzz growl martin grow more and more afraid it look so strong and angry so unspeakably fierce the creature look as if he be speak to martin say something very easy to understand and very dreadful to hear this be what it seem to be say : -- ha you come on I unawares and startle I away from the nest i find you have eat the last two egg and i find they and they be mine must i go hungry for you -- starvele robber a miserable little boy alone and lose in the forest naked all scratch and bleed with thorn with no courage in he heart no strength in he hand look at I i be not weak but strong and black and fierce i live here -- this be my home i fear nothing i be like a serpent and like brass and temper steel -- nothing can bruise or break I : my tooth be like fine dagger when i strike they into the flesh of any creature i never loose my hold till i have suck out all the blood in he heart but you weak little wretch i hate you i thirst for you blood for steal my food from I what can you do to save yourself down down on the ground chicken-heart where i can get hold of you you shall pay I for the egg with you life i shall hold you fast by the throat and drink and drink until i see you glassy eye close and you cheek turn whiter than ash and i feel you heart flutter like a leaf in you bosom down down it be terrible to watch he and seem to hear such word he be nearer now -- scarcely a yard away still with he beady glaring eye fix on martin 's face : and martin be powerless to fly from he -- powerless even to stir a step or to lift a hand he heart jump so that it choke he he hair stand up on he head and he tremble so that he be ready to fall and at last when about to fall to the ground in the extremity of he terror he utter a great scream of despair and the sudden scream so startle the weasel that he jump up and scuttle away as fast as he could through the creeper and bush make a great rustling over the dead leaf and twig and martin recover he strength listen to that retreat sound as it pass away into the deep shadow until it cease altogether chapter viii the flower and the serpent he escape from the horrible black animal make martin quite happy in spite of hunger and fatigue and he push on as bravely as ever but it be slow go and very difficult even painful in place on account of the rough thorny undergrowth where he have to push and crawl through the close bush and tread on ground litter with old dead prickly leaf and dead thorny twig after go on for about a hour in this way he come to a stream a branch of the river he have leave and much shallower so that he could easily cross from side to side and he could also see the bright pebble under the clear swift current the stream appear to run from the east the way he wish to travel towards the hill so that he could keep by it which he wra glad enough to do as it be nice to get a drink of water whenever he feel thirsty and to refresh he tired and sore little foot in the stream follow this water he come before very long to a place in the forest where there be little or no underwood but only low tree and bush scatter about and all the ground moist and very green and fresh like a water-meadow it be indeed pleasant to feel he foot on the soft carpet of grass and stoop he put he hand down on it and finally lie down he roll on it so as to have the nice sensation of the warm soft grass all over he body so agreeable be it lie and roll about in that open green place with the sweet sunshine on he that he feel no inclination to get up and travel on it be so sweet to rest after all he striving and suffering in that great dark forest so sweet be it that he pretty soon fall asleep and no doubt sleep a long time for when he wake the sun which have be over he head be now far down in the west it be very still and the air warm and fragrant at that hour with the sun shine through the higher branch of the tree on the green turf where he be lie how green it be -- the grass the tree every tiny blade and every leaf be like a piece of emerald green glass with the sun shine through it so wonderful do it seem to he -- the intense greenness the brilliant sunbeam that shine into he eye and seem to fill he with brightness and the stillness of the forest that he sit up and stare about he what do it mean -- that brightness and stillness then at a little distance away he catch sight of something on a tree of a shine golden yellow color jump up he run to the tree and find that it be half overgrown with a very beautiful climbing plant with leaf divide like the finger of a hand and large flower and fruit both green and ripe the ripe fruit be as big as a duck 's egg and the same shape and of a shine yellow color reach up he hand he begin to feel the smooth lovely fruit when be very ripe it come off its stem into he hand it smell very nice and then in he hunger he bite through the smooth rind with he tooth and it taste as nice as it look he quickly eat it and then pull another and eat that and then another and still other until he could eat no more he have not have so delicious a meal for many a long day not until he have eat he fill do martin begin to look closely at the flower on the plant it be the passion-flower and he have never see it before and now that he look well at it he think it the loveliest and strangest flower he have ever behold not brilliant and shine jewel-like in the sun like the scarlet verbena of the plain or some yellow flower but pale and misty the petal be of a dim greenish cream-colour with a large blue circle in the center and the blue too be misty like the blue haze in the distance on a summer day to see and admire it better he reach out he hand and try to pluck one of the flower then in a instant he drop he hand as if he have be prick by a thorn but there be no thorn and nothing to hurt he he drop he hand only because he feel that he have hurt the flower move a step back he stare at it and the flower seem like a thing alive that look back at he and ask he why he have hurt it o poor flower say martin and come closer he touch it gently with he finger-tip and then stand on tiptoe he touch its petal with he lip just as he mother have often and often kiss he little hand when he have bruise it or prick it with a thorn then while still stand by the plant on bring he eye down to the ground he spy a great snake lie coil up on a bed of moss on the sunny side of the same tree where the plant be grow he remember the dear little snake he have once make a friend of and he do not feel afraid for he think that all snake must be friendly towards he although this be a very big one thicker than he arm and of a different color it be a pale olive-green like the half-dry moss it be lie on with a pattern of black and brown mottle along its back it be lie coiled round and round with its flat arrow-shaped head rest on its coil and its round bright eye fix on martin 's face the sun shine on its eye make they glint like polished jewel or piece of glass and when martin move nearer and stand still or when he draw back and go to this side or that those brilliant glint eye be still on he face and it begin to trouble he until at last he cover he face with he hand then he open he finger enough to peep through they and still those glitter eye be fix on he -lrb- illustration : -rrb- martin wonder if the snake be vex with he for come there and why it watch he so steadily with those shine eye will you please look some other way he say at last but the snake would not and so he turn from it and then it seem to he that everything be alive and watch he in the same intent way -- the passion-flower the green leave the grass the tree the wide sky the great shine sun he listen and there be no sound in the wood not even the hum of a fly or wild bee and it be so still that not a leaf move finally he move away from that spot but tread very softly and hold he breath to listen for it seem to he that the forest have something to tell he and that if he listen he would hear the leaf speak to he and by-and-by he do hear a sound : it come from a spot about a hundred yard away and be like the sound of a person cry then come low sob which rise and fall and then cease and after a silent interval begin again perhaps it be a child lose there in the forest like himself go softly to the spot he discover that the sob sound come from the other side of a low tree with widespread branch a kind of acacia with thin loose foliage but he could not see through it and so he go round the tree to look and startle a dive which fly off with a loud clatter of its wing when the dive have fly away it be again very silent what be he to do he be too tired now to walk much farther and the sun be get low so that all the ground be in shadow he go on a little way look for some nice shelter where he could pass the night but could not find one at length when the sun have set and the dark be come he come upon a old half-dead tree where there be a hollow at the root line with half dry moss very soft to he foot and it seem a nice place to sleep in but he have no choice for he be afraid of go further in the dark among the tree and so creep into the hollow among the old root he curl himself up as comfortably as he could and soon begin to get very drowsy in spite of have no cover to keep he warm but although very tired and sleepy he do not go quite to sleep for he have never be all alone in a wood by night before and it be different from the open plain where he could see all round even at night and where he have fear nothing here the tree look strange and make strange black shadow and he think that the strange people of the wood be perhaps now roam about and would find he there he do not want they to find he fast asleep it be better to be awake so that when they come he could jump up and run away and hide himself from they once or twice a slight rustling sound make he start and think that at last some one be come to he steal softly so as to catch he unawares but he could see nothing move and when he hold he breath to listen there be no sound -lrb- illustration : -rrb- then all at once just when he have almost drop off a great cry sound at a distance and make he start up wide awake again o look look look cry the voice in a tone so deep and strange and powerful that no one could have hear it without terror for it seem to be utter by some forest monster twenty time bigger than a ordinary man in a moment a answer come from another part of the wood what be that cry the answering voice and then another voice cry and then other far and near all shout what be that and for only answer the first voice shout once more o look look look poor martin tremble with fright crouch lower down in he mossy bed think that the awful people of the forest must have see he and would be upon he in a few moment but though he stare with wide-open eye into the gloom he could see nothing but the tree stand silent and motionless and no sound of approach footstep could he hear after that it be silent again for a while and he begin to hope that they have give up look for he when suddenly close by sound a loud startling who be that and he give himself up for lose for he be too terrify to jump up and run away as he have think to do : he could only lie still he tooth chatter he hair stand up on he head who be that exclaim the terrible voice once more and then he see a big black shape drop down from the tree above and settle on a dead branch a few foot above he hiding-place it be a bird -- a great owl for now he could see it sharply outline against the clear starry sky and the bird have see and be peer curiously at he and now all he fear be go for he could not be afraid of a owl he have be accustom to see owl all he life only they be small and this owl of the forest be as big as a eagle and have a round head and ear like a cat and great cat-like eye that shine in the dark the owl keep stare at martin for some time sway he body this way and that and lower then raise he head so as to get a better view and martin on he side stare back at the owl and at last he exclaim o what a great big owl you be please say _ who be that _ again but before the owl say anything martin be fast asleep in he mossy bed chapter ix the black people of the sky whether or not the great owl go on shout _ o look look look _ and ask _ what be that _ and _ who be that _ all night martin do not know he be fast asleep until the morning sun shone on he face and wake he and as he have no clothes and shoe to put on he be soon up and out first he take a drink of water then feel very hungry he go back to the place where he have find the ripe fruit and make a very good breakfast after that he set out once more through the wood towards sunrise still follow the stream before long the wood become still more open and at last to he great joy he find that he have get clear of it and be once more on the great open plain and now the hill be once more in sight -- those great blue hill where he wish to be look nearer and larger than before but they still look blue like great bank of cloud and be a long distance away but he be determine to get to they to climb up they steep side and by and by when he find the stream bent away to the south he leave it so as to go on straight as he could to the hill away from the water-side the ground be higher and very flat and cover with dry yellow grass over this yellow plain he walk for hour rest at time but find no water and no sweet root to quench he thirst until he be too tired to walk any further and so he sit down on the dry grass under that wide blue sky there be not a cloud on it -- nothing but the great globe of the sun above he and there be no wind and no motion in the yellow grass blade and no sight or sound of any live creature martin lie on he back gaze up at the blue sky keep he eye from the sun which be too bright for they and after a time he do see something move -- a small black spot no bigger than a fly move in a circle but he know it be something big but at so great a height from the earth as to look like a fly and then he catch sight of a second black speck then another and another until he could make out a dozen or twenty or more all move in wide circle at that vast height martin think they must be the black people of the sky he wonder why they be black and not white like white bird or blue and of other brilliant color like the people of the mirage now it be impossible for martin to lie like that follow those small black spot on the hot blue sky as they wheel round and round continuously without give he eye a little rest by shut they at interval by-and-by he keep they shut a little too long he fall asleep and when he wake he do not wake fully in a moment he remain lie motionless just as before with eye still close but the lid just raise enough to enable he to see about he and the sight that meet he eye be very curious he be no longer alone in that solitary place there be people all round he dozen and score of little black man about two foot in height of a very singular appearance they have bald head and thin hatchet face wrinkled and warty and long nose and they all wear black silk clothes -- coat waistcoat and knickerbockers but without shoe and stocking they thin black leg and foot be bare nor do they have anything on they bald head they be gather round martin in a circle but a very wide circle quite twenty to thirty foot away from he and some be walk about other stand alone or in group talk together and all look at martin only one who appear to be the most important person of the company keep inside the circle and whenever one or more of the other come forward a few step he hold up he hand and beg they to go back a little we must not be in a hurry he say we must wait wait for what ask one for what may happen say the important one i must ask you again to leave it to I to decide when it be time to begin then he strut up and down in the open space turn now towards he fellow and again to martin move he head about to get a better sight of he face then put he hand down between he coat and waistcoat he draw out a knife with a long shine blade and hold it from he look attentively at it by and by he breathe gently on the bright blade then pull out a black silk pocket handkerchief wipe off the stain of he breath and turn the blade about make it glitter in the sun then he put it back under he coat and resume he walk up and down we be get very hungry say one of the other at length very hungry indeed cry another some of we have not taste food these three day it certainly do seem hard say yet another to see we dinner before we and not be allow to touch it not so fast my friend i beg exclaim the man with the knife i have already explain the case and i do think you be a little unfair in press I as you do thus rebuke they consult together then one of they speak if sir you consider we unfair or that we have not full confidence in you would it not be as well to get some other person to take you place yes i be ready to do that return the important one promptly and here draw forth the knife once more he hold it out towards they but instead of come forward to take it they all recoil some step show considerable alarm and then they all begin protest that they be not complain of he that they be satisfy with they choice and could not have put the matter in abler hand i be pleased at you good opinion say the important one i may tell you that i be no chicken i first see the light in September 1739 and as you know we be now within seven month and thirteen day of the end of the first decade of the second half of the nineteenth century you may infer from this that i have have a pretty extensive experience and i promise you that when i come to cut the body up you will not be able to say that i have make a unfair distribution or that any one have be leave without he portion -lrb- illustration : -rrb- all murmur approval and then one of the company ask if he would be allow to bespeak the liver for he share no sir certainly not reply the other such matter must be leave to my discretion entirely and i must also remind you that there be such a thing as the _ carver 's privilege _ and it be possible that in this instance he may think fit to retain the liver for he own consumption after thus assert himself he begin to examine the blade of he knife which he still hold in he hand and to breathe gently on it and wipe it with he handkerchief to make it shine brighter in the sun finally raise he arm he flourish it and then make two or three stab and lunge in the air then walk on tiptoe he adyance to martin lie so still on the yellow grass in the midst of that black-robed company the hot sun shine on he naked white body the other all immediately press forward crane they neck and look highly excite : they be expect great thing but when the man with a knife have get quite close to martin he be seize with fear and make two or three long jump back to where the other be and then recover from he alarm he quietly put back the knife under he coat we really think you be go to begin say one of the crowd oh no no indeed not just yet say the other it be very disappointing remark one the man with the knife turn on he and reply with dignity i be really surprise at such a remark after all i have say on the subject i do wish you would consider the circumstance of the case they be peculiar for this person -- this martin -- be not a ordinary person we have be keep we eye on he for some time past and have witness some remarkable action on he part to put it mildly let we keep in mind the boldness the resource the dangerous violence he have display on so many occasion since he take to he present vagabond way of life it appear to I say one of the other that if martin be dead we need not concern ourselves about he character and desperate deed in the past _ if _ he be dead exclaim the other sharply that be the very point -- _ be _ he dead can you confidently say that he be not in a sound sleep or in a dead faint or shamming and ready at the first touch of the knife to leap up and seize he assailant -- i mean he carver -- by the throat and perhaps murder he as he once murder a spoonbill that would be very dreadful say one but surely say another there be means of tell whether a person be dead or not one simple and effectual method which i have hear be to place a hand over the heart to feel if it still beat yes i know i have also hear of that plan very simple as you say but who be to try it i invite the person who make the suggestion to put it in practice with pleasure say the other come forward with a tripping gait and a air of not be in the least afraid but on come near the suppose corpse he pause to look round at the other then pull out he black silk handkerchief he wipe he black wrinkled forehead and bald head whew he exclaim it be very hot to-day i do not find it so say the man with the knife it be sometimes a matter of nerve it be not a very nice remark but it have the effect of brace the other up and move forward a little more he begin anxiously scrutinize martin 's face the other now begin to press forward but be warn by the man with a knife not to come too near then the bold person who have undertake to feel martin 's heart double back the silk sleeve of he coat and after some further preparation extend he arm and make two or three preliminary pass with he tremble hand at a distance of a foot or so from the breast of the corpse then he approach it a little nearer but before it come to the touching point a sudden fear make he start back what be it what do you see cry the other i be not sure there be not a twitch of the eyelid he reply never mind the eyelid -- feel he heart say one that be all very well he return but how would you like it yourself will _ you _ come and do it no no they all cry you have undertake this and must go through with it thus encourage he once more turn to the corpse and again anxiously begin to examine the face now martin have be watch they through the slit of he not quite closed eye all the time and listen to they talk be hungry himself he could not help feeling for they and not think that it would hurt he to be cut up in piece and devour he have begin to wish that they would really begin on he he be both amuse and annoy at they nervousness and at last opening wide he eye very suddenly he cry feel my heart it be as if a gun have be fire among they for a moment they be strike still with terror and then all together turn and flee go away with three very long hop and then open wide they great wing they launch themselves on the air for they be not little black man in black silk clothes as it have seem but vulture -- those great high-soaring black-plumaged bird which he have watch circle in the sky look no bigger than bee or fly at that vast distance above the earth and when he be watch they they be watch he and after he have fall asleep they continue move round and round in the sky for hour and see he lie so still on the plain they at last imagine that he be dead and one by one they close or half-close they wing and drop glide downward grow larger in appearance as they near the ground until the small black spot no bigger than fly be see to be great black bird as big as turkey but you see martin be not dead after all and so they have to go away without they dinner chapter x a troop of wild horse it seem so lonely to martin when the vulture have go up out of sight in the sky so silent and solitary on that immense level plain that he could not help wish they back for the sake of company they be a amusing people when they be walk round he converse together and try without come too near to discover whether he be dead or only sleep all that day it be just as lonely for though he go on as far as he could before night he be still on that great level plain of dry yellow grass which appear to have no end and the blue hill look no nearer than when he have start in the morning he be hungry and thirsty that evening and very cold too when he nestle down on the ground with nothing to cover he but the little heap of dry grass he have gather for he bed it be better next day for after walk two or three hour he come to the end of that yellow plain to higher ground where the earth be sandy and barren with a few scattered bush grow on it -- dark prickly bush like butcher 's broom when he get to the highest part of this barren ground he see a green valley beyond stretch away as far as he could see on either hand but it be nice to see a green place again and go down into the valley he manage to find some sweet root to stay he hunger and thirst then after a rest he go on again and when he get to the top of the high ground beyond the valley he see another valley before he just like the one he have leave behind again he rest in that green place and then slowly go up the high land beyond where it be barren and sandy with the dark stiff prickly bush grow here and there and when he get to the top he look down and behold there be yet another green valley stretch away to the right and leave as far as he could see would they never end -- these high barren ridge and the long green valley between when he toil slowly up out of this last green resting-place it be grow late in the day and he be very tired then he come to the top of another ridge like the other only higher and more barren and when he could see the country beyond lo another valley greener and broader than those he have leave behind and a river flow in it look like a band of silver lie along the green earth -- a river too broad for he to cross stretch away north and south as far as he could see how then should he ever be able to get to the hill still far far away beyond that water martin stare at the scene before he for some time then feel very tired and weak he sit down on the sandy ground beside a scanty dark bush tear come to he eye : he feel they run down he cheek and all at once he remember how long before when he wander begin he have drop a tear and a small dusty beetle have refresh himself by drink it he bent down and let a tear drop and watch it as it sink into the ground but no small beetle come out to drink it and he feel more lonely and miserable than ever he begin to think of all the queer creature and people he have meet in the desert and to wish for they some of they have not be very kind to he but he do not remember that now it be so sad to be quite alone in the world without even a small beetle to visit he he remember the beautiful people of the mirage and the black people of the sky and the ostrich and old jacob and the savage and the serpent and the black weasel in the forest he stand up and stare all round to see if anything be come but he could see nothing and hear nothing by-and-by in that deep silence there be a sound it seem to come from a great distance it be so faint then it grow louder and nearer and far away he see a little cloud of dust and then even through the dust dark form come swiftly towards he the sound he hear be like a long halloo a cry like the cry of a man but wild and shrill like a bird 's cry and whenever that cry be utter it be follow by a strange confused noise as of the neighing of many horse they be in truth horse that be come swiftly towards he -- a herd of sixty or seventy wild horse he could see and hear they only too plainly now look very terrible in they strength and speed and the flow black mane that cover they like a black cloud as they come thunder on intend perhaps to sweep over he and trample he to death with they iron-hard hoof all at once when they be within fifty yard of martin the long shrill wild cry go up again and the horse swerve to one side and go sweeping round he in a wide circle then as they gallop by he catch sight of the strangest-looking be he have ever see a man on the back of one of the horse naked and hairy he look like a baboon as he crouch double up grip the shoulder and neck of the horse with he knee cling with he hand to the mane and crane he neck like a fly bird it be this strange rider who have utter the long pierce man-and-bird-like cry and now change he voice to a whinnying sound the horse come to a stop and gathering together in a crowd they stand toss they mane and stare at martin with they wild startled eye in another moment the wild rider come bound out from among they and move now erect now on all fours come sidele up to martin fling he arm and leg about wag he head grimace and utter whinnying and other curious noise never have martin look upon so strange a man he be long and lean so that you could have count he rib and he be stark naked except for the hair of he head and face which half cover he he skin be of a yellowish brown color and the hair the color of old dead grass and it be coarse and tangled fall over he shoulder and back and cover he forehead like a thatch he big brown nose stand out beneath it like a beak the face be cover with the beard which be tangle too and grow down to he waist after stare at martin for some time with he big yellow goat-like eye he prance up to he and begin to sniff round he then touch he with he nose on he face arm and shoulder -lrb- illustration : -rrb- who be you say martin in astonishment for only answer the other squeal and whinny grimace and kick he leg up at the same time then the horse advance to they and gather round in a close crowd begin touch martin with they nose he like it -- the softness of they sensitive skin which be like velvet and put up he hand he begin to stroke they nose then one by one after smell he and be touch by he hand they turn away and go down into the valley be soon scatter about most of they grazing some rolling other lie stretch out on the grass as if to sleep while the young foal in the troop leave they dam begin play about and challenge one another to run a race martin follow and watch they almost wish that he too could go on four leg to join they in they game he trust those wild horse but he be still puzzle by that strange man who have also leave he now and be go quietly round on all fours smell at the grass by-and-by he find something to he liking in a small patch of tender green clover which he begin nose and tear it up with he tooth then turn he head round he stare back at martin he jaw work vigorously all the time the stem and leave of the clover he be eat stick out from he mouth and hang about he beard all at once he jump up and fly back at martin snatch he up from the ground carry he to the clover patch and set he upon it face down on all fours then when martin sit up he grasp he by the head and force it down until he nose be on the grass so as to make he smell it and know that it be good but smell it he would not and finally the other seize he roughly again and open he mouth force a bunch of grass into it -lrb- illustration : -rrb- it be grass and i sha 'n' t eat it scream martin cry with anger at be so treated and spew the green stuff out of he mouth then the man release he and withdraw a space of two or three yard sit down on he haunch and plant he bony elbow on he knee thrust he great brown finger in he tangled hair and stare at martin with he big yellow goat 's eye for a long time suddenly a wild excited look come into he eye and leap up with a shrill cry which cause all the horse to look round at he he once more snatched martin up and hold he firmly grip to he ribby side by he arm bound off to where a mare be stand give suck to she young foal with a vigorous kick he send the foal away and force martin to take he place and to make it easier for he press the teat into he mouth martin be not accustom to feed in that way and he not only refuse to suck but continue to cry with indignation at such treatment and to struggle with all he little might to free himself he strive be all in vain and by-and-by the man see that he would not suck have a fresh idea and gripping martin more firmly than ever with one hand force and hold he mouth open and with the other draw a stream of milk into it after choke and splutter and cry more than ever for a while martin begin to grow quiet and to swallow the milk with some satisfaction for he be very hungry and thirsty and it taste very good by-and-by when no more milk could be draw from the teat he be take to a second mare from which the foal be kick away with as little ceremony as the first one and then he have as much more milk as he want and begin to like be feed in this amusing way of what happen after that martin do not know much except that the man seem very happy after feed he he set martin on the back of a horse then jump and dance round he make funny chuckle noise after which he roll horse-like on the grass he arm and leg up in the air and finally pull martin down he make he roll too but the little fellow be too tired to keep he eye any longer open and when he next open they it be morning and he find himself lie wedge in between a mare and she young foal lie side by side close together there too be the wild man coil up like a sleep dog he head pillow on the foal 's neck and the hair of he great shaggy beard throw like a blanket over martin he very soon grow accustomed to the new strange manner of life and even like it those big noble-looking wild horse with they shine coat brown and bay and black and sorrel and chestnut and they black mane and tail that sweep the grass when they move be so friendly to he that he could not help love they as he go about among they when they graze every horse he approach would raise he head and touch he face and arm with he nose o you dear horse martin would exclaim rub the warm velvet-soft sensitive nose with he hand he soon discover that they be just as fond of play as he be and that he too be to take part in they game have feed as long as they want that morning they all at once begin to gather together come at a gallop neighing shrilly then the wild man catch martin up leap upon the back of one of the horse and away go the whole troop at a furious pace to the great open dry plain where martin have meet with they on the previous day now it be very terrifying for he at first to be in the midst of that fly crowd as the animal go tear over the plain which seem to shake beneath they thundering hoof while they human leader cheer they on with he shrill repeat cry but in a little while he too catch the excitement and lose all he fear be as wildly happy as the other cry out at the top of he voice in imitation of the wild man after a hour 's run they return to the valley and then martin without be compel to do so rolled about on the grass and go after the young foal when they come out to challenge one another to a game he try to do as they do prance and throw up he heel and snort but when they run from he they soon leave he hopelessly behind meanwhile the wild man keep watch over he feed he with mare 's milk and invite he from time to time to smell and taste the tender grass best of all be when they go for another run in the evening and when martin be no longer hold with a tight grip against the man 's side but be teach or allow to hold on cling with he leg to the man 's body and clasp he round the neck with he arm he finger tightly hold on to the great shaggy beard three day pass in this way and if he time have be much longer with the wild horse he would have become one of the troop and would perhaps have eat grass too and forget he human speech or that he be a little boy bear to a very different kind of life but it be not to be and in the end he be separate from the troop by accident at the end of the third day when the sun be set and all the horse be scatter about in the valley quietly grazing something disturb they it might have be a sight or sound of some fear object or perhaps the wind have bring the smell of they enemy and hunter from a great distance to they nostril suddenly they be all in a wild commotion gallop from all side toward they leader and he pick martin up be quickly on a horse and off they go full speed but not towards the plain where they be accustom to go for they run now they flee in the opposite direction down to the river : into it they go into that wide deep dangerous current leap from the bank each horse as he fall into the water with a tremendous splash disappear from sight but in another moment the head and upper part of the neck be see to rise above the surface until the whole lot be in and appear to martin like a troop of horse ' head swim without body over the river he cling to the neck and beard of the wild man have the upper half of he body out of the cold rush water and in this way they all get safely across and up the opposite bank no sooner be they out than without even pause to shake the water from they skin they set off at full speed across the valley towards the distant hill now on this side at a distance of a mile or so from the river there be vast reed-bed stand on low land dry to a hard crust by the summer heat and right into the reed the horse rush and struggle to force they way through the reed be dead and dry so tall that they rise high above the horse ' head and grow so close together that it be hard to struggle through they then when they be in the midst of this difficult place the dry crust that cover the low ground begin to yield to the heavy hoof and the horse sink to they knee be throw down and plunge about in the most desperate way and in the midst of this confusion martin be strike and throw from he place fall amongst the reed luckily he be not trample upon but he be leave behind and then what a dreadful situation be he when the whole troop have at last succeed in fight they way through and have go away leave he in that dark solitary place he listen until the sound of heavy hoof and the long cry of the man have die away in the distance then the silence and darkness terrify he and he struggle to get out but the reed grow so close together that before he have push a dozen yard through they he sink down unable to do more the air be hot and close and still down there on the ground but by lean he head back and stare straight up he could see the pale night sky sprinkle with star in the opening between the dry leaf and spike of the reed poor martin could do nothing but gaze up at the little he could see of the sky in that close black place until he neck ache with the strain but at last to make he hope he hear a sound -- the now familiar long shrill cry of the wild man then as it come nearer the sound of tramp hoof and neighing of the horse be hear and the cry and hoof-beat grow louder and then fainter in turn and sound now on this side now on that and he know that they be look for he i be here i be here he cry oh dear horse come and take I away but they could not hear he and at last the sound of they neighing and the wild long cry die away altogether and martin be leave alone in that black silent place chapter xi the lady of the hill no escape be possible for poor little martin so long as it be dark and there he have to stay all night but morning bring he comfort for now he could see the reed-stem that hem he in all round and by use he hand to bend they from he on either side he could push through they by-and-by the sunlight touch the top of the tall plant and work he way towards the side from which the light come he soon make he escape from that prison and come into a place where he could walk without trouble and could see the earth and sky again further on in a grassy part of the valley he find some sweet root wrhich greatly refresh he and at last leave the valley he come out on a high grassy plain and see the hill before he look very much nearer than he have ever see they look before up till now they have appear like mass of dark blue bank up cloud rest on the earth now he could see that they be indeed stone -- blue stone pile up in huge cliff and crag high above the green world he could see the roughness of the heap up rock the fissure and crevice in the side of the hill and here and there the patch of green color where tree and bush have take root how wonderful it seem to martin that evening standing there in the wide green plain the level sun at he back shine on he naked body make he look like a statue of a small boy carve in whitest marble or alabaster then to make the sight he gaze on still more enchanting just as the sun go down the color of the hill change from stone blue to a purple that be like the purple of ripe plum and grape only more beautiful and bright in a few minute the purple color fade away and the hill grow shadowy and dark it be too late in the day and he be too tired to walk further he be very hungry and thirsty too and so when he have find a few small white partridge-berry and have make a poor supper on they he gather some dry grass into a little heap and lie down in it be soon in a sound sleep it be not until the late afternoon next day that martin at last get to the foot of the hill or mountain and look up he see it like a great wall of stone above he with tree and bush and trail vine grow out of the crevice and on the narrow ledge of the rock go some distance he come to a place where he could ascend and here he begin slowly walk upward at first he could hardly contain he delight where everything look new and strange and here he find some very beautiful flower but as he toil on he grow more tired and hungry at every step and then to make matter worse he leg begin to pain so that he could hardly lift they it be a curious pain which he have never feel in he sturdy little leg before in all he wanderings then a cloud come over the sun and a sharp wind spring up that make he shiver with cold : then follow a shower of rain and now martin feeling sore and miserable creep into a cavity beneath a pile of overhang rock for shelter he be out of the rain there but the wind blow in on he until it make he tooth chatter with cold he begin to think of he mother and of all the comfort of he lose home -- the bread and milk when he be hungry the warm clothing and the soft little bed with its snowy white coverlid in which he have sleep so sweetly every night o mother mother he cry but he mother be too far off to hear he piteous cry when the shower be over he creep out of he shelter again and with he little foot already bleed from the sharp rock try to climb on in one spot he find some small creep myrtle plant cover with ripe white berry and although they have a very pungent taste he eat he fill of they he be so very hungry then feel that he could climb no higher he begin to look round for a dry sheltered spot to pass the night in in a little while he come to a great smooth flat stone that look like a floor in a room and be about forty yard wide : nothing grow on it except some small tuft of gray lichen but on the further side at the foot of a steep rocky precipice there be a thick bed of tall green and yellow fern and among the fern he hope to find a place to lie down in very slowly he limp across the open space cry with the pain he feel at every step but when he reach the bed of fern he all at once see sit among the tall frond on a stone a strange-looking woman in a green dress who be gaze very steadily at he with eye full of love and compassion at she side there crouch a big yellow beast cover all over with black eye-like spot with a big round head and look just like a cat but a hundred time larger than the biggest cat he have ever see the animal rise up with a low sound like a growl and glare at martin with its wide yellow fiery eye which so terrify he that he dare not move another step until the womaan speak very gently to he tell he not to fear she caress the great beast make he lie down again then come forward and take martin by the hand she draw he up to she knee -lrb- illustration : -rrb- what be you name poor little suffering child she ask bend down to he and speak softly martin -- what be yours he return still half sobbing and rub he eye with he little fist i be call the lady of the hill and i live here alone in the mountain tell I why do you cry martin because i be so cold and -- and my leg hurt so and -- and because i want to go back to my mother she be over there say he with another sob point vaguely to the great plain beneath they foot extend far far away into the blue distance where the crimson sun be now set i will be you mother and you shall live with I here on the mountain she say caress he little cold hand with hers will you call I mother you be _ not _ my mother he return warmly i do not want to call you mother when i love you so much dear child she plead bend down until she lip be close to he avert face how that great spotted cat stare at I he suddenly say do you think it will kill I no no he only want to play with you will you not even look at I martin he still resist she but she hand feel very warm and comforting -- it be such a large warm protect hand so pleasant do it feel that after a little while he begin to move he hand up she beautiful soft white arm until it touch she hair for she hair be unbound and loose it be dark and finer than the finest spin silk and fall all over she shoulder and down she back to the stone she sit on he let he finger stray in and out among it and it feel like the soft warm down that line a little bird 's nest to he skin finally he touch she neck and allow he hand to rest there it be such a soft warm neck at length but reluctantly for he little rebellious heart be not yet wholly subdue he raise he eye to she face oh how beautiful she be she love and eager desire to win he have flush she clear olive skin with rich red color out of she sweet red lip half part come she warm breath on he cheek more fragrant than wild flower and she large dark eye be gaze down into he with such a tenderness in they that martin see it feel a strange little shudder pass through he and scarcely know whether to think it pleasant or painful dear child i love you so much she speak will you not call I mother drop he eye and with tremble lip feel a little ashamed at be conquer at last he whisper mother she raise he in she arm and press he to she bosom wrap she hair like a warm mantle round he and in less than one minute overcome by fatigue he fall fast asleep in she arm chapter xii the little people underground when he awake martin find himself lie on a soft downy bed in a dim stone chamber and feeling silky hair over he cheek and neck and arm he know that he be still with he new strange mother the beautiful lady of the mountain she see he awake take he up in she arm and hold he against she bosom carry he through a long wind stone passage and out into the bright morning sunlight there by a small spring of clearest water that gush from the rock she wash he scratch and bruise skin and rub it with sweet-smelling unguent and give he food and drink the great spotted beast sit by they all the time purr like a cat and at interval he try to entice martin to leave the woman 's lap and play with he but she would not let he out of she arm : all day she nurse and fondle he as if he have be a helpless babe instead of the sturdy little run-away and adventurer he have prove himself to be she also make he tell she the story of how he have get lose and of all the wonderful thing that have happen to he in he wanderings in the wilderness -- the people of the mirage and old jacob and the savage the great forest the serpent the owl the wild horse and wild man and the black people of the sky but it be of the mirage and the procession of lovely being about which he speak most and question she do you think it be all a dream he keep ask she the queen and all those people she be vex at the question and turn she face away refuse to answer he for though at all other time and when he speak of other thing she be gentle and loving in she manner the moment he speak of the queen of the mirage and the gift she have bestow on he she become impatient and rebuke he for say such foolish thing at length she speak and tell he that it be a dream a very very idle dream a dream that be not worth dream that he must never speak of it again never think of it but forget it just as he have forget all the other vain silly dream he have ever have and have say this much a little sharply she smile again and fondle he and promise that when he next sleep he should have a good dream one worth the dream and worth remember and talk about she hold he away from she seat he on she knee to look at he face and say for oh dear little martin you be lovely and sweet to look at and you be mine my own sweet child and so long as you live with I on the hill and love I and eall I mother you shall be happy and everything you see sleep and wake shall seem strange and beautiful it be quite true that he be sweet to look at very pretty with he rosy-white skin deepen to red on he cheek and he hair curl all over he head be of a bright golden chestnut color and he eye be a very bright blue and look keen and straight at you just like a bird 's eye that seem to be think of nothing and yet see everything after this martin be eager to go to sleep at once and have the promise dream but he very eagerness keep he wide awake all day and even after go to bed in that dim chamber in the heart of the hill it be a long time before he drop off but he do not know that he have fall asleep : it seem to he that he be very wide awake and that he hear a voice speaking in the chamber and that he start up to listen to it do you not know that there be thing just as strange underground as above it say the voice martin could not see the speaker but he answer quite boldly : no -- there be nothing underground except earth and worm and root i have see it when they have be digging oh but there be say the voice you can see for yourself all you have get to do be to find a path lead down and to follow it there be a path over there just in front of you you can see the opening from where you be lie he look and sure enough there _ be _ a opening and a dim passage run down through the solid rock up he jump fire at the prospect of see new and wonderful thing and without look any more to see who have speak to he he run over to it the passage have a smooth floor of stone and sloped downward into the earth and go round and round in a immense spiral but the circle be so wide that martin scarcely know that he be not travel in a straight line have you by chance ever see a buzzard or stork or vulture or some other great bird soar upward into the sky in wide circle each circle take it higher above the earth until it look like a mere black speck in the vast blue heaven and at length disappear altogether just in that way go round and round in just such wide circle lightly run all the time with never a pause to rest and without feeling in the least tired martin go on only down and down and further down instead of up and up like the soar bird until he be as far under the mountain as ever any buzzard or crane or eagle soar above it thus run he come at last out of the passage to a open room or space so wide that look which way he would he could see no end to it the stone roof of this place be hold up by huge stone pillar stand scatter about like group of great rough-barked tree many time bigger round than hogshead here and there in the roof or the stone overhead be immense black cavern which almost frighten he to gaze up at they they be so vast and black and no light or sun or moon come down into that deep part of the earth : the light be from big fire and they be fire of smithy burn all about he send up great flame and cloud of black smoke which rise and float upward through those big black cavern in the roof crowd of people be gather around the smithy all very busy heating metal and hammer on anvil like blacksmith never have he see so many people nor ever have he see such busy man as these rush about here and there shout and collide with one another bringing and carry huge load in basket on they back and altogether the sight of they and the racket and the smoke and dust and the blaze fire be almost too much for martin and for a moment or two he be tempt to turn and run back into the passage through which he have come but the strangeness of it all keep he there and then he begin to look more closely at the people for these be the little man that live under the earth and they be unlike anything he have see on its surface they be very stout strong-looking little man dress in coarse dark clothes cover with dust and grime and they have dark face and long hair and rough unkempt beard they have very long arm and big hand like baboon and there be not one among they who look taller than martin himself after look at they he do not feel at all afraid of they he only want very much to know who they be and what they be do and why they be so excited and noisy over they work so he thrust himself among they go to the smithy where they be in crowd and peer curiously at they then he begin to notice that he come among they create a great commotion for no sooner would he appear than all work would be instantly suspend down would go they basket and load of wood they hammer and implement of all kind and they would stare and point at he all jabber together so that the noise be as if a thousand cockatoo and parrot and paroquet be all scream at once what it be all about he could not tell as he could not make out what they say he could only see and plainly enough that he presence astonished and upset they for as he go about among they they fall back before he crowd together and all stare and point at he but at length he begin to make out what they be say they be all exclaim and talk about he look at he look at he they cry who be he what martin -- this martin never no no no yes yes yes martin himself -- martin with nothing on not a shred -- not a thread impossible -- it can not be nothing so strange have ever happen _ naked _ -- do you say that martin be naked oh dreadful -- from the crown of he head to he toe naked as he be bear no clothes -- no clothes -- oh no it can not be martin it be it be and so on and on until martin could not endure it longer for he have be naked for day and day and have cease to think about it and in fact do not know that he be naked and now hear they remark and see how they be disturb he look down at himself and see that it be indeed so -- that he have nothing on and he grow ashamed and frightened and think he would run and hide himself from they in some hole in the ground but there be no place to hide in for now they have gather all round he in a vast crowd so that whichever way he turn there before he they appear -- hundred and hundred of dark excited face hundred of grimy hand all point at he then all at once he catch sight of a old rag of a garment lie on the ground among the ash and cinder and he think he would cover himself with it and pick it hastily up be just go to put it round he when a great roar of no burst out from the crowd he be almost deafen with the sound so that he stand tremble with the old dirty rag of cloth in he hand then one of the little man come up to he and snatch the rag from he hand fling it angrily down upon the floor then as if afraid of remain so near martin he back away into the crowd again just then martin hear a very low voice close to he ear speak to he but when he look round he could see no person near he he know it be the same voice which have speak to he in the cave where he sleep and have tell he to go down into that place underground -lrb- illustration : -rrb- do not fear say the gentle voice to martin say to the little man that you have lose you clothes and ask they for something to put on then martin who have cover he face with he hand to shut out the sight of the angry crowd take courage and look at they say half sobbing o little man i have lose my clothes -- will not you give I something to put on this speech have a wonderful effect : instantly there be a mighty rush all the little man hurry away in all direction shout and tumble over each other in they haste to get away and by-and-by it look to martin as if they be have a great struggle or contest over something they be all struggle to get possession of a small closed basket and it be like a game of football with hundred of person all play all fight for possession of the ball at length one of they succeed in get hold of the basket and escape from all the other who oppose he and run to martin he throw it down at he foot and lift the lid display to he sight a bundle of the most beautiful clothes ever see by child or man with a glad cry martin pull they out but the next moment a very important-looking little man with a great white beard spring forward and snatch they out of he hand no no he shout these be not fit for martin to wear they will soil say which he fling they down on that dusty floor with its litter of cinder and dirt and begin to trample on they as if in a great passion then he snatch they up again and shake they and all could see that they be unsoiled and just as bright and beautiful as before then martin try to take they from he but the other would not let he never shall martin wear such poor clothes shout the old man they will not even keep out the wet and with that he thrust they into a great tub of water and jump in begin tread they down with he foot but when he pull they out again and shake they before they face all see that they be as dry and bright as before give they to I cry martin think that it be all right now never shall martin wear such poor clothes -- they will not resist fire cry the old man and into the flame he fling they martin now give up all hope of possess they and be ready to burst into tear at they loss when out of the fire they be pull again and it be see that the flame have not injure or tarnish they in the least once more martin put out he arm and this time he be allow to take those beautiful clothes and then just as he clasp they to he with a cry of delight he wake he head be lie on he new mother 's arm and she be awake watch he o mother what a nice dream i have o such pretty clothes -- why do i wake so soon she laugh and touch he arm show he that they be still clasp that beautiful suit of clothes to he breast -- the very clothes of he wonderful dream chapter xiii the great blue water there be not in all that land nor perhaps in all the wide world a happier little boy than martin when after wake from he sleep and dream he dress himself for the first time in that new suit and go out from the cave into the morning sunlight he then feel the comfort of such clothes for they be softer than the finest softest down or silk to he skin and keep he warm when it be cold and cool when it be hot and dry when it rain on he and the earth could not soil they nor the thorn tear they and above everything they be the most beautiful clothes ever see they color be a deep moss green or so it look at a little distance or when see in the shade but in the sunshine it sparkle as if small shine many-coloured bead have be sew in the cloth only there be no bead it be only the shine thread that make it sparkle so like clean sand in the sun when you look closely at the cloth you could see the lovely pattern weave in it -- small leaf and flower the leaf like moss leave and the flower like the pimpernel but not half so big and they be yellow and red and blue and violet in color but there be many many thing besides the lovely clothes to make he contented and happy first the beautiful woman of the hill who love and cherish he and make he call she by the sweet name of mother so many time every day that he well nigh forget she be not he real mother then there be the great stony hill-side on which he now live for a playground where he could wander all day among the rock overgrow with creeper and strange sweet-smelling flower he have never see on the plain below the bird and butterfly he see there be different from those he have always see so be the snake which he often find sleepily coil up on the rock and the little swift lizard even the water look strange and more beautiful than the water in the plain for here it gush out of the living rock sparkling like crystal in the sun and be always cold when he dip he hand in it even on the hottest day perhaps the most wonderful thing be the immense distance he could see when he look away from the hillside across the plain and see the great dark forest where he have be and the earth stretch far far away beyond then there be he playmate the great yellow-spotted cat who follow he about and be always ready for a frolic play in a very curious way whenever martin would prepare to take a run leap or a swift run down a slope the animal steal quietly up behind would put out a claw from he big soft foot -- a great white claw as big as a owl 's beak -- and pull he suddenly back at last martin would lose he temper and pick up a stick would turn on he playmate and away the animal would fly pretend to be afraid and go over bush and big stone with tremendous leap to disappear from sight on the mountain side but very soon he would steal secretly back by some other way to spring upon martin unaware and roll he over and over on the ground growl as if angry and make believe to worry he with he great white tooth although never really hurt he in the least he play with martin just as a cat play with its kitten when it pretend to punish it whenever martin begin to show the least sign of weariness the lady of the hill would call he to she then lie back among the fern she would unbind she long silky tress to let he play with they for this be always a delight to he then she would gather she hair up again and dress it with yellow flower and glossy dark green leaf to make herself look more lovely than ever at other time take he on she shoulder she would bind nimbly as a wild goat up the steepest place spring from crag to crag and dancing gaily along the narrow ledge of rock where it make he dizzy to look down then when the sun be near setting when long shadow from rock and tree begin to creep over the mountain and he have eat the fruit and honey and other wild delicacy she provide she would make he lie on she bosom play with she loose hair and listen to she singing as she rock herself on a stone he would presently fall asleep in the morning on wake he would always find himself lie still clasp to she breast in that great dim cavern and almost always when he wake he would find she cry sometimes on open he eye he would find she asleep but with trace of tear on she face show that she have be awake and cry one afternoon see he tire of play and hard to amuse she take he in she arm and carry he right up the side of the mountain where it grow so steep that even the big cat could not follow they finally she bring he out on the extreme summit and look round he seem to see the whole world spread out beneath he below half-way down there be some wild cattle feed on the mountain side and they look at that distance no bigger than mouse look eastward he behold just beyond the plain a vast expanse of blue water extend league and league away until it fade into the blue sky he shout with joy when he see it and could not take he eye from this wonderful world of water take I there -- take I there he cry she only shake she head and try to laugh he out of such a wish but by-and-by when she attempt to carry he back down the mountain he refuse to move from the spot nor would he speak to she nor look up into she plead face but keep he eye fix on that distant blue ocean which have so enchanted he for it seem to martin the most wonderful thing he have ever behold at length it begin to grow cold on the summit then with gentle caress word she make he turn and look to the opposite side of the heaven where the sun be just set behind a great mass of cloud -- dark purple and crimson rise into peak that be like hill of rose-coloured pearl and all the heaven beyond they a pale primrose-coloured flame fill with wonder at all this rich and vary color he forget the ocean for a moment and utter a exclamation of delight do you know dear martin say she what we should find there where it all look so bright and beautiful if i have wing and could fly with you cling to my bosom like a little bat cling to its mother when she fly abroad in the twilight what ask martin only dark dark cloud full of rain and cut hail and thunder and lightning that be how it be with the sea martin : it make you love it when you see it at a distance but oh it be cruel and treacherous and when it have once get you in its power then it be more terrible than the thunder and lightning in the cloud do you remember when you first come to I naked shiver with cold with you little bare foot blister and bleed from the sharp stone how i comfort you with my love and you find it warm and pleasant lie on my breast the sea will not comfort you in that way it will clasp you to a cold cold breast and kiss you with bitter salt lip and carry you down where it be always dark where you will never never see the blue sky and sunshine and flower again martin shiver and nestle closer to she and then while the shadow of evening be gather round they she sit rock herself to and fro on a stone murmur many tender sweet word to he until the music of she voice and the warmth of she bosom make he sleep chapter xiv the wonder of the hill now although martin have go very comfortably to sleep in she arm and find it sweet to be watch over so tenderly he be not the happy little boy he have be before the sight of the distant ocean and she know it and be trouble in she mind and anxious to do something to make he forget that great blue water she could do many thing and above all she could show he new and wonderful thing in the hill where she wish to keep he always with she to caress he to feed and watch over he by day and hold he in she arm when he sleep at night -- all that be less to he than the sight of something new and strange she know this well and therefore determine to satisfy he desire and make he life so full that he would always be more than contented with it in the morning he go out on the hillside wander listlessly among the rock and when the big cat find he there and try to tempt he to a game he refuse to play for he have not yet get over he disappointment and could think of nothing but the sea but the cat do not know that anything be the matter with he and be more determine to play than ever crouch now here now there among the stone and bush he would spring out upon martin and pull he down with its big paw and this so enraged he that pick up a stick he strike furiously at he tormentor but the cat be too quick for he he dodge the blow then knock the stick out of he hand and finally martin to escape from he creep into a crevice in a rock where the cat could not reach he and refuse to come out even when the lady of the hill come to look for he and beg he to come to she when at last compel by hunger he return to she he be silent and sullen and would not be caress he see no more of the cat and when next day he ask she where it be she say that it have go from they and would return no more -- that she have send it away because it have vex he this make martin sulk and he would have go away and hide himself from she have she not catch he up in she arm he struggle to free himself but could not and she then carry he away a long distance down the mountain-side until they come to a small dell green with creeper and bush with a deep carpet of dry moss on the ground and here she sit down and begin to talk to he the cat be a very beautiful beast with he spotted hide she say and you like to play with he sometimes but in a little while you will be glad that he have go from you he ask she why because though he be fond of you and like to follow you about and play with you he be very fierce and powerful and all the other beast be afraid of he so long as he be with we they would not come but now he have go they will come to you and let you go to they where be they say martin he curiosity greatly excited let we wait here she say and perhaps we shall see one by-and-by so they wait and be silent and as nothing come and nothing happen martin sit on the mossy ground begin to feel a strange drowsiness steal over he he rub he eye and look round he want to keep very wide awake and alert so as not to miss the sight of anything that might come he be vex with himself for feel drowsy and wonder why it be then listen to the low continuous hum of the bee he conclude that it be that low soft hum sound that make he sleepy he begin to look at the bee and see that they be unlike other wild bee he know that they be like humble-bee in shape but much smaller and be all of a golden brown color : they be in score and hundred come and go and have they home or nest in the rock a few foot above he head he get up and climb from he mother 's knee to she shoulder and standing on it he look into the crevice into which the bee be streaming and see they nest full of cluster of small round object that look like white berry then he come down and tell she what he have see and want to know all about it and when she answer that the little round fruit-like object he have see be cell full of purple honey that taste sweet and salt he want she to get he some not now -- not to-day she reply for now you love I and be contented to be with I and you be my own darling child when you be naughty and try to grieve I all you can and would like to go away and never see I more you shall taste the purple honey he look up into she face wonder and trouble at she word and she smile down so sweetly on he upturned face look very beautiful and tender that it almost make he cry to think how wilful and passionate he have be and climb on to she knee he put he little face against she cheek -lrb- illustration : -rrb- then while he be still caress she light tripping step be hear over the stony path and through the bush come two beautiful wild animal -- a doe with she fawn martin have often see the wild deer on the plain but always at a great distance and run now that he have they stand before he he could see just what they be like and of all the four-footed creature he have ever look on they be undoubtedly the most lovely they be of a slim shape and of a very bright reddish fawn-colour the young one with dappled side and both have large trumpet-like ear which they hold up as if listen while they gaze fixedly at martin 's face with they large dark soft eye enchant with the sight of they he slip down from he mother 's lap and stretch out he arm towards they and the doe come a little nearer timidly smell at he hand then lick it with she long pink tongue in a few minute the doe and fawn go away and they see they no more but they leave martin with a heart fill with happy excitement and they be but the first of many strange and beautiful wild animal he be now make acquaint with so that for day he could think of nothing else and wish for nothing better but one day when she have take he a good way up on the hillside martin suddenly recognize a huge rocky precipice before he as the one up which she have take he and from the top of which he have see the great blue water instantly he demand to be take up again and when she refuse he rebel against she and be first passionate and then sullen finding that he would not listen to anything she could say she sit down on a rock and leave he to himself he could not climb up that precipice and so he ramble away to some distance think to hide himself from she because he think she unreasonable and unkind not to allow he to see the blue water once more but presently he catch sight of a snake lie motionless on a bed of moss at the foot of a rock with the sun on it light up its polished scale so that they shine like gem or color glass rest he elbow on the stone and hold he face between he hand he fall to watch the snake for though it seem fast asleep in the sun its gem-like eye be wide open all at once he feel he mother 's hand on he head : martin she say would you like to know what the snake feel when it lie with eye open in the bright hot sun shall i make you feel just how he feel yes say martin eagerly forget he quarrel with she then take he up in she strong arm she walk rapidly away and bring he to that very spot where he have see the doe and fawn she sit he down and instantly he ear be fill with the murmur of the bee and in a moment she put she hand in the crevice and pull out a cluster of white cell and give they to martin break one of the cell he see that it be full of thick honey of a violet color and tasting it he find it be like very sweet honey in which a little salt have be mix he like it and he do not like it still it be not the same in all the cell in some it be scarcely salt at all and he begin to suck the honey of cell after cell try to find one that be not salt and by and by he drop the cluster of cell from he hand and stoop to pick it up forget to do so and lay he head down and stretch himself out on the mossy ground look up into he mother 's face with drowsy happy eye how sweet it seem lie there in the sun with the sun shine right into he eye and fill he whole be with its delicious heat he wish for nothing now -- not even for the sight of new wonderful thing he forget the blue water the strange beautiful wild animal and he only thought if he have a thought be that it be very nice to lie there not sleep but feel the sun in he and see it above he and see all thing -- the blue sky the gray rock and green bush and moss and the woman in she green dress and she loose black hair -- and hear too the soft low continuous murmur of the yellow bee for hour he lay there in that drowsy condition he mother keep watch over he and when it pass off and he get up again he temper appear change : he be more gentle and affectionate with he mother and obey she every wish and when in he ramble on the hill he find a snake lie in the sun he would steal softly near it and watch it steadily for a long time half wish to taste that strange purple honey again so that he might lie again in the sun feeling what the snake feel but there be more wonderful thing yet for martin to see and know in the hill so that in a little while he cease to have that desire chapter xv martin 's eye be open -lrb- illustration : -rrb- one morning when they go up into a wild rocky place very high up on the hillside a number of big bird be see come over the mountain at a great height in the air travel in a northerly direction they be big hawk almost as big as eagle with very broad round wing and instead of travel straight like other bird they move in wide circle so that they progress very slowly they sit down on a stone to watch the bird and whenever one fly lower than the other come pretty near they martin gaze delightedly at it and wish it would come still nearer so that he might see it better then the woman stand up on the stone and gaze skywards and throw up she arm she utter a long call and the bird begin to come lower and lower down still sweeping round in wide circle and by and by one come quite down and pitch on a stone a few yard from they then another come and light on another stone then another and other follow until they be all round he in score sit on the rock great brown bird with black bar on they wing and tail and buff-coloured breast with rust-red spot and stripe it be a wonderful sight those eagle-like hawk with they blue hooked beak and deep-set dark pierce eye sit in number on the rock and other and still other drop down from the sky to increase the gathering then the woman sit down by martin 's side and after a while one of the hawk spread he great wing and rise up into the air to resume he flight after a interval of a minute or so another rise then another but it be a hour before they be all go o the dear bird -- they be all go cry martin mother where be they go she tell he of a far-away land in the south from which when autumn come the bird migrate north to a warmer country hundred of league away and that bird of all kind be now travel north and would be travel through the sky above they for many day to come martin look up at the sky and say he could see no bird now that the buzzard be all go i can see they she return look up and glance about the sky o mother i wish i could see they he cry why can not i see they when you can because you eye be not like mine look can you see this and she hold up a small stone phial which she take from she bosom he take it in he hand and unstopped and smell at it be it honey can i taste it he ask she laugh it be better than honey but you can not eat it she say do you remember how the honey make you feel like a snake this would make you see what i see if i put some of it on you eye he beg she to do so and she consent pour a little into the palm of she hand it be thick and white as milk then take some on she finger tip she make he hold he eye wide open while she rub it on the eye-ball it make he eye smart and everything at first look like a blue mist when he try to see then slowly the mist fade away and the air have a new marvellous clearness and when he look away over the plain beneath they he shout for joy so far could he see and so distinct do distant object appear at one point where nothing but the gray haze that obscure the distance have be visible a herd of wild cattle now appear scatter about some grazing other lie down ruminate and in the midst of the herd a very noble-looking tawny-coloured bull be stand o mother do you see that bull cry martin in delight yes i see he she return sometimes he bring he herd to feed on the hillside and when i see he here another time i shall take you to he and put you on he back but look now at the sky martin he look up and be astonish to see number of great bird fly north where no bird have appear before they be mile high and invisible to ordinary sight but he could see they so distinctly they shape and color that all the bird he know be easily recognize there be swan shine white with black head and neck fly in wedge-shaped flock and rose-coloured spoonbill and flamingo with scarlet wing tip with black and ibis and duck of different color and many other bird both water and land appear flock after flock all fly as fast as they wing could bear they towards the north he continue watch they until it be past noon and then he see fewer and fewer only very big bird appear and then these be see less and less until there be none then he turn he eye on the plain and try to find the herd of wild cattle but they be no longer visible it be as he have see it in the morning with the pale blue haze over all the distant earth he be tell that the power to see all distant thing with a vision equal to he mother 's be now exhaust and when he grieve at the loss she comfort he with the promise that it would be renew at some other time -lrb- illustration : -rrb- now one day when they be out together martin be greatly surprised and disturbed at a change in he mother when he speak to she she be silent and byand-by draw a little away he look at she with a fear which increase to a kind of terror so strangely alter do she seem stand motionless gaze fixedly with wide-open eye at the plain beneath they she whole face white and draw with a look of rage he have a impulse to fly from she and hide himself in some hole in the rock from the sight of that pale wrathful face but when he look round he he be afraid to move from she for the hill itself seem change and now look black and angry even as she do the ground he stand on the gray old stone cover with silvery-white and yellow lichen and pretty flowery creep plant so beautiful to look at in the bright sunlight a few moment ago now be cover with a dull mist which appear to be rise from they make the air around they dark and strange and the air too have become sultry and close and the sky be grow dark above they then suddenly remember all she love and kindness he fly to she and cling to she dress sob out o mother mother what be it she put she hand on he then draw he up to she side with he foot on the stone she be stand by would you like to see what i see martin she ask and take the phial from she bosom she rub the white thick liquid on he eye-ball and in a little while when the mistiness pass off she point with she hand and tell he to look there he look and as on the former occasion all distant thing be clearly visible for although that mist and blackness give off by the hill have wrap they round so that they seem to be stand in the midst of a black cloud yet away on the plain beneath the sun be shine brightly and all that be there could be see by he where he have once see a herd of wild cattle he now see mount man to the number of about a dozen slowly ride towards the hill and though they be mile away he could see they very distinctly they be dark black-bearded man strangely dress some with fawn-coloured cloak with broad stripe other in a scarlet uniform and they wear cone-shaped scarlet cap some carry lance other carbine and they all wear sword -- he could see the steel scabbard shine in the sun as he watch they they draw rein and some of they get off they horse and they stand for some time as if talk excitedly point towards the hill and use emphatic gesture what be they talk about so excitedly think martin he want to know and he would have ask she but when he look up at she she be still gaze fixedly at they with the same pale face and terrible stern expression and he could but dimly see she face in that black cloud which have close around they he tremble with fear and could only murmur mother mother then she arm be put round he and she draw he close against she side and at that moment -- o how terrible it be -- the black cloud and the whole universe be light up with a sudden flash that seem to blind and scorch he and the hill and the world be shake and seem to be shatter by a awful thunder crash it be more than he could endure : he cease to feel or know anything and be like one dead and when he come to himself and open he eye he be lie in she lap with she face smile very tenderly bend over he o poor little martin she say what a poor weak little boy you be to lose you sens at the lightning and thunder i be angry when i see they come to the hill for they be wicked cruel man stain with blood and i make the storm to drive they away they be go and the storm be over now and it be late -- come let we go to we cave and she take he up and carry he in she arm chapter xvi the people of the mist when martin first come to the hill it be at the end of the long hot dry summer of that distant land : it be autumn now and the autumn be like a second summer only not so hot and dry as the first but sometimes at this season a wet mist come up from the sea by night and spread over all the country cover it like a cloud to a soar bird look down from the sky it must have appear like another sea of a pale or pearly gray color with the hill rise like island from it when the sun rise in the morning if the sky be clear so that it could shine then the sea-fog would drift and break up and melt away or float up in the form of thin white cloud now whenever this sea-mist be out over the world the lady of the hill without come out of she chamber know of it and she would prevent martin from leave the bed and go out he love to be out on the hill-side to watch the sun come up and she would say to he you can not see the sun because of the mist and it be cold and wet on the hill wait until the mist have go and then you shall go out but now a new idea come into she mind she have succeed in make he happy during the last few day but she wish to do more -- she wish to make he fear and hate the sea so that he would never grow discontented with he life on the hill nor wish to leave she so now one morning when the mist be out over the land she say to martin when he wake get up and go out on to the hill and see the mist and when you feel its coldness and taste its salt on you lip and see how it dim and sadden the earth you will know better than to wish for that great water it come from so martin get up and go out on the hill and it be as she have say : there be no blue sky above no wide green earth before he : the mist have blot all out he could hardly see the rock and bush a dozen yard from he the leaf and flower be heavy laden with the gray wet and it feel clammy and cold on he face and he taste its salt on he lip it seem thickest and darkest when he look down and lightest when he look up and the lightness lead he to climb up among the drip slippery rock and slip and stumble he go on and on the light increase as he go until at last to he delight he get above the mist there be a immense crag there which stand boldly up on the hillside and on to this he manage to climb and stand on it he look down upon that vast move sea of gray mist that cover the earth and see the sun a large crimson disc rise from it it be a great thing to see and make he cry out aloud for joy : and then as the sun rise higher into the pure blue sky the gray mist change to silvery white and the white change in place to shine gold : and it drift faster and faster away before the sun and begin to break up and when a cloud of mist sweep by the rock on which he stand it beat like a fine rain upon he face and cover he bright clothes with a gray beady moisture now look abroad over the earth it appear to martin that the thousand and ten and hundred of thousand of fragment of mist have the shape of man and be like a innumerable multitude of gigantic man with shine white face and shine golden hair and long cloud-like robe of a pearly gray color that trail on the earth as they move they be like a vast army cover the whole earth all with they face set towards the west all move swiftly and smoothly on towards the west and he see that every one hold he robe to he breast with he left hand and that in he right hand raise to the level of he head he carry a strange object this object be a shell -- a big sea-shell of a golden yellow color with curved pink lip and very soon one of the mist people come near he and as he pass by the rock he hold the shell to martin 's ear and it sound in he ear -- a low deep murmur as of wave break on a long shingled beach and martin know though no word be speak to he that it be the sound of the sea and tear of delight come to he eye and at the same time he heart be sick and sad with longing for the sea -lrb- illustration : -rrb- again and again until the whole vast multitude of the mist people have go by a shell be hold to he ear and when they be all go when he have watch they fade like a white cloud over the plain and float away and disappear in the blue sky he sit down on the rock and cry with the desire that be in he when he mother find he with trace of tear on he cheek and he be silent when she speak to he and have a strange look in he eye as if they be gaze at some distant object she be angrier than ever with the sea for she know that the thought of it have return to he and that it would be harder than ever to keep he one morning on wake he find she still asleep although the trace of tear on she cheek show that she have be awake and cry during the night ah now i know why she cry every morning think martin it be because i must go away and leave she here alone on the hill he be out of she arm and dress in a very few moment move very softly lest she should wake but though he know that if she awake she would not let he go he could not leave she without say goodbye and so coming near he stoop over she and very gently kiss she soft cheek and sweet mouth and murmur good-bye sweet mother then very cautiously like a shy little wild animal he steal out of the cavern once outside in the early morning light he start run as fast as he could jump from stone to stone in the rough place and scramble through the dew-laden bush and creeper until hot and panting he arrive down at the very foot of the hill then it be easier walking and he go on a little until he hear a voice cry martin martin and look back he see the lady of the hill stand on a great stone near the foot of the mountain gaze sadly after he martin oh my child come back to I she call stretch out she arm towards he oh martin i can not leave the hill to follow you and shield you from harm and save you from death where will you go oh I what shall i do without you for a little while he stand still listen with tear in he eye to she word and waver in he mind but very soon he think of the great blue water once more and could not go back but begin to run again and go on and on for a long distance before stop to rest then he look back but he could no longer see she form standing there on the stone all that day he journey on towards the ocean over a great plain there be no tree and no rock nor hill only grass on the level earth in some place so tall that the spike look like great white ostrich plume wave high above he head but it be easy walking as the grass grow in tussock or bunch and underneath the ground be bare and smooth so that he could walk easily between the bunch he wonder that he do not get to the sea but it be still far off and so the long summer day wear to a end and he be so tired that he could scarcely lift he leg to walk then as he go slowly on in the fading light where the grass be short and the evening primrose be open and fill the desert air with they sweet perfume he all at once see a little gray old man not above six inch in height standing on the ground right before he and stare fixedly at he with great round yellow eye -lrb- illustration : -rrb- you bad boy exclaim this curious little old man whereupon martin stop in he walk and stand still gaze in the greatest surprise at he you bad boy repeat the strange little man the more martin stare at he the harder he stare back at martin always with the same unbending severity in he small round gray face he begin to feel a little afraid and be almost incline to run away then he think it would be funny to run from such a very small man as this so he stare bravely back once more and cry out go away you bad boy answer the little gray man without move perhaps he be deaf just like that other old man say martin to himself and throw out he arm he shout at the top of he voice go away and away with a scream he go for it be only a little gray burrow owl after all martin laugh a little at he own foolishness in mistake that common bird he be accustom to see every day for a little old man by-and-by feeling very tired he sit down to rest and just where he sit grow a plant with long white flower like tall thin goblet in shape sit on the grass he could see right into one of the flower-tube and presently he notice a little old gray shrivel woman in it very very small for she be not longer than the nail of he little finger she wear a gray shawl that drag behind she and keep get under she foot and trip she up she be most active whisk about this way and that inside the flower and at interval she turn to stare at martin who keep get nearer and nearer to watch she until he face nearly touch the flower and whenever she look at he she wear a exceedingly severe expression on she small dried-up countenance it seem to martin that she be very angry with he for some reason then she would turn she back on he and tumble about in the tube of the flower and gather up the end of she shawl in she arm begin dust with great energy then hurry out once more she would shake the dust from she big funny shawl in he eye at last he carefully raise a hand and be just go to take hold of the queer little old dame with he forefinger and thumb when up she fly it be only a small gray twilight moth very much puzzle and confuse and perhaps a little frightened at these curious deception he lay himself down on the grass and shut he eye so as to go to sleep but no sooner have he shut he eye than he hear a soft soft little voice call martin martin he start up and listen it be only a field cricket singing in the grass but often as he lay down and close he eye the small voice call again plainly as possible and oh so sadly martin martin it make he remember he beautiful mother now perhaps cry alone in the cave on the mountain no little martin rest on she bosom and he cry to think of it and still the small voice go on call martin martin sadder than ever until unable to endure it longer he jump up and run away a good distance and at last too tired to go any further he creep into a tussock of tall grass and go to sleep chapter xvii the old man of the sea next day martin journey on in the old way jump up and take a good long run then drop into a trot then a walk and finally sit down to rest then up again and another run and so on but although feeling hungry and thirsty he be so full of the thought of the great blue water he be go to see so eager to look upon it at last after wish for it so long that he hardly give himself any time to hunt for food nor do he think of he mother of the hill alone to-day and grieving at he loss so excited be he at the prospect of what lay before he a little past noon he begin to hear a low murmuring sound that seem in the earth beneath he and all about he and in the air above he but he do not know that it be the sound of the sea at length he come to a place where the earth rise up in long ridge of yellow sand on which nothing grow but scatter tuft of stiff yellow grass as he toil over the loose sand sometimes sink ankle-deep in it the curious deep murmur sound he have hear for so long grow louder and louder until it be like the sound of a mighty wind in a wood but deeper and hoarser rise and fall and at interval break by great throb as of thunder echo and re-echo among the distant hill at length he have toil over the last ridge of sand and then all at once the world -- he world of solid earth at all event -- come to a abrupt end for no more ground on which to set a foot be before he but only the ocean -- that ocean which he have want so badly and have love at a distance more than the plain and hill and all they contain to delight he how wide how vast it be stretch away to where it melt into the low sky its immense grey-blue surface break into ten thousand thousand wave light with white crest that come in sight and vanish like lightning flash how tremendous how terrible it be in its agitation -- o the world have nothing to compare with it nothing to hold he heart after it and it be well that the earth be silent that it only gaze upon it with the sun and moon and star listen day and night for ever to the great voice of the sea only by lie flat on he chest could martin look down over the edge of the awful cliff which be one of the highest in the world and then the sight of the sea swirl and beat at the foot of that stupendous black precipice send up great cloud of spray in its fury make he shudder it be so awful to look upon but he could not stir from that spot there he stay lie flat on he chest gaze and gaze feeling neither hunger nor thirst forgetful of the beautiful woman he have call mother and of everything besides and as he gaze little by little that great tumult of the wave grow less they no longer lift themselves up wave follow wave to beat upon the cliff and make it tremble but sink lower and lower and at last draw off from the precipice leave at its foot a long narrow strip of sand and shingle expose to sight a solemn calm fall upon the waste of water only near the shore it continue to move a little rise and fall like the chest of a sleep giant while along the margin small wave continue to form and break in white foam on the shingle with a perpetual low moan sound further out it be quite calm its surface everywhere flush with change violet green and rosy tint : in a little while these lovely color fade as from a sunset cloud and it be all deep dark blue : for the sun have go and the shadow of evening be over land and sea then martin he little heart fill with a great awe and a great joy creep away a few yard from the edge of the cliff and coil himself up to sleep in a hollow in the soft warm sand on the follow morning after satisfy he hunger and thirst with some root which he have not to go very far to find he return to watch the sea once more and there he remain never remove he eye from the wonderful scene until the sun be directly over he head then when the sea be calm once more he get up and start to walk along the cliff keep close to the edge occasionally stop to lie down on he chest and peer over he go on and on for hour until the afternoon tide once more cover the strip of shingled beach and the wave rise high begin to beat with a sound like thunder against the tremendous cliff make the earth tremble under he at length he come to a spot where there be a great gap in the line of the cliff where in past time a portion of it have tumble down and the stupendous mass of rock have roll far out into the sea and now form island of black jagged rock standing high above the water here among the rock the sea boil and roar its loudest churn its water into mass of white froth here a fresh wonder meet he sight : a number of big animal unlike any creature he have ever see before be lie prone on the rock just out of the reach of the wave that beat round they at first they look like cow then he see that they have neither horn nor leg that they head be like dog 's but without ear and that they have two great flapper-shaped foot on they chest with which they walk or crawl upon the rock whenever a wave break on they cause they to move a little higher -lrb- illustration : -rrb- they be sea-lion a very big sort of seal but martin have never hear of such a creature and be anxious to look more closely at they he go into the gap and begin cautiously climb down over the broken mass of rock and clay until he get quite near the sea lie there on a flat rock he become absorb in watch these strange dog-headed legless cattle of the sea for he now have they near and they could see he and occasionally one would lift its head and gaze earnestly at he out of large dark eye that be soft and beautiful like the eye of the doe that come to he on the hill o how glad he be to know that the sea the mighty water roar so loud as if in wrath have its big beast too for he to love like the hill and plain with they cattle and deer and horse but the tide be still rise and very soon the biggest wave begin to come quite over the rock roll the big beast over and even wash they off and it anger they when the wave strike they and they roar aloud and by and by they begin to go away some disappear beneath the water other with head above the surface swimming away out into the open sea until all be go martin be sorry to lose they but the sight of the sea tumble and foam on the rock still hold he there until all the rock but one have be cover by the water and this one be a great black jagged rock close to the shore not above twenty or thirty yard from he against this mass of rock the wave continue to dash themselves with a mighty noise send up a cloud of white foam and spray at every blow the sight and sound fascinate he the sea appear to be talk whispering and murmuring and cry out aloud to he in such a manner that he actually begin try to make out what it be say then up would come a great green wave rush and moan to dash itself to piece right before he face and each time it break against the rock and rise high up it take a fantastic shape that begin to look more and more the shape of a man yes it be unmistakably like a monstrous gray old man with a vast snow-white beard and a world of disorder white hair float over and around its head at all event it be white for a moment then it look green -- a great green beard which the old man take with he two hand and twist just as a washerwoman twist a blanket or counterpane so as to wring the water out of it martin stare at this strange uncouth visitor from the sea while he in turn lean over the rock stare back into martin 's face with he immense fishy eye every time a fresh wave break over he lift up he hair and garment which be of brown seaweed and all rag and tatters it seem to annoy he somewhat but he never stir and when the wave retire he would wring the water out once more and blow a cloud of sea-spray from he beard at length hold out he mighty arm towards martin he open he great cod-fish mouth and burst into a hoarse laugh which sound like the deep laughter-like cry of the big black-backed gull still martin do not feel at all afraid of he for he look good-natured and friendly who be you shout martin at last who be i return the man-shaped monster in a hoarse sea-like voice

would not believe it i be that fond of rum sometimes down here when i remember how good it taste i open my mouth wide and take down a big gulp of sea water enough to fill a hogshead then i come up and blow it all out again just like a old grampus and have say this he open he vast cavernous mouth and roar out he hoarse ho ho ho louder than before and at the same time he rise up higher above the water and the black rock he have be lean on until he stand like a stupendous tower above martin -- a man-shaped tower of water and spray and white froth and brown seaweed then he slowly fall backwards out upon the sea and fall upon the sea cause so mighty a wave that it go high over the black rock and wash the face of the cliff sweeping martin back among the rock when the great wave retire and martin half-choked with water and half-dazed struggle on to he foot he see that it be night and a cloudy black sky be above and the black sea beneath he he have not see the light fade and have perhaps fall asleep and see and talk with that old sea monster in a dream but now he could not escape from he position down in the gap just above the roar wave there he have to stay sheltered in a cavity in the rock and lie there half sleeping and half waking he have that great voice of the sea in he ear all night chapter xviii martin play with the wave after a night spend in the roar of the sea a drench and bruise prisoner among the rock it be nice to see the dawn again no sooner be it light than martin set about try to make he escape he have be wash by that big wave into a deep cleft among the rock and mass of hard clay and shut in there he could not see the water nor anything except a patch of sky above he now he begin climb over the stone and crawl and force himself through crevice and other small opening make a little progress for he be sore from he bruise and very weak from he long fast and at interval tire and beat he would drop down cry with pain and misery but martin be by nature a very resolute little boy and after two or three minute ' rest he tear would cease and he would be up struggle on determinedly as before he be like some little wild animal when it find itself captive in a cage or box or room who try without cease to find a way out there may be no way but it will not give up try to find one and at last after so much try martin 's effort be reward : he succeed in get into the steep passage by which he have come down to the sea on the previous day and in the end get to the top of the cliff once more it be a great relief and after rest a little while he begin to feel glad and happy at the sight before he : there be the glorious sea again not as he have see it before its wide surface roughen by the wind and fleck with foam for now the water be smooth but not still it rise and fall in vast roller or long wave that be like ridge wave follow wave in a very grand and order manner and as he gaze the cloud break and float away and the sky grow clear and bright and then all at once the great red sun come up out of the water but it be impossible for he to stay there longer when there be nothing to eat he extreme hunger compel he to get up and leave the cliff and the sandy hill behind it and then for a hour or two he walk feebly about search for sweet root but find none it would have go hard with he then if he have not see some low dark-looking bush at a distance on the dry yellow plain and go to they they look like yew-bush and when he get to they he find that they be thickly cover with small berry on some bush they be purple-black on other crimson but all be ripe and many small bird be there feast on they the berry be pleasant to the taste and he feast with the little bird on they until he hunger be satisfied and then with he mouth and finger stain purple with the juice he go to sleep in the shade of one of the bush there too he spend the whole of that day and the night hear the low murmur of the sea when wake and when morning come he be strong and happy once more and after fill himself with the fruit set off to the sea again arrive at the cliff he begin walk along the edge and in about a hour 's time come to the end of it for there it slope down to the water and before he far as he could see there be a wide shingled beach with low sand-hill behind it with a shout of joy he run down to the margin and the rest of that day he spend dabble in the water gathering beautiful shell and seaweed and strangely-painted pebble into heap then go on and on again still pick up more beautiful riffraff on the margin only to leave it all behind he at last never have he spend a happier day and when it come to a end he find a sheltered spot not far from the sea so that when he wake in the night he would still hear the deep low murmur of the wave on the beach many happy day he spend in the same way with no living thing to keep he company except the little white and gray sanderling that pipe so shrill and clear as they flit along the margin before he and the great sea-gull that utter hoarse laughter-like cry as they soar and hover above he head oh happy bird exclaim martin clap he hand and shout in answer to they cry every day martin grow more familiar with the sea and love it more and it be he companion and playmate he be bolder than the little restless sanderling that run and flit before the advance wave and so never get they pretty white and gray plumage wet : often he would turn to meet the come wave and let it break round and rush past he and then in a moment he would be stand knee-deep in the midst of a great sheet of dazzling white foam until with a long hiss as it flee back draw the round pebble with it it would be go and he would laugh and shout with glee what a grand old play-fellow the sea be and it love he like the big spotted cat of the hill and only pretend to be angry with he when it want to play and would do he no harm and still he be not satisfied but grow bolder and bolder put himself in its power and trust to its mercy he could play better with he clothes off and one day chase a great receding wave as far as it would go he stand up bravely to encounter the succeed wave but it be greater than the last and lift he in its great green arm it carry he high up till it break with a mighty roar on the beach then instead of leave he strand there it rush back still bear he in its arm out into the deep further and further from the shore it carry he until he become terrify and throw out he little arm towards the land he cry aloud mother mother he be not call to he own mother far away on the great plain he have forget she now he only think of the beautiful woman of the hill who be so strong and love he and make he call she mother and to she he cry in he need for help now he remember she warm protect bosom and how she have cry every night at the fear of lose he how when he run from she she follow he call to he to return ah how cold be the sea 's bosom how bitter its lip struggle still with the great wave struggle in vain blinded and half-choked with salt water he be drive violently against a great black object tumble about in the surf and with all the strength of he little hand he cling to it the water roll over he and beat against he but he would not lose he hold and at last there come a bigger wave and lift he up and cast he right on to the object he be cling to it be as if some enormous monster of the sea have catch he up and put he in that place just as the lady of the hill have often snatch he up from the edge of some perilous precipice to set he down in a safe place there he lay exhaust stretch out at full length so toss about on the billow that he have a sensation of be in a swing but the sea grow quiet at last and when he look up it be dark the star glitter in the dim blue vault above and the smooth black water reflect they all round he so that he seem to be float suspend between two vast starry sky one immeasurably far above the other below he all night with only the twinkling tremble star for company he lay there naked wet and cold thirsty with the bitter taste of sea-salt in he mouth never daring to stir listen to the continual lapping sound of the water morning dawn at last the sea be green once more the sky blue and beautiful with the young fresh light he be lie on a old raft of black water-logged spar and plank lash together with chain and rot rope but alas there be no shore in sight for all night long he have be drift drift further and further away from land a strange habitation for martin the child of the plain be that old raft it have be make by shipwrecked mariner long long ago and have float about the sea until it have become of the sea like a half-submerged float island brown and many-coloured seaweed have attach themselves to it strange creature half plant and half animal grow on it and little shell-fish and numberless slimy creep thing of the sea make it they dwelling-place it be about as big as the floor of a large room all rough black and slippery with the seaweed float like ragged hair many yard long around it and right in the middle of the raft there be a large hole where the wood have rot away now it be very curious that when martin look over the side of the raft he could see down into the clear green water a few fathom only but when he creep to the edge of the hole and look into the water there he be able to see ten time further down look in this hole he see far down a strange fish-shaped creature strip like a zebra with long spine on its back move about to and fro it disappear and then very much further down something move first like a shadow then like a great dark form and as it come up higher it take the shape of a man but dim and vast like a man-shaped cloud or shadow that float in the green translucent water the shoulder and head appear then it change its position and the face be towards he with the vast eye that have a dim greyish light in they gaze up into he martin tremble as he gaze not exactly with fear but with excitement because he recognize in this huge water-monster under he that old man of the sea who have appear and talk to he in he dream when he fall asleep among the rock could it be although he be asleep at the time that the old man really have appear before he and that he eye have be open just enough to see he by-and-by the cloud-like face disappear and do not return though he watch for it a long time then sit on the black rotten wood and brown seaweed he gaze over the ocean a vast green sunlit expanse with no shore and no living thing upon it but after a while he begin to think that there be some living thing in it which be always near he though he could not see what it be from time to time the surface of the sea be break just as if some huge fish have rise to the surface and then sink again without show itself it be something very big judge from the commotion it make in the water and at last he do see it or a part of it -- a vast brown object which look like a gigantic man 's shoulder but it might have be the back of a whale it be no sooner see than go but in a very short time after its appearance cry as of bird be hear at a great distance the cry come from various direction grow louder and louder and before long martin see many bird fly towards he on arrival they begin to soar and circle round above he all scream excitedly they be white bird with long wing and long sharp beak and be very much like gull except that they have a easier and swifter flight martin rejoice at see they for he have be in the greatest terror at the strangeness and loneliness of the sea now that there be no land in sight sit on the black raft he be constantly think of the warning word he mother of the hill have speak -- that the sea would kiss he with cold salt lip and take he down into the depths where he would never see the light again o how strange the sea be to he now how lonely how terrible but bird that with they wing could range over the whole world be of the land and now seem to bring the land near he with they white form and wild cry how could they help he he do not know he do not ask but he be not alone now that they have come to he and he terror be less and still more bird keep come and as the morning wear on the crowd of bird increase until they be in hundred then in thousand perpetually wheeling and swooping and rise and hover over he in a great white cloud and they be of many kind mostly white some gray other sooty brown or mottled and some wholly black then in the midst of the crowrd of bird he see one of great size wheeling about like a king or giant among the other with wing of amazing length wild eye of a glitter yellow and a yellow beak half as long as martin 's arm with a huge vulture-like hook at the end now when this mighty bird swoop close down over he head fan he with its immense wing martin again begin to be alarm at its formidable appearance and as more and more bird come with more of the big kind and the wild outcry they make increase he fear and astonishment grow then all at once these feeling rise to extreme terror and amazement at the sight of a new bird-like creature a thousand time bigger than the largest one in the circle crowd above come swiftly towards he he see that it be not fly but swim or glide over the surface of the sea and its body be black and above the body be many immense white wing of various shape which stand up like a white cloud overcome with terror he fall flat on the raft hide he face in the brown seaweed that cover it then in a few minute the sea become agitate and rock he in he raft and a wave come over he which almost sweep he into the sea at the same time the outcry of the bird be redouble until he be nearly deafen by they scream and the scream seem to shape themselves into word martin martin the bird seem to be scream look up martin look up look up the whole air above and about he seem to be full of the cry and every cry say to he martin martin lookup lookup -lrb- illustration : -rrb- although daze with the awful din and almost faint with terror and weakness he could not resist the command press he hand on the raft he at last struggle up to he knee and see that the fear bird-like monster have pass he by : he see that it be a ship with a black hull its white sail spread and that the motion of the water and the wave that sweep over he have be create by the ship as it come close to the raft it be now rapidly glide from he but still very near and he see a crowd of strange-looking rough man with sun-browned face and long hair and shaggy beard lean over the bulwark stare at he they have see with astonishment the corpse as they think of a little naked white boy lie on the old black raft with a multitude of sea-birds gather to feed on he now when they see he get up on he knee and look at they they utter a great cry and begin rush excitedly hither and thither to pull at rope and lower a boat martin do not know what they be do he only know that they be man in a ship but he be now too weak and worn-out to look at or think of more than one thing at a time and what he be look at now be the bird for no sooner have he look up and see the ship than they wild cry cease and they rise up and up like a white cloud to scatter far and wide over sky and sea for some moment he continue watch they listen to they change voice which now have a very soft and pleasant sound as if they be satisfied and happy it make he happy to hear they and he lift he hand up and smile then relieve of he terror and overcome with weariness he close he eye and drop once more full length upon he bed of wet seaweed at that the man stare into each other 's face a very strange startled look come into they eye and no wonder for long long month run to year they have be cruise in those lonely desolate sea thousand of mile from home see no land nor any green thing nor dear face of woman or child : and now by some strange chance a child have come to they and even while they be make all haste to rescue it put they arm out to take it from the sea its life have seemingly be snatch from they but he be only sleep -lrb- illustration : -rrb- note _ when i arrange with mr hudson for the publication of a american edition of _ a little boy lose _ i ask he to write a special foreword to he american reader he reply with a characteristic letter and take he at he word i be print it on the follow page _ alfr a knopf _ dear mr knopf _ : you request for a foreword to insert in the american reprint of the little book worry I a critic on this side have say that my preface to reprint of my earlier work be of the nature of parting kick and i have no desire just now to kick this poor innocent that evil-tempered old woman mother nature in one of she worst tantrum have be inflict so many cuff and blow on I that she have leave I no energy or disposition to kick anything -- even myself the trouble be that i know so little about it do i write this book what then make I do it in read a volume of for clavigera i once come upon a passage which sound well but leave I in a mist and it relieve I to find a footnote to it in which the author say : this passage be write many year ago and what i be think about at the time have quite escape my memory at all event though i let it stand i can find no meaning in it now little man may admire but must not try to imitate these gesture of the giant and as a result of a little quiet think it over i seem able to recover the idea i have in my mind when i compose this child 's story and find a title for it in blake something too of the semi-wild spirit of the child hero in the line : naught love another as itself and father how can i love you or any of my brother more i love you like the little bird that pick up crumb about the door there nature be after pick up the crumb to fly away a long time ago i form a small collection of child 's book of the early year of the nineteenth century and look through they wish that some of they have fall into my hand when i be a child i recall the book i have read at that time -- especially two or three like any normal child i delighted in such story as the swiss family robinson but they be not the book i prize most they omit the very quality i like best -- the little thrill that nature itself give I which half frightened and fascinate at the same time the wonder and mystery of it all once in a while i get a book with something of this rare element in it contain perhaps in some perfectly absurd narrative of animal take human shape or use human speech with such like transformation and vagary they could never be too extravagant fantastic and incredible so long as they express anything of the feeling i myself experience when out of sight and sound of my fellow being whether out on the great level plain with a glitter of illusory water all round I or among the shadowy tree with they bird and insect sound or by the waterside and bed of tall dark bullrush murmur in the wind these ancient memory put it in my mind to write a book which i imagine would have suit my peculiar taste of that early period the impossible story to be found on my own childish impression and adventure with a few dream and fancy throw in and two or three native legend and myth such as the one of the lady of the hill the incarnate spirit of the rocky sierra on the great plain about which i hear from my gaucho comrade when on the spot -- the strange woman seldom view by human eye who be jealous of man 's presence and be able to create sudden violent tempest to frighten they from she sacred haunt that be the story of my story and to the question in you publisher 's practical mind i be sorry to have to say i do not know i have no way of find out since child be not accustom to write to author to tell they what they think of they book and after all these excuse it just occur to I that child do not read foreword and introduction they have to be address to adult who do not read child 's book so that in any case it would be throw away still if a foreword you must have and from I i think you will have to get it out of this letter i remain yours cordially w h hudson November 141917 end of the project gutenberg ebook of a little boy lose by hudson w h
