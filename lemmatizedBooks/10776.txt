with a series of puff and chug a big shiny motor cycle turn from the road into the gravel drive at the side of a white farmhouse two boy sit on the creak saddle the one at the front handle bar throw forward the clutch lever and then turn on the power sharply to drive the last of the gas out of the twin cylinder the motor cycle come to a stop near a shed and the two lad swing off look at each other for a moment some ride that observe one you have she go then blake just a little joe -- yes it be a nice level stretch and i want to see what she could do you do not let she out to the full at that do you i should say not answer the one who have ride in front and guide the steed of steel and gasoline she 'll do better than ninety mile a hour on the level but i do not want to ride on she when she be do it nor i well it be a nice little run all right funny though that we do not get any mail be not it it sure be i think somebody must be rob the post-office for we ought to have have a letter from mr hadley before this and he laugh at he own joke yes agree joe and i ought to have have one from -- he stop suddenly and a blush suffused the tan of he cheek might as well say it as think it break in blake with another laugh that show he white even tooth have not mabel write to you this week what if she have not fire back joe oh nothing only -- only i suppose you be put out because you have not have a postcard from birdie lee challenge joe oh well have it you own way and blake with a shrug of he broad shoulder begin to wheel the motor cycle into the shed no but it be queer be not it go on joe here we have be back from the flood district over two week now and we have not have a line from mr hadley he promise to write too and let we know what sort of move picture he might be in line for next we vacation will soon be over and we do not want to be idle that be right agree he chum there be no money in sit around when the film be not run oh well i suppose mr hadley have be so busy that he have not have time to make he plan besides blake go on you know there be a lot of trouble over the mississippus flood picture -- reel of film get lose and all that -- to say nothing of the danger we friend run birdie lee say she would never forget what they suffer i do not blame she well maybe they have not get straighten out enough yet to feel like write but it sure be nice here and i do not mind if we stay another week or so and he look up the pleasant valley on one side of which be perch the farmhouse where the two move picture boy have be spend they vacation it sure be nice agree blake and it be lot more fun since we get this motor cycle for they have lately invest in the powerful vehicle on which they have make many trip about the surrounding country as blake go to put the machine in the shed which they farmer-landlord have allow they to use joe turn to glance back along the road they have come the farmhouse be set up on a little hill above the road and a glimpse of the highway could be have for a long distance it be the sight of something come along this thoroughfare that attract joe 's attention what be you look at ask blake return after have put away the motor cycle that horse and buggy look to I as though that horse be feel he oats and that the fellow drive he do not know any more about handle the rein than the law allow that be right joe if he do not look out he 'll have a upset or a runaway the vehicle in question be a light buggy draw by a particularly large and spirited horse seat in the carriage as the boy could see from they point of vantage be two man who they be could not be distinguish at that distance but the carriage be rapidly come nearer there he go suddenly cry joe as he chum speak blake see that one of the rein have part probably because the driver pull on it too hard in try to bring the restive steed down to a walk once the spirited horse feel that he be no longer under control save by one line which be worse than none he spring forward and at once begin to gallop pull after he the light carriage which sway from side to side threatening every moment to collapse overturn or at least be tear loose from the horse there he go yell joe again i should say so agreed blake there be go to be some doings soon this be evident for the horse be run away a fact not only apparent in itself but herald by the look on the face of the two occupant of the carriage and by they frightened cry which the wind easily carry to the watch joe duncan and blake stewart on the road below they and past the boy sweep the sway carriage in a cloud of dust as it be momentarily lose to sight behind a grassy knoll blake cry : the broken bridge joe the broken bridge they be head right for it that be right exclaim he chum how can we stop they once have recognize the danger the next thought that come to the mind of blake and joe train for emergency be how to avert it they look at each other for a second not to gain a delay but to decide on the best possible plan of save the imperil man the broken bridge murmur blake again that horse will never be able to make the turn into the temporary road go at the speed he be no and he be probably so frightened that he 'll not try it agree joe he 'll crash right through the barrier fence and -- he do not finish he sentence but blake know what he chum mean about half a mile beyond the farmhouse the road run over a bridge that span a deep and rocky ravine about a week before there have be a accident weaken by the passing of a heavy traction threshing engine it have be break and be rule unsafe by the county authority accordingly the bridge have be condemn and partially tear down a new structure be plan to replace it but this new bridge be not yet in place though a frail temporary span open only to foot passenger and very light vehicle have be throw across the ravine the danger though be not so much in the temporary bridge as in the fact that the temporary road connect with it leave the main and permanent highway at a sharp curve person know of the broken bridge make allowance for this curve and approach along the main road carefully to make the turn safely into the temporary highway but a maddened horse could not be expect to do this he would dash along the main road and would not make the turn or if he do go at the speed of this one he would most certainly overturn the carriage the main highway be fence off a short distance on either side of the broken bridge but this barrier be of so frail a nature that it could not be expect to stop a runaway he 'll crash right through it run out on the end of the broken bridge and -- once more joe do not finish we have get to do something cry blake yes but what ask joe we have get to save they cry blake again as he think of the two man in the carriage he have have a glimpse of they face as the vehicle draw by the frenzied horse sweep past he on the road below one of the man he know to be employ in the only livery stable of central fall on the outskirts of which he and joe be spend they holiday the other man be a stranger blake have only see that he be a young man rather good-looking and of a foreign cast of countenance blake have momentarily put he down for a italian the motor cycle suddenly cry joe what ask blake only half comprehend we might overtake they on the motor cycle repeat he chum a look of understanding come into blake 's eye that be right he cry why do not i think of that before instead of stand here moon i wonder if we have get time we 'll make time cry joe grimly get she out and we 'll ride for all we be worth it 'll be a race blake yes a race to save a life lucky she be get plenty of gas and oil in she yes and she have not have a chance to cool down run she out blake fairly leap toward the shed where he have wheel the motor cycle in another instant he and joe be trundle it down the gravel walk to the road as they reach the highway they could hear grow fainter and fainter the thump-thud of the hoof of the runaway horse joe hold the machine upright while blake vault to the forward saddle and begin to work the pedal to start the motor the cylinder be still hot from the recent run and at the first revolution the staccato explosion begin jump up yell blake in he chum 's ear -- shout above the rattle and bang of the exhaust for the muffler be open joe spring to leather but before he be in he seat blake be let in the friction clutch and a moment later at ever gather speed the shine motor cycle be speed down the road to the rescue would joe and blake be in time chapter ii on the brink what -- what be you plan blake yell joe into he chum 's ear as he sit behind he on the jolting second saddle of the sway motor cycle what do you mean demand blake half turn he head i mean how be you go to stop that runaway or rescue those fellow i have not think yet but if we can get ahead of the horse we may be able to stop he before he get to the road-barrier or to the dangerous turn that be right pant joe the word be fairly jolt out of he head he off -- i see hold fast exclaimed blake as the conductor do when a trolley car go around a curve hold fast there be need of the advice for a little turn in the road be just ahead of they and blake intend to take it at almost top speed bump sway jolting spit fire and smoke with a rattle clatter and bang on rush the motor cycle on its errand of rescue hark cry joe close to blake 's ear listen can not with all this racket yell back blake for he have open the throttle to gain a little increase of power what be the matter i think i hear the horse hearing he will not do any good observe blake grimly we have get to see he and get ahead and he turn on a little more gasoline while blake and joe be thus speed to the rescue of the man in the runaway we will take a few moment to tell we new reader something about the boy who be to figure prominently in this story joe duncan and blake stewart be call the move picture boy for a obvious reason they take move picture with they curious box-like camera equip with the thousand foot of sensitive celluloid film and the operating handle they have rise from the rank of mere helper to be expert operator and now they be qualify to take move picture of anything from a crowd shuffling along the street to a more complicated scene such as a flood earthquake or volcanic eruption and incidentally i might mention that they have be in all three of these last situation the first volume of this series be call the move picture boy and in that i introduce to you blake and joe they work on adjoining farm and one day they see a company of move picture actor and actress come to a stream near where they be to take a movie drama naturally blake and joe be interested at once and make the acquaintance of mr calvert hadley who be in charge of the taking of the play or film it as the technical term have it the two boy be give a opportunity to get into the business they go to new york and begin the study of how move picture be take develop from the film the positive print and then through the project machine throw on the screen more than life size the process be a intricate one and rather complicated involve much explanation as i have already go into it in detail in my first book of this series i will not repeat it here those of you who wish to know more about the movie than you can gain by look at the interesting picture in some theater be respectfully refer to the initial volume joe and blake be much interested in the film theatrical company my former reader will well remember some member of that organization -- cc piper or gloomy as he be call when not refer to as just cc birdie lee a pretty vivacious girl mabel pierce a new member of the company henry robertson who play juvenile lead miss shay and other in whom you be more or less interested after various adventure in new york city take film of all sort of perilous scene joe and blake go out west they adventure there be tell in the volume of that name they have they fill of cowboy and indian and incidentally be in no little danger afterward they go to the pacific coast thence to the jungle where many stir wild animal scene be obtain and afterward they have many adventure in earthquake land there they be in great danger from tremor of the earth and from volcano but good luck no less than good management bring they home with whole skin and with they case fill with rare film have finish in the land of uncertainty the work assign to they by mr hadley and he associate joe and blake have go for they vacation to the farm of mr hiram baker near central fall but they intention of enjoy a quiet stay be rudely interrupted for not long after they have arrive and be rest quietly under a cherry tree in the shade mr ringold with whom they be also associate in move picture work call they up on the long distance telephone to offer they a most curious assignment this be to go to the flood mississippus valley and get move picture of the father of water on one of he annual rampage of course blake and joe go and they adventure in the flood fill the volume immediately precede this one and now they have return anticipate a second session of they vacation they have bring a motor cycle with which to go about the pretty country surround central fall for reason blake we have not much time leave this summer and if we want to enjoy ourselves we 'll have to hustle a motor cycle be the most hustling thing i know of this side of a automobile and we can not afford that yet i be with you for a motor cycle joe have say so one be purchase jointly it be on return from a pleasant ride that we hero have see the runaway with which we be immediately concern they be now speed after the maddened horse drag the frail carriage hope to get ahead of and stop the animal before it either crash into the frail barrier and leap into the ravine or upset the vehicle in try to make the turn into the temporary road there he be suddenly cry blake the motor cycle bear the two chum have make the curve in the road successfully and be now straighten up on a long level stretch and yet not so long either for not more than a quarter of a mile ahead be another turn and then come the bridge i see he answer joe can you make it i be go to declare blake close he lip firmly every little bump and stone in the road seem magnify because of the speed at which they be move but blake hold the long handle firmly and once the curve be pass he turn the rubber grip that let a little more gasoline flow into the carbureter to be vaporize and spray into the cylinder where the electric spark explode it with a bang we -- be -- go -- some pant joe get -- to assented blake grimly on sway the thunder rattle motor cycle the carriage top have either be let down or some of the support have break and it have fall and the boy could now plainly see the two man on the seat they have not jump but they have evidently give up try to make the horse stop by pull on the one rein for the animal be speed straight down the center of the road we be not catch up to he very fast howl joe into blake 's ear and he have to howl louder than usual for they be then pass along a portion of the road densely shaded by tree in fact the branch of the tree meet overhead in a thick arch and it be like go through a leafy tunnel this top bower of twig and branch throw back the noise of the explosion of the motor cycle and make a echo above which it be almost impossible to make one 's voice hear look out suddenly cry blake hold fast at first joe imagine that he chum be go to make another curve in the road but none be at hand then as blake watch he chum 's right hand he see he slowly turn the movable rubber handle that control the gasoline supply blake be turn on more power though now the machine be run at a higher rate than joe or blake have ever travel before with a jump like that of a dog release from the leash the motor cycle seem to spring forward indeed joe must need hold on and as he be not so favorably seat as be he chum it become a matter of no little trouble to maintain a grip with he leg and hand we -- sure -- be -- go -- some mutter joe but he do not open he mouth any more it be too dangerous at the speed they have attain a jolt over a stone or a bit of wood might send he tooth through he tongue if he part he jaw so he keep quiet ahead of they the carriage sway and swerve the horse be a speedy one but no creature of bone blood muscle and sinew can distance a fire-spitting and smoke-eating machine like a motor cycle the distance be gradually be cut down but now just ahead of they be the curve immediately beyond which be the broken bridge and also the temporary one shunt off at a sharp angle from the main highway look out hold on once more cry blake speaking in quick tone for a moment joe wonder at the add caution and then he sense what blake be about to do to one side of they stretch a level field the road make a slight detour about it just before meet the ravine and by cross this field it be possible for the boy to reach the bridge ahead of the sway carriage but at the speed they be now run it be dangerous and risky in the extreme to run across the uneven meadow blake however evidently be go to chance it hold fast he cry once more and joe have no more than time to take a firmer grip on the bar in front of he and to cling with he leg to the foot support and saddle than they be off the road and into the green field the fence have be take down to allow for the storage of bridge-building material in the meadow now we 'll get he cry blake but he speak too soon for the motor cycle have not go ten foot into the uneven field jolting swaying and all but throw off the move picture boy than the sound of the explosion suddenly cease and the machine begin to slacken speed with a quickness that be add to by the rough nature of the ground the motor cycle slow up and stop what be the matter cry joe put down he foot to support the machine something 's bust -- gasoline pipe i guess cry blake come on we have get to run for it the accident have occur only a short distance from the road together the two chum leap clear of the motor cycle make for it on the run but they be too late they have a glimpse of the runaway horse dash straight at the fence barrier the next moment there be a splinter crash and he be through it oh cry blake the thunder of the horse 's hoof on what be leave of the wooden approach to the broken bridge drown he word then the animal with a leap disappear over the jagged edge of the plank the boy expect to see the carriage and the two occupant follow but to they intense surprise the vehicle sway to one side catch somehow on one of the king beam of the bridge and hang there come on cried blake increase he speed we have get a chance of save they yet chapter iii a surprise they reach -- only just in time -- the broken and collapse carriage with its two front wheel mere twisted and splintered spoke the move picture boy reach it and with strong and capable hand pull it back from the brink of the ravine over which it hang in the depths below the horse lay very still and quiet pull back direct blake but joe need no urge a slight difference -- inch only -- mean safety or death -- terrible injury at best for the ravine be a hundred foot deep but those few inch be on the side of safety so evenly be the carriage poise that only a little strength be need to send it either way but joe and blake pull it back on the unwrecked portion of the bridge approach the two man be still on the seat but it have break in the middle pitch they toward the center and they be wedge fast hank duryee the town livery driver do not seem to be hurt though there be a anxious look on he face and he be very pale which be unusual for he as for the other man he seem to have faint he eye be close but he swarthy complexion permit little diminution in he color there be a slight cut on he head from which have trickle a little blood that run down to he white collar easy boy caution hank and he voice rasp out in the quiet that succeed the staccato noise from the motor cycle go easy now a touch 'll send we down and he gaze shudderingly into the depths below we have get you blake assure he as he and joe draw still farther back on the platform of the bridge what be leave of the carriage as they do so one of the rear wheel collapse let the seat down with a jerk oh gasp hank and a tremor seem to go through the insensible frame of the other it be all right blake assure the livery stable driver you can not fall far not as far as down -- there and hank point a tremble finger into the depths of the ravine can you get out -- can you walk ask joe yes i be more scared than hurt hank make answer how about he ask blake motion to the other occupant of the carriage only a little cut on the head where he bang up against the top iron i guess a little water will fetch he around my but that be a close shave he stagger out on the broken bridge he leg be unsteady through weakness and fear but not from any injury how do it happen ask joe horse get scare at something -- i do not know what -- and bolt i do not want to take he out -- he be a old spitfire anyhow and have not be drive in a week but this feller be in a hurry and he nod toward the unconscious man and i have to bring he out with rex -- the only horse in the stable just then i say i be afraid we would have a smash-up and we do the line bust near baker 's place and -- well here we be better here than -- down there observe joe in a low voice that be right agree hank now let 's see what we can do for he hope he be not much hurt though i do not see how he could be who be he ask blake but the livery stable driver do not answer he be bend back the bent frame of the dashboard to more easily get out the swarthy man joe and blake see what he be try to do help he soon they be able to lift out the stranger but there be no need of carry he for he suddenly open he eye straighten up and stand on he foot retain a support hand on hank 's shoulder where -- where be we he ask in a dazed way do we fall he speak with a accent that at once tell blake and joe he nationality -- spanish either from mexico or south america we be all right put in hank these young fellow save we from go over into the gulch it be a narrow squeak though ah the man utter the exclamation with a long sigh of satisfaction and relief then he put he hand to he forehead and bring it away with a little blood on it it be nothing it be a mere scratch and do not distress I in the least he go on speak very correct english in he curiously accented voice he appear to hesitate a little to pick out the word and expression he want and often in such case the wrong word though correct enough in themselves be select i be at ease -- all right that be to say he go on with a rather pale smile and so these young man save we -- save we life be that what you mean señor -- i should say sir and he quickly correct he slip i should say they do exclaimed hank with a air of satisfaction old rex take matter into he own hand or rather leg and we be just about head for kingdom come when these fellow pull we back from the brink as for rex himself i guess he be go where he will not run away any more and lean over the jagged edge of the bridge the stableman look down on the motionless form of the horse rex have indeed run he last it be all so -- so surprising to I go on the stranger it all occur with such unexpected suddenness one moment we be drive along as quietly as you please only perhaps a trifle accentuate and then -- presto we begin to go too fast and the leather thong break then indeed there be thing do as you say up here he smile try perhaps to show himself at he ease he be rapidly recover not only from the fright but from the effect of the blow on the head which have cause the cut and render he unconscious for a moment it sure be a narrow squeak declare hank again i do not want any closer call i could not move to save myself i be so dumbfounded and the carriage would have topple down in another second if you boy have not come along and haul it back we see you pass mr baker 's house explain blake and we come after you on the motor cycle try to get ahead of you but the old machine lay down on we but we get here in time add joe you do indeed i can not thank you enough put in the spaniard as joe and blake both class he you have save my life and some day i hope not only to repay the favor but to show how grateful i be in other way i be a stranger in this part of you fine country but i expect to be better acquaint soon but where be we horse he ask quickly not seem to understand what have happen how be we to continue we journey and he look at he driver we be at the end of it now in more way than one hank answer with a smile you be just where you want to go though not in the style i calculate on take you but i do not comprehend sir say the spaniard in rather puzzle accent i have engage you to take I to a certain place there be a accident we go through a fence with a resounding crash -- ah i can hear that smash yet and he put he hand to he ear in a somewhat dramatic manner then everything be black we horse disappear and -- he be down there if you want to know _ where _ he disappear to break in hank practically it be no matter -- if he be go go on the spaniard but i do not comprehend -- assimilate -- no comprehend -- that be it i do not comprehend what you mean when you say we be at we journey 's end i 'll tell you exclaim hank as he glance at joe and blake in a manner that cause they to wonder you say you want to find -- pardon I -- my card gentleman and the stranger extend a rectangle of white on which be engrave the name _ vigue alcando _ blake take it and as he do so from the pocket whence the spaniard have extract the card there fall a letter joe pick it up but to he surprise it be address to himself and blake jointly and in the upper left hand corner be the imprint of the film theatrical company why -- why begin joe this be for we look blake for you that letter for you cry mr alcando be you the move picture boy that be what they call we answer joe this be blake stewart and i be he chum joe duncan be it possible -- be it possible cry mr alcando and you have save my life why -- i -- i -- er -- i -- oh to think of this happen so you be -- you be -- he put he hand to he head and seem to sway look out he be go to fall warn blake spring forward to catch the spaniard chapter iv a delay letter but mr alcando to americanize he name do not faint after reel uncertainly for a moment he obtain command of he muscle straighten up and stand rigid i -- i beg you pardon he say faintly as though he have commit some blunder i -- i fear i be not altogether myself should not wonder but what you be a bit play out put in hank what we have just go through with be enough to knock anyone out to say nothing of the crack you get on the head maybe we would better get a doctor and he voice frame a question as he look at joe and blake no no hastily exclaim the spaniard for he be of that nationality though bear in south america as the boy learn later i do not require the service of a physician go on mr alcando speak rapidly i be perfectly all right now -- or i shall be in a few moment if i have a drink of water -- he voice trail off feebly and he look about rather helplessly there use to be a spring hereabouts say hank but i have not be this way in some time and -- i know where it be interrupted blake he and joe with a training that have make it necessary for they to size up and know intimately they surroundings for use in take move picture have sense the location of a bubble spring of pure water along the road on they first visit to it it be right over here i 'll get some blake go on if you will be so kind speak the spaniard and he extend a collapsible drinking cup blake lose little time in fill it and soon after drink mr alcando appear much better i be sorry to give all this trouble the spaniard go on but i have seem to meet with considerable number of shock to-day first there be the runaway which i certainly do not expect and then come the sudden stop -- a stop most fortunate for we i take it and he glance not without a shudder in the direction of the gulch where the dead horse lay and then you pull we back from the brink -- the brink of death he go on and he voice have in it a tone of awe as well as thankfulness i can not thank you now -- i shall not try he go on but some time i hope to prove -- oh what be i say he break in upon himself i never dream of this it be incomprehensible that i should meet you so you whom i -- once more he hand go to he head with a tragic gesture and yet it do not seem that he be in physical pain the cut on he head have stop bleed it be too bad too bad and yet fate would have it so he murmur after a pause but that it should turn in such a queer circle well it be fate -- i must accept joe and blake look at each other blake with slightly raise eyebrow which might mean a implied question as to the man 's sanity then the move picture boy look at hank who have drive they about on several excursion before they buy the motor cycle hank who stand a little behind the spaniard shrug he shoulder and tap he head significantly but i must again beg you pardon say mr alcando quickly i most certainly be not myself this day but it be the surprise of meeting you whom i come to seek now if you will pardon I and he look at the letter address to blake and joe jointly -- which epistle have be hand to he after it have be pick up from the ground and be you really look for we ask joe much puzzle i be -- for both of you young gentleman my friend the driver here can testify to that that be right say hank this gentleman come in on the new york express and go to we livery stable he say he want to come out to baker 's farm and meet you boy i happen to be the only one around at the time hank go on and as i know the road and know you boy i offer to bring he out but i wish i would have some other horse i sure do not count on rex run away and when i find i could not stop he and know we be head for the broken bridge -- well i want to jump out but i do not dare and i guess you feel the same way he say to mr alcando somewhat i must confess speak the spaniard who as i have say use very good english though with a odd accent which i shall not attempt to reproduce and then come the smash go on hank and i do not expect any more than he do that you fellow would come to we rescue but you do and now mr alcando you can deliver you letter and these really be the young gentleman whom i seek ask the spaniard pardon I i do not in the least doubt you word he add with a formal bow but it seem so strange we be the move picture boy answer blake with a smile wonder what the letter could contain and wonder more than ever why a missive from the film theatrical company should be bring by this unusual stranger then this be for you go on mr alcando and to think that they save my life he murmur shall i read it joe ask blake for the spaniard extend the letter to he sure go ahead i 'll listen blake take the fold sheet from the envelope and he first glance be at the signature it be from mr hadley he exclaim what be up ask joe quickly blake be read in a mumble tone hardly distinguishable dear boy this will introduce -- um -- um -- um -- who be desirous of learn the business of take move picture he come to I well recommend -- um -- um -lrb- more mumble -rrb- i wish you would do all you can for he -- um -- and when you go to panama -- that be as far as blake read then he cry out : i say joe look here i can not make head nor tail of this what be it ask he chum look over he shoulder at the letter the spaniard have so strangely bring to they why mr hadley speak of we go to panama that be the first we have have a inkling to that effect what in the world do he mean i hope i have not bring you bad news in a prospective trip to where the great canal will unite the two ocean speak the spaniard in he formal manner well i do not know as you would call it _ bad _ news say blake slowly we have get sort of use to be send to the end of the earth on short notice but what get I -- excuse I for put it that way -- what surprise I be that this be the first mr hadley have mention panama to we be that so asked mr alcando why i understand that you know all about he plan no one know _ all _ about hadley 's plan say joe in a low voice he make plan as he go along and change they in he sleep but this one about panama be sure a new one to we that be right chime in blake we be speak of the big ditch shortly before the runaway come past go on blake but that be only a coincidence of course we have no idea of go there and i can not yet understand what mr hadley refer to when he say we may take you there with we to show you some of the inside workings of make move picture do you read the letter all the way through joe ask no but -- perhaps i can explain interrupted the spaniard if you will kindly allow I i come to new york with a express purpose in view that purpose have now suffer -- but no matter i must not speak of that and there seem to be a return of he queer tragic manner i be connect with the equatorial railroad company he resume after a momentary pause during which he seem to regain control of himself we company have recently decide to have a series of move picture make show life in we section of the south american jungle and also what we have do in the matter of railroad transportation to redeem the jungle and make it more fit for habitation as one of the means of interesting the public and i may say in interesting capitalist move picture be suggest the idea be my own and be adopt and i be appoint to arrange the matter but in order that the right kind of move picture might be obtain so that they would help the work of we railroad i decide i must know something of the detail -- how the picture be make how the camera be construct how the picture be project -- in short all i could learn about the business i desire to learn my company send I to new york and there on inquiry i learn of the film theatrical company i have letter of introduction and i soon meet mr hadley he seem to be in charge of this branch of the work -- i mean outdoor picture yes that be he line say joe mr ringold attend to the dramatic end of it we have do work for both branch so i be tell go on mr alcando i ask to be assign a teacher and offer to pay well for it and mr hadley at once suggest that you two boy would be the very one who could best give I what i desire he tell I that you have just return from the danger of the mississippus flood section and be up here rest but i make so bold upon myself to come here to entreat you to let I accompany you to panama mr alcando come to a stop after he rather lengthy and excited explanation but great scott exclaim blake we do not know anything about go to _ panama _ we have not the least idea of go there and the first we have hear of it be the mention in this letter you bring from mr hadley it sure be queer say joe i wonder if any of we mail -- he be interrupt by the sound of rapid footstep and a freckle-faced and red-haired boy with a ragged straw hat and no shoe come run up say -- say pant the urchin i be glad i find you here be a letter for you pa -- pa -- he be be carryin ' it around in he pocket and when he change he coat just now it drop out he send I down with it lickity-split and the boy hold out a envelope bear a special delivery stamp blake take the missive mechanically chapter v another surprise while blake be tear off the end of the envelope preparatory to take out the enclosure joe look sharply at the red-haired lad who have so unexpectedly deliver it how would you father come to get we letter sam ask joe for the lad be the son of a farmer who live neighbor to mr baker sim rolinson the postmaster give it to he i guess volunteer sam sim generally take around the special delivery letter himself but he must have be busy when this one come in and he give it to pa anyhow pa say he ask he to deliver it only he do not do it put in joe i think something be the matter with we mail that we have not hear from new york lately you father be carry the letter around in he pocket but he do not mean to speak sam quickly he forget all about it until to-day when he be change he coat and it fall out then he make I scoot over here with it as fast as i could he say he be sorry and hope he have not do any damage well i guess not much joe respond for after all it be a accommodation to have the letter bring out from the post-office by the neighbor as often happen that one should be forget and carry in a pocket be not so very surprising then you will not make any fuss the barefoot lad go on eagerly no -- why should we inquire joe with a smile we will not inform the postal authority i guess it be not so very important and he look at blake who be read the delay letter whew finally whistle joe 's chum this be go some what be up now another surprise answer blake this day seem to be fill with 'em be it about panama you have guess it mr hadley want we to go there and get a series of move picture incidentally he mention that he be send to we a gentleman who want to go with we if we decide to go i presume he refer to you and blake nod in the direction of mr alcando then you have confirmatory evidence of what my letter say ask the spaniard bow politely that be what it amount to blake make answer though of course see that this be the first we have have panama bring up to we we do not really know what to say about go there hardly agree joe at a look from he chum and yet you may go shall you not ask the spaniard quickly he seem very eager for a answer oh yes we may -- it be not altogether out of the question say blake we 'll have to think about it though and if you do go may i have the honor of accompany you to the isthmus again he seem very anxious well of course if mr hadley want you to go with we we 'll take you answer joe slowly we be employ by mr hadley as one of the owner of the film theatrical company and what he say generally go ah but gentleman i should not want you to take I under compulsion exclaim the spaniard quickly i would like to go -- as you friend and he throw out he hand in a impulsive appealing gesture as a friend he repeat well i guess that could be arrange return blake with a smile for he have take a liking to the young man though he do not altogether understand he we 'll have to think it over oh of course i should not ask for a decision now say mr alcando quickly i shall return to my hotel in the village and come out to see you when i may -- when you have make you decision i feel the need of a little rest -- after my narrow escape and that it should be you who save my life -- you of all again the boy note he peculiar manner i guess we have better be get back suggest hank have to foot it to town though he add regretfully as he look at the smash carriage i hope the boss do not blame I for this and he voice be rueful i shall take it upon myself to testify in you favor say the spaniard with courtly grace it be a unavoidable accident -- the breaking of the rein and the madden dash of the horse off the bridge that we do not follow be a miracle i shall certainly tell you employer -- as you say you boss and he smile -- i shall tell he you could not help it i would take it kindly if you would add hank for rex though he have a terrible temper be a valuable horse well he will not run away any more that be one sure thing i guess that carriage can be patch up why do not you ask mr baker to lend you a rig suggest blake i be sure he would i 'll tell he how it happen that be kind of you sir you place I more than ever in you debt speak the spaniard bow again how do you know we be here ask joe of the boy who have bring the delay special delivery letter i stop at mr baker 's house sam explain and mr baker say she see you come down this way on you motor cycle she say you would just be on a ride and probably would not go far so i run on think i would meet you come back i do not know anything about the accident he conclude he eye big with wonder as he look at the smash carriage be you able to walk back to the farmhouse where we be board ask blake of mr alcando if not we could get mr baker to drive down here oh thank you i be perfectly able to walk thanks to you quickness in prevent the carriage and ourselves from topple into the chasm reply the spaniard hank with mr alcando and sam walk back along the road while blake and joe go to where they have drop they motor cycle they repair the disconnect gasoline pipe and ride on ahead to tell mr baker of the come of the other the farmer readily agree to lend he horse and carriage so that the unfortunate one would not have to walk into town a matter of three mile i shall remain at the central fall hotel for a week or more or until you have fully make up you mind about the panama trip say mr alcando on leave the boy and i shall come out whenever you send I word to learn of you decision that it may be a favorable one i need hardly say i hope he add with a low bow we 'll let you know as soon as we can promise blake but my chum and i will have to think it over we have hardly become rest from take flood picture i can well believe that from what i have hear of you strenuous activity well what do you think about it all ask joe as he and he chum sit on the shady porch a hour or so after the exciting incident i have just narrated i hardly know answer blake i guess i 'll have another go at mr hadley 's letter i do not half read it he take the missive from he pocket and again peruse it it contain reference to other matter besides the project panama trip and there be also enclose a check for some work the move picture boy have do but as it be with the reference to the big canal that we be interested we shall confine ourselves to that part of mr hadley 's letter no doubt you will be surprise he write to learn what i have in prospect for you i know you deserve a longer vacation than you have have this summer but i think too that you would not wish to miss this chance of course if you do not want to go to panama i can get some other operator to work the move picture camera but i would rather have you than anyone i know of so i hope you will accept the idea be this : the big canal be near completion and the work be now at a stage when it will make most interesting film then too there be another matter -- the big slide there have be several small one do considerable damage but no more than have be count on i have information however to the effect that there be impend in culebra cut a monstrous big slide one that will beat anything that ever before take place there if it do happen i want to get move picture not only of the slide but of scene afterward and also picture show the clear away of the débris whether this slide will occur i do not know no one know for a certainty but a man who have live in panama almost since the french start the big ditch claim to know a great deal about the slide and the cause of they he tell I that certain small slide such as have be experience be follow -- almost always after the same lapse of time -- by a much larger one the larger one be due soon and i want you there when it come now another matter some time after you get this you will be visit by a spanish gentleman name vigue alcando he will have a letter of introduction from I he want to learn the move picture business and as he come well recommend and as both mr ringold and i be under obligation to people he represent we feel that we must grant he request of course if you feel that you can not stand he after you see he and if you do not want to take he with you -- yes even if you do not want to go to panama at all do not hesitate to say so but i would like very much to have you someone must go for the film from down there will be particularly valuable at this time in view of the come opening of the canal for the passage of vessel so if you do not want to go someone else represent we will have to make the trip now think the matter over well before you decide i think you will find mr alcando a pleasant companion he strike I as be a gentleman though he view on some thing be the view of a foreigner but that do not matter of course as usual we will pay you boy well and meet all expense it be too bad to break in on you vacation again as we do to get the flood picture but the expect big slide like the flood will not wait and will not last very long you have to be ` johnnie on the spot ' to get the view i will await you answer chapter vi something queer for a little while after he have read to joe the letter from mr hadley blake remain silent nor do he chum speak when he do open he lip it be to ask : well what do you think of it blake blake draw a long breath and reply questioningly : what do you think of it i ask you first laugh joe no but seriously what do you make of it all make of it you mean go to panama yes and this chap alcando what do you think of he blake do not answer at once well ask joe rather impatiently do anything -- that be anything that fellow say -- or do -- strike you as be -- well let 's say -- queer and blake look he chum squarely in the face queer yes i guess there do of course he be excite about the runaway and he do have a narrow escape if i do say it myself only for we he and hank would have topple down into that ravine that be right assent blake but what strike I as queer resume joe be that he seem put out because it be we who save he he act -- i mean the spaniard do -- as though he would have be glad if someone else have save he life just how it strike I cry blake i wonder if you feel the same but perhaps it be only because he be unduly excite we might have misjudge he possibly admit joe but even if we do not and he really be sorry it be we who save he i do not see that it need matter he be probably so polite that the reason he object be because he do not want to put we to so much trouble perhaps agree blake as you say it do not much matter i rather like he so do i assent joe but he sure be queer in some way quite dramatic why you would think he be on the stage the way he go on after he learn that we two who have save he be the move picture boy to whom he have a letter of introduction yes i wonder what it all mean observe blake the time be to come when he and joe be to learn in a most sensational manner the reason for the decidedly queer action of mr alcando for some time longer the chum sit and talk but as the day wane and the supper hour approach they be no nearer a decision than before let 's let it go until morning suggest blake i be with you agree joe we can think better after we have ` sleep on it ' joe be later than blake get up next morning and when he see he chum sit out in a hammock under a tree in the farmyard joe notice that blake be read a book you be the regular early worm this morning be not you call joe it be a wonder some bird have not fly off with you i be too tough a morsel blake answer with a laugh besides i have be on the jump too much to allow a ordinary bird the chance what be the matter with you -- oversleep no i do it on purpose i be tired but what be that you be read and what do you mean about be on the jump oh i just take a little run into the village after breakfast on the motor cycle you do to tell that spaniard he could or could not go with we oh i do not see he i just go into the town library you know they have get a fairly decent one at central fall yes so i hear but i do not suppose they would be open so early in the morning they be not i have to wait and i be the first customer if you can call it that you _ be _ get studious laugh joe great scott look at what he be read he go on as he catch a glimpse of the title of the book ` history of the panama canal ' whew it be a mighty interesting book declare blake you 'll like it perhaps -- if i read it say joe drily oh i fancy you 'll want to read it go on blake significantly say cry joe strike with a sudden idea you have make up you mind to go to panama have not you well begin he chum slowly i have not fully decide -- oh piffle cry joe with a laugh excuse my slang but i know just how it be he proceed you have make up you mind to go and you be get all the advance information you can to spring it on I i know you trick well you will not go without I will you you know i would never do that be the answer speak rather more solemnly than joe 's laughing word deserve you know we promise to stick together when we come away from the farm and start in this move picture business and we have stick i do not want to break the combination do you i should say not and if you go to panama i go too i have not actually make up my mind go on blake who be perhaps a little more serious and probably a deeper thinker than he chum but i go over it in my mind last night and i do not just see how we could refuse mr hadley 's request you know he start we in this business and only for he we might never have amount to much so if he want we to go to panama and get view of the giant slide volcanic eruption and so on i for one think we ought to go so do i -- for two chime in joe but be there really volcanic eruption down there well there have be in time past and there might be again anyhow the slide be always more or less likely to occur i be just read about they in this book culebra cut that be where the really stupendous work of the panama canal come in think of it joe nine mile long with a average depth of 120 foot and at some place the side go up 500 foot above the bed of the channel why the suez canal be a farm ditch alongside of it whew whistle joe you be there with the fact already blake they be so interesting i could not help but remember they say blake with a smile this book have a lot in it about the big landslide at first they be terribly discourage to the worker they practically put the french engineer who start the canal out of the running and even when the united state engineer start figure they do not allow enough leeway for the culebra slide at first they decide that a ditch about eight hundred foot wide would be enough to keep the top soil from slip down but they finally have to make it nearly three time that width or eighteen hundred foot at the top so as to make the side slope gently enough and yet slide occur even now remark joe dubiously yes because the work be not quite finish and we be go to get one of those slide on we film if we go yes and i do not see but what we would better go then i be with you blake old man cry joe affectionately slapping he chum on the back with such energy that the book fly out of the other 's hand look out what you be do or you 'll get the librarian after you cry blake as he pick up the volume well then we 'll consider it settle -- we 'll go to panama he look questioningly at he chum yes i guess so have you tell that spaniard no not yet of course i have not see he since you do but i fancy we have better write to mr hadley first and let he know we will go he 'll wonder why we have not write before we can explain about the delay letter all right and when we hear from he and learn more of he plan we can let mr alcando hear from we i guess we can mosey along with he all right yes and we 'll need a helper with the camera and thing he can be a sort of assistant while he be learn the rope a letter be write to the move picture man in new york and while wait for a answer blake and joe spend two day visit place of interest about central fall if this be to be another break in we vacation we want to make the most of it suggest joe that be right agree blake they have not yet give the spaniard a definite answer regard he join they it do not matter -- the haste young gentleman mr alcando have say with a smile that show he white tooth in strong contrast to he dark complexion i be not in so much of a haste as we say in my country there be always mañana -- to-morrow blake and joe while they find the spaniard very pleasant could not truthfully say that they feel for he the comradeship they might have manifest toward one of they own nationality he be polite and considerate toward they -- almost too polite at time but that come natural to he perhaps he be a little older than joe and blake but he do not take advantage of that he seem to have fully recover from the accident though there be a nervousness in he action at time that set the boy to wonder and occasionally blake or joe would catch he surreptitiously look at they in a strange manner i wonder what be up say blake to joe after one of those occasion he sure do act queer that be what i say agree joe it be just as though he be sorry he have to be under obligation to we if you can call it that for save he life that be how it impress I but perhaps we only imagine it hello here come mr baker with the mail we ought to hear from new york have not birdie lee write yet ask joe oh drop that warn blake he eye flash there be a letter from mr hadley in which he convey news and information that make blake and joe definitely decide to make the trip to panama and take alcando with we ask joe i suppose so say blake though it could not be say that he assent be any too cordial then we would better tell he so he 'll know it be settle all right we can ride over on the motor cycle a little later after a quick trip on the gasoline bicycle the move picture boy be at the only hotel of which central fall boast mr alcando be in he room the clerk inform the boy and they be show up enter call the voice of the spaniard as they knock ah it be you my young friend he cry as he see they and get up hastily from a table on which be many papers he begin hastily pile book on top of they for all the world say joe later as though he be afraid we would see something i be delighted that you have call the spaniard say and i hope you bring I good news yes say blake we be go -- as he speak there come in through the window a puff of air that scatter the papers on the table one seemingly part of a letter be blow to blake 's foot he pick it up and as he hand it back to mr alcando the lad could not help see part of a sentence it read : go to panama get all the picture you can especially the big gun blake feel himself stare eagerly at the last word chapter vii in new york ah my letter have take unto themselves wing laugh the spaniard as he stoop to pick up the scatter papers and you have assist I in save they he go on as he take the part of the epistle blake hold out to he as he do so mr alcando himself have a glimpse of the word blake have think so strange the foreigner must have in a manner sense blake 's suspicion for he say quickly : that be what it be not to know you wonderful american language i myself have much struggle with it and so do my friend i have write to one of they say i expect to go to panama and he write in he poor english that he hope i do go and that i get all the picture i can especially big one he pause for a moment look at blake sharply the boy think then the spaniard go on : only unfortunately for he he do not yet know the difference between ` gun ' and ` one ' what he mean to say be that he hope i would get big picture -- big one you know and i hope i do i suppose you do take big move picture -- i mean picture of big scene do you not and he include joe in the question he ask oh yes we have take some pretty big one blake 's chum admit as he think of the time when they have so recently be in the flood mississippus valley and when they have risk danger and death in the jungle and in earthquake land though i suppose go on mr alcando as he fold the part of a letter blake have pick up i suppose there be big gun at panama -- if one could get picture of they -- eh and again he look sharply at blake -- for what reason we hero could not determine oh yes there be big gun down there say joe i forget they size and how far they can hurl a projectile but we be not likely to get a chance to take any picture move or otherwise of the defens i fancy they be a sort of government secret i should think so speak blake and there be a curious restraint in he manner at which joe wonder yes we probably will not get much chance to see the big gun go on the spaniard but i be content if i learn how to become a move picture operator i shall write to my friend and tell he the difference between the word ` one ' and ` gun ' he will laugh when he find out he mistake will he not and he glance at blake probably be the answer blake be do some hard thinking just then but so you have decide to go to the canal ask the spaniard when he have collect he scattered papers yes we be go down there answer blake and as mr hadley wish you to go along of course we 'll take you with we and teach you all we know i hope i shall not be a burden to you or cause you any trouble respond the spaniard politely with a frank and engaging smile oh no not at all return joe cordially he have take quite a liking to the chap and anticipated pleasure in he company usually when he and blake go off on move picture excursion they have some member of the film theatrical company with they or they meet friend on the way or at they destination but neither cc piper nor any of the other actor be go to the canal so blake and joe would have have to go alone have it not be for the advent of mr alcando we be very glad to have you with we add blake how soon can you be ready to go whenever you be i can leave to-day if necessary there be not any necessity for such a rush as that blake say with a laugh we 'll finish out we week 's vacation and then go to new york we camera will need overhaul after the hard service they get in the flood and we 'll have to stay in new york about a week to get thing in shape so we 'll probably start for the canal in about two week that will suit I excellently i shall be all ready for you say the spaniard then i 'll write to mr hadley to expect we blake add the boy leave mr alcando straighten out he papers and start back through the town to the farm what make you act so funny blake when you pick up that piece of paper ask joe when they have alight from they motor cycle at the baker homestead a little later well to tell you the truth joe i be a bit suspicious what about that gun business yes and blake 's voice be serious buttermilk and corn cake cry joe with a laugh you do not mean to say you think this fellow be a international spy do you try to get secret of the united state fortification at the canal well i do not know as i exactly believe _ that _ joe and yet it be strange someone should be write to he about the big gun yes maybe but then he explain it all right you mean he _ try _ to explain it oh well if you look at it that way of course you 'll be suspicious but i do not believe anything of the sort it be just a blunder of someone who do not know how try to write the english language it be all nonsense to think he be a spy he come to mr hadley well recommend and you can make up you mind mr hadley would not have anything to do with he if there be something wrong oh well i do not exactly say he be a _ spy _ return blake almost waver let it go maybe i be wrong yes i think you be say joe i like that chap and i think we 'll have fine time together we 'll have hard work that be one thing sure blake declare it be not go to be easy to get good picture of the big ditch and wait for one of those culebra cut slide be go to be like camping on the trail of a volcano i think you can not tell when it be go to happen that be right agree joe with a laugh well we 'll do the best we can old man and now let 's go on a picnic or something to finish out we vacation we will not get another this year perhaps let 's go down and see how they be come on with the new bridge where the horse try to jump over the ravine suggest blake and a little later they be speed in that direction the final week of they stay in the country go by quickly enough and though the boy appreciate they vacation in the quiet precinct of central fall they be not altogether sorry when the time come to leave for truth to tell they be very enthusiastic about they move picture work and though they be no fonder of a grind than any real boy be they be always ready to go back to the click crank that unwind the strip of celluloid film which catch on its sensitive surface the impression of so many wonderful scene they call at the hotel one evening to tell mr alcando that they be go to new york the follow day and that he could if he wish accompany they but they find he have already leave he have write they a note however in which he say he would meet they in the metropolis at the office of the move picture concern and there complete plan for the trip to panama queer he do not want to go in to new york with we say blake there you go again laugh joe get suspicious again take it easy blake well maybe i be a bit too fussy admit he chum they trip to and arrival in new york be unattended by any incident worth chronicle and take a car at the grand central terminal they be soon on they way to the film studio well well if it be not blake and joe cry cc piper the grouchy actor as he see they come in my but i be glad to see you and he shake they hand warmly glad something please you say miss shay with a shrug of she shoulder you have do nothing but growl ever since this rehearsal start blake and joe have arrive during a intermission in the taking of the studio scene of a new drama be he as bad as ever ask joe of mabel pierce the new member of the company well i do not know he very well she say with a little blush he be worse declare nettie shay i wish you would take he out somewhere boy and find he a good nature he be a positive bear oh come now not as bad as that cry mr piper i be glad to see you boy though and really he seem quite delighted what be on he ask be you go with we to californium we be go to do a series of stunt there i hear sorry but we be not book to go say blake i guess it be panama and the canal for we mr piper seem to undergo a quick and curious change he face that have be light by a genial smile become dull and careworn he manner lose its joyousness that be too bad he exclaim panama you be almost sure to be bury alive under one of the big culebra slide and we 'll never see you again chapter viii off for panama there be a moment of silence follow mr piper 's gloomy prediction and then miss shay with a laugh cry out : oh what a shame i would keep still if i could not say anything nicer than _ that _ not very cheerful be he speak joe about the same as usual comment blake drily well it be true just the same declare cc piper with a air of conviction ` the truth be not to be speak -- at all time ' quote miss pierce good for you whisper joe cc seem a little put out at all the criticism level at he ahem he exclaim of course i do not mean that i want to see you boy catch in a landslide -- far from it but -- but if we _ be _ go to be catch that way you hope there will be move picture of it do not you cc laugh blake now there be no use try to get out of it he add as the gloomy actor stutter and stammer we know what you mean but where be mr ringold or mr hadley they be around somewhere explain miss shay when the other member of the company with whom they have spend so many happy and exciting day have offer they greeting be you in such a hurry to see they she ask of blake oh not in such a _ awful _ hurry he answer with a laugh as birdie lee come out of a dress room smile rosily at he i guess not laugh miss shay soon the interval between the scene of the drama then be film or photograph come to a end the actor and actress take they place in a ball room that be build on one section of the studio floor ready call the manager to the camera operator and as the music of a unseen orchestra play so that the dancing might be in perfect time the camera begin click and the action of the play which include a exciting episode in the midst of the dance go on it be a gay scene for the lady and gentleman be dress in the height of fashion it be necessary to have every detail faithfully reproduce for the eye of the move picture camera be more search and far-seeing than any human eye and record every defect no matter how small and when it be recall that the picture throw on the screen be magnify many hundred time a small defect as can readily be understand become a very large one so great care be take to have everything as nearly perfect as possible blake and joe watch the film of the drama recall the time when they use to turn the handle of the camera at the same work before they be choose to go out after bigger picture -- scene from real life the operator a young fellow whom both blake and joe know look around and nod at they when he have to stop grind out the film a moment to allow the director to correct something that have unexpectedly go wrong do not you wish you have this easy job the operator ask we may before we come back from panama answer blake a little later mr ringold and mr hadley come in greet the two boy and then begin a talk which last for some time and in which all the detail of the project work as far as they could be arrange in advance be go over what we want say mr hadley be a series of picture about the canal it will soon be open for regular traffic you know and in fact some vessel have already go through it but the work be not yet finish and we want you to film the final touch then too there may be accident -- there have be several small one of late and as i write you a man who claim to have make a study of the natural force in panama declare a big slide be due soon of course we will not wish the canal any bad luck and we do not for a moment want that slide to happen only -- if it do come you want it film interrupted blake with a laugh that be it exactly exclaim mr ringold you 'll find plenty down there to take picture of say mr hadley we want scene along the canal hire a vessel and take move picture as you go along in she go through the gatun lock of course scene as you boat go in they and the water rise and then go down again ought to make a cork picture mr hadley be grow enthusiastic get some jungle scene to work in also he direct in short get scene you think a visitor to the panama canal would be interested in see some of the film will be a feature at the panama exposition in californium and we expect to make big money from they so do you best we will promise joe and blake nod in acquiescence you meet the young spaniard who have a letter of introduction to you do you not ask mr hadley after a pause yes answer blake meet he under rather queer circumstance too i guess we hint at they in we letter a mere mention respond mr hadley i should be glad to hear the detail so blake and joe in turn tell of the runaway what do you think of he -- i mean mr alcando ask the move picture man why he seem all right speak joe slowly look at blake to give he a chance to say anything if he want to i like he glad to hear it exclaim mr hadley heartily he come to we well recommend and as i think i explain we company be under obligation to concern he and he friend be interested in so we be glad to do he a favor he explain do he not that he company wish to show scene along the line of they railroad to attract prospective customer yes he tell we that observe joe what be the matter blake have not you anything to say asked mr hadley in a curious voice turn to joe 's chum how do the spaniard strike you well he seem all right be blake 's slow answer only i think -- blake think he be a international spy i guess break in joe with a laugh tell he about the ` big gun ' blake what be that ask mr hadley quickly whereupon blake tell of the wind-blown letter and he first suspicion oh that be all nonsense laugh mr hadley we have investigate he credentials and find they all right besides what object would a south american spy have in find out detail of the defens at panama south america would work to preserve the canal not to destroy it if it be some european nation now that would be a different story you do not need to worry blake no i suppose it be foolish but i be glad to know you think mr alcando all right if we have get to live in close companionship with he for several month it be a comfort to know he be all right now when be we to start how do we go where shall we make we headquarters and so on yes you will want some detailed information i expect agree the move picture man well i be ready to give it to you i have already make some arrangement for you you will take a steamer to colon make you headquarters at the washington hotel and from there start out when you be ready to get picture of the canal and surround country i 'll give you letter of introduction so you will have no trouble in charter a tug to go through the canal and i already have the necessary government permit then joe and i have better be pack up for the trip suggest blake yes the sooner the better you might call on mr alcando and ask he when he will be ready here be he address in new york and mr hadley hand blake a card name a certain uptown hotel a little later have see to they baggage and hand they particular and favorite camera over to one of the man of the film company so that he might give they a thorough overhaul blake and joe go to call on they spanish friend be not you glad to know he be not a spy or anything like that ask joe of he chum yes of course i be and yet -- still suspicious i see laugh joe better drop it blake do not answer inquiry of the hotel clerk give blake and joe the information that mr alcando be in he room and be show to the apartment by a bell-boy blake knock on the door who be there wait a moment come in rather sharp accent from a voice the move picture boy recognize as that of mr alcando it be blake stewart and joe duncan say the former lad we have call -- i beg you pardon -- in one moment i shall be with you -- i will let you in exclaim the spaniard the boy could hear he move about in he apartment they could hear the rattle of papers and then the door be open there be no one in the room except the young south american railroad man but there be the odor of a strong cigar in the apartment and blake notice this with surprise for some time before mr alcando have say he do not smoke the inference be then that he have have a visitor who be smoking when the boy knock but there be no sign of the caller then except in the aroma of the cigar he might have go into one of the other room that open from the one into which the boy look for mr alcando have a suite in the hotel and after all it be none of the affair of blake or joe if they new friend have have a caller only say blake to joe afterward why be he in such a hurry to get rid of he and afraid that we might meet he i do not know joe answer it do not worry I you be too suspicious i suppose i be mr alcando welcome the boy but say nothing about the delay in open he door or about the visitor who must have slip out hastily the spaniard be glad to see blake and joe and glad to learn that they would soon start for panama i have much to do though in what little time be leave he say rapidly arrange some papers on he table as he do so blake catch sight of a small box with some peculiar metal projection on it stick out from amid a pile of papers yes much to do go on mr alcando and then either by accident or design he shove some papers in such a way that the small box be completely hide we have just come from mr hadley explain joe and then he and blake plunge into a mass of detail regard they trip with which i need not weary you sufficient to say that mr alcando promise to be on hand at the time of the sailing of the steamer for colon in due time though a day or so later than originally plan blake and joe with they new spanish friend be on hand at the pier mr alcando have considerable baggage and he be to be allow the use of a old move picture camera with which to get he hand in blake and joe of course have they own machine which have be put in perfect order there be several of they for different class of work final instruction be give by mr hadley good-by be say and the boy and mr alcando go aboard i hope you have good luck call birdie lee to blake as she wave she hand to he and so do i add mabel pierce to joe thanks they make answer in a chorus and -- look -- out -- for -- the -- big slide call mr piper after they as the steamer swing away from the pier gloomy to the last laugh blake so they be off for panama little dream of the sensational adventure that await they there chapter ix the little box blake and joe be too well-seasoned traveler to care to witness many of the scene attendant upon the departure of they vessel though young in year they have already crowd into they life so many thrilling adventure that it take something out of the ordinary to arouse they interest it be not that they be blasé or indifferent to novel sight but travel be now with they a old story they have be out west to the pacific coast and in far-off jungle land to say nothing of they trip to the place of the earthquake and the more recent trip to the flood mississippus valley so once they have wave good-by to they friend and fellow-worker on the pier they go to they stateroom to look after they luggage the two boy and mr alcando have a room ample for they need and though it would accommodate four they be assure that the fourth berth would not be occupy so no stranger would intrude when blake and joe go below mr alcando do not follow either he like the open air to be find on deck or he be not such a veteran traveler as to care to miss the sight and sound of departure he baggage be pile in one corner and that of the boy in other part of the stateroom with the exception of the trunk and camera which be stow in the hold as not be want on the voyage well what do you think of he now ask joe as he sit down for both he and blake be tire there have be much to do that day why he seem all right be the slowly-given answer nothing more suspicious eh no i can not say that i have see anything of course it be queer for he to have someone in he room that time and to get rid of whoever it be so quickly before we come in but i suppose we all have we secret yes agree joe and he certainly can not do enough for we he be very grateful this be show in every way possible by the spaniard more than once he refer to the saving of he life in the runaway accident and he never tire of tell those whom he meet what the boy have do for he it be truly grateful praise too and he be sincere in all that he say as joe have remark the spaniard could not do enough for the boy he help in numberless way in get ready for the trip and offer to do errand that could better be attend to by a messenger boy he be well supply with cash and it be all joe and blake could do to prevent he from buy they all sort of article for use on they trip pass a sport goods store that make a specialty of fitting out traveler who hunt in the wild mr alcando want to purchase for blake and joe complete camping outfit portable stove gun knife patent acetylene lamp portable tent automatic revolver and all sort of thing but we do not need they thank you blake insist we be not go to do any hunting and we will not camp out if we can help it oh but we might have to say mr alcando then think how useful these outfit would be but we would have to cart they around with we for month maybe say joe on the slim chance of use part of the thing one night we do not need 'em but i want to do something for you boy the spaniard insist i be so grateful to you -- we know that by this time declare blake please do not get anything more for they friend have already buy they some thing for they steamer trip ah well then if you insist agree the generous one but if ever you come to my country all that i own be yours i be ever in you debt oh you must not feel that way about it blake assure he after all you might have save yourself hardly return the spaniard and he shudder as he recall how near he have be to death on the bridge but now he and blake and joe be safely on a steamer on they way to panama the weather be get rather cool for though it be only early November the chill of winter be begin to make itself feel but we 'll soon be where it be warm enough all the year around say joe to blake as they arrange they thing in the stateroom that be right say he chum it will be a new experience for we not quite so much jungle i hope as the dose we have of it when we go after the wild animal no and i be glad of it respond joe that be a little too much at time yet there be plenty of jungle in panama i suppose so well suppose we go up on deck for a breath of air they have take a steamer that go directly to colon making but one stop at san juan porto rico a number of tourist be aboard and there be one or two personally conduct party so the vessel be rather lively with so many young people in the day that follow joe and blake make the acquaintance of a number of person in whom they be more or less interested when it become know that the boy be move picture operator the interest in they increase and one lively young lady want blake to get out he camera and take some move picture of the ship 's company but he explain that though he might take the picture on board the steamer he have no facility for develop or print the positive or project they after they be make in the previous book of this series be describe in detail the mechanical process of how move picture be make and to those volume curious reader be refer the process be a intricate one though much simplify from what it be at first and it be well worth study on and on sweep the _ gatun _ carry we friend to the wonderland of that great ditch which have become one of the marvel of the world occasionally there be storm to interrupt the otherwise placid voyage but there be only short discomfort mr alcando be eager to reach the scene of operation and after he first enthusiasm concern the voyage have worn off he insist on talk about the detailed and technical part of move picture work to joe and blake who be glad to give he the benefit of they information well you have not see anything more suspicious about he have you ask joe of he chum when they be together in the stateroom one evening the spaniard be on deck no i can not say that i have i guess i do let my imagination run away with I but say joe what sort of a watch have you that tick so loudly watch that be not my watch exclaim he chum listen order blake do not you hear a tick they both stand at attention i do hear something like a clock admit joe but i do not see any i do not know there be one in this stateroom there be not either say joe with a glance about but i surely do hear something maybe it be you own watch work overtime mine do not tick as loud as that and blake pull out he timepiece even with it out of he pocket the beat of the balance wheel could not be hear until one hold it to he ear but what be it ask joe curiously it seem to come from mr alcando 's baggage blake say yes it be in he berth he go on move toward that side of the stateroom the nearer he advance toward the sleep place of the spaniard the louder become the tick he be get some sort of a clock in he bed blake go on he may have one of those cheap watch though it be not like he to buy that kind maybe he put it under he pillow and forget to take it out perhaps i would better move it or he may not think it be there and toss it out on the floor but when he lift the pillow no watch be to be see that be funny say blake musingly i surely hear that tick in this berth do not you yes assent joe maybe it be mix up in the bedclothes before blake could interfere joe have turn back the covering and there near the foot of the berth between the sheet be a small brass-bound box contain a number of metal projection it be from this box the tick sound come why -- why gasp blake that -- that box -- what about it ask joe wonderingly that be the same box that be on he table the time we come in he room at the hotel -- when we smell the cigar smoke i wonder what it be and why he have it in he bed chapter x the secret conference blake be silent a moment after make this portentous announcement then he lean forward with the evident intention of pick up the curious ticking box look out cry joe grasp he chum 's hand what for blake want to know it might be load -- go off you know nonsense exclaimed blake it be probably only some sort of foreign alarm clock and he stuff it in there so the tick would not keep he awake i have do the same thing when i do not want to get up i use to chuck mine under the bed or stuff it in a old shoe what be the matter with you anyhow you act scare for joe 's face be actually white -- that be as white as it could be under the tan cause by he outdoor life well i -- i think stammer joe perhaps that be a -- who be get suspicious now demand blake with a laugh talk about I why you be way ahead oh well i guess i do imagine too much admit joe with a little laugh it probably be a alarm clock as you say i wonder what we would better do with it if we leave it there -- he be interrupt by the opening of the stateroom door and as both boy turn they see they spanish friend standing on the threshold stare at they well he exclaim and there be a angry note in he voice -- a note the boy have never before notice for mr alcando be of a sunny and happy disposition and not nearly as quick temper as person of he nationality be suppose to be i suppose it do look as though we be rummage in you thing say blake decide instantly that it be best to be frank but we hear a curious tick noise when we come down here and we trace it to you bunk we do not know what it might be and think perhaps you have put you watch in the bed and might have forget to take it out we look and find this -- ah my new alarm clock exclaim mr alcando and what seem to be a look of relief pass over he face he reach in among the bed clothes and pick up the curious brass-bound ticking box with its many little metallic projection i perhaps do not tell you that i be a sort of inventor the spaniard go on i have not have much success but i think my new alarm clock be go to bring I in some money it work on a new principle but i be give it a good test privately before i try to put it on the market he take the brass-bound ticking box from the bed and must have adjust the mechanism in a way blake or joe do not notice for the click-click stop at once and the room seem curiously still after it some day i will show you how it work the young spaniard go on i think myself it be quite what you call -- clever and with that he put the box in a trunk and close the lid with a snap that throw the lock and now boy we will soon be there he cry with a gay laugh soon we will be in the beautiful land of panama and will see the marvel of that great canal be you not glad and i shall begin to learn more about make move picture that will please I though i hope i shall not be so stupid a pupil as to make trouble for you my friend to whom i owe so much he look eagerly at the boy we 'll teach you all we know which be not such a awful lot say joe and i do not believe you 'll be slow you have pick up some of it already go on blake for while delay over make they arrangement in new york the boy and they pupil have go into the rudiment of move picture work i be glad you think so return the other i shall be glad when we be at work and more glad still when i can with my own camera penetrate into the fastness of the jungle along the line of we railroad and show what we have do to bring civilization there the film will be the eye of the world watch we progress he add poetically why do not you come up on deck he proceed it be warm down here we just come down say joe but it be hot for they be approach nearer to the equator each hour while the boy be follow the young spaniard up on deck joe find a chance to whisper to blake : i notice he be not at all anxious to show we how he brass-box alarm clock work no agree blake in a low voice and yet he invention might be in such a shape that he do not want to exhibit it yet so you think that be the reason eh surely do not you i do not what then well i think he be try to -- hush here he come caution blake for they friend at that moment come back from a stroll along the forward deck but if joe be really suspicious of the young spaniard nothing that occur in the next few day serve to develop that suspicion no reference be make to the odd alarm clock which be not hear to tick again nor be it in evidence either in mr alcando 's bed or elsewhere what be you go to say it be that time when i stop you ask blake of he chum one day i be go to say i think it might be some sort of a improvement on a move picture camera joe answer this may be only a bluff of he -- want to learn how to take move picture he may know how all along and only be work on a certain improvement that he can not perfect until he get just the right condition that be what i think well you think wrong declare blake as for he know something about the picture now why he do not even know how to thread the film into the camera oh well maybe i be wrong admit joe day succeed day until in due time after they stop at san juan where the boy go ashore for a brief visit the steamer drop anchor in the excellent harbor of colon at the atlantic end of the great panama canal a storm be impend as the ship make she way up the harbor but as the boy and the other passenger look at the great break-water construct to be one of the protection to the canal they realize what a stupendous undertake the work be and they know that no storm could affect they now they be within the colon harbor well we be here at last exclaimed joe as he look over the side and notice many vessel lie about most of they connect in some manner with the canal construction yes and now for some move picture -- at least within a day or so go on blake i be tired of do nothing at last we be at panama and i shall soon be with you take picture cry the spaniard how long do you think it will be before i can take some view myself he ask eagerly oh within a week or so we 'll trust you with a camera say blake that be if you can spare time from you alarm clock invention add joe with a curious glance at he chum but if mr alcando feel any suspicion at the word he do not betray himself he smile genially make some of he rapid latin gesture and exclaim : oh the clock he be safe asleep and will be while i be here i work only on move picture now in due season blake joe and mr alcando find themselves quarter in the pleasant washington hotel build by the panama railroad for the government where they find transport to a southern clime most of the luxury demand by people of the north well this be something like live exclaimed blake as they baggage and move picture camera and accessory have be put away they sit on the veranda and watch breaker after breaker sweep in from the caribbean sea the only trouble be we will not be here long enough complain joe as he sip a cooling lime drink for the weather be quite warm we 'll have to leave it and take to the canal or the jungle to say nothing of stand up to we knee in dirt take slide do you -- er -- really have to get very close to get picture of the big slide ask mr alcando rather nervously blake think the nearer the better joe reply remember that time blake when we be film the volcano and the ground open right at you foot i should say i do remember it say blake some picture that where be this ask the spaniard in earthquake land there be _ some _ time there ha do not think to scare I cry they pupil with a frank laugh i say i be go to learn move picture and i be -- slide or no slide oh we be not try to ` josh ' you declare blake we 'll all have to run some chance but it be all in the day 's work and after all it be no more risky than go to war no i suppose not laugh they pupil well when do we start as soon as we can arrange for the government tug to take we along the canal answer blake we 'll have to go in one of the united state vessel as the canal be not officially open yet we 'll have to make some inquiry and present we letter of introduction if we get start with the film inside of a week we 'll be do well the week they have to wait until they plan be complete be a pleasant one they live well at the hotel and mr alcando meet some spaniard and other person whom he know and to whom he introduce the boy finally the use of the tug be secure camera be load with the reel of sensitive film other reel in they light-tight metal box be pack for transportation and shipping case so that the expose reel could be send to the film company in new york for develop and print be take along not only be blake and joe without facility for develop the film they take but it be very hard to make negative in hot country if you have ever try to develop picture on a hot day without a ice water bath you can understand this and there be just then little ice to be have for such work as photography though some might have be obtain for a emergency blake and joe be only to make the exposure the developing and printing could better be do in new york well we 'll start up the canal to-morrow say blake to joe on the evening of they last day in colon yes and i 'll be glad of it remark joe it be nice enough here at this hotel but i want to get busy so do i confess he chum they be to make the entire trip through the canal as guest of uncle sam the government have accede to mr hadley 's request as the complete film be to form part of the official exhibit at the exposition in californium later on whew but it _ be _ hot exclaimed joe after he and blake have look over they possession to make sure they be forget nothing for they trip next day yes agree blake let 's go out on the balcony for a breath of air they room open on a small balcony which face the beach mr alcando have a room two or three apartment farther along the corridor and he too have a small balcony attach as blake and joe go out on theirs they see in the faint light of a crescent and much-clouded moon two figure on the balcony opening from the spaniard 's room he have company say joe in a low voice yes agree blake i wonder who it be he say all of he friend have leave the hotel he must have meet some new one it be very still that night the only sound be the low boom and hiss of the surf as it rush up the beach and gradually to joe and blake come the murmur of voice from the spaniard 's balcony at first they be low and it seem to the boy though neither express the thought that the conference be a secret one then clearly across the intervene space come the word : be you sure the machine work right perfectly be the answer in mr alcando 's tone i have give it every test then the voice again sink to a low murmur chapter xi along the canal blake do you hear that ask joe after a pause during which he and he chum could hear the low buzz of conversation from the other balcony yes i hear it what of it well nothing that i know of and yet -- yet you be more suspicious than i be break in blake i do not see why i hardly know myself admit joe yet somehow that tick box and what you see in that letter -- oh nonsense interrupted blake do not imagine too much you think that curious box be some attachment for a move picture camera do you well it might be and -- and you be afraid he will get ahead of you in you invention of a focus tube be not you continue blake not give he companion a chance to finish what he start to say for joe have recently happen to hit on a new idea of a focus tube for a move picture camera and have apply for a patent on it but there be some complication and he papers have not yet be grant he be in fear lest someone would be grant a similar patent before he receive he oh i do not know as i be afraid of that joe answer slowly well it must be that -- or something insist blake you hear alcando and someone else talk about a machine and you at once jump to the conclusion that it be a camera no i do not exclaim joe he do not continue the conversation along that line but he be do some hard thinking later that evening when mr alcando call at the room of the two chum to bid they goodnight he make no mention of he visitor on the balcony nor do blake or joe question he and we start up the canal in the morning ask the spaniard yes and we 'll make the first picture go through the gatun lock decide blake good i be anxious to try my hand say they pupil with they baggage valise trunk camera box of undeveloped film other box to hold the expose reel of sensitive celluloid and many other thing the move picture boy and mr alcando go aboard the government tug _ nama _ the next morning with the exception of some army engineer make a trip of inspection they be the only passenger well be you all ready boy ask the captain for he have be instruct by he superior to show every courtesy and attention to we hero in a sense they be work for uncle sam all ready answer blake then we 'll start be the reply i guess -- oh one moment i beg of you cry mr alcando i see a friend come with a message to I and he point along the pier where the tug be tie come on the run be a man who bear every appearance of be a spaniard you be late complain mr alcando as the runner hand he a letter you almost delay my good friend the captain of this tug i could not help it be the answer i do not receive it myself until a few minute ago it come by cable so you be off we be off answer mr alcando then the other speak in spanish and later on blake who undertake the study of that language so as to make himself understand in a few simple phrase know what it be that the two man say for the runner ask : you will not fail we i will not fail -- if i have to sacrifice myself be the answer of mr alcando and then with a wave of he hand the other go back up the pier all right again ask captain watson all right my dear sir i be sorry to have delay you answer mr alcando with more than he usual politeness a little delay do not matter i be at you service the commander say well now we 'll start if either blake or joe feel any surprise over the hurry visit at the last minute of mr alcando 's friend they say nothing to each other about it besides they have other matter to think of just then since now they real move picture work be about to begin in a short time they be move away from the pier up the harbor and toward the wonderful lock and dam that form the amazing feature -lrb- aside from the culebra cut -rrb- of the great canal better get we camera ready have not we blake suggest joe i think so agree he chum now mr alcando if you want to pick up any point you can watch we a little later we 'll let you grind the crank yourself i might explain briefly that move picture be take not by press a switch or a rubber bulb such as that which work a camera shutter but by the continuous action of a crank or handle attach to the camera press a bulb do well enough for take a single picture but when a series on a long celluloid strip be need as in the case for the movie a entirely different arrangement become absolutely necessary the sensitive celluloid film must move continuously in a somewhat jerky fashion inside the dark light-tight camera and behind the lens as each picture show some particular motion be take the film halt for the briefest space of time and then go on to be wind up in the box and a new portion bring before the lens for exposure all this the crank do automatically open and close the shutter move the film and all that be necessary i wish i have space not only to tell you more of how move picture be make but much about the panama canal as to the former -- the picture -- in other book of this series i have do my best to give you a brief account of that wonderful industry now as to the canal -- it be such a vast undertaking and subject that only in a great volume could i hope to do it justice and in a story -lrb- such as this be intend to be -rrb- i be afraid you would think i be try to give you pretty dry reading if i give you too many fact and figure of course many of you have read of the canal in the newspaper -- the controversy over the choice of the route the discussion as to whether a sea level or a lock canal be best and many other point especially whether the gatun dam would be able to hold back the water of the chagre river with all that i have nothing to do in this book but i hope you will pardon just a little reference to the canal especially the lock feature since joe and blake have a part in at least film those wonderful structure you know there be two kind of canal those on the level which be merely big over-grown ditch and those which have to go over hill and through low valley there be two way of get a canal over a hill one be to build it and let the water in to the foot of the hill and then to raise vessel over the crest of the hill and down the other side to where the canal again start by means of inclined plane or marine railway the other method be by lock as they be call that be there be build a series of basin with powerful water-tight gate divide they boy who live along canal well know how lock work a boat come along until it reach the place where the lock be it be float into a basin or section of the waterway and a gate be close behind it then from that part of the canal which be higher than that part where the boat then be water be admit into the basin until the boat rise to the level of the higher part of the canal then the higher gate be open and the vessel float out on the higher level it go up hill so to speak by reverse the process it can also go down hill of course there must be heavy gate to prevent the higher level water from rush into those of the lower level some part of the panama canal be eighty-five foot higher than other part in other word a vessel enter the canal at colon on the atlantic side of the isthmus must rise eighty-five foot to get to the level of gatun lake which form a large part of the canal then when the pacific end be approach the vessel must go down eighty-five foot again first in one step of thirty and a third foot and then in two step or lock aggregate fifty-four and two-third foot so you see the series of lock at either end of the great canal exactly balance one another the distance at each end be eighty-five foot it be just like go up stair at one end of a long board walk and down again at the other end only the step be of water and not wood the tug bearing blake joe and mr alcando be now steam over toward toro point break-water which i have before allude to this be build to make a good harbor at colon where violent storm often occur i want to get some picture of the breakwater blake have say since he and he chum be to present in reel a story of a complete trip through the canal and the breakwater be really the start point it extend out into the caribbean sea eleven thousand foot and you be take picture now ask mr alcando as blake and joe set up a camera in the bow of the boat that be what we be do come here and we 'll give you lesson number one invite blake click away at the handle i will gladly come exclaim the spaniard and soon he be deep in the mystery of the business there be not much delay at the breakwater as the boy be anxious to get to the canal proper and into the big lock a little later they tug be steam along the great ditch five hundred foot wide and over forty foot deep which lead directly to the lock this ditch or start of the canal proper be about seven mile long and at various point of interest along the way a series of move picture be take and so at last we be really on the panama canal cry joe as he help blake put in a fresh reel of unexposed film mr alcando look on and learn point that be what you be the captain inform they and just ahead of you be the lock now you 'll see something worth ` film ' as you call it chapter xii almost a accident what be that big long affair jut out so far from the lock ask blake when the tug have approach nearer that be the central pier the captain inform he it be a sort of guide wall to protect the lock you know there be three lock at this end or rather six two series of three each and each lock have several gate one great danger will be that powerful vessel may ram these gate and damage they and to prevent this very elaborate precaution be observe you 'll soon see we 'll have to tie up to this wall or we 'll run into the first protection which be a big steel chain you can see it just ahead there joe and blake who have get all the picture they want of the approach to the lock stop grind away at the handle of the camera long enough to look at the chain these chain for there be several of they each design to protect some lock gate consist of link make of steel three inch thick they stretch across the lock and any vessel that do not stop at the moment it should before reach this chain will ram its prow into it but i be not take any such chance captain watson inform the boy i do not want to be censure which might happen and i do not want to injure my boat what would happen if you do hit the chain ask blake they have start off again after the necessary permission to enter the lock have be signal to they once more blake and joe be take picture show the chain in position well if i happen to be in command of a big vessel say the size of the _ olympic _ and i hit the chain at a speed of a mile and a half a hour and i have a full load on the chain would stop I within about seventy foot and prevent I from ram the lock gate but how do it do it ask joe by means of machinery the captain inform he each end of the chain fender go about a drum which wind and unwind by hydraulic power once a ship hit the chain its speed will gradually slacken but it take a pressure of one hundred ton to make the chain begin to yield then it will stand a pressure up to over two hundred and fifty ton before it will break but before that happen the vessel will have stop but we be not go to strike the chain i take it put in mr alcando indeed we be not the captain assure he there it be be lower now as he speak the boy see the immense steel-linked fender sink down below the surface of the water where do it go ask blake it sink down in a groove in the bottom of the lock the captain explain it take about one minute to lower the chain and as long to raise it well i have get that blake exclaim as the handle of he camera cease click he have sufficient view of the giant fender as the tug go on captain watson explain to the boy that even though a vessel should manage to break the chain which be almost beyond the bound of possibility there be the first or safety gate of the lock and though a vessel might crash through the chain and also the first gate owe to failure to stop in the lock there would be a second gate which would almost certainly bring the craft to a stop but even the most remote possibility have be think of by the maker of the great canal and should all the lock-gate be tear away and the impound water of gatun lake start to rush out there be emergency dam that can be put into place to stop the flood these emergency dam can be swing into place in two minute by means of electrical machinery but should that fail they can be put into place by hand in about thirty minute so you see the canal be pretty well protected remark captain watson as he prepare to send he tug across the place where the chain have be and so into the first of the three lock basin say this be great cry blake as he look at the concrete wall tower above he they be moist for a vessel have recently come through now the tug no longer move under she own steam nor have it be since come alongside the wall of the central pier for all vessel must be tow through the lock basin and tow not by other craft but by electric locomotive that run alongside on the top of the concrete wall two of these locomotive be attach to the bow of the tug and two to the stern but those at the stern be not for pull as joe at first suppose for he say : why those locomotive in back be make fast to we with wire hawser i do not see how they can push with those they be not go to explain captain watson those in the stern be for hold back to provide for a emergency in case those in front pull we too fast those who build the canal seem to have think of everything speak blake with much enthusiasm you 'll think so after you have see some more of the wonder the tug captain go on with a smile better get you camera ready he advise they 'll be open and close the gate for we now and that ought to make good picture especially when we be close in the lock and water begin to enter how do it come in ask joe over the top no indeed they do not use the waterfall effect answer blake who have be read a book about the canal it come in from the bottom do not it captain watson yes through valve that be open and close by electricity in fact everything about the lock be do by electricity though in case of emergency hand power can be use the water fill the lock through opening in the floor and the water itself come from gatun lake there the gate be open the boy see what seem to be two solid wall of steel slowly separate by a unseen power as the leaf of a book might open in fact the gate of the lock be call leave slowly they swing back out of the way into depression in the side wall of the lock make to receive they here we go cry the captain the tug begin to move slowly under the pull of the electric locomotive on the concrete wall above they start you camera boy blake and joe need no urge already the handle be click and thousand of picture show a boat actually go through the lock of the panama canal be be take on the long strip of sensitive film oh it be wonderful exclaimed mr alcando do you think -- i mean would it be possible for I to -- to take some picture of course exclaim blake generously here grind this crank a while i be tire the spaniard have be give some practice in use a move picture camera and he know about at what speed to turn the handle for the move picture must be take at just a certain speed and reproduce on the screen at the same rate or the vision produce be grotesque person and animal seem to run instead of walk but the new pupil with a little coaching from blake do very well now the gate will be close say the tug captain and the water will come in to raise we to the level of the next higher lock we have to go through this process three time at this end of the canal and three time at the other watch they let in the water the big gate be not yet fully close when something happen that nearly put a end to the trip of the move picture boy to panama for suddenly they tug instead of move forward toward the front end of the lock begin go backward toward the slowly-closing lock gate what be up cry blake we be go backward shout joe yes the stern locomotive be pull we back and the front one seem to have let go captain watson say we 'll be between the lock gate in another minute hello up there he yell look toward the top of the lock wall what be the matter slowly the tug approach the closing lock gate if she once get between they move as they be she would be crush like a eggshell and it seem that no power on earth could stop the movement of those great steel leave this be terrible cry mr alcando i do not count on this in learn to make move picture you 'll be in tighter place than this say blake as he think in a flash of the danger he and joe have run what 'll we do ask joe with a glance at he chum look as though we would have to swim for it if the boat be smash say blake who remain calm it will not be hard to do that this be like a big swimming tank anyhow but if they let the other water in -- he do not finish but they know what he mean slowly and irresistibly the great lock gate be close and now the tug have almost be pull back between they she seem likely to be crush to splinter chapter xiii in the jungle what will we do with the camera blake the film too they will all be spoil -- we have not enough waterproof case cry joe to he chum as the boat through some accident or failure back nearer and nearer to the closing steel gate will we really have to jump overboard ask the spaniard i be not a very excellent swimmer but blake at whom these question seem direct do not have to answer they for after a series of confused shout on the top of the concrete wall above they the movement of the boat as well as the slow motion of the lock gate cease it be just in time for the rudder of the tug be not more than a few foot away from the jaw of steel you be all right now a man call down to those on the tug from the wall over they head something go wrong with the tow locomotive there be no more danger well i be glad to know that answer captain watson gruffly you might just as well kill a man as scare he to death what be the matter anyhow well all of we machinery be not work as smoothly as we 'll have it later the canal engineer explain some of we signal go wrong as you be be tow through and you go backward instead of forward then it take a minute or so to stop the lock gate but you be all right now and you 'll go on through blake and joe look at each other and smile in relief and mr alcando appear to breathe easier a little later the tug be again urge forward toward the front lock gate then the closing of those at she stern go on until the vessel be in a square steel and concrete basin -- or rather a rectangular one for it be longer than it be wide to lend itself to the shape of the vessel as blake have say it be like a big swimming tank now we 'll go up captain watson say you can not get any picture in here i suppose he add we can show the water bubble up as it fill the lock say blake water always make a pretty scene in move picture as it seem to move at just the right rate of speed we 'll take a short strip of film joe i guess the tug do not occupy a whole section of the lock for they be build to accommodate vessel a thousand foot long to economize time in fill up such a great tank as that would be the lock be subdivide by gate into small tank for small vessel it take just forty-six gate for all the lock explain captain watson while blake and joe be get they camera in position and the man at the lock be close certain water valve and open other each lock have two leaf or gate and they weight run anywhere from three hundred to six hundred ton accord to its position some of the gate be forty-seven foot high and other nearly twice that and each leaf be sixty-five foot wide and seven foot thick think of be crush between two steel gate of six hundred ton each eighty foot high sixty-five foot wide and seven foot thick observe joe i do not want to think of it laugh blake we be well out of that and he glance back toward the closed and water-tight lock gate which have so nearly nip the tug here come the water cry the captain there be a hissing and gurgling sound and million of bubble begin to show on the surface of the limpid fluid in which float the _ nama _ the water come in from below through the seventy opening in the floor of each lock be admit by means of pipe and culvert from the upper level as the water hiss boil and bubble while it flow in blake take move picture of it slowly the _ nama _ rise higher and higher she go until finally she be raise as high as that section of the lock would lift she she go up at the rate of two foot a minute though captain watson explain that when there be need of hurry the rate could be three foot a minute and we have two more lock to go through ask joe yes two more here at gatun and three at miraflore or rather there be one lock at pedro miguel where we go down thirty and a third foot and then we go a mile to reach the lock at miraflore there we shall have to go through two lock with a total drop of fifty-four and two-third foot captain watson explain the system be the same at each place the tug be now rest easily in the basin but some foot above the sea level blake and joe have take enough move picture of this phase of the canal since the next scene would be but a repetition of the process in the follow two lock that would lift the _ nama _ to the level of gatun lake but i tell you what we could do blake say to he chum what be that -- swim the rest of the way ask joe and have mr alcando make picture of we no we have have enough of water lately but we could get out on top of the lock wall and take picture of the tug go through the lock that would be different so it would cry joe we 'll do it they easily obtain permission to do this and soon with they camera and accompany by mr alcando they be on the concrete wall from that vantage point they watch the opening of the lock gate which admit the _ nama _ into the next basin there she be shut up by the closing of the gate behind she and raise to the second level the boy succeed in get some good picture at this point and other also when the tug be release from the third or final lock and steam out into gatun lake there be now before she thirty-two mile of clear water before reach miraflore better come aboard boy advise captain watson and i 'll take you around to gatun dam you 'll want view of that we sure will cry blake be not it all wonderful exclaimed joe who be deeply impress by all he see it be indeed agree the spaniard you nation be a powerful and great one it be a tremendous achievement aboard the tug they go around toward the great dam that be really the key to the panama canal for without this dam there would be no gatun lake which hold back the water of the chagre river make a big lake eighty-five foot above the level of the ocean it be this lake that make possible the operation of a lock canal otherwise there would have to be a sea-level one and probably you boy remember what a discussion there be in congress and elsewhere about the advantage and disadvantage of a sea-level route across the isthmus but the lock canal be decide on and have it not be it be probable that the canal would be in process of make for many year yet to come instead of be finish now whew whistle joe as they come in sight of the dam that sure be go some that be what it be cry captain watson proudly for he have have a small part in the work it be a mile and a half long half a mile thick at the base three hundred foot through at the waterline and on top a third of that how high be it ask joe who always like to know just how big or how little a object be he have a great head for figure it be one hundred and five foot high the captain inform he and it contain enough concrete so that if it be load into two-horse wagon it would make a procession over three time around the earth catch I i be go to faint cry blake stagger at the immensity of the figure that dam be indeed the key to the whole lock murmur mr alcando as he look at the wonderful piece of engineering if it be to break -- the canal would be ruin yes ruin or at least destroy for many year say captain watson solemnly but it be impossible for the dam to break of itself no water that could come into the lake could tear it away for every provision have be make for flood they would be harmless what about a earthquake ask joe i have read that the engineer fear they they do not now say the captain there be some talk at first of a earthquake or a volcanic eruption destroy the dam but panama have not be visit by a destructive earthquake in so long that the danger need not be consider and there be no volcano near enough to do any harm it be true there might be a slight earthquake shock but the dam would stand that the only thing that might endanger it would be a blast of dynamite dynamite quickly exclaim mr alcando and who would dare to explode dynamite at the dam i do not know who would do it but some of the enemy of the united state might or someone who fancy the canal have damage he the captain go on and who would that be ask blake in a low tone oh someone or some firm who might fancy that the canal take business away from they it will greatly shorten certain traffic and trade route you know hardly enough to cause anyone to commit such a crime as that do you think ask the spaniard that be hard to answer go on the tug commander i know that we be take great precaution though to prevent the dam or the lock from be damage uncle sam be take no chance well have you picture enough i think so answer blake when we come back we 'll stop off here and get some view from below the dam show the spillway yes that ought to be interesting the captain agree the tug now steam on she way out into gatun lake and there a series of excellent view be obtain for the move picture camera mr alcando be allow to do he part he be rapidly learn what the boy could teach he of course it could never happen the spaniard say when the camera have be put away for the view to be obtain then be of too much sameness to attract joe or blake it would never happen and i hope it never do but if it do it would make a wonderful picture would it not he ask what be you talk about ask blake the gatun dam be the answer if ever it be blow up by dynamite it would make a wonderful scene too wonderful say joe grimly it would be a terrible crime against civilization to destroy this great canal yes it would be a great crime agree the spaniard in a low voice a little later he go to he stateroom on the tug and blake and joe remain on deck queer sort of a chap be not he say joe he sure be -- rather deep agree he chum be you boy go into the jungle ask the tug captain that afternoon yes we want to get a few view show life in the wood answer blake why well the reason i ask be that i can take you to the mouth of the chagre river and from there you will not have so much trouble penetrate into the interior so if you be go -- i think we have better go do not you ask blake of he chum surely yes we might get some fine picture they 'll go well with the canal anyhow really a sort of part of the series we be take all right then i 'll leave you in the jungle the captain say a day or so later stop have be make to permit the boy to film certain scene they want the tug reach gamboa where they stop to plan a trip into the interior then one morning with they camera load with film they start off for a brief trip into the jungle chapter xiv in dire peril a small launch have be provide for the use of blake and joe in go into the jungle the first part of they trip be along the chagre river the tug on which they have come thus far be not suitable accordingly they have transfer what baggage they need to the launch and with they move picture camera with shelter tent food supplies and some west indian negro as helper they be prepare to enjoy life as much as possible in the jungle of the isthmus you boy do not seem to mind what you do to get picture comment mr alcando as they sit in the launch go up the stream the existence of which make possible gatun lake no you get so you 'll do almost anything to get a good film agree blake this be easy compare to some of the thing we have do joe remark you 'll become just as fascinate with it as we be mr alcando i hope so he admit for i will have to penetrate into a much wilder jungle than this if i take the view we company want perhaps i can induce you to come to south america and make film for we in case i can not do it he conclude well we be in the business remark blake with a smile but you 'll get so you can take for yourself just as good picture as we can do you really think so ask the spaniard eagerly i be sure of it blake say the little suspicion both he and joe have entertain of they companion seem to have vanish certainly he neither do nor say anything that could be construe as dangerous he be a polished gentleman and seem to regard the boy as he great friend he often refer to the runaway accident as for the odd ticking box it seem to have be put carefully away for neither blake nor joe see it nor have they hear the click of it when they go near mr alcando 's possession the first night in the jungle be spend aboard the boat it be pleasant enough mosquito canopy keep away the pest that be say to cause malaria and yellow fever among other thing but thanks to the activity of the american sanitary engineer the mosquito be greatly lessen in the canal zone and now for some real jungle life cry blake the next day as the little party set off into the forest a group of laborer with machete go ahead to clear the way for several mile nothing worth film be see and blake and joe be begin to feel that perhaps they have have they trouble for nothing now and then they come to little clearing in the thick jungle where a native have chop down the brush and tree to make a place for he palm-thatched and mud-floored hut a few of they cluster about form a village life be very simple in the jungle of panama oh blake look suddenly cry joe as they be walk along a native path what queer insect they be like leave the boy and mr alcando see what seem to be a procession of green leaf make its way through the jungle those be real leave the ant carry explain the guide who speak very good english they be call leaf-cutting ant and each one of they be really carry a leaf he have cut from some tree on closer inspection the boy see that this be so each ant carry on its back a triangular leaf and the odd part or rather one of the odd feature be that the leaf be carry with the thin edge forward so it would not blow in the wind what do they do with 'em ask joe eat 'em or make house of 'em neither reply the guide the ant put the leaf away until they be cover with a fungus growth it be this fungus that the ant eat and when it have all be take from the leaf they be bring out of the ant home and a fresh lot of leaf be bring in these ant be bring in a fresh lot now you see how odd exclaimed blake we must get a picture of this joe we sure must agree he chum but how can you take move picture of such small thing as ant ask mr alcando we 'll put on a enlarge lens and get the camera close to they explain blake who have have experience in take several film of this sort for the use of school and college a halt be call while the camera be make ready and then as the ant go on in they queer procession carry the leaf which look like green sail over they back the film click on in its indelible impression of they for the delight of audience who might see they on the screen in move picture theater from maine to californium well that be worth get say blake as they put away the camera and go on again i wonder what we 'll see next have you any wild beast in these jungle ask mr alcando of the indian guide well not many we have some deer though this be not the best time to see they and once in a while you 'll see a -- what be that suddenly interrupted blake point through the thick growth of tree i see some animal move then maybe it be a deer i would like to get a picture of it there be a movement in the underbrush and a shouting among the native carrier come on cried joe dash ahead with a camera better wait advise mr alcando it might be something dangerous it be only some tapir i think the guide say they be harmless then we 'll film they decide blake though the mere fact of harm or danger be absent do not influence he both he and joe have take picture of dangerous wild animal in africa and have stand at the camera calmly turn the handle when it seem as though death be on its way toward they in horrible form have occasion demand it now they would have go on and obtain the picture but there could be no danger from the tapir the picture obtain however be not very satisfactory the light be poor for the jungle be dense there and the tapir take fright almost at first so the resultant film as blake and joe learn later when it be develop be hardly worth the trouble they take still it show one feature of the panama jungle all about the boy be a wonderful and dense forest there be many beautiful orchid to be see hang from tree as though they really grow as they name indicate in the air blake and joe take view of some of the most beautiful there be one know as the holy ghost which only bloom twice a year and when the petal slowly open there be see inside they something which resemble a dive let 's get some picture of the next native village we come to suggest blake as they go on after photograph the orchid and the tapir all right that ought to go good as show a type of life here joe agree and they make a stop in the next settlement or clearing as it more properly should be call at first the native indian be timid about pose for they picture but the guide of the boy ' party explain and soon they be as eager as child to be snap and film this be the simple life all right remark blake as they look at the collection of hut gourd and cocoanut shell for kitchen utensil that be all really the black housekeeper have but she do not seem to feel the need of more the panama indian be very lazy if one have sufficient land to raise a few bean plantain and yam and can catch a few fish he want be supply he burn some charcoal for fuel and rest the remainder of the time that be when he do not go out to get some fresh meat for the table explain the guide meat where can he get meat in the jungle unless he spear a tapir ask blake there be the iguana the guide say with a laugh do they eat they cry joe for several time in the trip through the jungle he have jump aside at a sight of the big lizard which be almost as large as cat they be probably the ugliest creature in existence if we except the horn toad and the rhinoceros eat they i should say they do cry the guide come over here he lead the way toward a hut and there the boy see a most repulsive and to they cruel sight there be several of the big iguana or lizard with they short leg twist and cross over they back and to keep the leg in this position the sharp claw of one foot be thrust through the fleshy part of another foot the tail of each iguana have be cut off what in the world do they do that for asked blake that be how they fatten the iguana the guide say the native catch they alive and to keep they from crawl off they fasten they leg in that manner and as the tail be not good to eat they chop that off it be cruel cry joe yes but the indian do not mean it so the guide go on they be really too lazy to do anything else if some one tell they it be work to keep the lizard as they do instead of just shut they up in a box to stay until they be need to be kill for food they would stop this practice they would do anything to get out of work but this plan seem to they to be the easiest so they keep it up be iguana really good eating ask joe yes it taste like chicken the guide inform they but few white person can bring themselves to eat it i would rather have the fruit say mr alcando the boy have eat two of the jungle variety one be the _ mamaei _ which be about as large as a peach and the other the _ sapodillum _ fruit of the color of a plum the seed be in a jelly-like mass you eat they and do not have to be afraid of appendicitis say the spaniard with a laugh several view be take in the jungle village as joe call it and then they go farther on into the deep wood whew it be hot exclaimed joe as they stop to pitch a camp for dinner i be go to have a swim they be near a good-sized stream i be with you say blake and the boy be soon splash away in the water which be cool and pleasant be not you come in call blake to mr alcando who be on shore yes i think i will join you he reply he have begin to undress when blake who have swim half-way across the stream give a sudden cry joe joe he shout i be take with a cramp and there be a alligator after I help chapter xv in culebra cut joe spring to he foot at the sound of he chum 's voice he have come ashore after splash around in the water and for the moment blake be alone in the river as joe look he see a black ugly snout and back of it a glisten black and knobby body move along after blake who be make frantic effort to get out of the way i be come blake i be come cry joe as he run to the edge of the stream with the intention of plunge in you will be too late declare mr alcando the alligator will have he before you reach he oh that i be a good swimmer or that i have a weapon but joe do not stay to hear what he say but one idea be in he mind that of rescue he chum from peril that he might not be in time never occur to he blake give a gurgling cry throw up he hand and disappear from sight as joe plunge in to go to he rescue it be get he -- the beast have he cry the spaniard excitedly no not yet i guess maybe he sink : to fool the alligator say the guide a educate indian name ramo i wonder if i can stop he with one shot he go on take up a powerful rifle that have be bring with the camp equipment joe be swim out with all he power blake be nowhere to be see and the alligator be in plain sight head for the spot where blake have last be observe it be my only chance mutter ramo i hope the boy stay under water as he speak the guide raise the rifle take quick but careful aim and fire there be no puff of smoke for the new high-powered smokeless powder be use follow the shot there be a commotion in the water amid a smother of foam bright red show you hit he ramo cry the spaniard you hit he i guess i do the indian answer but where be blake that be what joe be ask himself as he plunge on through the stream use the australian crawl stroke which take one through the water at such speed just what joe could do when he reach he chum he do not stop to think certainly the two would have be no match for the big alligator but the monster have meet he match in the steel-jacketed mushrooming bullet it have strike true and after a death struggle the horrid creature sink beneath the surface just as blake shoot up have stay under as long as he could all right blake here you be i be with you cry joe change he course to bring himself to he chum be you all right yes except for this cramp the alligator do not get near enough to do any damage but where be he ramo shot he answer joe for he have see the creature sink to its death you be all right now put you hand on my shoulder and i 'll tow you in guess you 'll have to i can not seem to swim i dive down when i see how near the beast be get think i might fool he i hate to come up but i have to blake pant well you be all right now joe assure he but it be a close call how do it happen i be sure i do not know say blake still out of breath from try to swim under water if i would know there be alligator in this river i would never have go so far from shore that be right agree joe look around as though to make sure no more of the creature be in sight he see none on the shore stand ramo the guide with ready rifle feel better now ask joe yes the cramp seem to be leave I i think i go in swim too soon after eat those plantain for they have be give some of the yellow banana by a native when they stop at he hut for some water they upset I blake explain i be swim about wait for you to come back and join I when i see what i thought be a log in the water when it head for I i think it be funny and then when i see what it be i realize i would better be get back to shore i try but be take with a fierce cramp you hear I just in time yes respond joe as he and blake reach water shallow enough to wade in but if it have not be for ramo 's gun -- well there might be a different story to tell and one that would not look nice in move picture blake go on with a laugh you do I a good turn he say to ramo a little later as he shake hand with the dusky guide i sha not forget it oh it be not anything to pop over a alligator that way ramo return i have often do it for sport though i will admit i be a bit nervous this time for fear of hit you i wish i have be the one to shoot it say the spaniard why ask joe as he sit down on the warm sandy bank of the stream to rest why then i should have repay in a small measure the debt i be under to you boy for save my life i shall never forget that it be not anything declare blake quickly i mean what we do for you it mean a great deal -- to I return the spaniard quietly but with considerable meaning in he tone perhaps i shall soon be able to -- but no matter be there many alligator in this stream he ask of ramo oh yes more or less just as there be in most of the panaman river but i never know one to be so bold as to attack any one in daylight mostly they take dog pig or something like that this must have be a big hungry one you would have think so if you be as close to he as i be speak blake with a little shudder no one else feel like go in swim just then and the two boy dress blake have fully recover from the cramp that have so nearly be he undoing for a week longer they live in the jungle move from place to place camping in different location and enjoy as much as they could the life in the wild blake and joe make some good move picture film mr alcando help they for he be rapidly learn how to work the camera but the view of course be not as good as those the boy have obtain when in the african jungle these of the panama wild however be useful as show the kind of country through which the canal run and as such they be of value in the series of film well we 'll soon be afloat again remark blake one night when they have start back for gamboa i have have about enough jungle and so have i agree joe for the last two day it have rain and they be wet and miserable they could get no picture they tug be wait for they as arrange and once more on board they resume they trip through the canal soon after leave gamboa the vessel enter a part of the waterway on either side of which tower a high hill through which have be dig a great gash culebra cut cry blake as he see in the distance gold hill the highest point we must get some picture of this joe that be right so we must whew it be a big cut all right he go on no wonder they say it be harder work here than at the gatun dam and it be here where those big slide have be yes and there may be again say blake i hope not exclaim captain watson they be not only dangerous but they do terrible damage to the canal and the machinery we want no more slide but some be predict blake remark yes i know they say they come every so often but now it would take a pretty big one to do much damage we have nearly tame culebra if there come a big slide here it would block the canal observe mr alcando speculatively yes but what would cause a slide ask the captain dynamite could do it be the low-voiced answer dynamite yes but that be guard against the commander say we be take no chance now boy you get a good view of culebra and he point ahead blake and joe be soon busy with they camera make different set of view hand I that other roll of film will you please ask blake of the spaniard who be help they mine be use up as mr alcando pass over the box he mutter though possibly he be unaware of it : yes dynamite here or at the dam would do the work what -- what be that cry blake in surprise chapter xvi the collision judge by mr alcando 's manner no one would have think he have say anything out of the ordinary but both blake and joe have hear he low-voiced word and both stare aghast at he what be that you say ask blake wonder whether he have catch the word aright dynamite exclaim joe and then blake know he have make no mistake somewhat to the surprise of himself and he chum the spaniard smile i be speak in the abstract of course he say i have a habit of speak aloud when i think i merely remark that a charge of dynamite here in culebra cut or at gatun dam would so damage the canal that it might be out of business for year you do not mean to say that you know of any one who would do such a thing cry blake hold the box of unexposed film that the spaniard have give he of course not my dear fellow i be speak in the abstract i tell you it occur to I how easy it would be for some enemy to so place a charge of explosive i do not see why the canal be not better guard you american be too trust what be that ask captain watson come up at this juncture i be merely speak to the boy about how easy it would be to put a charge of dynamite here in the cut or at the dam and damage the canal explain mr alcando i believe they think i mean to do it he add with a laugh as he glance at the serious face of the two move picture boy well -- i -- er -- i -- stammer blake somewhat to he own surprise he do find himself harbor new suspicion against mr alcando but they have never before take this form as for joe he blush to recall that he have in the past also be somewhat suspicious of the spaniard but now the man 's frank manner of speaking have disarm all that dynamite eh exclaim the captain i would just like to see any one try it this canal be better guard than you think my friend and he look meaningly at the other oh i have no doubt that be so be the quick response but it seem such a simple matter for one to do a great damage to it possibly the indifference to guard it be but seem only that be what it be go on captain watson dynamite huh i would like to see someone try it he mean of course that he would not like to see this do but that be he sarcastic manner of speak what do you think of he anyhow ask joe of blake a little later when they be put away they camera have take all the view they want i do not know what to say joe be the slow answer i do think there be something queer about alcando but i guess i be wrong it give I a shock though to hear he speak so about the canal the same here but he be a nice chap just the same and he certainly show a interest in move picture that be right we be get some good one too the work in culebra cut though nearly finish be still in such a state of progress that many interesting film could be make of it and this the boy propose to do arrange to stay a week or more at the place which more than any other have make trouble for the canal builder well it surely be a great piece of work exclaim blake as he and joe with mr alcando and captain watson go to the top of gold hill one day they be on the highest point of the small mountain through which the cut have to be dig it be a wonderful piece of work the captain say as blake and joe pack up the camera they have be use think of it -- a cut nine mile long with a average depth of one hundred and twenty foot and in some place the side be five hundred foot above the bottom which be at no point less than three hundred foot in width a big pile of dirt have to be take out of here boy yes and more dirt will have to be say mr alcando what do you mean ask the tug commander quickly and rather sharply i mean that more slide be likely to occur be they not yes worse luck growl the captain there have be two or three small one in the past few week and the worst of it be that they generally herald larger one yes that be what i mean the spaniard go on and it be what we hear speak blake we expect to get some move picture of a big slide if one occur not that we want it to explain joe quickly i understand the captain go on with a smile but if it _ be _ go to happen you want to be here exactly blake say we want to show the people what a slide in culebra look like and what it mean in hard work to get rid of it well it be hard work all right the captain admit though now that the water be in and we can use scow and dredge instead of railroad car we can get rid of the dirt easier you boy should have be here when the cut be be dig before the water be let in i wish we have be blake say we could have get some dandy picture that be what you could go on the captain it be like look at a lot of ant through a magnifying glass big mouthful of dirt be be bite out of the hill by steam shovel load on to car and the train of car be pull twelve mile away to the dump ground there the earth be dispose of and back come the train for more and with thousand of man work blast be send off every minute or so the puffing of engine the tooting of whistle the creaking of derrick and steam shovel -- why it be something worth see sorry we miss it joe say but maybe we 'll get some picture just as good it will not be anything like that -- not even if there be a big slide the captain say shake he head doubtfully though the canal be practically finish and open to some vessel there be much that yet remain to be do upon it and this work blake and joe with mr alcando to help they at the camera film each day reel after reel of the sensitive celluloid be expose pack in light-tight box and send north for development and printing at time when they remain in culebra cut which they do for two week instead of one fresh unexposed film be receive from new york be bring along the canal by government boat for as i have explain the boy be semi-official character now mr alcando be rapidly become expert in handle a move picture camera and often he go out alone to film some simple scene i wonder how we film be come out ask blake one day after a fresh supply of reel have be receive we have not hear whether mr hadley like we work or not hard to tell joe respond but they know a few day later for a letter come praise most highly the work of the boy and incidentally that of mr alcando you be do fine mr hadley write keep it up the picture will make a sensation do not forget to film the slide if one occur of course we 'll get that joe say as he look up at the frown side of culebra cut only it do not seem as if one be go to happen while we be here i hope it never do declare captain watson solemnly as the boy want to make picture along the whole length of the canal they decide to go on through the pedro miguel and miraflore lock to the pacific ocean thus make a complete trip and then come back to culebra of course no one could tell when a slide would occur and they have to take chance of film it they trip to pedro miguel be devoid of incident at those lock instead of go up stair they go down the level gradually fall so they boat come nearer to the surface of the pacific a mile and a half farther on they would reach miraflore the tug have approach the central pier to which it be tie await the service of the electrical locomotive when back of they come a steamer one of the first foreign vessel to apply to make the trip through the isthmus that fellow be come a little too close to I for comfort captain watson observe as he watch the approach vessel blake and joe who be stand near the commander at the pilot house see mr alcando come up the companionway and stand on deck stare at the big steamer a little breeze succeed a dead calm ruffle a flag at the stern of the steamer and the boy see the brazilian color flutter in the wind at the same moment mr alcando wave he hand seemingly to someone on the steamer 's deck look out where you be go suddenly yell captain watson hardly have he shout than the steamer veer quickly to one side and then come a crash as the tug heel over grind against the concrete side of the central pier we be be crushed yell blake chapter xvii the emergency dam the crash and splinter of wood the grind of one vessel against the other at the concrete pier the shrill tooting of the whistle and the confused shout of the respective captain of the craft make a din out of which it seem order would never come if i could only get this on a film say joe to himself during a calm moment but the camera be below in the cabin and the tug be now careen at such a angle that it be risky to cross the deck besides joe must think of save himself for it look as though the tug would be crush and sink pull we out of here yell captain watson to the man on the lock wall in charge of the electrical towing locomotive pull we out that seem one way out of the trouble for the _ nama _ be be crush between the brazilian steamer and the wall but the order have come too late for now the tug be wedge in and no power could move she without tear she to piece until the pressure of the big steamer be remove so wisely the man in charge of the tow machine do not follow captain watson 's order over this way cry blake to he chum and to mr alcando who be stand amid-ship joe be at the bow and because that be narrower than the main portion of the tug it have not yet be subject to the awful pressure but there be no need of joe or the other include captain watson change they position the brazilian ship now begin draw away aid by she own engine and by the tow rope extend from the other side of the lock wall the _ nama _ which have be partly lift up in the air as a vessel in the arctic ocean be lift when two ice floe begin to squeeze she now drop down again and begin settle slowly in the water she be sink cry blake we camera -- we film joe yes we must save they he chum shout i 'll help offer the spaniard be we really sink of course shout captain watson how could anything else happen after be squeeze in that kind of a cider press we 'll go to the bottom sure leave the boat yell one of the man on top of the lock wall we be go to tow you out of the way so when you sink you will not block the lock let 's get out we stuff blake cry again and realize but hardly understand what be happen the boy rush below to save what they could fortunately it be the opening of many seam cause by the crush process rather than any great hole stove in she that have bring about the end of the _ nama _ she begin to sink slowly at the pier and there be time for the removal of most of the article of value belong to the boy and mr alcando hastily the camera the box of expose and unexposed film be hoist out and then when all have be save that could be quickly put ashore the tug be slowly tow out of the way where it could sink and not be a menace to navigation and without block the lock poor _ nama _ murmur captain watson to go down like that and not you own fault either and he look over with no very friendly eye toward the brazilian steamer which have suffer no damage more than to she paint you can raise she again suggest one of the lock man yes but she 'll never be the same sorrowfully complain she commander never the same how do it happen ask blake be there a misunderstanding in signal must have be something like that captain watson answer that vessel ought to have stay tie up on she own side of the lock instead she come over here under she own steam and crash into I i be go to demand a investigation do you know anyone on board she he ask quickly of the spaniard i see you wave to someone why yes the captain be a distant relative of mine be the somewhat unexpected answer i do not know he be go to take he vessel through the canal though i be surprise to see he but i be sure you will find that captain martail will give you every explanation i do not want explanation -- i want satisfaction growl the tug captain there go the _ nama _ call blake point to the tug as he speak she begin to settle more rapidly in the water but she do not sink altogether from sight as she be tow toward the shore and go down in rather shallow water where she could be more easily reach for repair it be a narrow escape joe say what be we to do now blake too bad we do not get some move picture of that accident well maybe it be a good thing we do not return he chum the canal be suppose to be so safe and free from the chance of accident that it might injure its reputation if a picture of a collision like that be show maybe it be just as well better agree captain watson as you say the canal be suppose to be free from accident and when everything get work smoothly there will be none to speak of some of the electrical control device be not yet in place if they have be that vessel never could have collide with we i should think she captain would know better than to signal for she to proceed under she own power in the canal lock speak joe possibly there be some error in transmit signal on board suggest mr alcando and later they learn that this be indeed the case or at least that be the reason assign by the brazilian commander for the accident he vessel get beyond control well it be lucky she do not ram the gate and let out a flood of water say joe to blake a little after the occurrence yes if that have happen we would have have to make picture whether we want to or not but i wonder what we be go to do for a boat now however that question be easily settle for there be other government vessel to be have and blake joe and mr alcando with they camera film and other possession be soon transfer to continue they trip in the _ bohio _ which be the name of the new vessel the _ nama _ be leave for the wreck crew well this be not exactly the quiet life we look for in the canal zone be it blake ask joe that night as he and he chum be put they new stateroom to rights hardly thing have begin to happen and i have notice joe that once they begin they keep up i think we be in for something do you mean a big slide in culebra cut well that may be only part of it i have a feeling in my bone somehow or other that we be on the eve of something big say for instance -- i can not answer blake as joe pause but i be sure something be go to happen no more collision i hope he chum venture do you know blake i have wonder several time whether that one to-day be not do on purpose blake stare at he chum and then to joe 's surprise reply : and i have be think the same thing you have joe exclaim now i say -- hush caution blake quickly he be come the door of they stateroom open and mr alcando enter he have a room across the corridor be i intrude he ask if i be -- not at all come in answer blake with a meaning look at he chum i want to ask you something about make double exposure on the same film the spaniard go on you know what i mean when a picture be show of a person sit by a fireside say and above he or she appear a vision of other day oh yes we can tell you how that be do joe say and the rest of the evening be spend in technical talk well what be you go to say about that collision ask joe of blake when mr alcando have leave they at nearly midnight i do not think it be exactly safe to say what i think be blake 's response i think he be -- suspicious of we he finish in a whisper let 's watch and await development but what object could he -- never mind -- now rejoin blake with a gesture of caution several busy day follow the sinking of the _ nama _ the move picture boy go through the miraflore lock make some fine film and then proceed on to the pacific ocean breakwater thus make a complete trip through the canal obtain a series of picture show scene all along the way they also take several view in the city of panama itself of course theirs be not the first vessel to make the complete trip so that feature lose something of its novelty but the boy be well satisfy with they labor we be not through though by any means say blake we have to get some picture of gatun dam from the lower side i think a few more jungle scene and some along the panama railroad would not go bad that be right agree joe so they prepare to make the trip back again to colon once more they be head for the lock this time to be lift up at miraflore instead of be let down they approach the central pier be take in charge by the electrical locomotive and the big chain be lower so they could proceed just as the lower gate be be swing open to admit they to the lock there be a cry of warn from above what be that cry joe i do not know blake answer but it sound as though something be go to happen i do not have all those feeling for nothing then come a cry : the upper gate the upper gate be open the water be come down put the emergency dam in place quick joe and blake look ahead to see the upper gate which be suppose to remain closed until the boat have rise to the upper level swing open and a immense quantity of foamy water rush out it seem about to overwhelm they chapter xviii the big slide for a short space there be a calm that seem more thrilling than the wildest confusion it take a few seconds for the rush of water to reach the _ bohio _ and when it do the tug begin to sway and tug at the mooring cable for they have not yet be cast off to enable it to be tow blake rush toward the lower cabin where be you go cry joe to get the camera reply he chum not pause this be a chance we must not miss but we must escape we must look to ourselves shout mr alcando this be not time for make move picture we have get to make it this time joe say fall in with blake you 'll find you have get to make move picture when you _ can _ not when you _ want _ to to do justice to mr alcando he be not a coward but this be very unusual for he to make picture in the face of a great danger -- to stand calmly with a camera turn the crank and get view after view on the strip of celluloid film while a flood of water rush down on you it be something he never dream of but he be not a quitter which word though objectionable as slang be most satisfactorily descriptive i 'll help the young spaniard cry as he follow blake and joe down to where the camera and film be keep on come the rush of water release by the accidental opening of the upper lock gate before the lower one be close the water of gatun lake be rush to regain the freedom deny they by the building of the lock but they be not to have they own way for long even this emergency great as it be unlikely as it be to happen have be foresee by those who build the canal the dam swing over the emergency dam come the cry the _ bohio _ be now strain and pull at she cable fortunately they be long enough to enable she to rise on the flood of the rush water or she might have be hold down and so overwhelmed but she rise like a cork though she plunge and sway under the influence of the terrible current which be like a mill race use both camera cry blake as he and joe each come on deck bear one while mr alcando follow with spare reel of film we 'll both take picture blake go on one set may be spoil then he and he chum set up they camera on the tripod aim the lens at the advance flood at the swung-back gate and at the man on top of the concrete wall endeavor to bring into place the emergency dam it be a risky thing to do but then blake and joe be use to do risky thing and this be no more dangerous than the chance they have take in the jungle or in earthquake land on rush the water the tug rise and fall on the bosom of the flood unconfined as it be by the restrain gate and as the sturdy vessel sway this way and that roll at she mooring and threatening every moment to break and rush down the canal blake and joe stand at they post turn the crank and beside they stand mr alcando if not as calm as the boy at least as indifferent to impend fate captain wiltsey of the _ bohio _ have give order to run the engine at full speed hope by the use of the propeller to offset somewhat the powerful current but the rush of water be too great to allow of much relief there go the emergency dam suddenly cry blake go out you mean yell joe above the roar of water no it be be swing into place it 'll be all over in a few minute good thing we get the picture when we do across the lock about two hundred foot above the upper gate be be swing into place the steel emergency dam design to meet and overcome just such a accident as have occur these dam be work by electricity and could be put in place in two minute or if the machinery fail they could be work by hand though take nearly half a hour during which time much damage might be do but in this case the electrical machinery work perfectly and the dam which when not in use rest against the side of the lock wall and parallel with it be swing across almost at once the rush of water stop gradually subside until the tug swing easily at she mooring cable whew whistle blake in relief as he cease grind at the crank of he move picture camera that be go some that be what agree joe but i guess we get some good film you certainly deserve to exclaim mr alcando with shine eye you be very brave oh it be all in the day 's work speak blake now i wonder how that happen that be what i would like to know say captain wiltsey i must look into this a inquiry develop the fact that a misplace switch in some newly install electrical machinery that control the upper lock gate be to blame the lock machinery be design to be automatic and as nearly error proof as anything control by human being can be that be to say it be plan that no vessel could proceed into a lock until the fender chain be lower and that a upper gate could not be open until a lower one be close but in this case something go wrong and the two gate be open at once let out the flood this however have be foresee and the emergency dam provide and it be this solid steel wall that have save the lock from serious damage and the _ bohio _ from be overwhelm as it be no harm have be do and when the excitement have calm down and a inspection make to ascertain that the gate would now work perfectly the tug be allow to proceed well what be you plan now boy ask mr alcando on the day after the lock accident back to culebra cut answer blake we have order to get a picture of a big slide there and we be go to do it even if you have to make the slide yourself ask the spaniard with a short laugh not much exclaimed blake i would do a good deal to get the kind of move picture they want but nothing like that there have be some rain of late however and if thing happen as they often have before in the cut there may be a slide yes they do follow rain so i be tell go on the spaniard well i do not wish you canal any bad luck but if a slide do occur i hope it will come when you can get view of it in the daytime and not at night suggest joe for several day nothing of interest occur blake and joe send back to new york the film of the mad rush of water through the lock and also dispatch other view they have take they have go to culebra cut and there tie up wait for a slide that might come at any time and yet which might never occur naturally if the canal engineer could have have they way they would have prefer never to see another avalanche of earth descend mr alcando have by this time prove that he could take move picture almost as well as could the boy of course this film of nature be not all there be to the business it be quite another matter to make view of theatrical scene or to film the scene of a indoor and outdoor drama but i do not need any of that for my purpose explain mr alcando i just want to know how to get picture that will help develope we railroad business you know that pretty well now say blake i suppose you will soon be leave the canal -- and we not until i see you film the big slide he reply i wish you all success to say nothing of the canal put in joe to say nothing of the canal repeat the spaniard and he look at the boy in what blake say afterward he think be a strange manner then you have not altogether get over you suspicion of he ask joe no and yet i do not know why either of we should hold any against he go on joe 's chum certainly he have be a good friend and companion to we and he have learn quickly oh yes he be smart enough well we have not much more to do here a slide if we can get one and some picture below gatun dam and we can go back north yes agree blake see anything of alcando 's alarm clock model lately ask joe after a pause not a thing and i have not hear it tick either he have give up work on it or he be so interested in the picture that he have forget it several more day pass gloomy unpleasant day for it rain nearly all the time then one morning sit in the cabin of the tug anchor near gold hill there come a alarm a land slide a big slide in culebra cut emergency order that mean we cry blake spring to he foot and get out a camera it be we chance joe yes too bad but it have to be i suppose agree he chum as he slip into a mackintosh for it be rain hard chapter xix joe 's plight from outside the cabin of the tug come a confused series of sound first there be the swish and pelt of the rain vary as the wind blow the sheet of water across the deck but above it all be a deep ominous note -- a grind crush noise as of giant rock pile one on top of the other smash to powder between they the lighter stone what will happen asked mr alcando as he watch joe and blake make ready they seem to work mechanically -- slip into rubber boot and rain coat and all the while see that the camera and film be in readiness they have bring some waterproof box to be use in case of rain -- some they have find of service during the flood on the mississippus no one know what will happen say blake grimly but we be go to get some picture before too much happen out there ask the spaniard with a motion of he hand toward the side of the big hill through which the canal have be cut out there -- of course cry joe we can not get move picture of the slide in here he do not intend to speak shortly but it sound so in the stress of he hurry then i be come say mr alcando quietly if i be to do this sort of work in the jungle along we railroad i 'll need to have my nerve stiffen this will stiffen it all right return blake sternly as a louder sound from without tell of a larger mass of the earth slide into the water of the canal whence the drift have be excavate with so much labor it be a bad slide -- the worst in the history of the undertaking -- and the limit of it be not reach when joe and blake with they camera and spare box of film go out on deck the brown-red earth the great rock and the little stone mass of gravel shale schist cobble fine sand -- all in one intermingled mass be slip slide roll tumble fall and fairly leap down the side of gold hill come on cried blake to joe i be with you be the reply and i also say mr alcando with set tooth fortunately for they the tug be tie to a temporary dock on the side of the hill where the slide have start so they do not have to take a boat across but could at once start for the scene of the disaster we may not be here when you come back call captain wiltsey after the boy why not ask joe i may have to go above or below i do not want to take any chance of be catch by a blockade all right we 'll find you wherever you be say blake as yet the mass of slip and slide earth be fall into the water of the canal some distance from the moor tug but there be no tell when the slide might take in a larger area and extend both east and west up a rude trail run blake and joe make they way toward where the movement of earth be most pronounced the light be not very good on account of the rain but they slip into the camera the most sensitive film to insure good picture even when light condition be most unsatisfactory the move picture boy pause for only a glance behind they they have hear the emergency order be give soon they would be flash along the whole length of the canal bring to the scene the scow the dredge the centrifugal pump -- the man and the machinery that would tear out the earth that have no right to be where it have slide then see that the work of remedy the accident be under way almost as soon as the accident have occur blake and joe follow by mr alcando hurry on through the rain up to they ankle in red mud for the rain be heavy it be this same rain that have so loosen the earth that the slide be cause here be a good place cry blake as he come to a little eminence that give a good view of the slip slide earth and stone i 'll go on a little farther say joe we 'll get view from two different place what can i do ask the spaniard anxious not only to help he friend but to learn as much as he could of how move picture be take under adverse circumstance you stay with blake suggest joe i have get the little camera and i can handle that and my extra film alone and with ease stay with blake it be well the spaniard do with a rush and roar a grind crash sound a large mass of earth greater in extent than any that have precede slip from the side of the hill oh what a picture this will make cry blake enthusiastically he have he camera in place and be grind away at the crank mr alcando standing ready to assist when necessary take she a while suggest blake who be wind from he run and carry the heavy apparatus the big portion of the slide seem to have subside at least momentarily blake give a look toward where joe have go at that moment with a roar like a blast of dynamite a whole section of the hill seem to slip away and then with a grind crash the slanting earth on which joe stand and where he have plant the tripod of he camera go out from under he joe and he camera disappear from sight chapter xx at gatun dam look cry mr alcando he would have say more -- have utter some of the expression of fear and terror that race through he mind but he could not speak the word he could only look and point but blake as well as the spaniard have see what have happen and with blake to see be to act quick he cry we have get to get he out before he smother pack up this stuff as he speak he fold the tripod leg of he camera and lay it on top of a big rock that seem firmly enough imbed in the soil not to slip from its place then place beside it the spare box of film and throw over they a rubber cover he have bring blake begin to run across the side of the hill toward the place where joe have last be see come on cried blake to mr alcando but the spaniard need no urge he have lay with blake 's the box of film he carry and the two be now speed to the rescue go get help cry joe to a indian worker from the tug who have follow to help carry thing if need go quick bring man -- shovel we may have to dig he out he add to mr alcando if -- if we can find he reply the other in low tone go on -- run cry joe for the indian do not seem to understand then the meaning and need of haste occur to he _ si señor _ i go -- _ pronto _ he exclaim and he be off on a run fortunately for blake and mr alcando the worst of the slide seem to be over a big mass of the hill below they and off to they right have slide down into the canal it be the outer edge of this that have engulf joe and he camera have he be directly in the path of the avalanche nothing could have save he as it be blake feel a deadly fear grip at he heart that after all it might be impossible to rescue he chum but i 'll get he i 'll get he he say fiercely to himself over and over again i 'll get he slip slide now be bury up to they knee in the soft mud and sand again find some harder ground or shelf of shale that offer good footing blake and the spaniard struggle on through the rain it be still come down but not as hard as before here be the place cry blake come to a halt in front of where several stone form a rough circle he be under here no farther on i think say the spaniard blake look about he he mind be in a turmoil he could not be certain as to the exact spot where joe have be engulf in the slide and yet he must know to a certainty there be no time to dig in many place one after the other to find he chum every second be vital do not you think it be here blake ask try to think i be the spaniard reply and it seem to I that it be farther on if there be only some way we could tell -- the sentence trail off into nothingness there be really no way of tell all about they be a dreary waste of mud sand boulder smaller stone gravel and more mud -- mud be over everything and more mud be constantly be make for the rain have not cease i be go to dig here decide blake in desperation as with he bare hand he begin throw aside the dirt and stone mr alcando watch he for a moment and then as though give up he idea as to where joe lay beneath the dirt he too start throw on either side the clay and soil blake glance down the hill the indian messenger have disappear and presumably have reach the tug and be give the message for help then blake bent to he herculean task again when next he look up have scoop a slight hole in the side of the hill he see a procession of man run up -- man with pick and shovel over they shoulder he see too a big slice of the hill in the canal the wonderful waterway be block at culebra cut blake think little of that then he one idea and frantic desire be to get joe out they 'll never get here in time say mr alcando in a low voice we 'll never get he out in time we -- we must cry blake as again he begin digging mr alcando have speak the truth the man could not get there in time -- joe could not be dig out in time -- if it have depend on human agency for not only be blake unaware of the exact spot where he chum lay bury but at least so it seem there have be such a mass of earth precipitate over he that it would mean hour before he could be get out however fate luck providence or whatever you choose to call it have not altogether desert the move picture boy the very nature of the slide and the hill on which it have occur be in joe 's favor for as blake after a despairing glance at the approach column of man bent again to he hopeless task there be a movement of the earth look out cry mr alcando he would have speak too late have what happen be of greater magnitude as it be blake feel the earth slip from beneath he foot and jump back instinctively but there be no need beyond he another big slide have occur and between he and mr alcando and this last shift of the soil be a ridge of rock that hold they to they place down in a mass of mud go another portion of the hill and when it have cease move blake give a cry of joy for there lie in a mass of red sand be joe himself and beside he be the camera the tripod leg stick out at grotesque angle joe joe yell blake prepare to leap toward he chum be careful warn mr alcando there may be danger -- but no known danger could have hold blake back he be there blake cry we be digging in the wrong place i think so say the spaniard but blake do not stay to listen to he now he be at joe 's side the slide have lay bare a ledge of rock which seem firm enough to remain solid for some time joe joe cry blake bend over he chum and then he see what it be that have probably save joe 's life the boy 's big rubber coat have be turn up and wind around he head and face in such a manner as to keep the sand and dirt out of he eye nose and mouth and also wrap up in the fold of the garment be the camera rapidly blake pull the coat aside joe 's pale face look up at he there be a little blood on the forehead from a small cut the boy be unconscious joe joe beg blake speak to I be you all right he bare he chum 's face to the pelting rain -- the best thing he could have do for it bring joe back to consciousness -- slowly at first but with the return tide of blood the faint spell pass we must get he to the boat say mr alcando come up now be you hurt can you walk ask blake joe find he voice -- though a faint voice it be yes -- yes he say slowly i -- i guess i be all right there seem to be no broken bone mr alcando take charge of the camera it be not damage except as to the tripod what happen ask joe he voice stronger now you be catch in the slide blake inform he do not think about it now we 'll have you take care of i -- i guess i be all right joe say standing upright that coat get wind around my face and keep the dirt away i get a bad whack on the head though and then i seem to go to sleep do i get any picture i do not know do not worry about they now we -- we miss the best part of the slide i guess joe go on too bad it be all right he chum insist i be film away up to the time you go under now let 's get back by this time the crowd of man include captain wiltsey have arrive but there be nothing for they to do the slide have bury joe and another slide have uncover he leave he little the worse save for a much-muddied suit of clothes and a bad headache to say nothing of several minor cut and bruise it be a lucky escape back to the tug they go take the camera with they joe be give such rough and ready surgery and medical treatment as be available and captain wiltsey say he would leave at once for gatun where a doctor could be obtain fortunately the blockading of the canal by the slide do not stop the _ bohio _ from continue she journey the slide be north of she position i do hope we get some good film say joe when he have be make as comfortable as possible in he berth i think we do blake say you camera be protect by the rubber coat and mine be not hurt at all later the boy learn that though they have miss the very best or rather the biggest part of the slide still they have on they film enough of it to make a most interesting series of view late that afternoon joe be in the care of a physician who order he to stay in bed a couple of day which joe be very willing to do for after the first excitement wear off he find himself much more sore and stiff than he have realize they be at gatun now and there blake plan to get some view of the big dam from the lower or spillway side but first i be go back to the slide he say i want to get some view of the dredger get rid of the dirt chapter xxi mr alcando 's absence blake spend a week at culebra cut make picture of the removal of the great mass of earth that have slide into the water the chief engineer general george w goethal have order every available man and machine to the work for though the canal have not be formally open many vessel have start to make trip through it and some of they have be block by the slide it be necessary to get the dirt away so they could pass on they voyage so with dredge with steam shovel and hydraulic pump that suck through big flexible pipe mud and water spray it off to one side the work go on blake have mr alcando to help he and the spaniard be now expert enough to render valuable assistance while blake be at one scene get view of the relief work he pupil could be at another interesting point blake have telegraph to new york that the one picture above all other desire have be obtain -- that of a big slide in the culebra cut he do not tell how joe have nearly lose he life in help get the film for blake be modest as be he chum and as he say it be all in the day 's work joe be leave to recover from the shock and slight injury at gatun while blake and mr alcando be at culebra for the shock to the young move picture operator have be greater than at first suppose though he bodily injury be comparatively slight well what be next on the program ask joe of blake about two week after the accident when blake have return from culebra most of the work there be do and the canal be again open save to vessel of extreme draught i guess we 'll go on make picture of gatun dam now that be if you be well enough speak blake how do you feel pretty fair how do alcando make out all right he be learn fast we can trust he with a camera now out alone that be good i say blake and joe 's voice take on a confidential tone you have not notice anything strange about he have you strange what do you mean i mean while he be off there with you anything more about that alarm clock of he and do anything more develop about he know the captain of that vessel that sink the _ nama _ no that be only coincidence i think why i can not say that i have notice anything suspicious about he joe if that be what you mean and blake 's voice have a question tone that be what i do mean speak joe and if you have not i have have what i have be watch alcando since you and he come back and i think he be decidedly queer suspicious you mean i mean he act as though something be go to happen another landslide ask blake with a laugh no chance of that here at gatun dam no but something else could happen i think you mean the -- dam itself ask blake suddenly serious well i do not exactly know what i do mean joe say and he voice be trouble i 'll tell you what i notice and hear and you can make you own guess go on invite blake i be all ear as the donkey say it be no laughing matter retort he chum have not you notice since you and alcando come back he go on that he seem different in a way he go about by himself and several time i have catch he look at the dam as though he would never see it before he be wonderfully impress by it well anybody would be speak blake it be a wonderful piece of engineering but go on not only that resume joe but i have hear he talk to himself a lot well that be either a bad sign or a good one laugh he chum they say when a fellow talk to himself he either have money in the bank or he be in love you can take you choice not when it be the kind of talk i overheard alcando have with himself joe resume i go out on the dam yesterday and i see he look at it he do not see I but i hear he mutter to himself what do he say blake want to know i do not hear it all be joe 's answer but i catch two sentence that make I do a lot of think they be these : ' i just hate to do it though i 'll have to i suppose but i 'll not put the blame on ' -- and joe come to a pause well go on urge blake that be all there be joe continue i could not hear any more what do you suppose he mean he might have mean nothing -- or anything blake remark slowly it sound to I as though he mean that he have make a failure of the move picture business and be go to quit that must be it he mean that he have to give it up though he hate to and that he would not blame we for not give he better instruction could he have mean that he could blake reply for to tell you the truth he 'll never be a good operator he have not a correct eye for detail and he can not focus worth a cent though that might be overcome in time he do well enough for ordinary work but when it come to fine detail he be not in it i find that out back there at culebra when he be work with I of course he be a lot of help and all that but he be a failure as a move picture operator i be sorry to hear that say joe with genuine sympathy so be i to have to come to that conclusion blake go on i guess he know it too for he say as much to I so i guess that be what he talk to himself mean perhaps it do well we do we best for he we surely do and i guess he appreciate that he say so anyhow and so you be go to get some gatun picture and then quit -- eh that be it joe and the sooner we get they the sooner we can get back home i have have all i want of panama not that it be not a nice place but we have see all there be to see we might try a little more of the jungle we get enough of those picture before blake declare no the dam will wind it up as far as we be concern if mr alcando feel any sorrow over he failure as a move picture operator he do not show it when next he meet the boy he be quite cheerful be you fully recover joe he ask oh sure i be all right again i only wish i could have have a hand in rescue you the spaniard go on it would have be a manner of pay in a slight degree the debt i owe you boy but fate take that out of my hand and you be save by the same sort of slide that cover you up yes i guess i be bear lucky laugh joe preparation for take several view of the big gatun dam from the lower or spillway side be make one afternoon mr alcando ask if he would be need in make any view and when blake tell he he would not the spaniard go off by himself take a small camera with he i be go to try my luck on my own hook he say that be right encouraged blake go it on you own responsibility good luck he be try hard at all event say joe when they acquaintance have leave they yes agree joe he want to make good several time after this mr alcando go off by himself for more or less prolonged absence each time he take a camera with he it be a small machine make more for amateur than for professional but it give good practice how be you come on ask blake one day when mr alcando return after a trip which he say have take he to gatun dam oh pretty well i think be the answer as the spaniard set down he camera and carry case i get some good scene i believe when be you go to make the last of the spillway view blake do not answer he be listen to a curious sound it be a tick like that of a alarm clock and it come from the interior of the carry case that hold extra reel of film for the little camera mr alcando have blake feel himself stare at the black box chapter xxii a warn what be the matter ask mr alcando as he note blake 's intent look be something -- he do not finish that sound -- in the film-case -- begin blake oh my alarm clock -- yes exclaim the spaniard i take it out with I on my trip often when i have finish take picture i try to do a little work on it there be one feature i can not seem to perfect and i hope some day to stumble on it without it the clock be a failure i have it with I to-day but i could make no progress -- none at all i think i shall put it away again and take with he the case from which come that curious tick noise he go to he stateroom blake shake he head he do not know what to think he 'll never make a good move picture operator he say to himself you have get to give you whole mind to it and not be monkey with invention when you set out to get view a alarm clock suppose he do perfect it there be enough on the market now and i do not believe there be a fortune in any of 'em he might much better stick to what he set out to learn well it be not any of my business i suppose joe and i have do all we can several time after this the spaniard go off by himself to make simple move picture view with the little camera but whether or not he take along the curious brass-bound box with the metal projection which he say be a alarm clock be something blake or joe could not discover for blake have tell joe of alcando 's confession certainly if alcando do take he model with he he do not wind it up until leave the boy for no tick sound come from the case the canal be now as it have be before the big slide vessel be pass to and fro though in some part of the waterway much finish work remain to be do blake and joe take some view of this and also film the passage of the various ship to make they picture of wider appeal when they would be show at the panama exposition mr alcando do he share and for a time seem to show a great interest in he work so that blake have hope the spaniard would really become a good operator but something be always lack and it be not altogether effort on the part of the pupil the time be approach when blake and joe must bring they work to a end they have accomplish what they set out to do and word come back from new york where they film have be send for development that they be among the best the boy have ever take well i will soon be leave you say mr alcando to the chum one day i have hear from my railroad firm and they be anxious for I to come back and begin make picture there he friend be go to be sadly disappoint in he think blake it be too bad he 'll make a failure of those view well if he do they may send for joe and I and that will be so much more business for we though i be sorry to see he make a fizzle of it but mr alcando appear to have no fear on he own account he be cheerfully optimistic i shall want several camera of different kind he say to the boy perhaps you can recommend to I where to get some yes speak joe we 'll help you pick they out if you be go back to new york i be not so sure of that the spaniard say i will know in a few day when i hear from my railroad friend i expect a letter shortly there be some little delay in get the picture blake want of the gatun dam certain work have to be do and blake want to show the complete and finish structure so he decide to wait about a week after the above conversation with mr alcando the spaniard come to the boy wave a open letter in he hand the mail have just come in bring missive to blake and joe some be of a business nature but for each boy there be a envelope square and of delicate tint -- such stationery as no business man use but we need not concern ourselves with that we all have we secret i have my march order laugh the spaniard i leave you this week for my own particular jungle now i must arrange to get my camera we 'll help you offer joe and then with the catalogue of a move picture supply house before they the boy sit down to plan what sort of a outfit would best be suit to the need of mr alcando he be not limit as to money it be evident for he pick out the most expensive camera possible to buy i wish you boy would come and see I when i get to work take view along we railroad line he say it be not altogether a selfish invitation he add with a laugh for i expect you could give I good advice and correct some of my mistake i be afraid we will not get a chance to go to south america blake answer with a tentative list of what he need mr alcando go to write a letter to he railroad official ask they to order he outfit for he as blake push back he chair intend to leave the cabin to seek he own stateroom he see on the floor a piece of paper idly he pick it up and as he see it be part of a letter to the spaniard he fold it to hand to he but as he do so he catch sight of a few word on it and those word make he stare in wonder for blake read : stuff be all ready for you you have better do the job and get away there be some fine scenery in europe say nothing to he chum about it blake go with the letter toward the spaniard 's stateroom he be not in but blake put the paper on a desk with some other and come out hastily i wonder what that mean he think to himself that must have be he order to come back to brazil and make the picture but if he go at it that way -- just to do the job and get away he will not have much success and to think of go to make film of european scenery when he be not really capable of it well some of these foreigner think they know it all when they have only a smattering of it muse blake though alcando be not as bad that way as lot of other well we have do we best with he and how unjust all we suspicion be -- joe 's and mine i wonder what he really do think he be up to anyhow the next day blake and joe be busy make many important view of the big dam which hold back the water of the chagre river create gatun lake the spaniard too be busy with he preparation for leave he be away from the boy nearly all day come back to the boat which they make they headquarters in the evening get any picture ask blake if you have we 'll pack up you reel and send it to new york with ours where 's the little camera and case mr alcando stop short as though strike by jove he cry i leave it out at the dam i be make some view there and use up all the film then i get to work on my alarm clock and forget all about the camera and film case i leave they out there and my clock too i 'll go right back and get they he turn to leave the cabin but as he do so captain wiltsey enter he pay no attention to the spaniard but address blake and joe say : boy i have a little task for you have you any flash-light powder flash-light powder yes we have some blake say but we can not use it for move picture it do not last long enough perhaps it will last long enough for what i want the captain say if you 'll excuse I i 'll go back and get the camera i be so careless as to leave out speak mr alcando i be glad he be go captain wiltsey say as the cabin door close i would rather tell this to just you boy i have just have a queer warning he say a warning repeat joe yes about gatun dam there be a rumor that it be go to be destroy chapter xxiii the flashlight for a instant the move picture boy could hardly grasp the meaning of the fateful word speak by captain wiltsey but it need only a look at he face to tell that he be labor under great excitement the gatun dam to be destroy repeat joe then we would better get -- do you mean by a earthquake ask blake break in on he chum 's word no i do not take any stock in they earthquake theory the captain answer that be all bosh it be dynamite dynamite cry joe and blake in a breath yes there be rumor so persistent that they can not be deny to the effect that the dam be to be blow up some night blow up cry blake and joe again that be the rumor continue captain wiltsey i do not wonder you be astonished i be myself when i hear it but i have come to get you boy to help we out how can we help ask blake not that we will not do all we can he add hastily but i should think you would need secret service man detective and all that sort of help we 'll have enough of that help go on the tug boat commander who be also a employee of the commission that build the canal but we need the peculiar help you boy can give we with you camera you mean to take move picture of the blow up of the dam ask joe well there will not be any blow up if we can help it speak the captain grimly but we want to photograph the attempt if it go that far have you any flashlight powder yes blake answer or if not we can make some with material we can easily get but you can not make more than a picture or two by flashlight could not you if you have a very big flashlight that would last for several minute yes i suppose so well then figure on that but i do not understand it all object blake and joe too look he wonder both be seek a reason why the captain have say he be glad mr alcando have go out to get the camera he have forget i 'll explain say mr wiltsey you have no doubt hear as we all have down here the story of fear of a earthquake shock as i say i think they be all bosh but of late there have be persistent rumor that a more serious menace be at hand and that be dynamite in fact the rumor have get down to a definite date and it be say to-night be the time pick out for the destruction of the dam the water of the chagre river be exceptionally high owe to the rain and if a breach be blow in the dam now it would mean the let loose of a destructive flood but who would want to blow up the dam ask blake enemy of the united state be the captain 's answer i do not know who they be nor why they should be we enemy but you know several nation be jealous of uncle sam that he possess such a vitally strategic waterway as the panama canal but we do not need to discuss all that now the point be that we be go to try to prevent this thing and we want you boy to help with a flashlight ask blake wonder whether the captain depend on scare those who would dare to plant a charge of dynamite near the great dam with a flashlight or rather with a series of they and you move picture camera the captain go on we want you boy to get photographic view of those who will try to destroy the dam so that we will have indisputable evidence against they will you do it of course we will cry blake only how can it be do we do not know where the attempt will be make nor when and flashlight powder do not burn very long you know yes i know all that the captain answer and we have make a plan we have a pretty good idea where the attempt will be make -- near the spillway and as to the time we can only guess at that but it will be some time to-night almost certainly and we will have a sufficient guard to prevent it some one of this guard can give you boy warn and you can do the rest -- with you camera yes i suppose so agreed blake it will be something like take the picture of the wild animal in the jungle joe say we do some of they by flashlight you remember blake yes so we do and i bring the apparatus with we though we have not use it this trip now let 's get down to business but we 'll need help in this joe i wonder where alcando -- you do not need he declare the captain why not ask joe he know enough about the camera now and -- he be a foreigner -- a spaniard object the captain i see speak blake you do not want it to go any farther than can be help no agree the captain but how do you and the other official hear all this joe want to know in a dozen different way be the answer rumor come to we we trace they and get -- more rumor there have be some disaffection among the foreign laborer man with fancied but not real grievance have talk and mutter against the united state then in a manner i can not disclose word come to we that the discontent have culminate in a well-plotted plan to destroy the dam and to-night be the time set just who they be who will try the desperate work i do not know i fancy no one do but we may soon know if you boy can successfully work the camera and flashlight and we 'll do we part exclaim blake tell we where to set the camera we can use that automatic camera too can not we ask joe yes that will be the very thing cry blake they have find when make view of wild animal in the jungle as i have explain in the book of that title that to be successful in some case require they to be absent from the drinking hole where the beast come nightly to slake they thirst so they have develop a combined automatic flashlight and camera that would when set take picture of the animal as they come to the watering-place the beast themselves would by break a thread set the mechanism in motion the flashlight powder -- i wonder if we can get enough of that speak joe it 'll take quite a lot we must get it -- somehow declare the captain i fancy we have some on hand and perhaps you can make more there be quite a chemical laboratory here at the dam but we have get to hustle the attempt be to be make some time after midnight hustle it be cry blake come on joe chapter xxiv the tick-tick put one camera here joe all right blake and where will you have the other take that with you easy now do not make a noise and do not speak above a whisper caution blake stewart you 'll work one machine and i 'll attend to the other we 'll put the automatic between we and trust to luck that one of the three get something when the flash go off the two boy with captain wiltsey have make they way to a position near the spillway below the great gatun dam it be a intensely dark night though off to the west be distant flash of lightning now and then tell of a approach storm in the darkness the boy move cautiously about plant they camera and flashlight battery to give the best result they have have to work quickly to get matter in shape before midnight fortunately they be not delay by lack of magnesium powder a large quantity have be find in one of the laboratory this be quickly make up into flashlight cartridge to be explode at once or in a series by means of a high voltage storage battery the move picture camera have be put in place blake to work one and joe the other while the automatic which be operate by clockwork once the trigger-string be break also set off the continuous flashlight be set between the two boy to command a good view of the dam and of whoever should approach to blow it up it now lack a hour of midnight when so the rumor say the attempt be to be make of the nature of these rumor and of how much truth there be in they the boy could only guess they do not ask too much know that there might be government secret it would not be wise for they to know but that certain level-headed man do take stock in those rumor be evident for elaborate preparation have be make to protect the dam the preparation be conduct with as much secrecy as possible in order that the conspirator might not become aware of they we do not want to scare they off explain captain wiltsey that may seem a strange thing to say he go on but it be the truth of course we do not want the dam blow up or even slightly damage but it will be better to let they make the attempt and catch they red-handed than just to scare they off before they make a try because if we do that they may only come back again later when we be not ready for they but if we let they see we be prepared and can catch some of they at work it will end the conspiracy that be right agree blake well we 'll do all we can to help make the capture we 'll capture they likeness on the film anyhow and you 'll know who they be which will be something the captain say we have not be able as yet to discover the identity of any of they they have keep very secret and work very much in the dark it have be arrange among captain wiltsey and he helper that they be to give a certain signal when they discover the dynamiter at work and then the boy would set off they flashlight and begin to work they hand camera the automatic one of course would need no attention provide the miscreant go near enough the net-work of string to break one and so set the mechanism in motion but that be problematical and as joe say they would have to trust to luck and so the preparation for receive the midnight caller go on joe and blake work in silence make ready for they part in it all about the boy though they could neither see nor hear they be uncle sam 's man -- soldier some of they -- station near where so rumor say the attempt be to be make to explode the dynamite we really ought to have another helper say blake thoughtfully there be one place we can not get in focus no matter how we try with the three machine we have if we have another automatic it would be all right but we have only the one another hand camera would do but we would have to get someone to work it i would suggest we get mr alcando but you do not seem to want he he could easily take charge of one it be better to have no foreigner reply the captain not that mr alcando might not be all right for he seem a nice chap but he be a spaniard or rather a south american and some of the south american have not any too much love for we especially since the canal be build why ask blake oh for various reason some of they have lose trade because it shorten route but there i must go and see if all the man be in place captain wiltsey leave he and once more the move picture boy resume he vigil all about he be silence and darkness as well as he could he look to see that he camera be point in the right direction and that it set firmly on the tripod the leg of which be drive into the ground i 'll just step over and see how joe be think blake he judge it lack half a hour yet of midnight he find joe busy mend a broken wire that run from the battery to the flashlight powder chamber just discover it joe whisper lucky i do too or it would have fail I just when i need it be it fixed ask blake as he chum straighten up in the darkness yes it 'll do for a while though it be only twist together say but be not it dark it sure be agree blake together they stand there near the great dam there come to they ear the splashing of water over the spillway for the lake be high and much be run to waste well i guess i 'll be get back say blake in a low voice no tell when thing will happen now as he start to go away joe remark : where be you wear you watch i can hear it over here watch i have not mine on blake answer you can not see it in the dark so i leave it on the boat well something be tick pretty loud and it be not mine joe say for i do the same as you and leave it in my cabin but do not you hear that noise they both listen clearly to they through the silence of the night come a steady and monotonous tick -- tick-tick -- it be the clockwork of the automatic camera blake whisper it can not be answer joe that be too far off besides it be a different sound they both listen intently tick tick tick come to they through the dark silence chapter xxv mr alcando disappear for several seconds blake and joe stand there -- without move -- only listen and that strange noise they hear keep up its monotonous note hear it whisper joe yes answer blake the brass box -- the box -- he have yes whisper joe all the suspicion he have have -- all those he have laugh at blake for harbor come back to he in a rush the brass-bound box contain clockwork be it a alarm after all certainly it have give a alarm now -- a most portentous alarm we have get to find it say blake sure joe assent it may go off any minute now we have get to find it seem to be near here they begin look about on the ground as though they could see anything in that blackness but they be try to trace it by the sound of the tick and it be no easy matter if you have ever try to locate the clock in a dark room we ought to give the alarm say blake before it be too late assent joe where can it be it seem near here and yet we can not locate it get down on you hand and knee and crawl around advise blake in this fashion they search for the elusive tick-tick they could hear it now plainly and now faintly but they never lose it altogether and each of they recognize the peculiar click sound as the same they have hear come from the brass-bound box mr alcando have say be he new alarm clock hark suddenly exclaim blake off to the leave where be plant the automatic camera come a faint noise it sound like a suppress exclamation then come a echo as if someone have fall heavily a instant later the whole scene be light up by a brilliant flash -- a flash that rival the sun in brightness and make blake and joe stare like owl thrust suddenly into the glare of day the dynamite gasp joe unconsciously hold himself in readiness for a shock the flashlight -- the automatic camera cry blake there be no need for silence now the whole scene be brilliantly light and remain so for many seconds and in the glare of the magnesium powder the move picture boy see a curious sight advance toward the dam be a solitary figure which have come to halt when the camera go off with the flashlight it be the figure of a man who have evidently just arise after a fall mr alcando gasp joe the spaniard fairly shout blake then as the two chum look on the brilliantly light scene know that the camera be faithfully take picture of every move of they recent pupil the boy see rush toward alcando a number of the man and soldier who have be in hide he be surround -- as good as catch blake cry so he be the guilty one unless there be a mistake speak joe mistake never shout he chum look -- the brass box the glare of the distant flashlight illuminate the ground at they foot and there directly in front of they be the tick box from it trail two wire and as blake look at they he give a start the next moment he have kneel down and with a pair of pliers he carry for adjust the mechanism of he camera sever the wire with a quick snap the tick in the box still go on but the affair be harmless now it could not make the electrical current to discharge the deadly dynamite boy boy where be you cry captain wiltsey here cry blake we have stop the infernal machine and we have get the dynamiter he be you friend -- the rest of the word die away as the light burn itself out intense blackness succeed come on cried joe they have get he we will not have to work the hand camera the automatic do it they stumble on through the darkness lantern be bring and they see mr alcando a prisoner in the midst of the canal guard the spaniard look at the boy and smile sadly well it -- it be all over he say but it be not as bad as it seem it be bad enough as you 'll find say captain wiltsey grimly be you sure the wire be disconnect boy he ask sure reply blake hold out the brass box oh so you find it say the spaniard well even if it have go off there would not have be much of a explosion it be easy enough to say that -- now declare the captain but later when they follow up the wire which blake have sever which have run from the brass-bound box to a point near the spillway of the dam it be find that only a small charge of dynamite have be bury there -- a charge so small that it could not possibly have do more than very slight damage to the structure i can not understand it say captain wiltsey they could just as well have put a ton there and blow the place to atom and yet they do not use enough to blow a boulder to bit i do not understand it but why should mr alcando try to blow up the dam at all ask blake that be what i can not understand but a little later they do for the spaniard confess he have to admit he part in the plot for the move picture make by the automatic camera be proof positive that he be the guilty one yes it be i who try to blow up the dam alcando admit but as you have see it be only to be a attempt to damage it it be never intend to really destroy it it be a apparent attempt only but what for he be ask to cause a lack of confidence in the canal be the unexpected answer those i represent would like to see it unused it be go to ruin we railroad interest then he tell of the plot in detail alcando be connect as i have tell you with a brazilian railroad the road depend for its profit on carry goods across south america once the canal be establish goods could be transport much more cheaply and quickly by the water route the railroad owner know this and see ruin ahead of they if the canal be to be successful consequently they welcome every delay every accident every slide in culebra cut that would put off the opening of the great waterway but the time finally come when it be finish and a success then one of the largest stockholder of the railroad a unprincipled man plan a plot at first he fellow stockholder would not agree to it but he persuade they paint the ruin of they railroad and say only slight damage would be do to the canal he plan be to make a slight explosion or two or more of they near culebra cut or at the great dam this he anticipate would cause shipper to regard the canal with fear and refuse to send they goods through it in that way the railroad would still hold its trade alcando be pick for the work he do not want to undertake it but he be promise a large sum and threat be make against he for the originator of the plot have a certain hold over he but i be to throw the blame on innocent party if i could the spaniard go on in he confession also i be to select a means of cause the explosion that would not easily be detect i select move picture as the simplest means i know that some be to be make of the canal for government use and i think if i get in with the move picture operator i would have a good chance and good excuse for approach the dam without be suspect after i have accomplish what i set out to do i could i think let suspicion rest on the camera man so i lay my plan i learn that mr hadley 's firm have receive the contract to make the view and by inquiry through spy i learn who they principal operator be it be then i come to you boy he say ashamed as i be to confess it it be my plan to have the blame fall on you blake and joe gasp but when you save my life at the broken bridge that time of course i would not dream of such a dastardly trick the spaniard resume i have to make other plan i try to get out of it altogether but that man would not let I so i decide to sacrifice myself i would myself blow up the dam or rather make a little explosion that would scare prospective shipper i do not care what become of I as long as i do not implicate you i could not do that so i change my plan confederate supply the dynamite and i get this clock-work in the brass-bound box to set it off by means of electrical wire i plan to be far away when it happen but i would have leave a write confession that would have put the blame where it belong i keep the battery box connection and clockwork inside the small camera i carry tonight all be in readiness the dynamite be plant and i set the mechanism but something go wrong with it there be too much of a delay i come back to change the timer i break the string connection you make and -- i be catch by the camera the news have somehow leak out and i be catch well perhaps it be better so and he shrug he shoulder with seeming indifference but please believe I when i say that no harm would have come to you boy he go on earnestly nor would the dam have be greatly damage it be all a terrible plot in which i become involve not all through my own fault go on the spaniard dramatically as soon as i meet you boy after you have save my life i repent of my part but i could not withdraw the plan of this scoundrel -- yes i must call he so though perhaps i be as great -- he plan call for find out something about the big gun that protect the canal only i be not able to do that though he order I to in a letter i think you see blake nod he and joe be begin to understand many strange thing one of the secret agent bring I the box contain the mechanism that be to set off the dynamite the spaniard resume you nearly catch he he add and blake recall the episode of the cigar smoke i have secret conference with the man engage with I in the plot the conspirator confess at time i talk freely about dynamite the dam in order to throw off the suspicion i see you entertain regard I but i must explain one thing the collision in which the tug be sink have nothing to do with the plot that be a simple accident though i do know the captain of that unlucky steamer finally after i have absent myself from here several time to see that all the detail of the plot be arrange i receive a letter tell I the dynamite have be place and that after i have set it off i have better flee to europe blake have accidentally see that letter i receive instruction the time we be start off on the tug go on alcando that the original plot be to be change and that a big charge of dynamite be to be use instead of a small one but i refuse to agree to it he declare i feel that in spite of what i might do to implicate myself you boy would be blame and i could not have that if the canal be to suffer great damage i would have do anything to protect you after what you do in save my worthless life he say bitterly so i would not agree to all the plan of that scoundrel though he urge I most hotly but it be all over now he exclaim with a tragic gesture i be catch and it serve I right only i can be blame my good friend you will not be and he smile at blake and joe i be glad all the suspense be at a end i deserve my punishment i do not know the plot have be discover and that the stage be set to make so brilliant a capture of I but i be glad you boy have the honor but please believe I in one thing i really do want to learn how to take move picture though it be to be a blind as to my real purpose and as i say the railroad company do not want to really destroy the dam after we have put the canal out of business long enough for we to have amass a fortune we would have be content to see it operate we simply want to destroy public confidence in it for a time the worst kind of destruction murmur captain wiltsey take he away and guard he well he order the soldier we will look further into this plot to-morrow but when to-morrow come there be no mr alcando he have manage to escape in the night from he frail prison and whither he have go no one know but that he have speak the truth be evident a further investigation show that it would have be impossible to have seriously damage the dam by the amount of dynamite hide but as captain wiltsey say the destruction of public confidence would have be a serious matter and so it be alcando all along observe blake a few day later follow a unsuccessful search for the spaniard yes we suspicion of he be justified remark blake it be a lucky thing for we that we do save he life mean as he be it would not have be any joke to be suspect of try to blow up the dam no indeed agree blake and suspicion might easily have fall on we it be a clever trick once we have the government permission to go all over with we camera and alcando as a pupil could go with we he could have do almost anything he want but the plot fail lucky it do remark joe i guess they 'll get after that railroad man next but the stockholder who be instrumental in form the plot like alcando disappear that they do not suffer for they part in the affair as they should have be rumor later when both of they be see in a european capital well supply with money how they get it no one know the brazilian railroad however repudiate the attempt to damage the canal even apparently lay all the blame on the two man who have disappear but from then on more stringent regulation be adopt about admit stranger to vital part of the canal but we be through comment blake one day when he and joe have film the last view of the big waterway that alcando be a ` slick ' one though indeed
