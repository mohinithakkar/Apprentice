people and he think he should rather go without much to eat or wear than to leave home about ten day after john carry arthur to mr martin 's mr hamilton have make he clothes look as neat and tidy as possible by thoroughly wash and mend they -lrb- for she could not afford to get any new one -rrb- and john have make he a nice box in which they be all carefully place arthur try to be a brave boy as he mother wish but he could not eat he breakfast that morning every mouthful seem to choke he and when he bid he mother and the child good-bye the tear would come fast and thick into he eye in spite of all he could do to prevent it tear be in he mother 's eye too but she speak cheerfully well arthur say she it will be only six week to thanksgiving and mr martin have promise you shall come home then and how glad we shall all be to see you it be a sunny autumn morning the white frost lay on the grass and the fence and the north-wind be chilly as the boy drive on rover persist in follow they and finally arthur beg john to take he in and carry he over rover be delighted and lay himself down in the bottom of the wagon and look affectionately into arthur 's face poor rover say he you will miss I i know and i shall miss you a great deal more i wonder if mr martin have a dog i guess not say john for he take no notice of rover and every body who like dog speak to rover because he be so large and handsome i be afraid you will be homesick at first over there but we must do the best we can for these be hard time i do not see how we can do any thing more than pay the rent this year after all my summer 's work for the dry weather ruin the potato and corn will not bring more than fifty cent a bushel and how we be to live i do not see i be not afraid for myself but it be too bad for mother and the little one so if you be homesick you must try to get over it again and not come back or let mother know it for she have just as much trouble as she can bear already oh no say arthur i will not be homesick i _ will _ be a brave boy as mother call it and never complain let what will come but i do wish we be not so poor i do not know say john i think poor folk that work hard enjoy about as much as anybody after all it be not a disgrace to be poor if we be only honest and do what be right and you know the minister say last sabbath that jesus christ when he live on the earth be a poor man and work with he hand for a living he will not despise the poor now he have go into heaven again for he will remember how he be poor once mother say nothing will break she heart but live to see we do some wicked deed and that she could not survive that we must be careful not to break she heart mu not we arthur so the lad ride on till noon and when the sun shine out warmly the forest-tree look more magnificent in its golden light than king solomon in all he glory there be the crimson-leaved maple and the yellow beach and the variegated oak mingle with the fresh green hemlock and pine there be something in the quiet and deep stillness of the wood which make the boy silent as they ride through they feel the influence of its exceed beauty though they could not have express it in word for god always speak to we through he work and if we will listen to the voice we heart will be soften and pleasant and profitable thought will arise it be two in the afternoon when john and arthur reach mr martin 's he be not at home but mr martin receive they kindly say she expect they would come that day she be a grave-looking old lady who wear spectacles and the inquisitive manner in which she look over the top of they into arthur 's face quite frighten the little fellow and he could only reply in very low monosyllable to the question she ask he so john give she such information as she desire mr martin show they the small chamber in which arthur be to sleep and john carry up the wooden box and put it down in one corner after stay half a hour john think he must go a sense of the loneliness of he situation among stranger where no one familiar voice would be hear and not one familiar object see come over the heart of poor arthur with such force at this moment that he burst into a flood of tear exclaim -- oh do not leave I here john do not leave I i can not stay brushing the tear from he own eye john draw the sob child out into the yard say as he put he arm affectionately about he neck -- but arthur what do you think mother would say to see you come back with I how it would distress she indeed you _ must _ stay and try to be contented i think it look like a pleasant place here this be a very pretty yard and yonder be a large garden i dare say mr martin will let you have a bed in it next spring but it be live here all alone which i dread say arthur you know mother say we be never all alone say john god will be with you and if you try to be a good contented boy he will approve of you conduct and love you only six week too remember till you come home just think how soon they will be go rover have be gaze wistfully into arthur 's face as if he wonder what be go on that make they all so sober and now he gently lay he paw upon he hand arthur caress he fondly say -- oh rover dear good fellow how i wish i could have you for company i wish you could say john but i do not think it would be right to leave he for mr martin might not wish to have he john now untie he horse say try to be contented for mother 's sake dear arthur many year after when john be a middle-aged man he tell I that nothing in he whole life have make he feel worse than leave little arthur behind he that day i can see the poor little fellow now say he just as he look stand at the gate weep bitterly rover refuse at first to leave arthur but john lift he into the wagon and drive off it be a lonely evening to arthur there be no frolic with rover and the child on the green no kind mother 's voice to call he in no affectionate good-night kiss for the little stranger mr and mr martin be very kind-hearted people but they have little sympathy with a child and make no conversation with he there be no hardship impose on arthur indeed they require less of he than he have be accustom to do at home and have he be a courageous light-hearted boy like he brother jame he would soon have be very happy in he new home but we have say he be shy and sensitive like a delicate plant he need sunshine to develope he nature and shrink from the rough chill blast none who have not experience it can know any thing of the suffer such a child endure when deprive of the sweet influence of home such a one often appear dull and stupid to a careless observer when there be throb under that cold exterior a heart of the keenest sensibility let the bold healthy active boy be send from home if necessary a little hardship and a little struggle with the rougher element of life will perchance but strengthen and increase he courage and prepare he for the conflict and struggle of after year but oh fond mother keep that delicate timid child which nestle to thy side with such confide trust which tremble at the voice of a stranger and shrink like the mimosa from a rude and unfamiliar touch under thine own shelter roof-tree for a time at least there seek to develope and strengthen he delicate nature into more manly strength and vigor there judiciously repress excessive sensibility and increase confidence in himself and other if it can possibly be avoid do not expose he while a child to the tender mercy of those who do not understand he peculiar temperament and who however kind they feeling can not possess he confidence we need not dwell on the first week of arthur 's stay at mr martin 's they think he a little homesick but presume he would soon get over it he perform the little task they exact of he with great alacrity and be quite a favorite with mr martin who say he be the most quiet and well-behaved child she ever see at first arthur thought of nothing but home and home-scene but he struggle bravely to rise above sad and sorrowful thought and to be contented they shall never hear I complain he say to himself and dear mother too shall never know how bad i feel i want to do my duty and be a _ brave _ boy every fortnight a letter come from home and though arthur read it with streaming eye it be a precious treasure he would read they over and over till he seem to hear he mother 's voice once more and feel she loving hand upon he head he answer they but write only a few word say he be well and the other common place remark child usually write he be not happy but he be calmer now and do not _ every _ night cry himself to sleep the visit at home be a bright cheer spot to which he often look forward and as week after week pass away slowly indeed he rejoice in the certainty that that long-looked-for period be get nearer and nearer and _ would _ come at last chapter ii thanksgive thanksgiving dear delightful thanksgive what a happy sound in all childish

again how they all seize upon and kiss he how the mother hold he to she heart with tearful eye ah this be joy such joy as can be purchase only by separation and suffering who that look now on arthur 's beam eye and glowing cheek could dream that they have be cloud by sorrow or dim by tear of all the happy group that be assemble in we old commonwealth that night few we think be happier than this rover be by no mean a silent witness of the joy he would not leave arthur 's side a moment and constantly seek to attract he notice arthur have be always very fond of rover almost more so than the other child though he be a great favorite with all and rover have miss he since he go away almost as much as arthur have miss rover so it be a joyful re-union on both side he be a large dog of the newfoundland breed with shaggy hair he have beautiful white spot and long silky ear and be a very good-natured dog he would let charlie get on he back and ride he all about the yard and the boy have make a little sled to which they fasten rover and emma well wrap up in she hood and cloak with she woolen mitten on would have quite long ride after he sometimes in the yard and sometimes in the street how much the child have to talk about that night how many story to tell arthur and question to ask he in return arthur have decide beforehand not to make any complaint or to say he be unhappy or homesick and indeed in the pleasure of be at home again he almost forget he have ever be unhappy he be to stay till Monday morning and to he those four day seem a long period of enjoyment quite too long to be saddened yet by the thought of separation the night settle down on the inmate of the cottage and sweet sleep seal up all eye even those of the weary mother the year have bring many trial and some heavy one but there be in spite of they all much to be thankful for especially that all she beloved child have be preserve to she and be so healthy so promising and so likely to prove blessing to she ah how long afterwards do she recall that merry evening and those beam face with a heavy heart chapter iii the separation thanksgiving be over its dinner its frolic its boisterous mirth be all in the past it be sabbath evening a sadness seem to hang about the party lucy have return to she aunt with whom she live jame be to go home that evening henry and arthur in the morning they with john and they mother sit thoughtfully around the fire the younger child be in bed little be say by any one but mrs hamilton wish to have a more private interview with arthur take he to she room there she question he about he new home more particularly to she amazement the moment she speak of he return he burst into a flood of tear poor arthur he mean to be brave and to hide he trouble but now that he heart have be warm by the light of affection and home-joy the idea of go back be terrible to he he could not deceive or keep back any thing with passionate earnestness he beseech he mother to let he stay at home i will only eat a potatoe and a piece of bread if you will let I stay mother indeed i will not be much of a burden to you but oh dear mother do not send I back there cry he sob as if he heart would break this be a sad trial for mr hamilton and she pause to think what be right and to ask for guidance from on high it seem to she that arthur 's dissatisfaction arise from he own weakness of spirit rather than from anything really disagreeable in he situation they be kind to he he be not over-worked could attend a good school and would it not be a injury to he to indulge this excessive love for home and yield to he entreaty would he ever be a man with courage to face the storm of life if she with a woman 's weakness allow she feeling to prevail over she judgment it must not be she must be firm for he sake cruel as it seem it be real kindness and she trust he would soon be contented if not she could then change she determination if she wish so she tell he once more that duty and not present enjoyment be to be consult that she still think it be best for he to stay at mr martin 's and she still believe he would find contentment and peace there in do he duty she do not upbraid he but tell he very tenderly she wish he to acquire more strength of purpose and to gain the habit of control he feeling if he do not he could never be happy or useful and it would be sad indeed to grow up a weak timid and useless be who have not strength of character enough to pursue what be right if difficulty lay in the path whenever you be lonely and sad say she think of I and how much pleasure you be give I by stay and do you duty think of you father in heaven who watch over you and will be well-pleased when you try to subdue you fault never forget to ask he for strength to do right and he will give it if you ask in sincerity remember always that he have place we in the world to become he child and grow holy and it be often through trial we be make better you will be a better boy if you conquer you weakness and become cheerful and contented than you could have be have no sacrifice be require of you my dear child i do believe god will bless you and enable you to conquer with such word mr hamilton seek to soothe and strengthen she child while she own heart be throb with painful emotion she could not sleep that night for she heart yearn over she darling boy and she long to fold he under the shelter of a loving home she feel that she need in she own heart more of that perfect submission to god 's will which she enjoin on other and it be only by earnest and humble prayer that she could calm she troubled spirit and feel trust and confidence that all be for the best but she have find prayer to be a balm for the wounded spirit in many a hour of suffering and she now realize the sweetness of that inestimable privilege oh not a gift or blessing with this can we compare the power which he have give to pour we soul in prayer chapter iv the present arthur leave home early Monday morning it be a cold dreary day without and a dreary one within to mr hamilton she have no unoccupied moment in which to sit down and pore over she trouble but amid all she care and labor the plead sorrowful face of she boy would rise before she like a accuse angel she fear she have show he too little sympathy in he suffering and have too much repress the manifestation of he feeling she seem to herself as she imagination follow she weep boy a cruel heartless mother and again only in prayer could she find relief and peace and even then a weight still rest upon she spirit a few day after arthur 's departure a idea occur to mr hamilton which she be sure would give he pleasure this be to send he rover to keep as he own but would the child be willing to part with they pet and playfellow and if they be would mr martin give he consent that very evening she propose it to the child and she be please to find how willing they be to make some sacrifice for they little brother 's sake even emma who love so dearly to play with he and ride on the sled after he seem ready to part with he when she find it would make arthur happy yet it be with a mournful voice she tell he as she pat he and stroke he long ear you must be a good doggie rover and make my brother arthur happy he be good brother and you must be good doggie too will not you rover good fellow mr hamilton write to mr martin state arthur 's fondness for the dog and that if he have no objection they should like to give he to arthur for he own but add that she do not wish to do so unless perfectly agreeable to he she be quite surprised to see mr martin come in at the door on the second morning after the letter be send he say he have come within three mile on business and think he would just ride round and take the dog i fear you may find he troublesome sir say mr h for my child have allow he to take great liberty with they not a bit not a bit say the old gentleman to be sure my wife do not take to dog overmuch but you see the boy be a little home-sick and we want he to feel more contented if we can so i be very glad to take the dog he be a noble fellow on my word how old be he two next spring say mr h and he be a very kind faithful creature i assure you we all love he very much emma and charlie who have just comprehend that the stranger-gentleman be go to take away the dog begin to look very grave indeed emma be no martyr to suffer calmly for conscience ' sake much less little white-headed charlie who obstinately assert with a most heroic air that nobody should tarry off _ he _ doggie but you dear brother arthur be all alone and he cry at night when he go to bed because he have no brother nor sister there not even a pussie or a dog he will not cry if rover be with he do not you want rover to go esmaam i do but i want rover to stay here with I too but he can not make arthur happy then arthur poor dear arthur will have nobody to comfort he rover _ must _ go say emma sorrowfully but i wish there be two rover one for arthur and one for I it be a pretty sight to see these child put they fat little arm round rover 's neck and hug he over and over again and kiss he rough face with they rosy mouth and let they sunny curl lie among he shaggy lock great tear roll down emma 's cheek as the dog go out of the door but though emma be no martyr she be a warm-hearted generous little girl and she do not want to keep the dog away from arthur though so sorry to part with it we have get you and i and two kitty have not we charlie say she and sister mary and brother john and you mother beside who i hope be worth counting say mr hamilton you can spare rover very well i think after arthur leave home on that dark cheerless Monday morning he feel very sorry indeed that he have make any complaint to he mother for he know that by do so he have give she trouble instead of be a comfort and help to she in the midst of she sorrow besides he have break he resolution for he have most firmly resolve not to complain he have yield to the strong impulse of the moment and now he be afraid he never should gain self-control but there be nothing to be do but to make stronger effort to be contented and useful in he new home he humbly ask god to enable he to do better and to pardon the weakness of the past whenever a little boy desire with he whole soul to do right and pray to god for strength he will certainly find he can however difficult it may seem at first god we kind heavenly father have promise to give we he holy spirit if we ask he for it in sincerity and however young you be or weak or ignorant however far away from earthly friend or human sympathy he will hear the softest word you utter the faintest breathing of a silent prayer and will come into you soul and bless it that glorious spirit be infinite it give life to the archangel host it bless the weakest and lowliest child arthur find that by make a great effort a _ very _ great one he could restrain he tear and turn he thought away from he own trouble and indeed from himself entirely he have a few book and he become fond of read they sometimes mr martin would ask he to read aloud and though she seldom wish to hear any thing but newspaper that be a diversion of he thought arthur have a clear pleasant voice and read very well for a child of he age and every time he read aloud he be improve himself in this part of education another pleasant change be go to school arthur have dread this very much because all the scholar would be stranger to he and he have never be to school without older brother and sister with he be so shy and timid he do not form acquaintance so readily as some boy but in two or three week he have become quite friendly with some particularly theodore robert theodore be two year older than arthur but recite in the same class he pass mr martin 's on he way to school and usually call for arthur they walk about half a mile partly through a wood to reach the school-house a little brown building with only one room in it theodore be a bold generous-hearted boy and he influence over arthur be very good while arthur 's gentler nature and more refined manners be of service to theodore who be not very particular about little thing one night as theodore and arthur be come home from school they stop to look at a squirrel 's nest in a hollow tree just in the wood a pretty striped squirrel be run up and down a tree at a little distance whisk he bushy tail and watch they with he large bright eye they find a large store of nut in the hollow tree and theodore propose they should take they out oh no no say arthur would you have the poor squirrel starve oh he 'll find enough to eat never fear say theodore a squirrel be too cunning to starve but it be not right to take they theodore just think how many hour the little fellow work and how hard he tug to get they all in here and they be _ he _ now i be sure he have a good right to they and i would not any sooner rob he of he nut than i would a man of he money la what a fuss you make about it say theodore with a loud laugh but since you feel so bad i 'll let he squirrelship alone this time thank you say arthur and now theodore i must say if you have do it i would not have like to play with you so well as i do before for i should think you be a cruel boy and i could not love you you be a curious fellow say theodore with another loud laugh such lesson be not lose on theodore for though he have have very little instruction in moral or manners he have a heart in the right place under he rough outside we 'll begin we stone house to-night if you 'll come in theodore say arthur as they reach mr martin 's gate no i can not stop to-night sister susan be come to see we and i want to get home early this make arthur think of _ he _ sister and it be with rather a heavy heart he enter the yard mr martin stand near the door and as arthur pass he he say i have get a present in the house for you a present for _ I _ sir say arthur yes for you and something you 'll like too i guess what do you think it be rover who know the sound of arthur 's voice begin to bark loudly and in a moment the door be open and he be in arthur 's arm never be there a more joyful meeting between old friend arthur be so excited that he laugh and cry at once and say all kind of wild thing to rover who in he turn keep caress he young master and tell he in he way how glad he be to see he again and indeed the poor dumb animal seem to express as much affection and delight as if he have have a tongue to say in word how much he love he how do you like you present my boy say mr martin arthur could hardly speak for emotion but in a moment he reply very much indeed sir and you be very good to get he for I but may he stay here with I yes he be you dog now arthur they have give he to you at home they seem to set a great deal by he too there arthur well know how dearly they all love rover and he feel sure it must have be hard for they to give he up he heart be touch by this generosity and he resolve to become worthy of it and to strive to do something to make the family happy in return rover seem to impart new life to arthur he have now something to love and something that love he and though it be only a poor dumb animal it fill the vacant place in he heart never have mr martin see he dark eye sparkle so and he pale cheek look so bright and do the child at home regret make this sacrifice for they little brother 's sake if any little reader ask this question we fear they have never try the experiment of give up something they love to make another happy if they have they would know what great delight there be in it what a warm delicious feeling it spread throughout the heart it _ be _ more bless to give than to receive and happy as arthur be in receive this precious present they be still happier in have give it as mr hamilton be undress emma that night the latter say mother do you think arthur have get rover yet oh yes some hour ago i hope i dare say he find he there when he get home from school and how happy he be to-night dear child i can

both contagious and infect all those who come in contact with they on bright cold winter morning after eat he nice breakfast rover would scamper off to school with arthur he be in too fine spirit to walk by he side so he would bind off before he plunge into the snow drift up to he neck then bind back again with a short quick bark shake himself from the feathery snow and away again for another merry race if he be separate for a hour from arthur he would leap up at he return and almost overwhelm he with he rough embrace but this seldom happen out of school hour for let arthur go where he would to the barn the brook of a errand or on a visit to he friend theodore there rover be sure to follow arthur would sometimes take he into he room at night and let he lie there but mrs martin do not approve of this but as she be always up by day-light she would open the door and rover would go scamper up the stair ready for a great frolic on arthur 's bed as the school continue arthur become

spot i get out of the carriage and enter the quiet little enclosure i well remember where they lay after this lapse of year and without difficulty find the spot two small white stone have be erect and i sit down on the grass and spend a half hour in gentle musing and in half-sad half-pleasing memory once more the manly form and beam face of henry hamilton rise before I and i seem to hear he clear ringing laugh i thought of all he sanguine hope and earnest plan for usefulness how eagerly he have strive to excel in study how warmly he have sympathize with the suffering and sorrowful how joyfully he have enter into the recreation of the happy and then i thought of the sudden blighting of all those warm affection those passionate desire but be they blighted rather be not all that be good and lovely in he still exist and perfect be he not still loving sympathize rejoice true that outward form be now dust beneath my foot and it be sad that any thing so beautiful should have pass away from before we eye but the warmly-beating soul with all its noble longing and rich aspiration have not perish with it when oh when shall we learn that we and those we love be immortal being when shall we learn that death do not destroy only remove they and we the grass have spring up thick and green over little arthur 's grave and the sweet morning sunlight lay quietly upon it one little blue violet have open its pretty leaf and lay there smile i be about to pick it to keep as a little memorial of the spot and the hour but it seem so full of life so fit a companion for the precious dust beneath i would not shorten its existence but leave it to wither there my tear flow for little arthur be a child i have dearly love but yet i know not why i should mourn he early death the god who have watch over he here be still watch over he and we need not fear to trust that loving friend death be not terrible in itself it be sin that make it fearful if we be pure and holy we should be happy here or in another world just where god think best to place we but we be sinful and we need pardon and redemption from sin before we can look calmly and fearlessly upon the grave jesus christ have tell we how ready he be to forgive sin how much he have suffer that we might be forgive and to every human be even to the youngest who read this page he be say come unto I ye that be weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest the soul 's return return my soul unto thy rest from vain pursuit and maddening care from lonely woe that wring thy breast the world 's allurement toil and snare return unto thy

and way and wages spurn lay hold upon eternal life god be thy rest -- with heart incline to keep he word that word believe christ be thy rest -- with lowly mind he light and easy yoke receive the end
