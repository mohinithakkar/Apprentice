that pavilion of the tuilery palace which overlook the seine at the southwestern extremity of the _ place du carrousel _ the spot be select for two reason : it be far remove from the noise and hubbub of the city and it furnish facility for liquore up in case of necessity i be there and leave as you will see under circumstance calculate to give I a lasting impression of the event we all three of we sit around a pine table upon which faintly flicker a tallow candle in a soda-water bottle that shed around a sickly glare -lrb- that be to say the candle do -rrb- bismarck look a little the worse for wear i think and as he unbutton he vest with a grunt of relief he strike I likewise as be rather short in he wind favre be loose and frisky as a four week old kitten and speak with a quick decide tone that remind I of horace greeley he never once swear however during the whole interview you reader will observe that even if this momentous meeting be not mark by the usual diplomatic usage the language be strictly accord to the usual diplomatic idiom it be important to note this fact as everything hinge on the idiom bismarck be the first to break silence : the difficulty which embarrass the question under discussion stand first in the order of elimination favre assent and bismarck continue : we must remove the peritoneum to get at the viscera of the issue -lrb- i be much strike with the force and originality of this method of put it -rrb- and evict those impression which be purely matter of national sensibility i snuff the candle and wait for favre favre : you excellency abound in subtle diagnosis bismarck : it be not a question of nose favre : you excellency mistake I i mean to say that like the ` heathen chinee ' you way be dark i move the light closer to the count favre only smile bismarck : touch ` rectification ' then germany stick to she position i regard this as a insinuation that somebody be stick favre : france adhere unalterably to she previous resolution national tradition deeply interwoven with the fine fiber of individual nature forbid the relaxation of tissue logically irresistible a smile of triumph flit faintly o'er the feature of the frenchman he evidently think he have make a ten strike i whisper approvingly _ tre bien monsieur tre bien _ bismarck : do the german heart yearn for the rhine do it yearn for strasbourg do it yearn for metz and if not what do it yearn for he be look straight at I when he say this and so i answer bier a dark scowl flit frantically over the feature of the german but he go right on : be all the longing of all

some editorial remark concern the relation between physician and they patient the latter be exhort to place all confidence in they medical adviser for otherwise there can be no harmonious action between they this be all very well and mr punchinello think that if anything in this world should be the subject of sacred confidence it should be the revelation of the sick-room but after read the report of the various case which be detail in this publication he faith in the advisability of confide in one 's doctor be somewhat shake for instance when he read that miss anna p ----- aged 25 of blonde complexion and apparent good health residing near jefferson avenue and sixty-eighth street have be subject for year to convolution of the cerebral hemisphere and have be oblige at various time to submit to partial amputation of horn-like excrescence on the division of she manual extremity mr punchinello be of opinion that this young lady who could be easily recognize from the hint -lrb- -rrb- of she name and residence might possibly object to the announcement to all she friend and acquaintance that she have cerebral hemisphere and still more to the fact that they be convoluted but this dreadful truth be publish under the merest film of concealment of she identity to the whole world and she physical condition and subsequent surgical treatment may be town-talk for the rest of she life where be the sacred confidence here there be dozen of similar case in the publication refer to and medical journal be in general full of they will it therefore be wonder at if we do not want all the world to know every time we call in a doctor that we may have a parenchyma of the lung or a sub-conjunctival cellular tissue that we will begin some day to insist as much upon medical honor as

scientific man who intend pass the winter on the top of mount washington might certainly find some other manner of spend the cold month in the interest of science which would be much more difficult and disagreeable they expect to be snow up at the tip-top house from December until march and will spend they time in a room line with feel where they will burn twenty ton of coal during they sojourn almost any one could do all this if the scientific gentleman in question desire to undergo some really notable hardship there be plenty of deep lake in new york at the bottom of which they might spend the winter in a diving-bell they would probably be freeze in until march and they would find it much more difficult to use they instrument and everything far more disagreeable generally than in a large room in the tip-top house still if they would prefer something still more arduous let they ride day and night from December until march in the third avenue car of this city if they be to do this and confine they scientific labor to observation of the decidedly mean altitude of the sun they would probably suffer more in a give time than any previous party of learn man and thus accomplish they object much better than by deliberately allow themselves to be snow up on mount washington \* \* \* \* \* a surprising prophecy year ago mr punchinello have a very old grandfather and he well remember that on the _ inside _ of the lid of a certain horse-hair trunk the property of that estimable old man be paste a bit of poetical prophecy the word of which embedded themselves like the hot letter of a branding-iron on the tender skin of mr punchinello 's mind the follow be the prophecy : add seventy-four and 62 and forty and 900 too then if to this sum you place seven hundred and a ace you will surely find the year when they ought to disappear -- both a certain holy ` un and the last napoleon and darkness will come wholly on the sun day natheless will glow down in the region far below now this be certainly a very astounding prophecy if the number mention at the beginning of the oracular ditty be add together without use the ace they make the year 1776 now the value of a ace in seven-up -lrb- and seven be the uppermost word in the line in which we ace occur -rrb- be four so four add to the former sum make the year 1780 but even the first napoleon have not make he appearance in this year and so it would seem there must be a mistake somewhere but such be not the case if after the manner of the regular prophecy-maker we treat this sum accord to the rule of probability we shall see that if seventeen-eighty will not work prophecy we must reverse the year and call it eighteen-seventy this hit the mark exactly and make we tremble at the prophetic power of some of those old delver in the mine of dark prediction for now we see plainly that not only the pope and the ex-emperor of france will probably disappear this year from the scene of they glory but that the sun over which a certain dirty mistiness have be steal for some time past will be entirely shroud in the blackness of ruin the line -- day natheless will glow down in the region far below doubtless refer to dana the less who when he sheet be utterly overwhelm in its self-made oblivion will deserve and probably obtain all the brightness and warmth to which the verse refer place this astounding prediction by the side of the amazing event of the present year it be impossible for mr punchinello to repress he feeling of wonder and awe \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- illustration -rrb- the play and show there be a old

woman in black hair and a white garment suggestive of repose stroll at midnight by the bank of the prattle east river foot of grand street and set a house afire at the end of the third act that be the boucicault style and as the flippant edward go on to observe it draw like a factory chimney in the bowery and at niblo 's but this sort of thing will not do at all at wallack 's of course not stoddart be permit to swear there to be sure but i understand that he do it for fear people should call wallack 's the hall of the old man 's christian association with that exception there be as somebody say about something absolutely nothing to offend the most fastidious any person who exhibit excitement upon the stage be discharge at the end of the week with a pension miss moore be permit to weep but she do it so quietly and nicely that it do not disturb anybody and the usher have receive strict order to eject anybody in the audience who manifest any marked interest in the performance a friend of mine from peorium once go to wallack 's and take no pain whatever to conceal he admiration of the act on the contrary at a particularly nice point he actually clap he hand together twice of course he be arrest for breach of the peace and lock up over night but the management decline to prosecute when it be represent to they that the man have lately see mckean buchanan at the peorium academy of

good society that what this uncouth rustic mistook for indifference be the air of society talleyrand say or somebody say he say that the use of language be to conceal thought go to wallack 's and you will see that the art of act be to suppress emotion everything be below concert-pitch except perhaps the orchestra which insist upon play lively and popular music instead of do the dead march in saul for a funeral procession while the audience file out dreamily to drink and empty some dull opiate to the drain the entire audience be make heroic effort all through the play to prevent each other from see that they know they be listen to the most finished act to be see anywhere and look at the prettiest stage picture ever set all the actor be all the while try to conceal the fact that they be do any good act the whole theater be in a condition of sweet repose like the placid bosom of a mill-pond on a summer afternoon when stoddart shoot the dam well when you have society theater where they do this sort of thing you must have society play the recipe for these be different from the gallon of gore and the ton of thunder which make up the other sort you must have you actor represent people who be always bore to death if you wish to maintain the respect and patronage of a society audience whose ambition be to seem to be always bore to death in real life you must have what the sweet but-not exemplary swinburne call the lily and languor of virtue at wallack 's to balance the rapture and rose of vice which you get at the sensational shop people may fall in love in a mild way as they do in society but they must not undergo the ravages of that passion as it be exhibit out of society they be so to speak vaccinate for love and they be safe from the virulent confluent or even the varioloid type of the original malady they may also transact business of a high-toned sort and sometimes they get out of temper but they main employment be to wander about and yawn or to sit down and sneer

you make society play robertson do it to perfection he be the patent refrigerator and the man who do the two rose have plagiarize he process and reproduce he result i do not know whether the idea be to interest people in what be uninteresting or to uninterest people in what be interesting but he do both perhaps however some absurd person would like to know something about this play there be a commercial traveller in it who be take by-the-by bodily and even to he check trousers out of one of robertson 's play the only addition that have be make be that this one swear but then stoddart personate he this commercial traveller have a wife to whom by-the-by do it ever occur before the author of this play that commercial traveller could have wife the wife of this itinerant commercial person be a stationary commercial person who keep a boarding-house which the youth the hero of the play have the misery to inhabit all this be undeniably low for wallack 's and the sales-lady in the audience express they sense of that fact by intimate that effie germon 's jewel be not real and the sales-gentlemen by confide to one another at the bar whither they wend after the second act to quaff
