consider it carry and just to think what a chance it will be for I to try out my new outfit exclaim the fourth boy he who have be call by the queer name of bluff by one of he comrade possibly because be the only son of a prominent lawyer dick master may have be addict to the habit of put up a bold face even when he heart be weak jerry look at he rather superciliously at this remark and throw up he

anything to get away after _ that _ be level and the gatle open fire he remark scornfully huh it be all very well for you to talk that way jerry because you happen to be a fine shot and can bag you

boy frank langdon here break in with suppose you postpone that old chestnut of a dispute until we be snug in camp and let 's talk about how the thing can be do the first thing be to get consent at home i do not believe we need fear any trouble there frank you call we up on the ` phone in about a hour and if everything 's lovely and the goose hang high we 'll meet at my house and make definite arrangement say will whose mother be a well-to-do widow and seldom refuse she idolize son any reasonable request we could go on we motor-cycle and have a wagon bring the duffle along if it start at a decent hour in the morning we would be able to get in camp by the middle of the afternoon and have thing fix fairly well for the first night suggest jerry he eye bright with anticipation of a delightful time ahead you have get all the thing need frank and now we 'll see what you experience up in maine amount to say be not this just glorious think of it two week ' outing at this beautiful time of the year and up there in the wood where we be just plan to go next summer i wonder if old jesse wilcox have begin to set he trap yet that be he stamping-ground you know during the winter and he make quite a haul of muskrat ` coon some mink and even a otter once in a long while say bluff enthusiastically -- he be always a lead spirit in new venture but lack the pertinacity of frank do not you worry old fellow i 'll be johnny-on-the-spot when it come to deliver the goods but all further talking have better be put off until we find out whether we can go or not so i move we adjourn to meet again a hour from now at will 's shack remark young langdon always logical they have stop to talk the matter over alongside one of the store in the town and indeed bluff be perch upon a empty box that lay at the foot of a small pyramid of similar case pile up until such time as they could be sell or destroy while the other be talk jerry have make a little discovery that arouse both he curiosity and he temper : he have see a touseled head surmount by a cap he know full well push up a little above the rim of the most elevated empty box as if some conceal listener might be endeavor to hear better and in he eagerness recklessly expose himself in this way jerry be always prompt about do thing nor do he as a rule stop to figure what the immediate consequence might prove to be indignation at the idea of they conference have be overhear possess he soul and see a splendid chance to bring the plan of the listener to a sudden and disastrous end he manage without warn to give one of the box a flirt with he hand that move it out a foot or two as it happen to be the keystone of the arch the consequence be the entire pile come tumble down much after the fashion of a crumble church during a earthquake bluff give a wild shout and spring to a position of safety to turn and stare in astonishment at the remarkable result of the catastrophe from under the ruin a figure come crawl slowly rub sundry place about he leg and side where the sharp corner of the box have be in cruel contact with he flesh why it be andy lasher exclaim jerry pretend to be wonderfully surprise where in the world do you come from -- hide in that drygood box eh up to some of you old trick andy i guess go to carry off the whole dry-goods emporium that time perhaps the boy manage to get upon he foot though he continue to limp around and rub he leg vigorously as he whistle to keep from groan andy lasher be know as the town bully and many a time have he take delight in give we four friend more or less trouble jerry and he have always be at loggerheads and could look back to half a dozen occasion in the past where the contest for supremacy have bring they to the point of battle each time andy be suppose to have get the better of the conflict though he friend think he pay dearly for he victory but jerry seem never to know when he be whip and be just as ready to try conclusion with the other as before some fine day i 'll know how to outwit the big brute and then i mean to cure he of he bully way he be wont to say cheerfully as he festoon he face with strip of adhesive plaster and try to grin through the pain what d'ye mean upset I that way jerry wallington think just because you dad 's a big railroad man you can knock poor feller around any old way i guess i have get some rights you might have kill I tumble that pile of box down with I inside you ought to be make to pay fur it that be what grumble the fellow scowl vindictively and yet not daring to assume the offensive while the four chum be present for he have never try conclusion with frank and be suspicious of the new boy in centerville -- for the langdon have live there about a year frank 's father have purchase the bank of which he be now president how could i know anybody be hide up there demand jerry in pretended ignorance though he eye twinkle with humor as he watch the bully limp around and still rub he knee be not i get a right to play hide-and-seek with my friend who tell you to stop just underneath and talk about campin ' out up above the lumber dock think you be the whole team do you well perhaps you will not shout just so loud when you know I and some of my mate be go up in that region ourselves to-morrow to see old bud rabig the trapper and if we have any trouble with you sissy there be bind to be a high old mix-up see and he glare first at one and then at each of the other in turn the boy look at one another in dismay for it seem as though some would-be joker have toss a bucket of ice-cold water over they this vague threat of andy lasher 's be not to be lightly dismiss as mere bluff for whatever he reputation might be the fellow have a way of keep he word especially when it concern any sort of mischief frank however laugh aloud that sort of talk do not cut any figure with we lasher if we go up to the head of the lake we 'll try and mind we own business and advise all other to do the same if they know what be good for they we be not out look for trouble but if it come along you and you crony will find that there be four fellow who know how to take care of themselves get that andy he say sternly the bully look at he fixedly for a moment and then draw back he short upper lip after a way he have and which make he face resemble that of a snarl wolf with fang expose he remark : it make I laugh to think of such a lot of tenderfoot in the wood be careful not to shoot yourselve kid gun be mighty dangerous sometimes and just make up you mind that we be not ago to be scare by big word the fellow that train with I have be up against hard knock too often to knuckle down before a lot of bluster and brag they two week 'll be the liveliest you ever know take my word for it with he tongue in he cheek he scurry away just in time to avoid the proprietor of the store who now come bustling out to learn what all the racket might mean and find we four boy busily replace he pyramid of empty box chapter ii ready for the start centerville be a thriving town situate almost midway down the east shore of camalot lake and very nearly opposite newtonport on the opposite bank in consequence there be more or less rivalry between the two place which condition extend from the shopkeeper and bank to the sport of the boy of the bustling miniature city since the four chum be to figure as the lead spirit in we stir tale of the outdoor club it seem only proper that we should take a early opportunity to introduce they more fully to the reader together with some of they more prominent hobby hope that the acquaintance thus begin may ripen into warm intimacy as we journey along in company jerry wellington 's father be a railroad magnate and in full sympathy with he boy 's love for the open indeed it be from the elder wellington that jerry no doubt inherit he love for fair play whether in game on the baseball or football arena or in sport afield he sympathy seem to be always with the under dog in the fight and he would scorn to shoot a rabbit or a quail unless in full flight or to take a game-fish by any other means than the method in vogue among true sportsman on the other hand bluff master could never get it through he head what need there be for all this fuss and feather about give the game a chance he have the old primal instinct of the red indian whose one desire be to secure he quarry no matter whether by hook or by crook since bluff never pretend to be anything of a shot or a expert angler perhaps he be right in believe that so far as he be concern the game have all the chance necessary at any and all time frank langdon as mention before be the son of the banker and have live up in maine know about all there be to know about the trick of camper since he chum as yet have have only limited chance to discover what the extent of he knowledge might be they be very anxious to put frank to the test and learn a few of the say wrinkle calculate to make they better sportsman frank have one sister a pretty girl name nellie and bluff master have show a decide partiality for she ever since they be first bring together the last one of the quartette will milton be one of the rich widow 's two child and since he and frank be deeply interested in photography it be perhaps only natural that frank should be attract by will 's twin sister violet whom he believe to be the sweetest girl of he acquaintance these four boy attend the private school of alexander gregory dp and the sudden announcement that during a recent storm the building have suffer so severely as to necessitate the closing of the academy for a limited period have fall upon the community like a thunderbolt from a clear sky those student come from a distance be be send away at the expense of the proprietor of the school and other who belong either in centerville or newtonport be allow to go home subject to a call some two week later while the boy work at replace the fall box they keep up a run fire of observation regard this new calamity that threaten they peace for when andy lasher and the ugly crowd with which he train take a notion to make themselves disagreeable they could do it to the queen 's taste as jerry say shall we give the out up ask frank after he have hear some of the dire prophecy advance by he comrade especially bluff master never exclaim jerry ditto cry will look more determine than ever oh i be just as anxious to go as any one only it seem right to look the old thing squarely in the face before we start to lay plan if the rest say go you can count on I all right i be the last to squeal if trouble come and you know that fellow declare bluff glance around defiantly it be a habit with bluff to be always expect something serious to happen and in case he suspicion be verify as might occasionally occur he would crow over the other and strut around as though he think himself a prophet gifted with second-sight and able to forecast come event with ease on the other hand should the prediction fail to come about there be always a good excuse handy to account for the failure well say frank as he wink at jerry since we be all of one mind i do not know why we should waste any more time about it for one i be go straight to the bank and have a friendly chat with my dad i just feel dead certain he 'll be as tickled over the chance of a outing as i be he never forget that he be a boy you see so-long fellow see you later at will 's house there be a scattering then and there bluff head in the direction of the building where he father have he office while the other two keep on in company they home be close together will be the only one who really expect any show of opposition : for he widow mother simply idolize he see every day new trait of character as well as little facial resemblance that make he appear more and more like the husband and father who be go but then the boy know just how to overcome these scruple and he argument be always back up by he twin sister so that in the end he usually attain he wish he one great hobby lay in the line of photography and such have be he remarkable success with a cheap outfit that he mother have surprise and delight the boy on a recent birthday by give he a expensive camera of course he be fairly wild to get away into the wood and secure many stunning picture of the great outdoor folk the bird and animal inhabit the wild will care little about shooting and expect to do all he hunting with he camera when about a hour later frank call each of he chum up on the ` phone and eagerly demand to know how thing have turn out he be delighted to hear they say one after the other that everything be lovely and full permission to go have be duly grant after lunch they hold a grand pow-wow at the home of will to which the two girl be admit for it have be deem best that all the school in both centerville and newtonport should be close for a few day in order to make a few need repair after the storm frank consider yourself appoint commander-in-chief and now please tell each of we what we must do say will as they gather around in the living room i 'll see about the wagon that be to take we stuff up one of we can meet the driver on the road after we have pick out the spot for the camp every fellow be sure to have he outfit ready at seven in the morning bring two blanket apiece and the thing i have write down here -- a towel soap and such little necessity return frank who look after the grub part of it demand bluff who be never know to be separate from he appetite that be my part too say frank only if any of you have any particular fancy in the line of stuff to eat now be the time to add it to the list i have make out let 's take a squint at it partner remark bluff anxiously he run through the list do not think i be go on short ration laugh frank note the expression akin to dismay appear on the other 's face but you see we 'll have we motor-cycle along and when we need a new lot of grocery it 'll just be fun to mount and fly down here to pick up a bundle read out the variety bluff and see if any one think we want anything else h be here 's match sugar tea coffee condemn milk -- i mean condensed milk -- butter four loaf of bread make at home by frank 's hire girl who be a dandy cook read bluff in a sing-song tone then come bacon salt pork for cooking fish with half a ham potato pepper and salt self-raising flour cornmeal fine hominy rice bean can corn tomato boston baked bean a jar of jam can corned-beef and cracker what else -- do not all speak at once ask frank hold a pencil ready i say a nice juicy beefsteak for the first night in camp we will not be able to produce any game at short notice i reckon and that would be fine just put that down for my sake chief observe jerry and say be not we go to have any onion ask bluff indignantly at which frank double up as if take with a fit that be one on I boy why i would not ever think of go into camp without a supply of good onion along if you ever come trudge home at evening with game on you back tire to beat the band and when near camp sniff fire onion cook you would say they be the best thing ever tote into the wilderness that be the time you show you good sense bluff old man onion why to be sure and plenty of 'em anything more he laugh the boy shake they head they have not have enough experience in camp out to warrant suggest other addition to the apparently complete list make by the fellow who have be there and know all about the need of those who go into the wilderness all right if you happen to think of anything just get it that be all look at jerry grin there i bet i know what he be think about -- that all this be utter foolishness and that we ought to start out with nothing more than we could carry on we machine and then take pot-luck how about that demand frank oh well have it you own way fellow declare jerry with a shrug of he shoulder you know my idea about these thing i be the kind of a sportsman who go into the wood as light as possible -- give I a frying pan coffee pot tin cup and a pie platter some pepper and salt some match a camp hatchet to cut browse for my bed and my trusty rifle with which to supply the game and i warrant you i can get along as well as the fellow who make a pack-horse of himself and tote all sort of can goods over the carry that sound all mighty well in theory but there be mighty little practical sense about it a blanket be the camper 's best friend of a cool night and even if he be lucky enough to shoot enough game to satisfy he want he 'll get sick of one diet in a short time i ought to know something about it for i have try it both way declare frank yes break in bluff at this juncture and you wait and see if jerry do not eat he share of every bless thing we pack in -- he will not refuse one dish he be quite satisfied to turn up he nose at other carry load while he go free but at the same time he eat a quarter of the grub every time both frank and will laugh heartily at this in which they be join by nellie langdon and violet milton pshaw scoff jerry turn a bit red at the same time if other be silly enough to make pack-horse of themselves and lug all such thing into the primeval wilderness why of course i be willing to help dispose of they when the time come purely out of good-heartedness you see for it make they load lighter just drop that subject boy and put I down for a bottle of maple syrup for when frank give we some of those famous flapjack he be tell about so often we ought to have the proper thing to go with they so they talk the thing over from begin to end and it look as if the team frank expect to engage would have they work cut out for they haul all this camp stuff over the road to the point beyond the head of the lake the boy be evidently eager to get to work and hence the conference presently break up jerry head in one direction and frank and he sister with bluff find some plausible excuse for hang on go in another later on that day while frank be at the big grocery store give order to have the various edibles put up so as to be ready on the follow morning before seven o'clock he be interested in see andy lasher back by several of he pal actually make similar purchase though just where they secure the necessary fund have no rich father to appeal to be somewhat of a mystery andy send many a dark look across at the tall boy he secretly fear but apparently he know that this be no time to bring matter to a head and hence there be nothing say but the look on he freckled face tell of dark intention chapter iii the race for a camp-site all aboard for kamp kill kare frank langdon jump off he motor-cycle as he shout these word and there be a scurry among the other three boy who have gather at the house of will which have be mention as a place of meeting each motor-cycle have numerous small package secure about it after the individual fancy of the owner will carry he precious camera over he shoulder but the tripod a folding affair of the latest patent be tie to he wheel jerry and frank have they gun securely case and so arrange that they would not interfere with either the working of the machine or any jump on and off while bluff carry he new repeat shotgun hang from he back with a strap he see jerry eye the same with a sneer and be up in arm immediately just you wait and do not cry before you be hurt this bang-up modern machine shooter be no more murderous for I than yours be in you hand ` sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof ' and i be ready to compare note at the end of we little expedition to see who have slaughter the most game and bluff wag he round head with its thatch of yellow hair defiantly well a man be know by the company he keep and any true sportsman -- begin jerry ready to open the discussion on the spot rat exclaim will as he get in readiness to mount he machine stow all that hot air until the first chilly night perhaps you 'll need it before long i say frank well what have the wagon start along ask the other eagerly yes i see it off before come over here everything 's aboard and unless old uncle toby have a accident on the road he guarantee to get up there shortly after noon reply the leader quietly so you get you hire man to do the driving and i have half a suspicion the team come from you place too that be mighty nice of you father frank suppose we could keep toby with we one night to see we start father say we could have he all we want he can take the horse over to the nearest farm where we expect to get we supply of fresh egg and then do a part of the cooking for we as well as chop wood and some other stunt that say what you will kind of pall on a fellow after a little while better and better remark jerry who have be know on occasion to flunk when it come to drudgery and want to be fishing or roaming pretty much all the day and every day well the reason i ask be this : i would not wonder but what andy lasher and he pal might plan to intercept we supplies and do something mean to break up we fun continue will earnestly whew i have not think of that remark jerry look alarmed i have and i make a arrangement with old uncle toby to take erastus along in the wagon up to the point where we be to meet he at noon you know erastus be the porter and watchman at the bank and know to be a fighter when they see he sit there beside toby those fellow will have business somewhere else you mark I he can come home on the late afternoon train one of we take he over to the little station on a motor-cycle how do that suit you all around talk about you napoleon for lay out plan it could not be better arrange the supplies will be safe then now be there anything else to remember demand jerry not from I reply bluff steal a side glance at the open window where nellie and violet be stand watch the starting of the wonderful expedition that be expect to startle the timid wood folk up beyond the lumber camp at the head of the lake count I out declare will raise one foot to be ready to mount that settle it then who go first ask frank you do to start with later on after we pass the wagon jerry will act as guide as he be be up there before and know a lot about the country call will then here go fellow suit the action to the word frank run with he machine then give a vault into the saddle start the engine and with a loud pop the motor-cycle begin to hustle along the road at a moderately swift pace jerry come second then will and last but not least bluff who be very apt to have many thing happen to he motor-cycle before the ten mile have be reel off for that seem to be just he fortune good luck call the girl from the window while the little mother wave a ` kerchief from the doorway and then hurry in to shed a few tear for truth to tell these parting always affect she in this way through the town they go with dog race alongside and bark wildly and quite a few person wave they good wish as they pass for it be pretty well know what the outdoor club have in view and the hunting toggery with which bluff have adorn himself be a constant sign as to the glut there would presently be in the game market of centerville then past frank 's home where he father wave he hat as he stand in the doorway warn of the come of the squad by the rampant pop of the motor-cycle and after that the open country where the northbound road run alongside the calm water of lake camalot now glisten in the frosty air of a October morning frank slow up to allow of jerry overtake he so that they might talk as they cover the mile there be the wagon ahead he say i have notice it and just beyond i think i see several fellow up on the bank perhaps andy and he chum it might be well for we to close in and be ready to defend the wagon if necessary and look out for any sort of sharp-pointed nail on the road apt to slash we tire remark jerry who have experience so much of the trickery of the lasher crowd that he believe there be nothing too mean or small for they to attempt not a bad idea so slow up until the other boy arrive they may hardly feel like do anything now that we happen along i would feel sure they would not if we could only coax bluff to exhibit that awful pump-gun of he talk about you scorcher i think andy would run a mile -- i know i would if i think the murderous thing be go to be turn on I growl jerry who as the reader must already have notice be a very persistent fellow and hard to convince especially when on he favorite subject of a fair deal for every living creature they moderate they speed and pass the place where the hostile group stand with two rider on either side of the supply wagon then it be see that andy and he associate have impress a hungry-looking gaunt mule into they service the say animal be fairly load down with a assortment of the most astonishing article ever dream of in the mind of would-be camper under the circumstance with erastus and toby to help guard the camp outfit andy 's crowd do not dare lift a hostile hand but they take especial pain to hoot at the little company as it wheel past make more or less sarcastic remark and yet be careful not to go too far the truth be they do not wholly like the look of the big color man who sit there with old toby and of whose ability as a fighter they happen to know something about when the rival camper have be leave far behind the boy consider it safe to part company with the supply train and dash off we have get lot to do locate on a good campsite remember fellow those sort of thing do not grow on every bush i tell you so come along and frank as he speak let out another kink the pop grow more furious and away he shoot up the road in a little cloud of dust with jerry at he rear ready to take the lead as soon as there be any necessity for choose at the fork ten mile be a mere flea-bite as bluff master say when a good lively motor-cycle take the bit in its tooth and it seem as though they have hardly more than get well start before the junction be reach where jerry swing ahead and the rest trail after he the pace have to be more moderate after this for the go be not so even but nevertheless they make fair time and finally swing around at the head of the lake where the log camp be situate it be early in the season but there be some timber cutter at work in the wood near-by and a greasy man-cook stand in the doorway of the long log cabin where the gang put up throughout the winter while conduct they operation of level the forest or at least rob it of all the spruce for the pulp mill over at bedington jerry hold up at the lumber camp for he wish to ask a few question of the cook who be a man he happen to know in a small way though never particularly fancy jock stover the fellow stare at see a quartette of elegant motor-cycle come dash up to the logger ' winter quarter hello jock we be go into the wood to spend a week or two wagon follow after with all the stuff where do you suppose we could run across old jesse wilcox these day and be he start to do any trapping ask jerry the lumber-camp cook grin a little as he take in the new and striking hunting apparel which bluff master sport so airily doubtless he immediately conclude that the whole party must be a set of greenhorn incapable of know enough to come in out of the wet when it rain oh yes he be to work they tell I leastwise i heerd ole bud rabig complainin ' thet he never do hev a show wen jesse he be around 'cause the annermile they jest seem ter hanker arter jesse 's trap folk do say he he a kinder scent he use ter jest coax 'em like reply the cook not above hope these son of centerville rich people might think it worth while to toss he a generous tip for any information he give they we be head for that old camp by the twin hemlock where that spring bubble up winter and summer one of we will be back here to convoy old toby in with the chuck wagon and get erastus over the farmer ' station where he can catch a late train back just tell they to wait here if they come before i arrive and here be some tobacco money for you trouble jock the cook nimbly catch the fly coin and grin he thanks oh i 'll tell 'em all right do not yer be ` fraid jerry say they be a party o ' three as start in ter camp jest whar ye say about a hull hour ago boy from centerville too but a tough-lookin ' bunch they try to do I for a breakfast but i come out with a gun and they shoo reckon that pet peter be wun o ' the gang whew jerry look at the other in some dismay what 'll we do fellow that be andy 's right bower he must have start the three of they up here last night mean to have they squat by the spring first and keep we off and i do want to camp just there above all place it be be on my mind all night exclaim jerry disconsolately a hour you say jock ask frank always quick to decide knotty point i reckon about that but they feller be dog-tired a ' i do not think they 's agoin ' ter git up to thet spring in a hurry reply the cook still squeeze the half dollar as if to make it squeal as bluff remark later perhaps we can get there before they do suppose we make a try jerry for answer jerry start he machine on a run jump aboard and be quickly dash away at rather a reckless pace consider the rough tote road he have to follow the other be close at he heel and altogether the rattle report of the four exhaust quite excite the lumber-camp cook who stand there in the doorway gaping as long as the motor-cycle remain in sight chapter iv under the twin hemlock say be not this going-some for a rough road call bluff who be pound along close behind jerry will bring up the rear beat everything i ever do on wheel -- wow that be a scorcher of a jolt i hope none of the wheel break down answer the other over he shoulder but he dare not take he eye off the uneven tote road which they be follow for more than a second at a time lest some unfriendly root hurl he into the ditch a wreck see anything of 'em frank wheezed jerry a bit later as he keep he machine close behind the leader for somehow in this race for the campsite frank just naturally forge to the front from mere force of habit think i have a peep of something move ahead -- soon know come the answer some more jump follow and it require considerable agility on the part of the four rider to keep they saddle then they make a turn and discover three boy in full flight ahead there they be cry jerry in excitement how far ahead be the spring call frank about half a mile i reckon good then the game be ours bar accident the three fellow ahead keep turn around every dozen seconds as if worry at the rapid approach of the other keep you eye peel they be hatch up some sort of mischief call frank who know the sign he see that the other begin to wobble in they movement which be plain evidence that they have tire themselves out by they night tramp and be in no condition to compete with the motorcycle even on this rough stretch of road the tall athletic-looking leader of the trio suddenly jump aside and stoop over as if snatch something from the ground ` ware hawk shout bluff who have note this maneuver it could now be easily see that pet peter have fasten upon quite a cumbersome branch of a fall tree and he purpose be manifest when he step out as if to drop it across the road mean to wreck the machine as they sweep on frank change he course just a trifle but be now head straight for the unprincipled schemer who would have take the chance of seriously injure some of the party in order to further he own plan the sight of that heavy motor-cycle head straight at he rather demoralize pet who do not know but that frank mean to chase he until he get he so that he drop the branch before he have quite cover the entire space across the narrow road and make a wild leap for safety consequently frank be able to veer aside and skim past the dangerous obstruction without come a cropper in the ditch jerry also sweep by and the other be come so fast on the heel of the two leader that the bewildered rough could not pull they wit together in time to make any successful swoop perhaps they be not particularly anxious to arouse the party after all for the sight of the weapon they carry and above all the martial appearance of the khaki-clad bluff must have impress they more than a little hurrah the camp be ours yell the tail-ender as he cling to the rear of the remarkable procession for never before have these solemn wood witness anything like such a progressive picture of modern magic as these four lad boom along on metal steed capable of make fifty mile a hour and more in case of necessity and over a smooth road a few minute later of more moderate travel bring they to a point where a view could be have of the camp-site over to the right -- notice those twin hemlock yonder -- well the wonderful spring bubble up close beside those tree hold up frank call jerry so the quartette dismount jump from they wheel while still in motion after the habit of those who use motor-cycle in another minute all of they be bend low over the spring test the delightfully clear water of the same loud be the exclamation of satisfaction that arise for they ride have make they thirsty and the water be as cold as ice a crack good spot for a camp be the verdict of the experienced frank as he allow he eye to reeve about and take in the surroundings jerry beam with pleasure know you could not help like it for it seem to cover all the necessity of the case as far as i know they declare jerry whose knowledge be found pretty much on theory base on extensive reading rather than a practical experience such as frank have pass through this little knoll will serve to shed water when it rain as it be sure to do some time or other it always do when you camp and the water be just far enough away to keep the spring from be polluted by any refuse from the fire yes and the tree around here have not be touch by lumberman so that the whole aspect be restful to the eye i like it jerry it be a regular jim-dandy place hunk i say declare bluff after he usual explosive fashion but if he manner be crude he generally hit the nail on the head and no one could mistake he feeling in the matter he immediately squat down and begin to take he gun out of its case a operation jerry eye with alarm say look here what be you go to do with that machine eh be you so wild to get at the slaughter that you can not wait a decent length of time and give the poor bird and beast a chance to know we be here for a long stay for goodness ' sake show some sportsman spirit bluff he explode the other look up with a injured expression why say he i be only think of those three desperate character rush we camp and i want to let they see we be able to look out for ourselves that be what oh if that be the case hold up that tool and i bet they light out faster than they come -- who would not i would just like to know when -- hey jerry can the wagon get in here ask will know what the dispute would lead to if allow to go on any further why yes i think so if toby know how to manage right you see he can turn to the right cross behind that thicket and bring up here certainly the wagon can haul up here -- if it ever get to this point safe reply the other you and i will look out for that and when we ride back to convoy it here depend on it we 'll have we gun ready to make a good showing remark frank i do not think those three fellow will dare attack we especially when they see erastus they know he all right from sad experience you see ` rastus use to be something of a prizefighter in a small way among he kind and nothing delight he half so much as a scrap once in a while and the town rowdy have suffer at he hand all right say when and i 'll be ready to go plenty of time i figure that the wagon will not get to the lumber camp until noon so in the meantime we can be use that nice ax will have strap to he machine and do a number of thing firewood be a mighty handy article to have around a camp boy and it be simply wonderful what a big lot of it be need a hint be as good as a command frank just understand that we be ready to do anything you suggest for we all want to learn the rope as soon as we can what be you go to do he ask as frank unsheathed a camp hatchet and commence to look around as if in search of some particular kind of wood well you see i remember that i lose my tent peg the last time i camped in maine and it be up to I to cut a new supply no better time than now while we be wait for the wagon then i expect to lay out several pole on which to stretch the tent -- one tall one for the center and a couple of other outside for the fly that form a shelter remark frank commence operation on what seem a suitable piece of hickory what sort of tent be they ask jerry watch all that the other do so as to catch the true spirit of the thing from practical observation which somehow seem vastly different from what he read in he book on sport the kind which most canoeist like in these modern day they be big enough to accommodate four in a pinch although it be much better to have only two in each and that be why i bring both along then when the fly in front be raise it make a splendid place for the table be sheltered from sun and rain each tent have a waterproof floorcloth to keep the dampness out wait and see jerry they work like beaver for a time when one tire he muscle chop firewood another be eager to take up the job and it be wonderful how the pile of fuel increase frank rub he hand with pleasure when a hour or more later he come over to take a look at it have complete he own task as the quantity of tent peg announce that be fine fellow he declare laugh if you would ever go through what i do once when lose in the maine wood one bitter cold night you would never think you could have too big a pile of the stuff perhaps some time i 'll tell you about that experience for i 'll never forget it never but jerry suppose we get ready to run back to the lumber shack and wait there for the wagon i will not be easy until we see it here a little snack first from the grub i have get here and which nellie put up for we and then we 'll meander over the back trail he say grub exclaimed bluff start up from the soft mossy cushion he have fashion after do he little stunt with the ax count I in please and especially if you sister put it up frank for i reckon it must be the boss feed then at which the other smile for bluff 's weakness regard frank 's pretty sister be something of a joke among they but when the package be undo there be broad grin for dainty sandwich flank by a generous assortment of wing and drumstick connect at one time with a number of spring chicken come into view besides some pickle and even a bunch of cookie which frank assure he chum have be actually make by the fair hand of nellie herself they have hardly know just how hungry they be until the first bite be take and then little be say for some time on account of the rapidity with which those four set of sturdy jaw work but as might have be expect bluff be the first one to reach out he hand and secure one of the aforesaid cookie which he munch with closed eye as if mentally picture the sweet girl from whom the treat have come all ready for the road jerry exclaim frank jump up on deck captain i be with you come the reply just as cheerily you fellow keep a good watch though i do not fancy you 'll be bother by the three advance scout of the lasher brigade remark frank as he push he machine into position and prepare to run with it for a start huh grunt jerry cast a side glance toward bluff who be already shift he repeat shotgun to a position where it could lie across he knee as he sit there on he mossy hassock i bet they will not not as long as that thing be in sight talk about you scarecrow i would like to wager -- to be continue in we next come along jerry cry frank as he start on a minute later the merry pop of the two exhaust tell that the convoy for the chuck-wagon as they call it be on the way chapter v the first camp supper they do not seem to be around say jerry when he and he chum have cover at least half the distance to the lumber camp without see a sign of the three fellow who have try to dispute they advance in the morning i hope they be not hover around we camp to make trouble for the boy observe frank shake he head the other laugh aloud in a scoffing way all i can say be i be mighty sorry for pet and he pal if they try that sort of business when that criminal of a bluff be sit there with he gatle gun ready for work i would sooner face a tiger honest i would than that instrument of destruction i bet there will not be a chippy leave around here when we get out oh shuck jerry remember that he be not in you class when he empty that six-shot gun and make a miss every time what do it matter if the game have only poor bluff and he repeater to fear they could well laugh but when _ you _ look over the sight it be a different matter that be nice of you frank i 'll try and be more lenient with the poor fellow then anyhow i know he shut both eye when he pull the trigger for i have watch he more than once a man that be gun-shy never will make a success as a hunter be not that so i have be tell so but all the same bluff be a good-hearted chap and i like he first rate he furnish fun for the whole squad and besides nothing make he mad -- at least if he ever brush up it be over and do with like a flash but be not that the lumber camp ahead -- i think i have a glimpse of it through the tree -- there it be again say frank you be right but i do not see the wagon i hardly think it would be here before half a hour more we need not go any farther than the cabin and can be take in the sight while we wait precious little to see here do not compare with some of the big camp up in you maine i guess but they be make a gash in the timber all right and in a few year it 'll be all go -- that be what be worth take they come to a halt near the log cabin from which the head of the cook be quickly thrust he have hear the sound of they engine as they approach back again boy he inquire genially for the vision of that coin be still fresh in he memory bad penny always come back jock laugh jerry we have come to convoy the wagon in you see all we supplies tent grub and blanket happen to be in that wagon and we do not mean to let it be capture by any of the lasher crowd remark frank he see the cook start at the mention of that name as he mutter : butch lasher a-comin ' up hyer -- then they feller must aben some o ' he pal just what they be and frank go on to explain how it come there be a second vacation for the academy boy of centerville and also the unfortunate fact of andy know among he chum as butch for some unexplained reason have determine to take a outing in the same region at the identical time they have arrange to come we expect to have trouble with they right along but they would better be careful how they try any of they smart trick on we up here we mean to let they alone if they mind they business and pay no attention to we but on the other hand we know how to defend ourselves and we have get the means to do it he go on the cook shake he touseled head thet critter be sure a terror a ' i orter know be all he would say but the boy could imagine that there be some sort of a story back of it less than ten minute later while jerry be prowl around look at the bunk in which the lumberjack sleep when in camp the sound of voice come to frank who be watch outside and look down the crooked road he catch sight of the wagon with the two color man on the seat a shout bring jerry plunge out of the door and he join in noisily greet the come of the team it have be previously arrange that he be to take erastus on he machine over to the station on the railroad about two mile away so that he might get the afternoon local which would stop upon be flag meanwhile frank would escort the wagon to the camp feeling quite able to take good care of the supply train as jerry call it when he tire of say chuck-wagon jerry get away first with erastus perched behind he and grin from ear to ear with the novelty of the experience h be he will not think it so funny if they strike a root and take a header but then jerry 's a cautious driver and he know something of the lay of the land so i hope they 'll get along without a spill now uncle toby do you think you can stand a mile or two of rough sledding for the ` tote-road ' be hardly mean for a wagon with spring frank ask as the other vanish from sight go back along the way they have come from centerville ` deed a ' i specks i kin marse frank dis chile be able to stan ' a heap o ' knockin ' ` round on ` casion s ` long as i keep my shin safe i do not seem to keer ` bout much else say de word sah a ' i ` se ready to hit um up ag ` in right peart be the reply from the old gray-headed toby who have work for frank 's father many year -- indeed he be fond of say he have be a slave in the virginia branch of the langdon family befo ' de wah the horse have not have a very hard pull up to this time and be therefore in pretty fair condition to attempt the last quarter of the journey and they need all they strength to drag that heavily-laden wagon over the half-broken road where so many obstacle stick up to jolt the poor driver until he almost lose he grip on the seat though the boy have be able to avoid most of these because they could steer aside with the single line of wheel but the vehicle have be well make and the horse be full of vim while the venerable black man who grip the rein be a sticker as he express it after be once toss out upon the back of the near horse by the sudden stoppage of the wagon after rather a try experience they finally sight a column of smoke and call toby 's attention to this frank say : that be as far as we go this time toby toby shut he eye for a brief moment and doubtless give thanks for he poor old body must have be pretty well bruise by this time will and bluff have spy the wagon by now and they shout a noisy welcome now we be prepare for a siege with the grub at hand cry bluff dancing around with he gun hold on high say be careful with that contraption will you if ever it start go off not one of we would live to tell the ghastly tale call will as if really and truly alarmed which of course he be not bluff give he a indignant look for it pained he to have he pet gun insult after this rude fashion but he be too much delighted over the come of the supply wagon to cherish any animosity and besides as frank say he never could keep on be angry over a few minute at a time such fun they have get that vehicle unloaded then the tent have to go up which be a operation that consume considerable time for frank prove to be very exact in he way of arrange thing and would not accept any poor work when finally both tent have be erect with a burgee bear the club name float from the very top the camp begin to have a mighty cheery look that be invigorating then another fly be put up just in the rear under which some of the coarser provision such as water would not injure should the rain get in be store here too toby be to bunk while in camp everything look like business boy say jerry as he come in later what do you do with erastus demand frank upset he in a ditch do i look like i have be root he get off on the train and be home by now home -- the boy look at each other for it already seem as though they have be away a long time and yet they first night under canvas be still ahead they mean to keep the horse with they over night and next day jerry would go with toby to the farmer 's about a mile off leave the outfit there until it be need to take they back again as evening come on the boy begin to lie around and watch the old darkey start operation for supper which he do with evident delight for toby loved nothing better than to get away with marse frank and some of he friend where he could wait upon they and enjoy a holiday in the wood the unusual exertion of the ride and subsequent wood-chopping have really tire all of the chum though none of they would publicly admit it when bluff attempt to get up in a hurry for some purpose he find himself so stiff he could hardly move and it be only after much grunting and three distinct effort that he finally manage to reach he foot frank only smile he have expect just this and know that in a few day the boy would have succeed in get the kink out of they muscle bluff have insist that they have fry onion with that glorious steak and indeed he even prepare a dozen of the same himself for bluff could be very persistent when he choose frank call a halt at this number we may want a few another time old fellow he admonish oh all right then i be just wait till somebody call I off i have shed more tear than brutus ever drop at the bier of caesar wow some kind person wipe my eye please my hand be too rank to touch my tear-rag he declare and will perform this friendly office think that he deserve it after he heroism the coffee be soon bubble on the fire and the delightful odor of that fine sirloin steak together with a second frying-pan full of onion so permeate the surround atmosphere that have any of the lasher crowd be hide in the vicinity they must have suffer torture in the thought that they be debar from that glorious outdoor feast around the first campfire look there say jerry quietly point as he speak it be a little chipmunk come to find out what all this row be about here remark frank toss a piece of bread toward the cunning animal if you do not do anything to frighten they away we can have a lot of such friendly creature hang around the camp all the time then for goodness ' sake chain up that annihilator of bluff 's before he get it work overtime look as if he have a eye on it just now for game be game to the pot hunter no matter how he get it or what it happen to be growl jerry scowl in the direction of the other who only grin in reply supper be ready gemman kindly draw yer seat ` round de table announce the tow-headed cook at this juncture and in the eagerness to appease they keen hunger everything else be forget for the time be two collapsible table have be bring along and these be place under the raise fly of one of the tent so that the warmth of the open fire could be enjoy but the whole supper have not be cook after the old fashion for frank have a little outfit that burn kerosene make its own blue flame and which the other boy declare to be the finest thing of the kind they have ever see a set of aluminum ware go with it the kettle nesting in each other there be cup dish knife fork and spoon for four person besides frank have add a lot of kitchen thing from the house so that they be amply supply the supper be almost finish when something crash through the branch of a tree and fall at frank 's foot what be that exclaim the boy crash come another object it

he shout as he scramble up and go limp after the other this have 'em beat to a frazzle the hunt for the offender be without result he have evidently make haste to scuttle off after heave the stone at the camp frank and will after search for some little time start to return to the camp and on the way overtake bluff where 's jerry ask frank as they join force do not know come the answer as bluff push on eagerly ahead last i saw of he he be take a header over that long coffin-box back of the tent i hope he do not hurt himself badly that be all what be you hurry bluff continue frank notice that

yes sir so common that when man hire out they stipulate in the bond that they be not to be feed on terrapin then the fashionable people take a fancy for the dish the supply run low and now a decent-sized terrapin be worth five dollar perhaps muskrat may become popular the same way who know laugh frank at which the trapper roar seemingly think it a great joke he show they how he take the skin off and stretch they on he frame not too tight boy and then keep 'em in the open air in the shade away from the fire till they git right dry some we take off whole a ' other be slit up jest

have be around this section more than once he must have know how to get there five to one he burst right into the camp and demand he gun do you think so say jerry uneasily that be he way and you can just guess that he get into hot water before half a minute have go return frank would they hurt bluff ask will begin to show unexpected feeling well they might especially if he accuse they of steal he gun besides if he happen to see it there i would not put it past bluff to tackle the whole bunch in the effort to get he property frank go on jerry have throw he gun down as if ready to drop over himself he now stoop and pick it up again come on fellow there be only one thing for we to do he say and that be to hike over to that shanty and find out if they have get we chum there a prisoner finish frank will make no move to leave he beloved camera behind hide it somewhere suggest frank for it will be too dark by the time we get across to they camp to take a picture decently i guess not

solicitude in he voice and manner i be a little afraid of it and i want to say right here that both of you have show the right spirit in agree to come with I so quickly it do you credit boy remark frank will seem to puff up a bit under the compliment but jerry sneer oh i do not consider that anything at all bluff be a good fellow in spite of he butcher instinct and i guess he would go out of he way to help I he say frank look at he and open he mouth to speak but on second thought change he mind jerry seem to know more about the wood than either of he chum he have little trouble in guide they across the territory that separate the rival camp which be not more than a mile or so i can see the glow of a fire ahead announce will presently that be the place we be aim for the lake lie beyond i have fish from the point many a time pursued jerry and when be we go to try for fish i bring my rod and line along think we would have a fish dinner some fine day complain will wait there be plenty of time the season be nearly over but if a warm day come along we ought to be able to get some bass i think remark frank who be something of a authority in that line i can see figure move about like black ghost announce jerry say fellow this be get real exciting creep up on a rival camp with the intention of hold up the whole kit at the muzzle of we gun oh i hope it will not come to such a desperate point as that i would rather not have any trouble with that lasher if it can be avoid ventured frank but if they have get we chum tie to a tree a prisoner demand jerry in that case we 'll make sure that he be set free no matter what the consequence be the immediate response from the leader as they draw nearer to the fire they could begin to make out the identity of those who be move about andy lasher could be easily see as he always take it upon himself to be the high pin of any gathering of the clan in which he move then there be the fellow who have be catch steal from the trap of jesse wilcox that morning still limp painfully whenever he walk besides these two there be five other boy present a tough-looking bunch mutter jerry as he trail along after frank i do not see anything of bluff though whisper the other over he shoulder perhaps they have get he inside the cabin if you two would agree to stay here i 'll volunteer to creep up back of it and find out say jerry you be all right old fellow just the kind to tie to reply frank oh i do not know any one of you would do the same for I besides i guess -- but then it do not matter will you wait here boy ask jerry draw a little closer then let will have you gun while you be away jerry handed it over a little regretfully indeed he have calculate on carry the weapon himself though it must have be in the way they see he creep off for quite some little time they watch ready to rush forward if any sound announce that jerry have be discover and be in trouble they be get supper do not look like we outfit do it whisper will as he and frank crouch there in the brush wait and watch i should say not still the appetite be the main thing in the wood a hungry man can forgive anything look behind the shack -- be not that something move what frank have say be true for just then jerry creep across a open space and for a few seconds they see he plainly then he daringly slip in through the open door of the cabin doubtless take advantage of the attention of the camper be turn elsewhere come on move up a little i be too nervous now to stay quiet say frank while they be thus advance there suddenly arise a tremendous clamor it appear to issue from the interior of the dilapidated cabin in which andy 's crowd have take up they quarter oh what have happen now exclaim will scramble to he foot look cry frank something come fly out of the door of the shack and landing in a heap roll over and over claw at every object within reach then it sit up and look around in a frightened way why it be ben cooper say will partly relieved and he be meet up with jerry add frank grimly as he watch eagerly to see what else take place in the little opening where the camp have be pitch the boy be all on they foot they seem to be stare at they half-dazed comrade as though hardly able to grasp the real meaning of the condition then andy give a shout hey you feller look at that door go shut the prisoner must have get loose how about it ben cooper what happen to you they 's another feller in there ` side the prisoner he knock I clean silly and throw I out o ' the door whine the other rub he head dismally who be it

hey feller d'ye hear that another of that lot bag in the cabin come on a ' we 'll do he up yell the brawny leader rush forward when he reach the door he try in vain to break it open it seem to be brace in such a manner that he could make no impression on the plank bring I the ax somebody he howl after beat he fist vainly against the panel one of he follower make haste to obey when andy be arouse in this way the bravest of they do not dare brook he anger he immediately swing the implement about he head crash go the ax into the door which begin to split under the vigorous assault as though unable to stand long before such tactic he 'll do it -- he be go to break he way in and i have get jerry 's gun oh dear what shall we do exclaim will stop that chop you shout frank run forward with raise gun chapter x uncle toby fly high here do not shoot shout andy dodge behind one of he companion we surrender cry another throw up he hand frank and will look very threatening as they advance both of they have they gun level and besides the latter be encumber with he camera so that he present the appearance of be fairly load down with war material hey jerry open up call frank the door of the shack immediately begin to move and presently it be shove aside with the ax still stick in its plank just as andy have leave it talk about you rescue party say do not this take the cake exclaim a familiar voice and jerry 's head be thrust out of the opening be bluff there demand frank sure come in the voice of they miss chum a second head have by this time show up hey you franky boy what d'ye mean bombard we camp in this way what have we do to you crowd i would like to know to be treat like dog first there be that bluff master a-walkin ' in here a ' accuse we of steal he blame old gun when the only one we have get be a musket pet own now you come tear up thing andy be evidently get indignant but all the same he keep on the watch and whenever he think he see one of those weapon point in he direction he slip quietly behind one of the other that be all right bluff have lose he gun somebody take it from we camp last night just after a shower of rock come in on we and we rush out to find the fellow who send they he think it be one of you crowd and i guess he come over to ask what business have you tie he up like a convict tell I that frank put this to he sternly at the same time he beckon to jerry to make a start out of the cabin which the other easily understand and set about obey why the silly fool be for try to lick the whole lot of we say as how he know somebody from here have swipe he old gun and that unless we hand it over he would show we say we could not stand for that so we just sail in and make he a prisoner we do not hurt he much no more than he do we suppose the lot of you clear out now and let we alone growl andy grow bolder which we will be only too glad to do we only want to get bluff back there be a sudden brilliant flash and a shout of alarm from the boy about the front of the charcoal burner ' cabin get it all right and i bet it be a dandy exclaimed will he have set down jerry 's double-barreled shotgun when he see what he consider a good chance to get a picture of the group and touch off the little cartridge that allow he to snatch a flashlight picture two or three of andy 's fellow throw themselves flat on the ground under the impression that some one have fire at they still more of they be try to hide behind each other in alarm hey take that feller away will not you he be sure enough to scare anybody out of a year 's growth shout andy wave he arm excitedly but he know better than to try and rush forward while frank stand guard there seem to be a air of determination about that individual that andy do not fancy by this time jerry and bluff have join they chum the latter do not seem any the worse for he long confinement indeed he be grin as though the scare of he enemy over that flashlight have amuse he we be only too willing to go i tell you before that we do not mean to have any trouble with you if we could help it but if you start the ball roll look out yes say will on the heel of what frank have say it be a case of million for defense not one cent for tribute good night fellow and thank you for the grub you give I laugh bluff as he wave he hand mockingly toward the group jerry have recover he gun and in a bunch the four chum walk away the other follow they menacingly for a short distance but every time one of the two armed lad turn there be a sudden scattering when will whirl around and elevate he camera they fall flat to the ground as though really alarm they have turn back announce jerry presently say that be fine of you to come in there and rescue I declare bluff as he catch hold of jerry 's unwilling hand and squeeze it the other seem to be unusually modest for he pull quickly away beat it bluff you know you would have do the same for I i guess i owe you something for make fun of you so much anyhow it be just bully that be what talk about you earthquake and cyclone i do not think anything could beat that scare you give they with you old flashlight stunt will and i reckon it be go to turn out a dandy picture i just want to get that crowd in some outlandish attitude and if it prove what i think i have do it do they hurt you bluff ask frank oh well they act better than perhaps i have any reason to expect we mix up some in the start but they be too many for I you mean the whole lot -- well i should guess yes you have a sweet nerve saunter into that camp and take they all on accuse they of steal too say you do not know that they take you gun do you demand frank n -- no perhaps not admit bluff hesitatingly just surmise like be not it but why that shower of stone if not to get we to run out of camp so that some one could sneak in and take a coveted article -- and what more natural than that my new repeater should be the thing they want say bluff logically as he believe well until you have find some stronger evidence than that i would be a little slow about accuse any of that crowd eh jerry go on frank that be right admit jerry look back just then as if he fancy they might be follow which of course be not the case you do not see any sign of the gun while there do you ask frank no i can not say i do but then they would not be likely to stick my own property under my nose would they i could have they arrest later on for robbery all right suppose we let the subject rest for a while the gun may turn up again sooner or later i have hear of just such queer freak happen in camp now who get the first sight of we campfire and old toby cooking a glorious supper wow i can do justice to it all right they give I something to eat but gracious it be burn and taste horrible not one in that crowd know the first thing about camp cookery and they scorch everything they try say bluff sigh just keep up a little while longer there be not that the fire through that bunch of tree ahead after all you see it yourself first frank that be the fire all right straight this way boy and we 'll be there in a jiffy say will they hurry on i be look to see good old toby but somehow do not seem able to clap my eye on he honest black face declare bluff that be a fact where be he the fire be burn decently and from that i judge he be around somewhere remark frank well break in will you know he act as though afraid when we be start out say something about the big owl in the timber get on he nerve and the varmint prowl around wait for a chance to eat he up i believe the coon be hide in one of the tent afraid to show himself how about that frank be he such a coward demand jerry the other laugh do not ask I he reply shake he head it be not quite fair to give poor old uncle toby away like that but we be get close to the camp now and if he be around i 'll soon raise he like i do before if he be let that supper burn something be go to happen to a respectable color gentleman i know threaten bluff listen to he talk about you fighter this bluff take the cake why not satisfy with try to whip the entire lasher crowd in a bunch now he want to take on poor harmless old uncle toby washington low perhaps after all it be just as well such a blood-thirsty character have be rob of he little pump-gun why he would have clean out the whole wood community give half a chance jeer jerry come now let that drop i be only joking and you know it i would not lay a single finger on old toby 's white wool for world but where be he frank say bluff say there be something in we camp boy ejaculate will at that moment what be that ask frank he interest suddenly arouse well i see something move there -- look now there it be again over just beside the nearer tent whisper will in a awe-struck voice they all see it now keep move all the time boy it strike I that it must be a animal of some sort come from the experienced frank goodness gracious i hope it have not devour poor old toby gasp will well make you mind up on that score for it have not -- _ yet _ just look aloft a bit -- right above where the thing be jump about as if worry something what do you see astraddle that limb eh ask frank triumphantly talk about you treed coon why that be old toby sit up there and hang on for dear life and that object in the camp be i believe a wildcat worry over we fine ham remark frank quietly raise the hammer of he shotgun chapter xi a night alarm oh please do not shoot just yet i be nearly ready exclaim will who have be fumble with tremble finger at he camera while they be creep closer what do you want to do -- shoot the cat with you machine whisper frank the most accommodate fellow in the world yes that be it do not you see it would be the prize of the whole bunch can not you let I give a flash and shoot afterwards beg the ardent photographer frank could not refuse it would be a dandy all right with old toby hang there but look sharp for the cat hear we whisper and be ready to get out hardly have he speak before there come a brilliant flash get he shriek the excite will then come a heavy report close to he ear as frank fire the flash have dazzle all but frank who manage to keep he eye away from it he be thus enable to catch sight of the startled wildcat bound for the shelter of the tree have desert its meal in sudden fright as soon as he have fire frank throw he gun around so as to cover the spot he expect the animal to occupy if by any chance it escape the full effect of he first charge but it jump the other way and might have vanish from view only that jerry fire from he hip there be no time to aim from the shoulder he be down shout bluff as the fierce visitor in the camp roll over and over claw aimlessly as it expire ready to shoot again if necessary the two hunter cautiously advance there be no need of further attention for the wildcat stiffen out under they eye ginger but be not he a beaut exclaim bluff bend over i wonder if there happen to be a mate around say jerry as he bent a anxious look toward the timber close at hand they generally hunt in couple admit frank but in this case i hardly think it can be so for the other would have come to the feast uncle toby come down from he perch rather dubiously as if he fear that the danger might not be all over what happen to you uncle toby ask frank give the other a wink not to joke the old fellow too seriously for he be still tremble yuh see ` twar di way marse frank : dat cat he jest want de ham more 'n unc toby do a ' i naturally let he hab it he jump down from de tree a ' i feel a notion to elevate ` bout dat time don ' know how i gits up dar but ` spect i do fly explain the cook as well as he chatter tooth would permit he mean he aviate upward grin jerry will be pat he camera lovingly oh i do hope it turn out fine he say for that would be a jolly hit i would rather snap off picture like that than shoot a grizzly or a bull moose I for the gentle life i be no butcher talk to I about that will you you be a sport all right will only it happen that you taste run in a different direction from mine do not knock my love of fair play and i will not laugh at you want to snap off every living thing you see to make up a freak collection all right then jerry consider it a bargain i suppose you 'll have a muff make out of this nice fur for somebody continue will stroke the cat have not give it a thought besides half of the honor belong to frank what be that i make a mess of it and the beast would have escape if you have not shoot he on the jump exclaim frank and if you have not wound he how could i have ever have a chance to shoot you can not get out of it old man we 'll share the honor return jerry frank say no more but such generosity only draw he closer to he chum fortunately the supper have not advance far enough to be ruin they be able to save most of the ham which be a comfort frank declare that he wonder at the beast take to smoke pork he could not remember any similar circumstance in all he hunting and conclude that possibly the wildcat must have be unusually hungry it have really be quite a strenuous day and the boy be glad to sit around the big fire and partake of the good supper which uncle toby prepared bluff have to relate he story again and again but it differ little from what he have already tell i make a silly fool of myself i know now and it be mighty fine in you fellow come to pull I out of the hole i drop into if that andy have get my beautiful gun in he camp he be smart enough to keep it under cover i never have even a peep at it but just wait i be go to get that gun back if it take all winter declare bluff he 'll do it too just mark I observe frank nodding to jerry apparently the other be tire of hear about that same gun for he only smile and shrug he shoulder in the morning jerry try he hand at skin the game he have take particular pain to notice just how old jesse wilcox do this sort of thing and be a clever imitator he manage to succeed after a fashion frank meanwhile have make a frame suitable to the size of the skin and upon this the hairy pelt be stretch care be take to keep it in the shade and not near the heat of the fire while dry later on in the day jerry and frank take a stroll through the wood and manage to bring back three partridge and several gray squirrel frank would not let toby cook the latter as the other wish they be always tough for fry unless parboil first after skin and cut up i always put the piece in a pot and boil until tender then take they out dry off and put they in a hot pan in which several piece of salt pork have be first try out i think you 'll say they be all right when you get you tooth in they fellow he remark and they do will manage to take a few view during the middle of the day prowl in the neighborhood of the camp there be a pretty stream not far away and it run over rock and between attractive bank so that half a dozen charming picture present themselves to the eye of the artist the fall have not advance so far as to show sign of ice on the water though there be time when the air be very crisp and frosty bluff have remain in camp pretty much all day he seem uneasy and pass in and out of the tent frequently as though wonder what could have happen to bring about such a mysterious disappearance of he beloved gun sit by the fire for a time he would conceive some idea and jump to he foot hurry into the wood to search a particular spot where he remember have pass over on that never-to-be-forgotten night still when the other return in the afternoon there be the same look of distress upon he face talk to I about a pagan and he idol say jerry aside to frank bluff have the whole show beat i never see such a persistent fellow never he 'll never be happy till he get it jerry remark the other then he deserve to have a bad time declare jerry toss the bunch of game down before will and uncle toby who happen to be do something in common at the campfire that night they have a royal feast indeed it taste all the better because the squirrel and partridge have fall to they own gun and not be basely purchase in the market and doubtless they surroundings have considerable to do with the enjoyment of the dinner will take advantage of the darkness to get a new roll of film in he camera how many have you crack off ask jerry note he occupation three roll so far about half i bring i expect to be careful from now on and try to get choice subject but i know i 'll never find another to equal that wildcat scene oh i hope it be a success reply the enthusiastic photographer so say we all remark frank for it will chase the blues away many a time just to see the look on uncle toby 's face as he cling to that friendly limb gorry but i be mighty glad tuh git my claw on dat limb marse frank wen i seed dem big yaller eye a-starin ' at I a ' heerd dat yowlin ' noise my knee dey jest wobble together nevah could tell how i get up dar reckon as how you say be jest de truf a ' i _ fly _ exclaim the cook able to laugh now at he adventure they turn in early for they rest have be break on the precede night and both the hunter be leg weary the last sound frank remembered hearing be the mournful hooting of the owl the bird seem to have a favorite roosting-place not far away and from time to time the tremulous sound of they call drift through space just how long he sleep frank do not exactly know he awake with a sneeze and sit up rub he eye what be the matter exclaim jerry also start out of a sound sleep i do not know -- why the tent 's full of smoke the camp must be on fire wake up everybody as the two lad come crawl out of the canvas they be startle to discover a heavy pall of smoke rise all around they chapter xii the tell-tale match-safe wake up wake up both frank and jerry shout at the top of they strong voice the other come tumble into view and loud be they expression of dismay at the terrible sight that meet they eye get busy here every one water want and never mind you clothes even while he be speak frank jump into action the night air strike home and make he shiver for he have just tumble out from between the snug fold of he blanket but this be a time when delay might mean the complete wipe out of the camp will give a whoop and immediately vanish again inside the tent he have not go to rescue any of he clothes nor do he even think of get into they but when he reappear it be with he camera hug tightly in he arm meanwhile the other have set to work with a vim there be fortunately no wind so that the fire have burn sluggishly then again the late storm have wet the dead leaf then on the ground and they have not as yet become thoroughly dry so it take quite some time for they to get over smouldering and burst into a vigorous flame we be get it down fellow keep right along hit it hard call frank cheerily even old toby have appear from under the fly where he sleep he have be dreadfully scare at first doubtless under the impression that the mate to the dead bob-cat have invade the camp intent on revenge this feeling soon give way to the desire to see the camp save and he labor faithfully with the rest scatter the smoulder leave beat out the fire with any sort of thing they could snatch up in they excitement they manage to get the flame under control after a little while it have be a most exciting experience however bluff be swing he blanket vigorously and thrash the fire with it effectively though he might later on have some difficulty in get rid of the smudge that this process necessarily produce victory shout jerry when the last vestige of the fire have go under bluff throw he blanket around he shoulder and strut about with the air of a conqueror they have to get up early in the morning if they expect to beat we '' he say proudly talk about you hot time that be a scorcher cry jerry but i be begin to shiver now all right and i advise every one to crawl into he clothes in a hurry then we can talk it over it be a mighty suspicious thing that be what remark frank they be only too glad to take he advice and shortly after the four gather around the revive campfire to exchange opinion they be a pretty smutty-looking crowd but jerry declare that those mark be medal of honor now if we have all be like will here and each rush for he possession the camp would have be a-goner he remark with a reproachful look that be all right fellow and under any other condition i would have be one of the first to assist but i be the official photographer of the expedition and the guardian of those splendid film that must perpetuate we camping trip for posterity he explain hear hear cry frank why do not you lay the outfit down at a safe distance then and help fight the fire with we demand bluff i guess i know enough to take warning from you sad experience they hook you old gun the next thing they 'll be after will be my camera no sir i hang on to that business through thick and thin they 'll have to chloroform I to get my film away and that be so be it a accident ask bluff look to frank for a opinion what do you think jerry demand the leader it could not have be a accident and i be dead sure of it be the reply suppose you state you reason then first we bank the fire down as usual before crawl into bed then there be not a particle of wind to scatter the spark and last but not least those heap of dead leaf be carry here i happen to know that place be just about bare last evening reply the other seriously will utter a exclamation of wonder and alarm do you really mean to say that some fellow would be mean enough to try and burn we camp he ask i would not put it past that andy lasher talk to I about you heathen he be just about equal to any of 'em but do not you agree with I frank certainly i do because i happen to have a strong bit of evidence which i pick up out there close to the burning leave he hold something up a match-box exclaim will do any of you own that pass it around i never see it before declare jerry as he handle the little silver article in which several match still remain well i have then remark bluff suddenly as he stare at the trophy and just as i think here be two initial on it what be they ask jerry show excitement hb that do not cover any of andy 's crowd though say jerry seemingly disappoint the real owner of this match-box be herman bancroft announce bluff i have have it in my hand more than once you know i go with he for a time he want to join we rod gun and camera club but the black ball dish he chance perhaps herman be mad about that perhaps he even follow we up here and have try to get even suggest will that be hard to believe for he be not the bad fellow some people say a little wild but with a good heart i would rather believe he lose it and one of that crowd pick it up say bluff sturdily that be just like you bluff stand up for a friend well i be rather incline to believe the same way anyhow it be a mighty mean dodge if that andy lasher keep on he 'll get in a peck of trouble sooner or later why for such a thing as this he deserve a peppering of shot at a distance say frank indignantly it be criminal that be what we might have be smother in we bed remark bluff or my camera might have be utterly destroy wail will old toby say nothing but he cast many a anxious look around at the adjacent tree as if he have a idea linger under he woolly pate that in some way or other this new disaster might have a connection with the shooting of the wildcat thing assume a normal aspect after a while and only for the scent of burnt leaf no one would dream that the camp have come near destruction but all the inmate of kamp kill kare sleep so to speak with one eye open during the balance of that night there be no further alarm by the time breakfast have be dispose of they could look the matter calmly in the face and it no longer appear in such a terrible aspect as when they be scamper around in they pajamas fight the flame and smoke the sun seem unusually warm this morning so will declare that he mean to tramp over to the lake and try a little fishing since they would have small opportunity to do any of this when the cold wind come again i be on too remark bluff moodily a fellow without a gun be like a fifth wheel to a wagon useless in camp let 's make up some lunch for it be a long tramp and we will not come home until late jerry announce that he want to go over and have a further talk with jesse wilcox after which he might take a tramp in a new region advise by the old trapper as open a possible chance for big game -- perhaps a deer frank declare he would stick to the camp with such vicious character around he secretly think it hardly safe for all of they to go away leave old toby as the sole guardian they have too much at stake since they pleasure would be destroy if the camp be raid successfully reach the lake will spend much of he time take view while bluff set to work try to entice the finny denizen of the water to bite he lure as time go on he be fairly successful and when they eat they lunch he have quite a fair string of fish as the reward of he diligence will prove to be a poor fisherman after all especially when he have he adored camera along for he presently wander off again do not go too far warn bluff as he sit on the end of a log that jut out over the water a yard or more engross with he sport bluff hardly notice how time pass hear a step back of he he call out : i get three more what luck do you have will he hear what sound like a chuckle laugh back of he and before he could turn some one give he a strong push bluff go over with a splash into the lake chapter xiii the come of the storm bluff come up spluttering help help he shout involuntarily as well as a mouth half full of water would permit but there be no one in sight whoever have shove he into the lake have mysteriously vanish though a movement in the bush tell the direction of he flight recover from the shock bluff find that he could clamber out without much difficulty and he hasten to do so he cry have be hear however for presently the sound of some one run wildly come to he ear and will burst into view at sight of the drip fisherman he break into a shout catch a tartar do you and he pull you in oh what would not i have just give to have be here a snapshot of you go over would have be the finest ever shut up it be not a fish at all that yank I overboard somebody give I a shove snapped bluff begin to shiver in spite of the fact that the air seem unusually warm though the sun have disappear behind dark cloud what you be push in stammer will and he gather up he camera in he arm cast a look of alarm around as if afraid lest some hideous form dart into view bent on snatch it away that be the truth i be just sit here when i hear a step think it be you and ask how you have get on then the beggar laugh give I a shove and over i go ` ker chunk ' i let out a yell when i come up for you see i do not exactly know what he might mean to do explain the drip one and i do not blame you a bit but do not you see he at all never have a peep he dodge back so that when i get the water out of my eye he be go i see those bush over there move and know he run off that way will walk over to the bush look cautiously about but see no one sure you do not -- er -- go to sleep out on that log and dream somebody give you a push he query cautiously rat i guess i ought to know but see here perhaps you can prove it declare bluff indignantly how demand the other look down at you foot and see if he leave any trail that be how will immediately do as he be tell say come here there be track all right perhaps you be better up in that sort of thing than i be it be a human be after all and no dream he call bluff hasten to join he why of course just as i say this be where he hurry away you can see the mark of he foot easy and looky there one shoe the right have get a patch on it a piece that run to a point oh i would know that skunk any time from that it be a sure clue i tell you he exclaim but you would better get dry off as soon as you can why you be shiver now get any match mine be all soak say bluff he tooth rattle together i always carry a few yes here they be let I make a quick fire while you jump around to warm up and bluff _ please _ keep you eye on my camera will not you sure reply the other commence to leap and frisk around so as to get he chill blood in circulation again the fire be speedily make and take off he clothes bluff hug close to the blaze while will busy himself in hang up the wet garment though he have more or less difficulty in tear he eye away from the spot where he camera lay close by sometimes we get too much fire then again we want more and more remark bluff as he keep turn around like a roast on the spit for as fast as one side feel warm the other grow chill and i guess that we would better be beat it back to camp as soon as you dud be decently dry i do not like the look of that sky remark will i think you be right there be certainly a big storm come why the air seem dead just like it be in summer before a gale of wind and camp be nearly two mile away from this place do not you think i could put they on now will they feel pretty dry do as you please say the other not willing to commit himself though anxious to be off for the black look of the heaven begin to appall he not a little then here go suit the action to the word bluff hurriedly dress then he secure he nice string of fish and with he pole over he shoulder announce himself ready for the homeward tramp they make all reasonable haste and manage to reach the camp in due time when frank hear what have happen he be very angry some more of the mean work of that crowd i believe it must have be andy himself who push you in a dirty trick how do he know whether you could swim or not he say after the tale be tell oh well it be not a case of swim for the water be not five foot deep and all i have to do be to crawl out again but it be wet you see and a fellow feel mighty uncomfortable all soak just wait i 'll get even with he some day for that trick i have get the rascal located all right one of he shoe have a patch on the sole i would know again a clever idea admit the other in admiration and i hope you find he out no matter who he may be first they stone we camp after that they try to burn we out and now some busybody throw you into the lake what next i wonder you forget the worst thing of all -- the stealing of my gun grumble bluff well i wish jerry be back i hate to think of he wander around in the wood in the storm that be come for it be go to be a corker remark frank eye the darken sky with uneasiness perhaps the old trapper influence he to stay over with he till to-morrow suggest will who be make he beloved camera secure against rain by wrap it in fold of waterproof material bring along for the purpose a bright idea and i hope it be so but you know he say he mean to take in a new locality for a hunt after see jesse well jerry be up to many thing connect with wood life and at any rate he know how to look out for himself and as he speak frank stooped down by the tent what be you do now ask the curious bluff drive these tent peg in deeper there be no tell what sort of wind may be on we listen to that will you say frank thunder as sure as you live pretty late in the year for that be not it oh we sometimes hear it even in winter but you see the day have be unusually close and muggy i feel a storm in the air this morning and i be not surprised but i would be glad to see jerry show up continue the other as he tap each pin a few time to send they in more securely the mutter in the distance increase constantly in volume frank as a old campaigner know what be to be do under he direction toby and the two boy make everything as snug as could be expect they also conceal some dry wood in the hollow of a tree nearby so that later on they might be prepare for make a fire the storm come at last with a furious wind and a heavy downpour of rain wow exclaim bluff as he look out from the tent be not i glad we get here before that come one duck satisfy I i be not greedy the afternoon wane and night come on still there be no sign of jerry frank worry some but stop speak of the matter for he see that old toby be begin to shake with fear as the wind increase in fury and the tent wobble about at a great rate i hope they hold out say frank to himself he even don a waterproof he have bring along and go outside tap the peg all around again everything seem secure so far as he could see still he know that if one peg give the balance could not resist the additional strain and a catastrophe must result old toby be really too much alarm to retire to he fly so frank tell he he could remain with he when the other boy go to they tent none of they expect to obtain much sleep the wind come in fierce gust the tree groan and writhe and once or twice frank really hear a crash in the forest that tell of a rent in the timber i only hope nothing of that kind happen around here a fall tree might pin we all under and be we death he say to himself at length they conclude that it be time to separate and try to get some sleep though both bluff and will declare they know they would not close they eye so long as that howl keep up without and the canvas flutter with each wild gust just as they be about to make a run for it frank catch they by the arm wait he shout for there be a terrible crash close by and the earth seem to tremble as a forest monarch be lay low at the same minute with a shriek the wind descend upon the tent under which they be crouch frank hear a snap above the other sound and like a flash the entire tent be blow away leave the four camper expose to the fury of the storm chapter xiv how jerry be treed jerry that same morning reach the camp of the old trapper without any trouble he do not find jesse wilcox at home but know something of the trapper 's habit he make himself comfortable and wait after a time the other show up he carry a tidy bunch of fur along with he have stop to remove the pelt on the way glad to see ye jerry looky here one fine fox and would ye believe it actually a mink boy that ere pelt orter bring I a twenty all right that be why i be so tickled ye see this shore must be one o ' my lucky day make yerself to hum come to take a snack o ' dinner along with I i reckon eh well i might wait up and have a bite if you do not keep I too long you see i mean to make a roundabout trip into that stretch of wood you tell we about i would like the worst kind to get a crack at a deer that would be worth while jesse then i 'll get busy right away but p ` rap ye would better defer that ere trip fur a day or so lad remark the trapper sweep a eye upward why ask the boy thar 's some sorter storm broodin ' er i be bad deceive in course at this season we do not expect much along that line but i hev see a scorcher come along even in October ten year ago it be and thar be quite some timber level i be tellin ' ye but jerry be build along a stubborn line : have once make up he mind to do a thing it be very hard for he to break away oh i do not bother about a little blow if it come to the worst i can find a hollow tree and keep pretty dry now i want to see just how you cook that stew so i can do it sometime the dinner be a success and of course jerry be hungry heartily enjoy it when the meal be finish he arise and pick up he gun still of a mind to take that long tramp air ye ask the trapper why certainly i have not even think of change my mind return the boy well i s ` pose ye must then only keep yer eye peel for trouble up yonder it be sure goin ' to storm for i feel it in my bone besides thar 's a pack o ' measly wild dog loose in that stretch o ' timber wild dog repeat jerry open he eye wider sartin dog as have stray away from ther home a ' take back to a wild state it happen that way sometimes ther call o ' the wild they name it sumpin ' seem to pull the critter back a ' they break away from human kind to roam the wood a ' hunt ther livin ' i see the pack once or twice a ' i kinder believe ther a-gettin ' more fiercer all the while wild dog eh how many about be there jesse ask jerry finger he shotgun a little nervously from three to five ginerally ye see they come a ' go so ther be not no tellin ' jest how big the pack kin be but ef so be they tackle ye son jest shin up a tree a ' then pick 'em off that be my ijee remark the trapper shake hand after get further direction jerry hasten away it be not long before he find himself in the densest kind of timber in fact he have not see anything like it since come to the hemlock camp here and there be little opening in some of which green grass grow it be here the trapper have tell he he might possibly find a deer feed and as he make he way along jerry keep on the lookout for sign he have be walk much over a hour when he think he catch a glimpse of a deer ahead there be something move there at least and with he pulse quicken the boy begin to slowly and cautiously advance yes it be a deer and feed too the light be none too good under the tree with that dark threatening sky over all but jerry have keen eye and he be just now excite at the prospect of at least get a shot he keep on advance take advantage of every bit of cover that offer to he delight the animal do not seem to pay any attention to he though raise its head several time to sniff the air suspiciously by this time he have gain a position where he believe he could make the buckshot in he gun tell and with as steady a hand as he could bring to bear jerry take aim at the expose side of the deer when he fire the animal fall in its track and give a shout the exultant young hunter be about rush forward to secure he quarry when suddenly he horrified eye discover move figure rush through the undergrowth and head toward the spot where the deer lay still struggle feebly instantly he remember what the trapper have say these then be the wild dog evidently they be hungry and at the time he shoot have be try to creep up on the animal which they yearn to make a meal from jerry mechanically throw out the empty shell and push another into the chamber of he gun he see the pack bolt forward hear the wild clamor that mark they advance and then catch the exultant strain in they noisy yelping as they pounce upon the slay deer the boy feel more indignant than alarm that be _ he _ deer for he have do the stalk up against the wind nor be he at all disposed to allow those greedy cur a chance to tear the quarry to piece in they savage way jerry immediately hurry forward ready to dispute the possession of the game he find the whole pack furiously tear at the fall deer growl and exhibit all the savage nature of wolf when the boy shout they look up draw back they lip and look furious but not one give a sign of obey he get out you brute leave that carcass alone will you he yell wave he gun threateningly as if they realize that this human creature mean to dispute they right to the royal dinner they have find the four wild dog start toward he they present a terrible appearance just then with the blood about they muzzle and white fang expose perhaps jerry may have feel a shiver pass over he but that do not prevent he from raise he gun and deliberately cover the foremost of the brute bang go the gun then arise a tremendous howling together with furious snap sound the balance of the pack continue to rush forward more rapidly than before leave the stricken member to roll on the ground jerry think it high time he make a ascension after the manner of that which have mark the alarm of old toby at the time the wildcat invade the camp but he want to use that other barrel the worst way quickly cover the pack he pull the trigger then without wait to ascertain what the result might be he start to climb this be no easy task especially when encumber with a gun for he would not think of let this precious ally go but there be enough inspiration in the approach yelp and growl of the wild dog to spur he on to heroic effort and as a consequence he manage to get beyond they reach it be a old tree in which he happen to have seek refuge just then however jerry be not care about that for it be a case of any port in a storm and as he say beggar should not be choosers quite out of breath he cling to the rotten limb and proceed to shout at the dog so as to keep they there until he could find a chance to insert fresh charge in he gun when he expect to take care of they hey you with the collar be not you ashamed of yourself to take to such a pirate life when you once have a good home i bet say be not he a jim-dandy of a big bouncer though and as strong as a ox i would just hate to fall into he maw now hang around a few seconds more and i have get a nice surprise for you if you ever know what a gun be i guess you have forget by now in this strain he talk to they and keep both dog jump up at he in the endeavor to get a grip sometimes they brush he dangling foot with they jaw and at that jerry involuntarily draw up a little when he have insert the shell he try to get a chance to cover the big dog that animal though apparently suspect he purpose and keep jump about so wildly that it seem impossible to aim at he the second brute have be wound so seriously that it have crawl away so there be now but two leave finally see a good chance to knock over the smaller one of the pair jerry could not resist the temptation the animal may once have be a family pet but a wild existence of some month perhaps year have take he back to the wild state from which he ancestor have come age ago he be a mangy-looking dirty white brute with eye that seem red to the boy in the tree at the report of the gun the animal fall over in a kick heap for the distance be so very short that the charge of shot have go with all the destructive power of a forty-four bullet but something not down on the program immediately follow the rotten limb upon which jerry be hang unable to stand the strain of he weight and movement give way with a crash he feel a thrill of horror as he find himself be precipitate downward know as he do that the largest and fiercest of the wild pack be still there unhurt save in the way of a few stray shot that have fleck he tawny hide with tiny blood spot chapter xv in a bear 's hollow jerry land with a crash that almost shake the breath from he body realize the need of haste in get upon he foot he scramble erect he have maintain that frenzied clutch upon he gun as if believe that it be he best and only friend in this emergency one thing help he the big yellow hound have be startle first by the crash of the gun so close to he head and then again by the rapid downward plunge of the human figure perhaps some dim recollection of former beating at the hand of some severe master may also have temporarily demoralize the brute at any rate jerry be give just about five seconds to turn the corner and thus place the tree between himself and he enemy then the dog bound forward and a warm chase begin around that same tree with jerry do he prettiest to keep beyond reach of those gleam fang that press closely in he rear in this he manage fairly well but after he have prance around that tree quite a dozen time he make the alarming discovery that he be rapidly be wind he canine adversary on the other hand appear to be as fresh as ever unless something occur to assist he it begin to look very much as though he might trip after grow dizzy and the big yellow brute pounce upon he then a sudden thought come into he mind it be like a inspiration and make jerry laugh right out why of course he gun what be he grip it all this time so desperately for if not because he believe it worth while he try to remember whether he have fire one shot or two after reload it so confuse have he become with all this turn round and round that he could not be absolutely sure but there be nothing for he to do but take chance he feel to see if one of the hammer might be up and find the left one draw back that seem promising for if he have fire both barrel the hammer must naturally be down it might be only imagination but he believe he could actually feel the hot breath of the pursue beast on he leg as he twist around that tree so awkwardly with a prayer in he heart though he lip be mute he suddenly whirl thrust out the gun and pull the trigger fortune be certainly with he that day the dog viciously seize hold of the gun barrel in he tooth and it be just at this instant that jerry press the trigger he see the big beast swirl half-way around then he fall in a quiver heap hurrah it be but a pitiful shout poor jerry give for he be quite out of breath he too fall down in a heap close to the yellow form of he enemy but instinctively he hand work try to place he faithful gun in readiness for further work it be not need besides the big yellow leader of the wild pack he presently find a second brute stone dead and have the pleasure of dispatch both the other shortly after might as well make a clean sweep of it he say with a feeling of have accomplish something worth while for jesse have tell he these rove dog be just as destructive to sheep and other domestic animal as so many timber wolf would have be perhaps the farmer of the community might feel like vote jerry thanks for he good service of that day and not know whether he could find the place again he proceed to cut off the four caudal appendage to embellish he tale as frank later on declare with a laugh guess i have have quite enough sport for to-day jerry remark as he bent over the mutilate deer there be quite as much meat here as i can carry home in fact i have a good mind to hang most of it up out of reach of wild animal we could come for it another time from the look of the sky that storm jesse speak about must be come right along so he determine to make haste while something of a novice at the art of cut up a deer he have a general inkling as to how it should be do accordingly after half a hour 's work he manage to swing the better part of the meat fasten up in the skin to a limb that he make sure be sound now for home with my trophy say perhaps the boy will not open they eye when i show these four tail and get toby to cook some of _ my _ venison this have be a red letter day in my calendar what be that -- thunder i do believe perhaps -- jerry do not even wait to finish he sentence but start off on a lope but the gloom under the heavy timber increase he find difficulty in tell the point of the compass and finally it become absolutely impossible for he to make more than a half-way decent guess as to the quarter where the camp in all probability lay i suppose i be just about lose he at length reluctantly admit still jerry be not one to be easily daunt he have be in situation before now that call for a show of manliness and courage and rather pride himself on be equal to any such occasion the thunder be boom heavily and the rain ready to descend he believe he could hear a distant roar it might be wind tear through the forest or a heavy fall of rain perhaps both at any rate it would mark the breaking of the storm better be find that hollow tree i speak to jesse about he conclude once again luck favor the lad not thirty pace away he discover what seem to be a big stump about twelve foot or more in height it have a opening at the bottom large enough for he to crawl through indeed to he mind it be there especially for the very use he intend to put it run forward just as the rain begin to rattle down all around he jerry proceed to crawl through the aperture he find the interior amply large enough to give he the need shelter what be better the opening happen to be on the leeward side so that the driving rain could not find entrance this be what i call a bully fit talk to I about you cyclone cellar what could beat such a cozy den as this i be as snug as a bug in a rug four wild dog and my first deer all in one day i guess that be my top-notch record all right let she storm all she want so long as the lightning do not take a notion to strike this bless old stump he be say as he mentally shake hand with himself over the day 's achievement after a long time hour it seem to jerry during a temporary lull in the howling of the gale he venture to peep forth everything be pitch black around save when the lightning zigzag through space and light up all creation with its electric torch look like a all-night stand for jerry there come that wind tear thing loose again wow it be a big tree go down that time hope none of they take a notion to knock my poor old stump flat or i would be squashed into a pancake like many other people jerry have a habit of talk to himself under stress of excitement perhaps he believe that in this way he bolster up he courage just as some man whistle when they find themselves tremble in the face of some uncanny peril and there he crouch while the gale blow with renew violence and the night wear slowly on several time there come a lull and he begin to hope the worst have pass when once again the wind would swoop down as though loth to give up its riotous dominion over the stricken forest never have such a storm be hear of in October even the first gale which have demolish the roof of the academy and bring about this two week ' vacation for the boy have not equal this come from another quarter as it do jerry have one bad scare he have block up the entrance as best he could with what stray bit of wood he find around suddenly he feel he barrier move and realize that some wild animal be nose around try to force a entrance for shelter it must after all be the lair of a bear which he have find be this most remarkable day in all he experience to be wind up with a encounter that might dwarf the other into insignificance jerry give a shout at the same time he seize upon he gun and fire one barrel squarely through the opening he think he hear a loud woof but after that there be no further molestation but nevertheless he lay there wide-awake and on he guard should mr bear pluck up courage enough to return he mean to be ready to give he a warm reception time pass and he believe the storm be really diminish in fury it be certainly time for from the various crash jerry believe considerable timber must have go to the ground how thankful he should be to have escape as well as he have why the mere fact that he be lose do not cut any figure in the matter when so many more terrible thing might have happen to he there be really no sense of he leave he snug retreat until dawn come for he could not make he way in the storm-wrecked timber with any hope of success again he poke he way out to take a observation perhaps he be wonder if he shot could have kill the bear but no sign of such meet he strained eyesight when the next flash of lightning come but while he be thus try to pierce the gloom around he he hear a sound that thrill he through and through -- the sound of a human voice call help oh help it come wail through the night chapter xvi heap coal of fire on he head what be that exclaim jerry startle by the cry it come again help oh help somebody the boy be now convince that he have not hear the hoot of a owl and that some one be certainly in need of succor he remember the crash of the tree that have go down in the tempest could it be possible that the unfortunate one have be catch under one of these fall forest monarch and pin to the ground if so no wonder that he cry at the top of he voice for assistance unable to escape he must starve to death or become the prey of wild beast unless help come jerry immediately crawl out of he hole he no longer remember the fact that a bear have recently be sniff at the entrance to the hollow tree all he have in mind be that he might be of assistance to a fellow human being in distress it be pitch dark in the wood though now and then a flash of distant lightning come to momentarily relieve the gloom jerry start in the direction he believe the sound come from now and then he pause to listen and in this way manage to keep go straight hello where be you he cry finally as a dreadful silence fall upon the forest ahead a silence that make he very anxious indeed immediately a voice call out wildly : oh here i be under this fall tree please come and help I i can not hardly move and i think my arm be break do not leave I to die it be all right do not worry for i be not go to run away speak again so i can get to you it be awful dark under here the other take he at he word and commence to rattle on say all manner of thing simply to direct he rescuer to the spot it be andy lasher as sure as i live say jerry to himself as he recognize the other 's voice despite the agony in it so make he way forward he finally come to the tree under which the other be pinion by some of the branch i can not see you it be so dark here wait he say aloud oh please do not leave I now i 'll go out of my mind sure i do not mean to but i must have some light now i happen to have the stub of a candle in my pocket and the wind have die out so i think it will burn if i stick it down low i 'll get you out somehow andy say jerry cheerily he strike a match why be it you jerry sure thing see there that burn all right i guess now i 'll put it here in the shelter of this stump while i look into thing you will not leave I here jerry you be not that kind of a feller i know andy be evidently alarm he could not but remember that there have be bad blood between this lad and himself for a long time indeed some recent event that be not at all to he credit must have crop up to make he anxious not much say you just have the escape of you life i tell you this heavy limb almost hit you in fall if it have then it would have be one two three for you you seem to be hold down mostly by small branch observe jerry after he have make a critical examination do you think you can get I out jerry ask the other very humbly easy just you wait and when i tell you what to do go ahead with that he start operation by break off the smaller branch one at a time he gradually weaken the network that be bind the prisoner every obstacle however small that be remove make thing easier and finally jerry give a pull at the imprison boy andy let out a howl of pain but all the same he come free my arm i be go to look at that now right away if it be break the sooner you get back to centerville and see a doctor the better but somehow i have get a notion it be only badly bruise here bend it back so i can slip it out of the sleeve with much misgiving and many exclamation of agony andy do as he be tell the other then examine it from one end to the other talk to I about luck you have get cause to be mighty thankful andy there be a lot of bruise here but no bone break declare jerry sure you be not mistaken jerry -- 'cause it be awful sore groan the other and yet there be a trace of gratitude in he voice make up you mind it be so now the question be what be we go to do the rest of the night i be in a hollow tree but there be not room for two might manage to make a fire somehow and stand it out think you can walk now andy jerry unconsciously thrust a support arm around the waist of the other and steady he step as they move slowly off in so do he be heap coal of fire upon the head of he adversary andy grunt now and then as some jolt give he new pain but on the whole he be very quiet perhaps he mind be busy and he conscience work overtime so they reach the hollow stump here 's where i be camp all through the storm and mighty lucky for you that i lose my way when out hunting now wait till i dig out some of that dry wood from the inside it will make a capital start for a fire jerry set to work with a vim in five minute he have a cheery little blaze go and more wood dry out close beside it from time to time other fuel be add to the fire until it reach such proportion that it eagerly devour any sort of stuff they choose to feed it this be not half bad because it be get mighty cold after that storm and if you happen to be lie drench through under that tree i reckon you would be shiver some by now eh laugh jerry andy put out he right hand for it be the left arm that have be injure i want to tell you that i feel pretty punk now over the way i have treat you crowd jerry this be mighty white in you and that be what to act as you have with I i be right sorry now i ever lay out to hurt you feller i be not goin ' to keep it up no longer and that be dead certain if pet peter want to he can go it alone i be all in you have make I ashamed jerry understand there be really no need of further word between two boy such thing be instinctively grasp and jerry know what a tremendous effort it must have be for this rough fellow to frankly admit that he have be lead to see the error of he way perhaps the repentance be not wholly genuine and time would swing andy back to he old way but just then sit by that friendly fire he seem to feel very warmly dispose toward the lad whose come may have save he life oh that be all right do not mention it glad to know you mean to let we alone it be all we ask anyway but what bring you away up here andy say jerry andy drop he head and gaze into the fire the other even think he could see what look like a blush mantle he cheek though the chum of the town bully would have shout at the very idea of such a thing i reckon it be some more rotten business jerry to tell the truth i be up to see old bud rabig try to get he to join we in a raid on you camp you see the boy go on hurriedly as though fearful lest he courage might fail he before he get the whole thing off he mind we have try to smoke you out and make a botch of the trick and i even push bluff over into the lake this afternoon to get he a duckin ' 'cause the temptation be too great but it be all up with I now after this i be not goin ' to lift a hand against any of you crowd do you get lose too try to make you way back to you camp ask jerry that be just what i do think i could save time by take a short-cut through the big wood then the storm come down on I and i reckon i get some rattle i lose my head and while i thrash around that pesky old tree come down on I think i be a-goner i give you my word and andy shudder how long do you lie there question the other hour and hour it seem to I i would shout when i could but something seem to tell I it be not no good -- that i just deserve to die right there because i would never be no good to my folk at home or anybody else but you just wait and see i get a light i do think i be sure goin ' to die both boy be soon sleepy for the heat of the fire affect they eye so jerry fix thing to keep the blaze go while they nap roll a log over so that it offer a good chance for the fire to feed in this way they pass the balance of the night nor would either of they soon forget the experience though from different reason in the morning they manage to cook some of the fresh venison jerry carry and for which the other seem very grateful then they figure out they position which be not hard to do since the sky be clear and the sun well up half a hour later andy recognize certain landmark that tell he he could make a turn and reach he camp by the lake shore good-by jerry i be go to skip out here and i be not forgettin ' this either he say thrust out a hand while a queer grin creep over he face jerry hurry on anxious to relieve the suspense of he chum as he come in sight of the camp he pause and stare as well he might for it seem to be occupy by a stranger and he a man with the wild aspect of a madman chapter xvii after the storm whoop all hand on deck to pump ship my camera oh where do i put it grab up the bedding and hustle in under the other tent boy this last from steady clear-headed frank who seem to know just what should be do in a emergency it start bluff and uncle toby work strenuously to keep blanket from get very wet but will could not think of lend a hand until he have first of all lug he beloved camera under shelter it be indeed fortunate that both tent have not go by the board at the same time or the camp must have be plunge into the deepest distress lead by frank they manage to hustle they belongings under the second cover where the driving rain could not reach they by the time all have be do the boy be drip and it take they some twenty minute to get warm again snuggle in they blanket oh what a night wail will a dozen time please let up on that or give we a change in tune it be bad enough to have to stand the storm without listen to a phonograph grunt bluff the hour creep along now and then they doze but sound slumber do not come to a single one of the group uncle toby be quite content to cower as close to frank as possible satisfied that the other be able to protect he he seem to exhibit the blind confidence of a dog in a emergency call for energy to he frank be a type of manliness hard to match will the morning ever come groan will as he shift he cramped position for the tenth time at least well i think we have get a lot to be thankful for declare frank stoutly in the first place no great damage be do for i see that we tent be catch in the branch of a tree close by and we can rescue it in the morning then nothing be spoil that i know of and the storm be really over though morning be some two hour off strike a match and look at he nickel watch can not we have a fire ask will who be shiver under he blanket just think so myself it be get sharp now that the wind have shift into the northwest suppose we make a try answer frank readily it be just in anticipation of such a emergency that he have hide some of the dry wood away where the rain could not reach it frank 's previous experience in woodcraft have teach he many valuable thing secure some of this he quickly have a little blaze the other feed this in a cautious manner so as not to smother it by too much fuel as a result the fire be in a short time burn freely and diffuse a genial warmth around that prove very acceptable to the chill camper even will thaw out under its influence and cease to grumble it be all right too fellow not a drop get in tinder these waterproof he declare as he eagerly examine he precious possession so the morning find they the first thing they do be to rescue the runaway canvas it be find to be intact the pin only have give under the strain so shortly afterwards the second tent again arise and thing begin to look shipshape around the camp seem like a irish wash-day remark will as he survey the various blanket and other thing spread out on bush to dry in the sunshine and air only for jerry 's strange absence i would feel bully remark frank do not you think we would better start out and look for he ask will yes after we have have some breakfast i never like to attempt anything on a empty stomach and besides you see we may have to go all the way over to jesse 's shack before we learn about he observe frank do you really think he be stay there question bluff anxiously for even though he and jerry seem to be constantly bicker deep down in they heart they have a genuine affection for each other as have be prove more than once i hope so be all the other would say and i have get a dreadful fear remark will sigh that the poor fellow 's be catch under a fall tree so many go down last night i 'll hear that terrible crash every time i wake up for a long time to come it haunt I just because i imagine jerry out in it all toby here bang the big spoon on the empty frying pan that be a welcome sound to a set of ravenous boy and they quickly assemble around the rude table upon which the black _ chef _ be place heap of flapjack flank by steam cup of fragrant coffee uncle toby do not seem to relish be leave alone in the camp again but there be nothing else to be do frank give he some advice as to what he should do if any wild beast invade the place and also how he could threaten any of andy 's crowd should they show up with hostile intent then the three boy start off mean to head in a direct line for the distant camp of the old trapper what if we do not find he there ask the skeptical will wait till we get to the river before try to cross i reckon we 'll be apt to find some trace of he there and even if he be catch out in the wood in that storm that be no sign he be hurt or kill jerry know enough to get in out of the wet and depend on it he find shelter somehow somewhere so frank buoy they spirit up in he accustomed cheery way one could easily see that he belong to the optimist family and never look on the gloomy side of thing they have not go half a mile away from the camp before they discover some one move through the bush ahead there he be exclaimed bluff eagerly as he raise he hand to he mouth as if about to give a cooie hold on i do not believe it be there you see it be a man and a hunter too i expect for he be carry a gun interrupted frank perhaps he may have see jerry shall we ask he demand will if we keep on straight we be go to meet he and of course we 'll ask i only hope he have though i doubt it do either of you know he frank ask this because he be comparatively a newcomer in centerville while the other boy have be raise there seem to I i have see he before exclaim bluff why yes it be mr smithson he live in centerville -- that be he family do because he be not home much you see he be one of the warden over at the state insane asylum at merrick what cry frank startled then perhaps he may not be hunting wild animal after all suppose one of the mad inmate of that institution escape and be up here roam through the wood jewhittaker exclaim will turn a trifle pale and hug he camera closer to he breast as though he first fear concern its safety if that be so i hope jerry do not run across he that be all remark bluff come on hurry you have give I a little shock now and we must learn the truth immediately call out to he bluff -- there he see we and be come this way as frank say the keeper be hurry toward they now a anxious look on he face he nod to bluff as he come up camp up here be you boy that be fine use to like to do it myself when i be younger say you do not happen to see anything of a wild-looking chap anywhere around do you he ask glance at each in turn sorry to say we have not mr smithson have one of you charge get away that be just what have happen and i have be chase he all over the country get track of he yesterday just before the beastly old storm hit I he be somewhere around this section right now where 's you camp boy he 'll be pretty sharp set with hunger by now and can scent grub a long way off continue the keeper the three lad look at each other what shall we do fellow do not seem just right to be chase off this way in a bunch and leave that poor old innocent alone in camp what if this crazy man drop in on toby while we be go have we better turn back and later on if jerry do not show up organize another expedition divide we force frank always put thing so clearly that he seldom meet with any opposition that strike I as sensible observe will quickly turn back it be then will you go with we mr smithson we can give you a good cup of hot coffee and some breakfast if you be hungry say bluff i accept you offer boy and glad to meet you now lead the way please because somehow i seem to feel it in my bone that bismarck will gravitate toward some place where there be a odor of cookery in the air he always be a good feeder bismarck ejaculate frank why you see that be what he think and he carry out the part to a dot wait till you run up against he if luck turn that way reply the other he may have be injure in the storm suggest will not he such a cunning fellow would know how to escape a wet back be he consider dangerous bluff inquire a little anxiously well not particularly although he can look mighty fierce and would terrify a timid person possibly and i guess uncle toby fill that bill all right say bluff but there be we camp through the tree mr smithson and as sure as you live there be a stranger standing poke at the fire where we cook be bend down bismarck be make himself at home all right laugh the warden chapter xviii a strange visitor in camp what can we do about it ask will look alarmed it be up to mr smithson remark frank in a low tone look here boy you understand that i want to capture the gentleman very much indeed be you willing to give I a little assistance ask the warden why to be sure we will it look as though we might have some interest in he capture too judge by the way old toby be load up we good grub in those frying pan to suit he appetite he threaten to eat we out of house and home unless something desperate be do we 'll help capture the escape lunatic eh fellow sure we will frank let mr smithson tell we what to do that be all say bluff readily well i hardly think he 'll take the alarm at sight of any stranger so long as he do not get a glimpse of I now if you three just saunter easily into camp and pretend to treat he in a friendly way you 'll find he can be a fine gentleman humor he fail as much as you can boy and what else sir ask frank who be listen intently meanwhile i 'll be creep closer all the while after he have be feed he may feel sleepy because he must have be up all night the heat of the fire and a good feed will make he eye heavy continue mr smithson i guess you be right sir very good suppose you propose that he lie down by the fire and take a nap rig he up a sort of military bed he imagine that bismarck be with the old emperor off in france on the war campaign when he be fast asleep i 'll creep into camp and get he secure it will be easy boy believe I say be he the only one loose ask will just then he voice show alarm why yes so far as i know why do you ask demand the warden because there be some one else crawl through the bush over yonder be you sure ask mr smithson i see he head pop up he be look in at we camp get you gun ready frank some of these crazy people be say to be dangerous continue will humbug if you see any one at all it must have be a scout from andy lasher 's camp snoop around comment bluff disdainfully well perhaps it might be another keeper from the asylum remark smithson there it be again what do i tell you fel -- will stop speak in a whisper and gape true enough a human head have bob up above the top of the bush as the owner of the same endeavor to get a better view of the camp it be jerry ejaculate bluff in excitement mr smithson drop out of sight thinking that the stranger in camp might look that way be attract by the clamor of boyish tongue jerry have catch the word of bluff and immediately turn he head hello fellow howdye and who under the sun be the new manager you have get to run the camp he ask push out to greet they each in turn and eye mr smithson in some curiosity how be you jerry guess you know I all right eh why i be up here look for a escape lunatic you see say that worthy without rise talk to I about you coincidence -- and that be he right there in we camp order poor old scared uncle toby around with the air of a emperor i see it all boy exclaim jerry shake hand around as though he have be go for a full week instead of one night well he believe himself a bigger man than any emperor for he make and unmake king that be bismarck you see young man and we have just be lay a plan to capture he suppose you all saunter into camp now somebody tell jerry what we have decide to do he be look this way and ready to either run or hold he ground accord to how the wind blow come on jerry you can tell we all that happen later we must get rid of this unwelcome visitor first say frank we have just start out to learn what have become of you when we meet mr smithson and he advise we to return to we camp as he rather expect the gentleman he be look for would drift that way awful glad you get through that terrible storm safe old chap remark will what be those thing tie in a bunch at you belt -- scalp query bluff as they walk along together the tail of four wild dog that tackle I in the big timber after i have shoot a deer which they want remark jerry try to speak naturally what exclaim the other in concert oh it be a positive fact boy i can take you to where the critter lie if you want to see they later i be tell about they range that section by jesse who warn I to look out for they i meet the pack all right and i guess they wish i have not here be some of the fresh venison i hang up most of it so we could get it later then we make a breakfast on part of what i be lug home jerry go on we remark frank inquiringly of course andy lasher and myself andy lasher where do you run across _ he _ and how do it come that you let that miserable skunk eat breakfast with you demand bluff well he be in a bad way you see i just happen to get he out from under the branch of a fall tree that have he pin tight to the ground he arm be bruise and we bunk together until morning andy 's get a repentant mood on he he vow he be do play nasty trick on we club ` course i do not know how it will pan out boy say do he tell you anything about my gun ask bluff eagerly jerry turn and look at the questioner no he do not suppose he confess to everything he ever do but here we be fellow and we guest look as if he do not know whether to run for it or hang by that breakfast toby be cooking frank advanced toward the man bow and assume as he believe something of a military air welcome to we camp prince bismarck will not you be seat and wait for breakfast to be serve we have only rude accommodation here but i hope you will pardon any lack of seeming hospitality he say the wild look vanish from the face of the gaunt man and in its place come a expression of tremendous importance indeed but for the seriousness of the situation frank would have feel inclined to laugh outright it be so absurd to see this poor lunatic put on such magnificent air you forget young sir that i be the iron chancellor and that while in the field i shun all the comfort of home life a iron cot the simplest food these be enough for I it leave the brain clear to handle the tremendous affair of state that engross we attention where be king william the other go on oh he 'll be along after awhile perhaps prince after you have partake of we simple fare and rest by we friendly fire a little time the king may join you frank manage to keep a sober face while speak in this lofty way but bluff and jerry unable to stand it any longer turn they back on the couple evidently the lunatic be very hungry in spite of he possession of a iron will he keep turn a wistful eye toward the fire where the frightened black cook be hustle coffee and ham and egg for he benefit and indeed there be such a appetizing odor in the air that several time mr smithson raise he head and look longingly over the bush as though he wish thing would move faster so he could come into camp and get he share when the food be place before he the man eat ravenously the boy afterwards learn that he have not taste a bite for two day and they wonder at he have show even as much patience as he do just as mr smithson have say the escape lunatic become drowsy as soon as he finish eat let I fix a nice cot for you here prince when the king arrive you shall be awaken all right say frank soothingly the man look trustingly at he so that frank feel a little qualm of conscience over the fact that he have to deceive he you be very kind young sir indeed i believe i be weary and perhaps a nap would refresh I if napoleon send out a flag of truce notify I at once and he settle down on the warm blanket with a sigh of pleasure depend on it such shall be do reply frank turn away for he have by this time reach the limit of he endurance and if compel to keep this thing up much longer must have betray himself by laughter in ten minute he fly a handkerchief as a signal that the warden could come in mr smithson grin as he join they it be well do my boy you would sure make a actor all right and now for fear lest he slip I i 'll have to nab he he say do you want any help sir query frank oh i reckon not when he see that i have get he he 'll be as meek as a lamb he look on I as a jealous german general desirous of keep he out of touch with the king watch now he bent over the sleeper and touch he face wake up prince bismarck he say in a commanding tone the other open he eye stare and then smile amiably say : oh it be you be it general fate be against I again i yield myself a prisoner of war you can fasten my hand if you wish but i have dine well for one day chapter xix surprising trapper jesse mr smithson have carry he prisoner off after he too have partake of the hospitality of kamp kill kare boy he say in leave i be sure under obligation to you for all this and any time i can repay the debt do not hesitate to ask I to get bismarck back safe and sound after such a storm be go to be a feather in my cap and only for you i would be hunting he yet with only a slim chance of success why that be all right mr smithson frank have declare heartily we have enjoy help you though it do make a fellow feel bad to see as clever a man as that labor under such a ridiculous fancy he be once a professor in a college and lose he mind through overstudy remark the keeper as he move off with bismarck at he side there see that exclaimed bluff triumphantly just what i have tell my dad many a time when he complain that i be fall behind my class i 'll make certain to hold this up as a awful warning talk to I about you lose you brain by overstudy there be about as much chance of that as my be make king of england laugh jerry but still it _ have _ happen you see that establish a precedent all right and my father as a lawyer be always talk about such thing declare bluff not in the least abashed now suppose you sit right down here jerry and let we have the whole yarn from alpha to omega what you have not be through since you leave we yesterday morning be not worth mention to judge from the hint you let fall a deer four wild dog lose in the big timber storm bind rescue we most bitter enemy and now help to land a escape lunatic -- say you ought to feel satisfied old fellow observe frank jerry laugh aloud all he recent trouble as view from the pleasant seat by the campfire with he three chum around he seem to fade into insignificance well i reckon i be there be a bear too he say nod what a bear -- you run across a bear ejaculate will draw in a big breath and shake this head as if he deplore the loss of a opportunity to embellish he album of the camping-out trip with more fetch view well perhaps you could hardly call it that see that he come look for I try to push into the hollow tree where i have seek shelter from the storm that sound mighty interesting -- try to get in too be he and i suppose you object vigorously suggest frank fall down by the fire and assume a listen attitude i know i have not lose any bear you see and besides there be not room for two in that old stump so i ask he to please go away say jerry with a wink of course he do just that query will after i have shout and fire my gun through the hole he be somewhat surprise at such a rude reception for i guess that stump be one of he den and he think he have the first claim on it well start in now with you get over at the camp of jesse and give we all the thrill you want you have get proof about the deer and the wild dog but perhaps we 'll have to consider the story about the bear laugh frank and andy lasher 's repentance that be the most surprising of all declare bluff shake he head as though he could not understand it at all they sit there spellbound while jerry skim over the entire account of he adventure since quit the camp as the reader already know what befall he it would be useless repeat the story the three chum however listen and exchange look with one another as some particularly thrilling incident come along as though they could imagine jerry face that big yellow brute that chase he round and round the tree until he be dizzy enough to drop ere he remember that he have a gun in he hand i move we go out there right after lunch and get the balance of the venison we may not have another chance to lay in a stock of fresh meat all the time we be up here propose will finally oh i can see that you be doubt my story about the dog and wonder where under the sun i run across these four tail all right fellow i 'll do the best i can to take you to the place perhaps if we go to old jesse he could guide we there much better declare the mighty hunter calmly he talk as though he court a investigation remark frank and in justice to he reputation i think we ought to settle this matter without delay so i be in favor of go for one besides i confess to a curiosity to see the dead dog and perhaps if fate be kind look into the identical hollow tree in which jerry pass most of that stormy night it be a go then cry will eagerly for i want a few more picture if we could only rig up something to look like that yellow hound and have jerry gallop around that tree in front of he it would be simply immense talk to I about a faker will you -- why if will keep on he 'll be bamboozle the public worse than any showman ever do thanks but i guess you 'll have to excuse I from that gallop act will once bit twice shy you know but it be gospel truth about andy he even confess that he have be up to old rabig 's place to get he to join the crowd in play some more measly trick on we here you see he be sorry and have to just tell all these thing all but about my gun hang he grumble bluff indignantly bother you old gun will we ever hear the last of it exclaim jerry frowning and yet give frank a sly wink with one eye as if to inform he that he do not really mean all he say you never hear the first of it yet for i do not even have a single chance to shoot it off complain the other for which all the little bird and chipmunk be rejoice for they have have a chance to live besides a gun like that be dangerous to the community i think if it ever start to go i believe it would spit out fire without any help from you or any one else but for goodness ' sake change the subject i be sleepy declare jerry curl up on a blanket by the fire all of we be i reckon you see we be have a little circus of we own at the time this happen to you remark frank yes exclaim bluff do not you think you be the only pebble on the beach jerry why what happen demand the other look up why what do you think we have get all those thing on the bush dry out for yes one of the tent blow away in the middle of the storm i think it must have be a hour or two before midnight when the big gust come that tear it loose we be all four of we under it and there be some tall scurry just then believe I i can well believe it frank where be will with he camera then ask jerry try to keep the bless thing from get soaked answer bluff then he do not believe in wet plate laugh the other seem not film be good enough for he well we manage to get all the thing under the shelter of the other tent and shiver for some hour finally after the storm pass and it begin to get very cold we start a fire and wait to welcome the rosy dawn do not get poetic frank i be really too dead for sleep to appreciate it now wake I up fellow when lunch be ready will you and so speak jerry curl up again this time in earnest the other amuse themselves the balance of the morning in various way bluff declare that he believe he would stay in camp while the other go off frank look at he curiously as if wonder what have strike he for he consider that the trip be well worth take if only to see the husky-looking wild dog jerry have meet and slay he could remember have hear one or two person speak about the pack that be give the farmer so much trouble to think that after all they comrade have be the one to relieve the situation be pleasant indeed they arouse jerry when uncle toby announce that lunch be ready the old man seem to be keep pretty busy prepare meal for all straggler happen in but that part of the business please he the only thing he protest against be be leave alone in camp there be too many visitor at such time to suit he first have come the wildcat and then the wild man uncle toby have therefore hear bluff 's announcement that he intend remain behind when the other go off with particular pleasure and much relief immediately afterwards the three lad start out jerry seem much refresh by he nap and be as lively as either of he comrade a straight line be keep for the shack of the old trapper and when they finally reach the place it be to find jesse just start out why hello boy glad to see ye he say shake hand all around gravely and i 'll be hang if thar be not jerry big as life i be gettin ' uneasy about ye lad a ' just startin ' to follow up you route through the big timber ye see i kinder think ye might a-fall foul o ' they fierce wild dog i tell ye about both frank and will laugh well he do all right just that same thing and we be on we way now to see where he leave the critter declare will left 'em -- looky here ye do not mean to tell I -- it can not be possible now he fit that hull pack a ' get out o ' it alive exclaim the trapper then jerry with a laugh dangle the four tail before he startled eye chapter xx prove he claim jerusalem i surely believe he be go a ' do it exclaim old jesse wilcox frank and will burst out into a laugh do you recognize these tail then trapper ask the former because we even accuse jerry of try to palm off some substitute on we for the original oh they there be original tail all

mention it ye take the cake jerry a ' now ye want I to lead ye thar i s ` pose can ye describe the place well enough for I to recognize it ask the trapper possibly i can let 's see i remember that there be a queer-looking oak standing close by -- three tree in one as though sprout have grow up when the parent trunk be smash by lightning long ago remember have see anything like that in you trip through the big timber jesse ask the other seriously the trapper smile why it be right easy i know that place as well as i do my own dooryard shoot a stag down by they three oak myself ten year ago come christmas so that be whar ye meet up with the dog pack be it all right if so be ye be ready we kin start right off he remark eagerly all of the other be equally anxious to proceed jerry because he wish to prove he hunting triumph and he chum to see the evidence of he valor will no doubt still hope to induce the victor to attempt some sort of run stunt in connection with the tree and the dead dog that would form the basis of a striking picture go in a bee line as lead by the sagacious trapper who know the wood like a book the little company do not spend more than a hour on the way thar 's yer three oak son now tell we jest whar ye be when ye shot that deer as he speak jesse point ahead all of they could easily see the landmark now it be a old tree and there ought to be break branch underneath yes if you look over yonder you 'll see it and be not there something that look yellow from here ask jerry proudly just what the dog story be found on solid fact then exclaim frank hurrying forward with the other at he heel it be a true tale chime in will from the rear they find the dog just as jerry have leave they the big yellow brute lay under the rotten tree with he head mangled from the discharge of the gun at close quarter the dingy white one farther off and presently jerry lead they to where he have dispatch the other and there be my package of vension all right hang up yonder i be afraid some prowl lynx might get away with it he remark composedly while he two admire chum be whack he on the back admiringly and insist on proudly shake hand with he over and over again now to make a clean sweep come with I and i 'll show you where i pull andy out from under the fall tree he say frank laugh and would have protest declare that he stand ready to believe anything jerry might say after this but the other would not let he hold back i demand that you investigate see here 's where my charge tear up the ground when i fire through the rotten wood to scare the bear away and you can see the plain mark of claw on the old tree-trunk be it so fellow he ask without the least doubt no anania here that be sure declare frank all right now walk this way only a short distance i hear the yell you see above the racket of the storm and that tell I the one who shout must be near by there be the fall tree think what a narrow escape andy have from be crush to death and it be easy to see where you drag he out why here be the print of he shoe in the mud as plain as type remark frank where ask will show sudden interest and then after get down to look at short range he laugh say : everything be just as jerry say i know it be andy he pull out from under this tree how do you know demand the party in question curiously why you see it be andy lasher who knock bluff off that log into the lake we guess it at the time and he afterwards say as much to jerry here well we find he footprint and you see one of he shoe have a queer patch on the sole a sort of triangle here it be as big as life he point triumphantly downward frank fairly shout and even jerry grin talk about you great detective why they be not in the same class as we chum here you see fellow truth will out what more proof do you want demand jerry everything have be prove you be the hero of the hunt jerry i pass up my claim when you be around and so andy means to let we alone do he can he speak for he whole crowd too query frank i do not know perhaps not he say something about pet peter have to do it himself if he insist on carry on this nasty business of bother we so perhaps we may have more trouble with they unless andy take the bit in he tooth and lick a few of he pal will be meanwhile busily engage with he camera he first of all drag several of the dead dog around until they present a gruesome appearance bunch close together oh if you would only run around that old tree a few time jerry you do not know how much obliged i would be of course any one must imagine that the dog pursue you happen to just be out of sight at the time i snap you off but think how much pleasure the picture will give future generation _ please _ do he beg what do i care about future generation it would give I the nightmare every time i look at the measly thing i guess you would feel the same way if you just imagine you be go to have a piece gobble from you leg with every revolution you make nixey for I old chum observe the other indignantly then if you will not i suppose i 'll have to take a still picture but it be really too bad however i have other of you and some day i 'll try a composite picture insert you in the honorable position you decline to fill grumble will as he press the button and secure he view of the venerable tree with the clump of dog near its base talk about you obstinate chap do you ever see the equal of he when i decline to do the tall run act he be go to get out a fake picture anyway with I in it in that case i might as well stand for it here you i 'll conspire with you to fix it if it be get to be a counterfeit let 's make it a decent one so after all will 's persistency win out you 'll be glad when you see the result i be sure he say as he assist jerry to stand the dead hound on he stiffened foot and make it appear as though he might be stretch out in furious pursuit of some one now let I get start wind up around the tree tell I when the humbug business be over with growl jerry begin to circulate over the same track he have cover on the precede day at such a speedy pace this matter be soon adjust to the complete satisfaction of will though he seem determine to get result judge from the several click that announce he rapid-fire work with the camera the boy decide that there be no need of go back to the shack of the muskrat trapper again while they be just half the distance from they own camp jesse wilcox direct they so that there be small chance of they go astray and besides jerry have be over the ground before on this very morning i wonder whether he 'll bother take the pelt of those four dog venture will as he and he two friend walk briskly along hardly dogskin may be valuable but the buckshot in my gun just about ruin those for any use all but the yellow fellow i have to laugh at jesse when he see these tail he eye be like saucer declare jerry chuckle all right it be a pretty clever piece of work and he know it if that big hound have ever lay hold of you -- ugh i do not want to think of it let 's talk about something pleasant -- bluff 's pump-gun for instance remark frank he eye meet those of jerry and the other turn red in the face i do not see anything pleasant about that subject goodness know we hear enough of it from he what d'ye suppose he want to stay in camp for he demand perhaps to cudgel he brain in order to remember whether he could have take it with he when we run out of camp that night or perhaps to give another look around suggest frank dryly good luck to he then continue jerry he ought to employ the great american detective will here who discover thing by the print of a foot possibly he could follow up the trail of the thief until it lead to the lose gatle gun it would have be a good idea if take at the time what be this plain trail lead to ask frank i think it lead direct from the hemlock camp to where andy 's crowd hold out reply jerry who know considerable about this region be we far away from the lake then it be some closer than we camp this trail have be travel more or less lately too that prove those fellow have be back and forth they be bind to spend pretty much all they time while up here try to make life miserable for we we turn to the leave here fellow and go right along this way the other two after a look along the trail that lead to the lake camp be just start to follow jerry when they hear a muffle cry look hastily around to they great astonishment no jerry be in sight and in the trail they discover a gaping hole which be partly cover with a layer of slender stick thickly strew with dead leaf chapter xxi down the old shaft he be go cry will aghast what sort of a trap have he drop into exclaimed frank he be a lad of action and throw himself down flat he crawl to the very edge of the gaping hole hello jerry he shout i be all right fellow only bruise a little and my feeling considerably hurt i deserve something for forget this hole come a voice from out of the depths frank look down he eye be accustom to the sunlight he could not see anything but darkness there but even as he be try to pierce this a match flame up and he discover he chum kneel on a pile of dirt hold up he improvise torch as though curious to look around what be this place jerry demand the one above why will must remember if he once get he mind off that miserable old camera of he it be the shaft of what be intend to be a mine reply jerry with disgust plainly mark in he tone a mine -- and here i never hear of it echo frank that be because you be a newcomer in centerville year ago -- oh i could not say how many -- a crank live in the little hut close by now occupy by the family of a lumberman he believe there be gold in this region for nearly a year he dig down and make this shaft then he die in he cabin and no one else ever have faith enough in the thing to continue the work say will chime in what do you mean to say this hole in the ground have go all these year as a trap ready to swallow any pilgrim who walk along this trail demand frank why of course not the boy from town often use to come up here will have be down in this hole and so have i before it be cover with heavy plank then somebody have remove those board and lay a fine trap just like we be over in africa among the wild-beast catcher and i fall in worse luck grumble the boy at the bottom of the shaft i see and you think those fellow in the other camp have a hand in it do not doubt it at all you know yourself it would be just like that pet peter if i would only thought of the bloom old thing in time i might have investigate talk to I about you alpine climber i think i be go into the crevasse all right but how be you go to get out ask frank always practical a fellow can not climb out i know that for we use to try it somebody always have to put down the long pole that we make into a ladder declare will be it around here now continue frank wait and i 'll give a look will very carefully place he camera with its accompany case of film he make sure that it be out of the way so that no one might incautiously step on the same and ruin he heart 's delight then he pass into the bush to scour the immediate neighborhood meanwhile frank bent over the edge again i have examine this cover up here jerry and there be not the least doubt but that it be make with a distinct purpose he declare i reckon it be and it get I all right it look just like the rest of the trail and i never suspect a thing until i find myself go down speak to I about that will you to think that i be catch by such a shabby trick if it have be you now it would not seem so bad because you never see this hole before but what object could those rascal have have in construct the trap pursue frank seek more light that be hard to say i imagine though they expect to just badger we from time to time until finally we all set out in full chase of the crowd then perhaps they mean to lead we along this old trail avoid the pit themselves and have we tumble in pell-mell it be a clever dodge but a mean trick all the same but if that have happen it might have be serious one of we could easily break a leg or a arm in such a tumble expostulate frank huh little those fellow care about that they be a rough lot you know that pet peter think everybody be make of iron like himself say i hope will find that old ladder we use to play with i would hate to lie in here wait for you to go all the way to camp and get a rope grumble the imprison one i hear voice and i reckon will must have meet some one yes there they come with the ladder demand jerry eagerly they seem to be carry something between they why i ought to know that fellow as sure as you live it be andy lasher declare frank somewhat surprised then it be all right i be satisfied say jerry resignedly the other come forward and as frank have say they bear between they a long slender tree upon which many slat have be nail by the boy this form a rude but effective ladder upon which one might ascend and descend when desirous of see what the interior of the abandon shaft be like i come across andy down the trail only for he i guess i would never have light on the ladder for they would carry it some distance off and hide it cry will andy look frank straight in the face and the latter explain : it be mighty funny but you see i remember about this here trap the boy have set hopin ' some of you crowd would take a tumble i tell 'em i would not stand for it after what have happen so a bunch o ' we be on the way out here to put back the plank when we hear shout and guess somebody have fall in the rest dodge into the bush but i commence to run this way then i meet will here and we get the ladder he be only too willing to help go on will plainly fully believe in the change of heart on the town bully 's part say that be all mighty interesting but talk to I about it after you get a fellow out of this black hole i think i feel a snake right then we use to kill 'em in here too poke the ladder down boy please that be a fact as the drown boy say : ` save I first and scold I afterward ' let I give you a hand boy remark frank hey be careful there about get

the outdoor chum in the race for the hemlock camp andy say nothing but the manner in which he put he finger on he lip as he turn he head be indicative of silence he lead they forward in such a way that the cabin stand between they and the spot where several boy seem to have cluster interested in something when they look around the corner of the hut they count five in the bunch it be pet peter a

be get a edge all right now would not little willie milton weep tear if he see I a-doin ' this to he property and he bent down to sever the cord at one vicious blow frank think it high time to interfere these unscrupulous boy would not hesitate to destroy all the result of will 's hard labor and in fact take the keenest delight in wring he heart by so do there be only one way apparently to stop the desecration and save those precious film from destruction although oppose to violence on general principle still frank know very well that there be time when it become necessary for every one to stand up boldly for he rights he give a nudge to jerry which that worthy understand as a signal to be ready accordingly jerry raise he shotgun until he have cover the group in front of the cabin and then wait for the word step out and hold they whisper frank in he ear and the four boy make a sudden appearance from behind the shack now look pleasant please you fellow exclaim frank as he make sure that he have he gun hold on a line to cover the leader of the rebel in andy lasher 's camp chapter xxiii more sign of trouble pet peter look thoroughly frighten when he see that he have be catch in the very act of open another 's property the truth of the matter be he have be warn of late by the town authority that on the very next occasion when catch take thing that do not belong to he they would send he to the reform school do not you dare cut that string say frank sternly or i will not answer for the consequence pet peter the boy with a scowl throw the package down alongside the camera there be yer old shebang i be not do it a speck o ' harm be just kiddin ' anyway know will be around a ' jest want to make he squeal he declare of course it be a barefaced falsehood as every one understand but it seem to be the natural thing for a fellow like pet to say he always squirm out of a scrape that way while andy have at least show a certain amount of boldness when catch will step up and claim you property if it have suffer any damage i be go to make he pay for it if i have to take he all the way back to centerville continue frank eagerly do the one address walk forward and pick up both camera and package of film he be within three foot of those five boy yet never a hand be outstretch to hinder he they know better those grim gun that bear upon they and the angry face of jerry

could not have be repair sing out the delighted will ready to almost dance with joy which be a lucky thing for they then now i do not know why we should hang out here much longer we have get we own and the air of this camp be not quite as nice as i would like shall we go fellow ask frank might as well answer jerry but before we do i think these chap ought to be tell that the sheriff promise to drop in and see we to-morrow and that if there be any more of this humbug and annoyance try i be go to ask he to take the whole bunch back to centerville and i promise to prefer a charge of malicious mischief against they and a attempt to destroy property incendiarism be a crime especially when life be place in peril and one of we might have be burn while we sleep add frank severely there be exclamation of alarm from the cower boy they have be intimidate by the gun of jerry and he chum but this new source of danger chill they ardor wonderfully i reckon we be not goin ' to try any more trick feller think we would have a leetle fun out of this campin ' business but seein ' as how ye take it so hard we would better draw off muttered pet completely humble yes ` fun for the boy but

well come along boy and andy thank you for help get jerry out of that hole he thrust out he hand to the other as he speak but andy do not take it be not get anything to do with the rest of ye but jerry he save my life i tell he i be goin ' to quit naggin ' he crowd a ' so i be but that do not mean i be a turnin ' a saint right away pet here be itchin ' for a lickin ' a ' i get a good notion to

as you leave we alone we will not bother you in the least i give you my word say frank come on you fellow cry will i be anxious to get away from here that pet give I the cold creep when he come so near ruin my film ugh I for the comfort of we own camp no one want to linger even jerry be glad to turn he back on the old cabin and stalk away with he gun over he arm say call will over he shoulder a few minute later as they be push through the wood and follow the back trail well what be it ask jerry we forget something boy '' continue the other what be that demand frank come to a stand why when we be about it we ought to have demand that they return bluff 's dandy repeat shotgun say will thereupon frank break out into a laugh and turn upon jerry hear that will you he remark as if tickled oh rat there be that bless old gun bob up again will i ever hear the last of that machine exclaim jerry shrug he shoulder not till the ghost be lay i suppose jerry remark frank jerry walk along at he side still grumble as if he have a difficult matter to solve and could hardly make up he mind thus they come to the spot where the late catastrophe have take place the hole gape at they in the trail say this be a dangerous thing to leave uncover some one else might fall in perhaps one of that lumberman 's kid if they happen to be play hereabouts remark frank as they pause to look down once more into the dark depths i would not want my worst enemy to slip over that edge my but it be a queer sensation i have when fall let 's cover the hole up again remark jerry if we can find the plank it would be a good idea echo will they start a search immediately when andy and he follower have remove this cover to substitute the frail one of slender stick quilt with dead leaf and a scattering of soil to deceive the eye they could not have take the board far away i be dead sure they be not in the hole observe jerry as they hunt lucky for you they be not as you might have break a leg in striking hard plank instead of soft soil remark frank here they be boy sing out will just then it take but a short time for they to carry the heavy plank back to the place and cover up the hole the crazy gold-hunter have dig so many year ago hope those silly will not think to steal they off again they might trap one of that lumberman 's kid and then the penitentiary for theirs for sure say jerry as he make sure the cover be secure on all side i rather think they have have a lesson this time and will not be in any hurry to repeat the dose laugh frank come along boy somehow jerry seem to lag behind the other what be the matter with he ask will turn he thumb backward over he shoulder perhaps conscience be at work jerry have queer freak you know wait and see what develop answer frank mysteriously and although he companion try to get he to say more he absolutely decline it be a short time after this that they hear the boom of a gun hunter abroad somewhere around there go a second yes and a third game must be plenty where they be remark will frank do not reply but the other saw that he be smile as if he thought might be pleasant just then i just bet he be thinking of my sister violet be what pass through the mind of the boy but for once he be wrong they finally arrive at a point not a quarter of a mile from camp frank turn to see if jerry be come along for he have not hear a sound from he how about that venison you insist on carry i hope you do not leave it in that miserable pit now for i be calculate on have a feast for supper he ask see that jerry still plod along close by i have get it on my back all right so do not worry boy and honest now come to think of it i really believe the bundle save I from a worse shock than i get i land on it if you please do not know how it beat I down but it serve as a fine old buffer i look on that bless deer as my best friend listen exclaim will just then all of they could hear what seem to be shout ahead they certainly come from the direction of the home camp now what do you suppose have happen there this time can not we ever take a little saunter through the wood without the camp be make the theater for all sort of strange drama -- wildcat lunatic and now what exclaim jerry i think it would be just as well for we to sprint along and find out that toby seem fate to get into the queerest scrape ever hear of here go with which frank begin to run the other keep close at he heel and as the outcry increase they even put on additional speed burst out of the timber to see as strange a spectacle as ever greet the eye of woodsman return to they camp chapter xxiv what bluff do why it be a bear exclaim jerry as the three boy come to a standstill on the border of the camp it sure be and nothing less admit frank he face begin to pucker up with the advance stage of a laugh oh if i can only get my camera on he -- what glorious luck breathe will as he tremble finger work to drag the little black box out of its cover the bear be busy just then in fact exceedingly engage he have take to turn thing over around the fire just as though some one have give he a sheriff 's search warrant and he mean to use it to the limit he be hungry all right look at he get away with the corn uncle toby be just go to cook for supper say that must be the same old critter i interview while i be cage in that tree say jerry tickle at the think what make you think so demand frank he be so curious and so persistent you see besides i do not believe there be another bear within ten mile of here oh it be my old friend you just bet and that mean i ought to have the privilege of slaying he do not be piggish jerry let some of the rest of we do something or other remark frank with a touch of satire in he voice he have he own gun handy and mean to have a share in get a supply of bear meat for the camp larder do you see uncle toby i 'll be bless if he have not go and make a ladder and have use it to climb up in that tree yonder declare jerry snicker sensible old toby if i have to make shift to be a monkey as often as he have i think i would have a ladder too save considerable trouble you see and the wear and tear on he clothes count too but do not we leave bluff in camp -- i do not see anything of we pard do you boy a sharp click close to frank 's ear announce that will be at he old trick again he have snap off a view of the shaggy visitor squat there with the open kettle between he paw scoop up its juicy contents with evident relish can corn be a treat that do not come he way every day and bruin mean to make the most of he opportunity i think i have a glimpse of something move over there back of the tent and it might be bluff i hope he do not try to shoo the old varmint off before we get a whack at he i have only get bird-shot in my gun but at close quarter that ought to do as well as a bullet eh frank ask jerry excite at the prospect wait i have a notion that you may be surprised yet i have also a hunch my boy that there will be another claimant for the honor of this campaign sometimes surprise spring out of the very earth watch say frank lay a hand on the gun of he chum as though impel he to hold he fire suddenly there be a loud bang the bear roll over in a heap regardless of the congregate tinware that be consequently send scurry to the right and to the left who fire shout the amaze jerry look out fellow the old rascal 's up again and i guess i would better get behind a tree with my camera exclaim will suit the action to the word with commendable rapidity bang go a second discharge at this juncture and the bear now turn bit savagely at its hindquarter as though its wound smart severely immediately a third discharge follow the other bruin have by this time apparently sight the party from whom all these stinging cut must have proceed he give a roar of rage and lumber awkwardly across the space start to try and climb a little tree just alongside one of the tent it be bluff and he be up in that tree shout will as he peep around he own shelter and take in the picture with another click but -- he be get a gun stammer jerry of course he have do not he bring one with he perhaps a good fairy may have give he a tip as to where it could be find there he have fire again and that time he miss for the range be too close frank as he be speak commence to advance into the open looky out marse frank he chaw yuh up clean suah bawl uncle toby from the crotch in the tree where he ladder have allow he to reach git up heah honey whah he can not reach yuh dat b ` ar be ma-ad clar t ` rough four time he be shoot -- do not i say he could not hit the side of a barn think of he carry a gatle gun say jerry but he _ have _ hit he more than once look how the brute be bleed and just to think jerry he be get two more chance those pump-gun do not seem so very bad in a emergency laugh frank who seem to be enjoy the little affair very much indeed there go one more and the bear still live talk to I about that will you if he do not shoot its stub of a tail off that time what next i wonder why not execute the poor beast scientifically and not murder he by inch he move he gun forward again as though bent on shooting frank however would not let he raise the weapon wait i say give bluff one more chance make allowance for he excitement and he position while the bear be shake that tree so if he miss again we will both fire together and put a end to the comedy before it turn into a tragedy that be what it will be if bluff ever drop down into those claw why do not the duffer shoot i can not stand it much longer i tell you hold hard i have no doubt he be wait to get a good show when the bear stop rock that tree for a second there now a sixth roar drown frank 's last word this time bluff must have steel he nerve and cover the side of the bear for with the report the animal keel over make a vain attempt to get up again give a few kick and then lay still hurrah bluff have kill he bear yell frank rush forward and swing he hat excitedly come down here and stand over the fall beast while i immortalize you as the mightiest nimrod of they all call will rush up with he camera ready to do the business with neatness and dispatch jerry say nothing he look a bit dejected as he stand there and survey the dead bear it be not envy that grip he soul either for jerry be generous by nature something else have seize upon he and frank smile as though satisfy with the way thing have come out bluff come scramble down from he uncertain perch look wild be he really dead fellow just to think that after all i do it with my new repeat shotgun be not it a dandy though if jerry have not go to work and hide it away i might have down all the game that be come into this camp he say look upon the black hairy beast with a shudder for he have have quite a severe fright while sway to and fro with a angry bear beneath wait for he to drop like a ripe persimmon as jerry afterwards describe it jerry shout will in blank amazement yes he stick the gun in that long box over there you remember he fall over it and bruise he shin that be what give he the miserable idea i suppose anyway he do it while the rest of we be out in the brush hunting for the fellow who throw those rock into we camp declare bluff scowl at the author of he woe jerry laugh a little forcedly it be true i suppose i might as well own up bluff i be the guilty wretch all right the temptation come to I and i do the job without think what it would mean to you honestly i have feel sore about it more than once since and have just about make up my mind to confess when by some accident it seem you find it but you do not know it all i hide the gun and then when i go to see if it be safe it be go i do not know what to make of that but fancy somebody else in camp have take it then i commence a search and i find the gun down near that hole i rather think some of the lasher crowd come and take the gun but i be not sure after i find the gun i bring it to camp and put it in the box again i take back some of the hard thing i have be say about that weapon she can shoot all right and in the hand of a expert might as i say clean out all the game go frank tell I to take another look around just before you fellow leave camp i do not have the heart to until a little while back and be delighted to find the gun under those piece of canvas in the box it be not wet a bit in that hot old storm we have either continue bluff again as be contemplate he quarry and then puff out with honest pride say be it you shoot a little while back ask will just then because we hear a lot of shot somewhere around why yes i get uncle toby to stand behind a tree and throw up the wash basin half a dozen time while i banged away yes say frank pick up the article in question and to judge from the hole you put through it we 'll have to do without a basin during the remainder of we stay in camp but how do you suppose this bear wander into camp reckon dat he jest smell de cawn marse frank w ` en i open up de can a ' by gorry dat b ` ar he can not resist de temptation to hab some i see he comin ' foh I a ' i jest
