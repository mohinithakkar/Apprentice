and neither lead to the right hand nor the leave no question but you have neither lead to the right hand nor the left but as a man should say walk uprightly but it should appear by these plaintiff that you have have some wrong : if you love you spouse entirely it should seem you affect he fervently and if he hate you monstrously it should seem he loathe you most exceedingly and there be the
