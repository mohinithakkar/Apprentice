do be the best of whatever you be we all dream of great deed and high position away from the pettiness and humdrum of ordinary life yet success be not occupy a lofty place or do conspicuous work it be be the best that be in you rattle around in too big a job be much worse than fill a small one to overflow dream aspire by all means but do not ruin the life you must lead by dream pipe-dream of the one you would like to lead make the most of what you have and be perhaps you trivial immediate task be you one sure way of prove you mettle do the thing near at hand and great thing will come to you hand to be do if you can not be a pine on the top of the hill be a scrub in the valley -- but be the best little scrub by the side of the rill be a bush if you can not be a tree if you can not be a bush be a bit of the grass and some highway some happier make if you can not be a muskie then just be a bass -- but the liveliest bass in the lake we can not all be captain we have get to be crew there be something for all of we here there be big work to do and there be lesser to do and the task we must do be the near if you can not be a highway then just be a trail if you can not be the sun be a star it be not by size that you win or you fail -- be the best of whatever you be _ dougla malloch _ the house by the side of the road this poem have as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people it be a paradox of life that by hoard love and happiness we lose they and that only by give they away can we keep they for ourselves the more we share the more we possess we of course find in other people weakness and sin but we best means of cure these be through a wise and sympathetic understanding let I live in a house by the side of the road where the race of man go by -- the man who be good and the man who be bad as good and as bad as i i would not sit in the scorner 's seat or hurl the cynic 's ban -- let I live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man i see from my house by the side of the road by the side of the highway of life the man who press with the ardor of hope the man who be faint with the strife but i turn not away from they smile nor they tear -- both part of a infinite plan -- let I live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man i know there be brook-gladdened meadow ahead and mountain of wearisome height and the road pass on through the long afternoon and stretch away to the night but still i rejoice when the traveler rejoice and weep with the stranger that moan nor live in my house by the side of the road like a man who dwell alone let I live in my house by the side of the road where the race of man go by -- they be good they be bad they be weak they be strong wise foolish -- so be i then why should i sit in the scorner 's seat or hurl the cynic 's ban -- let I live in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man _ sam walter foss _ from dream in homespun four thing what be the quality of ideal manhood various people have give various answer to this question here the poet state what quality he think indispensable four thing a man must learn to do if he would make he record true : to think without confusion clearly to love he fellow-men sincerely to act from honest motive purely to trust in god and heaven securely _ henry van dyke _ from collect poem if the central idea of this poem be that success come from self-control and a true sense of the value of thing in extreme lie danger a man must not lose heart because of doubt or opposition yet he must do he best to see the grounds for both he must not be deceive into think either triumph or disaster final he must use each wisely -- and push on in all thing he must hold to the golden mean if he do he will own the world and even better for he personal reward he will attain the full stature of manhood if you can keep you head when all about you be lose theirs and blame it on you if you can trust yourself when all man doubt you but make allowance for they doubt too if you can wait and not be tire by wait or be lie about do not deal in lie or be hate do not give way to hate and yet do not look too good nor talk too wise : if you can dream -- and not make dream you master if you can think -- and not make thought you aim if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposter just the same if you can bear to hear the truth you have speak twist by knave to make a trap for fool or watch the thing you give you life to broken and stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tool : if you can make one heap of all you winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss and lose and start again at you beginning and never breathe a word about you loss if you can force you heart and nerve and sinew to serve you turn long after they be go and so hold on when there be nothing in you except the will which say to they hold on if you can talk with crowd and keep you virtue or walk with king -- nor lose the common touch if neither foe nor loving friend can hurt you if all man count with you but none too much if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds ' worth of distance run yours be the earth and everything that be in it and -- which be more -- you 'll be a man my son _ rudyard kiple _ from rudyard kipling 's verse 1885-1918 invictus triumph in spirit over adverse condition be the keynote of this poem of courage undismay it ring with the power of the individual to guide he own destiny out of the night that cover I black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever god may be for my unconquerable soul in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not wince nor cry aloud under the bludgeoning of chance my head be bloody but unbowed beyond this place of wrath and tear loom but the horror of the shade and yet the menace of the year find and shall find I unafraid it matter not how strait the gate how charge with punishment the scroll i be the master of my fate : i be the captain of my soul _ william ernest henley _ it could not be do after a thing have be do everybody be ready to declare it easy but before it have be do it be call impossible one reason why people fear to embark upon great enterprise be that they see all the difficulty at once they know they could succeed in the initial task but they shrink from what be to follow yet a thing begin be half do moreover the surmount of the first barrier give strength and ingenuity for the harder one beyond mountain view from a distance seem to be unscalable but they can be climb and the way to begin be to take the first upward step from that moment the mountain be less high as hannibal lead he army across the foothill then among the upper range and finally over the loftiest peak and pass of the alp or as peary push farther and farther into the solitude that encompass the north pole so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if you heed not the doubter meet each problem as it arise and keep ever with you the assurance _ it can be do _ somebody say that it could not be do but he with a chuckle reply that maybe it could not but he would be one who would not say so till he would try so he buckle right in with the trace of a grin on he face if he worry he hide it he start to sing as he tackle the thing that could not be do and he do it somebody scoff : oh you 'll never do that at least no one ever have do it but he take off he coat and he take off he hat and the first thing we know he would begin it with a lift of he chin and a bit of a grin without any doubting or quiddit he start to sing as he tackle the thing that could not be do and he do it there be thousand to tell you it can not be do there be thousand to prophesy failure there be thousand to point out to you one by one the danger that wait to assail you but just buckle in with a bit of a grin just take off you coat and go to it just start to sing as you tackle the thing that can not be do and you 'll do it _ edgar a guest _ from
