produce by lionel g sear uncle bernac a memory of the empire contents chapter i the coast of france ii the salt-marsh iii the ruin cottage iv man of the night v the law vi the secret passage vii the owner of grosboi viii cousin sybylle ix the camp of boulogne x the ante-room xi the secretary xii the man of action xiii the man of dream xiv josephine xv the reception of the empress xvi the library of grosbois xvii the end chapter i the coast of france i dare say that i have already read my uncle 's letter a hundred time and i be sure that i know it by heart none the less i take it out of my pocket and sit on the side of the lugger i go over it again with as much attention as if it be for the first time it be write in a prim angular hand such as one might expect from a man who have begin life as a village attorney and it be address to loui de laval to the care of william hargreave of the green man in ashford kent the landlord have many a hogshead of untaxed french brandy from the normandy coast and the letter have find its way by the same hand ` my dear nephew loui ' say the letter ` now that you father be dead and that you be alone in the world i be sure that you will not wish to carry on the feud which have exist between the two half of the family at the time of the trouble you father be draw towards the side of the king and i towards that of the people and it end as you know by he have to fly from the country and by my become the possessor of the estate of grosbois no doubt it be very hard that you should find yourself in a different position to you ancestor but i be sure that you would rather that the land should be hold by a bernac than by a stranger from the brother of you mother you will at least always meet with sympathy and consideration ` and now i have some advice for you you know that i have always be a republican but it have become evident to I that there be no use in fight against fate and that napoleon 's power be far too great to be shake this be so i have try to serve he for it be well to howl when you be among wolf i have be able to do so much for he that he have become my very good friend so that i may ask he what i like in return he be now as you be probably aware with the army at boulogne within a few mile of grosboi if you will come over at once he will certainly forget the hostility of you father in consideration of the service of you uncle it be true that you name be still proscribe but my influence with the emperor will set that matter right come to I then come at once and come with confidence ` you uncle ' c bernac ' so much for the letter but it be the outside which have puzzle I most a seal of red wax have be affix at either end and my uncle have apparently use he thumb as a signet one could see the little ripple edge of a coarse skin imprint upon the wax and then above one of the seal there be write in english the two word ` do not come ' it be hastily scrawl and whether by a man or a woman it be impossible to say but there it stare I in the face that sinister addition to a invitation ` do not come ' have it be add by this unknown uncle of mine on account of some sudden change in he plan surely that be inconceivable for why in that case should he send the invitation at all or be it place there by some one else who wish to warn I from accept this offer of hospitality the letter be in french the warning be in english could it have be add in england but the seal be unbroken and how could any one in england know what be the contents of the letter and then as i sit there with the big sail hum like a shell above my head and the green water hiss beside I i think over all that i have hear of this uncle of mine my father the descendant of one of the proudest and oldest family in france have choose beauty and virtue rather than rank in he wife never for a hour have she give he cause to regret it but this lawyer brother of hers have as i understand offended my father by he slavish obsequiousness in day of prosperity and he venomous enmity in the day of trouble he have hound on the peasant until my family have be compel to fly from the country and have afterwards aid robespierre in he worst excess receive as a reward the castle and estate of grosboi which be we own at the fall of robespierre he have succeed in conciliate barra and through every successive change he still manage to gain a fresh tenure of the property now it appear from he letter that the new emperor of france have also take he part though why he should befriend a man with such a history and what service my republican uncle could possibly render to he be matter upon which i could form no opinion and now you will ask I no doubt why i should accept the invitation of such a man -- a man whom my father have always stigmatise as a usurper and a traitor it be easier to speak of it now than then but the fact be that we of the new generation feel it very irksome and difficult to carry on the bitter quarrel of the last to the older _ emigre _ the clock of time seem to have stop in the year 1792 and they remain for ever with the love and the hatred of that era fix indelibly upon they soul they have be burn into they by the fiery furnace through which they have pass but we who have grow up upon a strange soil understand that the world have move and that new issue have arise we be incline to forget these feud of the last generation france to we be no longer the murderous land of the _ sans-culotte _ and the guillotine basket it be rather the glorious queen of war attack by all and conquer all but still so hard press that she scattered son could hear she call to arm for ever sound in they ear it be that call more than my uncle 's letter which be take I over the water of the channel for long my heart have be with my country in she struggle and yet while my father live i have never dare to say so for to he who have serve under conde and fight at quiberon it would have seem the blackest treason but after he death there be no reason why i should not return to the land of my birth and my desire be the stronger because eugenie -- the same eugenie who have be thirty year my wife -- be of the same way of think as myself she parent be a branch of the de choiseuls and they prejudice be even stronger than those of my father little do they think what be pass in the mind of they child many a time when they be mourn a french victory in the parlor we be both caper with joy in the garden there be a little window all choke round with laurel bush in the corner of the bare brick house and there we use to meet at night the dearer to each other from we difference with all who surround we i would tell she my ambition she would strengthen they by she enthusiasm and so all be ready when the time come but there be another reason besides the death of my father and the receipt of this letter from my uncle ashford be become too hot to hold I i will say this for the english that they be very generous host to the french emigrant there be not one of we who do not carry away a kindly remembrance of the land and its people but in every country there be overbear swaggering folk and even in quiet sleepy ashford we be plague by they there be one young kentish squire farley be he name who have earn a reputation in the town as a bully and a roisterer he could not meet one of we without utter insult not merely against the present french government which might have be excusable in a english patriot but against france itself and all frenchman often we be force to be deaf in he presence but at last he conduct become so intolerable that i determine to teach he a lesson there be several of we in the coffee-room at the green man one evening and he full of wine and malice be heap insult upon the french he eye creep round to I every moment to see how i be take it ` now monsieur de laval ' he cry put he rude hand upon my shoulder ` here be a toast for you to drink this be to the arm of nelson which strike down the french ' he stand leer at I to see if i would drink it ` well sir ' say i ' i will drink you toast if you will drink mine in return ' ` come on then ' say he so we drink ` now monsieur let we have you toast ' say he ` fill you glass then ' say i ` it be full now ' ` well then here be to the cannon-ball which carry off that arm ' in a instant i have a glass of port wine run down my face and within a hour a meeting have be arrange i shoot he through the shoulder and that night when i come to the little window eugenie pluck off some of the laurel leave and stick they in my hair there be no legal proceedings about the duel but it make my position a little difficult in the town and it will explain with other thing why i have no hesitation in accept my unknown uncle 's invitation in spite of the singular addition which i find upon the cover if he have indeed sufficient influence with the emperor to remove the proscription which be attach to we name then the only barrier which shut I off from my country would be demolish you must picture I all this time as sit upon the side of the lugger and turn my prospects and my position over in my head my reverie be interrupt by the heavy hand of the english skipper drop abruptly upon my arm ` now then master ' say he it be time you be step into the dingey ' i do not inherit the politics of the aristocrat but i have never lose they sense of personal dignity i gently push away he pollute hand and i remark that we be still a long way from the shore ` well you can do as you please ' say he roughly ` i be go no nearer so you can take you choice of get into the dingey or of swim for it ' it be in vain that i plead that he have be pay he price i do not add that that price mean that the watch which have belong to three generation of de lavals be now lie in the shop of a dover goldsmith ` little enough too ' he cry harshly ` down sail jim and bring she to now master you can step over the side or you can come back to dover but i do not take the vixen a cable 's length nearer to ambleteuse beef with this gale come up from the sou ' - west ' ` in that case i shall go ' say i ` you can lay you life on that ' he answer and laugh in so irritating a fashion that i half turn upon he with the intention of chastise he one be very helpless with these fellow however for a serious affair be of course out of the question while if one use a cane upon they they have a vile habit of striking with they hand which give they a advantage the marquis de chamfort tell I that when he first settle in sutton at the time of the emigration he lose a tooth when reprove a unruly peasant i make the best of a necessity therefore and shrug my shoulder i pass over the side of the lugger into the little boat my bundle be drop in after I -- conceive to yourself the heir of all the de lavals travel with a single bundle for he baggage -- and two seaman push she off pull with long slow stroke towards the low-lying shore there be certainly every promise of a wild night for the dark cloud which have roll up over the setting sun be now fray and ragged at the edge extend a good third of the way across the heaven it have split low down near the horizon and the crimson glare of the sunset beat through the gap so that there be the appearance of fire with a monstrous reek of smoke a red dancing belt of light lay across the broad slate-coloured ocean and in the center of it the little black craft be wallow and tumble the two seaman keep look up at the heaven and then over they shoulder at the land and i fear every moment that they would put back before the gale burst i be fill with apprehension every time when the end of they pull turn they face skyward and it be to draw they attention away from the storm-drift that i ask they what the light be which have begin to twinkle through the dusk both to the right and to the left of we ` that be boulogne to the north and etaple upon the south ' say one of the seaman civilly boulogne etaple how the word come back to I it be to boulogne that in my boyhood we have go down for the summer bathing could i not remember as a little lad trot along by my father 's side as he pace the beach and wonder why every fisherman 's cap fly off at we approach and as to etaple it be thence that we have flee for england when the folk come rave to the pier-head as we pass and i join my thin voice to my father 's as he shriek back at they for a stone have break my mother 's knee and we be all frenzied with we fear and we hatred and here they be these place of my childhood twinkle to the north and south of I while there in the darkness between they and only ten mile off at the furthest lay my own castle my own land of grosboi where the man of my blood have live and die long before some of we have go across with duke william to conquer the proud island over the water how i strain my eager eye through the darkness as i think that the distant black keep of we fortalice might even now be visible ` yes sir ' say the seaman '' tis a fine stretch of lonesome coast and many be the cock of you hackle that i have help ashore there ' ` what do you take I for then ' i ask ` well ` tis no business of mine sir ' he answer ` there be some trade that have best not even be speak about ' ` you think that i be a conspirator ' ` well master since you have put a name to it lor ' love you sir we be use to it ' ' i give you my word that i be none ' ` a escape prisoner then ' ` no nor that either ' the man lean upon he oar and i could see in the gloom that he face be thrust forward and that it be wrinkle with suspicion ` if you be one of boney 's spy -- ' he cry ' i a spy ' the tone of my voice be enough to convince he ` well ' say he ' i be darned if i know what you be but if you would be a spy i would ha ' have no hand in landing you whatever the skipper might say ' ` mind you i have no word to say against boney ' say the other seaman speaking in a very thick rumble voice ` he be be a rare good friend to the poor mariner ' it surprise I to hear he speak so for the virulence of feeling against the new french emperor in england exceed all belief and high and low be unite in they hatred of he but the sailor soon give I a clue to he politics ` if the poor mariner can run in he little bit of coffee and sugar and run out he silk and he brandy he have boney to thank for it ' say he ` the merchant have have they spell and now it be the turn of the poor mariner ' i remember then that buonaparte be personally very popular amongst the smuggler as well he might be see that he have make over into they hand all the trade of the channel the seaman continue to pull with he left hand but he point with he right over the slate-coloured dancing water ` there be boney himself ' say he you who live in a quieter age can not conceive the thrill which these simple word send through I it be but ten year since we have first hear of this man with the curious italian name -- think of it ten year the time that it take for a private to become a non-commissioned officer or a clerk to win a fifty-pound advance in he salary he have spring in a instant out of nothing into everything one month people be ask who he be the next he have break out in the north of italy like the plague venice and genoa wither at the touch of this swarthy ill-nourished boy he cow the soldier in the field and he outwit the statesman in the council chamber with a frenzy of energy he rush to the east and then while man be still marvel at the way in which he have convert egypt into a french department he be back again in italy and have beat austrium for the second time to the earth he travel as quickly as the rumor of he come and where he come there be new victory new combination the crackling of old system and the blur of ancient line of frontier holland savoy switzerland -- they be become mere name upon the map france be eat into europe in every direction they have make he emperor this beardless artillery officer and without a effort he have crush down those republican before whom the oldest king and the proudest nobility of europe have be helpless so it come about that we who watch he dart from place to place like the shuttle of destiny and who hear he name always in connection with some new achievement and some new success have come at last to look upon he as something more than human something monstrous overshadow france and menacing europe he giant presence loom over the continent and so deep be the impression which he fame have make in my mind that when the english sailor point confidently over the darken water and cry ` there be boney ' i look up for the instant with a foolish expectation of see some gigantic figure some elemental creature dark inchoate and threatening brooding over the water of the channel even now after the long gap of year and the knowledge of he downfall that great man cast he spell upon you but all that you read and all that you hear can not give you a idea of what he name mean in the day when he be at the summit of he career what actually meet my eye be very different from this childish expectation of mine to the north there be a long low cape the name of which have now escape I in the evening light it have be of the same greyish green tint as the other headland but now as the darkness fall it gradually break into a dull glow like a cooling iron on that wild night see and lose with the heave and sweep of the boat this lurid streak carry with it a vague but sinister suggestion the red line splitting the darkness might have be a giant half-forged sword-blade with its point towards england ` what be it then ' i ask ` just what i say master ' say he ` it be one of boney 's army with boney himself in the middle of it as like as not they be they camp fire and you 'll see a dozen such between this and ostend he be audacious enough to come across be little boney if he could dowse lord nelson 's other eye but there be no chance for he until then and well he know it ' ` how can lord nelson know what he be do ' i ask the man point out over my shoulder into the darkness and far on the horizon i perceive three little twinkling light ` watch dog ' say he in he husky voice ` andromeda forty-four ' add he companion i have often think of they since the long glow upon the land and the three little light upon the sea standing for so much for the two great rival face to face for the power of the land and the power of the water for the centuries-old battle which may last for century to come and yet frenchman as i be do i not know that the struggle be already decide -- for it lie between the childless nation and that which have a lusty young brood spring up around she if france fall she die but if england fall how many nation be there who will carry she speech she tradition and she blood on into the history of the future the land have be loom darker and the thudding of wave upon the sand sound louder every instant upon my ear i could already see the quick dancing gleam of the surf in front of I suddenly as i peered through the deepen shadow a long dark boat shoot out from it like a trout from under a stone make straight in we direction ' a guard boat ' cry one of the seaman ` bill boy we be do ' say the other and begin to stuff something into he sea boot but the boat swerve at the sight of we like a shy horse and be off in another direction as fast as eight frantic oar could drive she the seaman stare after she and wipe they brow ` she conscience do not seem much easier than we own ' say one of they ' i make sure it be the preventive ' ` look to I as if you be not the only queer cargo on the coast to-night mister ' remark he comrade ` what could she be ' ` curse if i know what she be i ram a cake of good trinidad tobacco into my boot when i see she i have see the inside of a french prison before now give way bill and have it over ' a minute later with a low grate sound we run aground upon a gravelly leach my bundle be throw ashore i step after it and a seaman push the prow off again spring in as he comrade back she into deep water already the glow in the west have vanish the storm-cloud be half up the heaven and a thick blackness have gather over the ocean as i turn to watch the vanish boat a keen wet blast flap in my face and the air be fill with the high piping of the wind and with the deep thunder of the sea and thus it be that on a wild evening in the early spring of the year 1805 i loui de laval be in the twenty-first year of my age return after a exile of thirteen year to the country of which my family have for many century be the ornament and support she have treat we badly this country she have repay we service by insult exile and confiscation but all that be forget as i the only de laval of the new generation drop upon my knee upon she sacred soil and with the strong smell of the seaweed in my nostril press my lip upon the wet and pringling gravel chapter ii the salt-marsh when a man have reach he mature age he can rest at that point of vantage and cast he eye back at the long road along which he have travel lie with its gleam of sunshine and its stretch of shadow in the valley behind he he know then its whence and its whither and the twist and bend which be so full of promise or of menace as he approach they lie expose and open to he gaze so plain be it all that he can scarce remember how dark it may have seem to he or how long he once hesitate at the cross road thus when he try to recall each stage of the journey he do so with the knowledge of its end and can no longer make it clear even to himself how it may have seem to he at the time and yet in spite of the strain of year and the many passage which have befall I since there be no time of my life which come back so very clearly as that gusty evening and to this day i can not feel the briny wholesome whiff of the seaweed without be carry back with that intimate feeling of reality which only the sense of smell can confer to the wet shingle of the french beach when i have rise from my knee the first thing that i do be to put my purse into the inner pocket of my coat i have take it out in order to give a gold piece to the sailor who have hand I ashore though i have little doubt that the fellow be both wealthier and of more assure prospects than myself i have actually draw out a silver half-crown but i could not bring myself to offer it to he and so end by give a tenth part of my whole fortune to a stranger the other nine sovereign i put very carefully away and then sit down upon a flat rock just above high water mark i turn it all over in my mind and weigh what i should do already i be cold and hungry with the wind lash my face and the spray smart in my eye but at least i be no longer live upon the charity of the enemy of my country and the thought set my heart dancing within I but the castle as well as i could remember be a good ten mile off to go there now be to arrive at a unseemly hour unkempt and weather-stained before this uncle whom i have never see my sensitive pride conjure up a picture of the scornful face of he servant as they look out upon this bedraggled wanderer from england slink back to the castle which should have be he own no i must seek shelter for the night and then at my leisure with as fair a show of appearance as possible i must present myself before my relative where then could i find a refuge from the storm you will ask I doubtless why i do not make for etaple or boulogne i answer that it be for the same reason which force I to land secretly upon that forbid coast the name of de laval still head the list of the proscribe for my father have be a famous and energetic leader of the small but influential body of man who have remain true at all cost to the old order of thing do not think that because i be of another way of think i despise those who have give up so much for they principle there be a curious saint-like trait in we nature which draw we most strongly towards that which involve the greatest sacrifice and i have sometimes think that if the condition have be less onerous the bourbon might have have fewer or at least less noble follower the french noble have be more faithful to they than the english to the stuart for cromwell have no luxurious court or rich appointment which he could hold out to those who would desert the royal cause no word can exaggerate the self-abnegation of those man i have see a supper party under my father 's roof where we guest be two fencing-master three professor of language one ornamental gardener and one translator of book who hold he hand in the front of he coat to conceal a rent in the lapel but these eight man be of the highest nobility of france who might have have what they choose to ask if they would only consent to forget the past and to throw themselves heartily into the new order of thing but the humble and what be sadder the incapable monarch of hartwell still hold the allegiance of those old montmorency rohan and choiseul who have share the greatness of he family be determine also to stand by it in its ruin the dark chamber of that exile monarch be furnish with something better than the tapestry of gobelin or the china of sevre across the gulf which separate my old age from theirs i can still see those ill-clad grave-mannered man and i raise my hat to the noblest group of noble that we history can show to visit a coast-town therefore before i have see my uncle or learn whether my return have be sanction would be simply to deliver myself into the hand of the _ gen d'arme _ who be ever on the look-out for stranger from england to go before the new emperor be one thing and to be drag before he another on the whole it seem to I that my best course be to wander inland in the hope of find some empty barn or out-house where i could pass the night unseen and undisturbed then in the morning i should consider how it be best for I to approach my uncle bernac and through he the new master of france the wind have freshen meanwhile into a gale and it be so dark upon the seaward side that i could only catch the white flash of a leap wave here and there in the blackness of the lugger which have bring I from dover i could see no sign on the land side of I there seem as far as i could make it out to be a line of low hill but when i come to traverse they i find that the dim light have exaggerate they size and that they be mere scatter sand-dune mottle with patch of bramble over these i toil with my bundle slung over my shoulder plod heavily through the loose sand and tripping over the creeper but forget my wet clothes and my numb hand as i recall the many hardship and adventure which my ancestor have undergo it amuse I to think that the day might come when my own descendant might fortify themselves by the recollection of that which be happen to I for in a great family like ours the individual be always subordinate to the race it seem to I that i should never get to the end of the sand-dune but when at last i do come off they i heartily wish that i be back upon they again for the sea in that part come by some creek up the back of the beach form at low tide a great desolate salt-marsh which must be a forlorn place even in the daytime but upon such a night as that it be a most dreary wilderness at first it be but a softness of the ground cause I to slip as i walk but soon the mud be over my ankle and half-way up to my knee so that each foot give a loud flop as i raise it and a dull splash as i set it down again i would willingly have make my way out even if i have to return to the sand-dune but in try to pick my path i have lose all my bearing and the air be so full of the sound of the storm that the sea seem to be on every side of I i have hear of how one may steer oneself by observation of the star but my quiet english life have not teach I how such thing be do and have i know i could scarcely have profit by it since the few star which be visible peep out here and there in the rift of the fly storm-cloud i wander on then wet and weary trust to fortune but always blunder deeper and deeper into this horrible bog until i begin to think that my first night in france be destine also to be my last and that the heir of the de lavals be destine to perish of cold and misery in the depths of this obscene morass i must have toil for many mile in this dreary fashion sometimes come upon shallower mud and sometimes upon deeper but never make my way on to the dry when i perceive through the gloom something which turn my heart even heavier than it have be before this be a curious clump of some whitish shrub -- cotton-grass of a flowering variety -- which glimmer suddenly before I in the darkness now a hour earlier i have pass just such a square-headed whitish clump so that i be confirm in the opinion which i have already begin to form that i be wander in a circle to make it certain i stooped down strike a momentary flash from my tinder-box and there sure enough be my own old track very clearly mark in the brown mud in front of I at this confirmation of my worst fear i throw my eye up to heaven in my despair and there i see something which for the first time give I a clue in the uncertainty which surround I it be nothing else than a glimpse of the moon between two flow cloud this in itself might have be of small avail to I but over its white face be mark a long thin v which shoot swiftly across like a shaftless arrow it be a flock of wild duck and its flight be in the same direction as that towards which my face be turn now i have observe in kent how all these creature come further inland when there be rough weather break so i make no doubt that they course indicate the path which would lead I away from the sea i struggle on therefore take every precaution to walk in a straight line above all be very careful to make a stride of equal length with either leg until at last after half a hour or so my perseverance be reward by the welcome sight of a little yellow light as from a cottage window glimmer through the darkness ah how it shine through my eye and down into my heart glowing and twinkling there that little golden speck which mean food and rest and life itself to the wanderer i blunder towards it through the mud and the slush as fast as my weary leg would bear I i be too cold and miserable to refuse any shelter and i have no doubt that for the sake of one of my gold piece the fisherman or peasant who live in this strange situation would shut he eye to whatever might be suspicious in my presence or appearance as i approach it become more and more wonderful to I that any one should live there at all for the bog grow worse rather than better and in the occasional gleam of moonshine i could make out that the water lay in glimmering pool all round the low dark cottage from which the light be break i could see now that it shine through a small square window as i approach the gleam be suddenly obscure and there in a yellow frame appear the round black outline of a man 's head peer out into the darkness a second time it appear before i reach the cottage and there be something in the stealthy manner in which it peep and whisk away and peep once more which fill I with surprise and with a certain vague apprehension so cautious be the movement of this sentinel and so singular the position of he watch-house that i determine in spite of my misery to see something more of he before i trust myself to the shelter of he roof and indeed the amount of shelter which i might hope for be not very great for as i draw softly nearer i could see that the light from within be beat through at several point and that the whole cottage be in the most crazy state of disrepair for a moment i pause think that even the salt-marsh might perhaps be a safer resting-place for the night than the headquarters of some desperate smuggler for such i conjecture that this lonely dwelling must be the scud however have cover the moon once more and the darkness be so pitchy black that i feel that i might reconnoitre a little more closely without fear of discovery walking on tiptoe i approach the little window and look in what i see reassure I vastly a small wood fire be crackle in one of those old-fashioned country grate and beside it be seat a strikingly handsome young man who be read earnestly out of a fat little book he have a oval olive-tinted face with long black hair ungathered in a queue and there be something of the poet or of the artist in he whole appearance the sight of that refine face and of the warm yellow firelight which beat upon it be a very cheer one to a cold and famished traveller i stand for a instant gaze at he and notice the way in which he full and somewhat loose-fitting lower lip quiver continually as if he be repeat to himself that which he be read i be still look at he when he put he book down upon the table and approach the window catch a glimpse of my figure in the darkness he call out something which i could not hear and wave he hand in a gesture of welcome a instant later the door fly open and there be he thin tall figure standing upon the threshold with he skirt flap in the wind ` my dear friend ' he cry peer out into the gloom with he hand over he eye to screen they from the salt-laden wind and drive sand ' i have give you up i think that you be never come i have be wait for two hour ' for answer i step out in front of he so that the light fall upon my face ' i be afraid sir -- ' say i but i have no time to finish my sentence he strike at I with both hand like a angry cat and spring back into the room he slam the door with a crash in my face the swiftness of he movement and the malignity of he gesture be in such singular contrast with he appearance that i be strike speechless with surprise but as i stand there with the door in front of I i be a witness to something which fill I with even greater astonishment i have already say that the cottage be in the last stage of disrepair amidst the many seam and crack through which the light be break there be one along the whole of the hinge side of the door which give I from where i be stand a view of the further end of the room at which the fire be burn as i gazed then i see this man reappear in front of the fire fumble furiously with both he hand in he bosom and then with a spring he disappear up the chimney so that i could only see he shoe and half of he black calf as he stand upon the brickwork at the side of the grate in a instant he be down again and back at the door ` who be you ' he cry in a voice which seem to I to be thrill with some strong emotion ' i be a traveller and have lose my way ' there be a pause as if he be think what course he should pursue ` you will find little here to tempt you to stay ' say he at last ' i be weary and spend sir and surely you will not refuse I shelter i have be wander for hour in the salt-marsh ' ` do you meet anyone there ' he ask eagerly ` no ' ` stand back a little from the door this be a wild place and the time be troublous a man must take some precaution ' i take a few step back and he then open the door sufficiently to allow he head to come through he say nothing but he look at I for a long time in a very search manner ` what be you name ' ` loui laval ' say i think that it might sound less dangerous in this plebeian form ` whither be you go ' ' i wish to reach some shelter ' ` you be from england ' ' i be from the coast ' he shake he head slowly to show I how little my reply have satisfy he ` you can not come in here ' say he ` but surely -- ' ` no no it be impossible ' ` show I then how to find my way out of the marsh ' ` it be easy enough if you go a few hundred pace in that direction you will perceive the light of a village you be already almost free of the marsh ' he step a pace or two from the door in order to point the way for I and then turn upon he heel i have already take a stride or two away from he and he inhospitable hut when he suddenly call after I ` come monsieur laval ' say he with quite a different ring in he voice ' i really can not permit you to leave I upon so tempestuous a night a warm by my fire and a glass of brandy will hearten you upon you way ' you may think that i do not feel disposed to contradict he though i could make nothing of this sudden and welcome change in he manner ' i be much oblige to you sir ' say i and i follow he into the hut chapter iii the ruin cottage it be delightful to see the glow and twinkle of the fire and to escape from the wet wind and the numbing cold but my curiosity have already rise so high about this lonely man and he singular dwelling that my thought run rather upon that than upon my personal comfort there be he remarkable appearance the fact that he should be await company within that miserable ruin in the heart of the morass at so sinister a hour and finally the inexplicable incident of the chimney all of which excited my imagination it be beyond my comprehension why he should at one moment charge I sternly to continue my journey and then in almost the same breath invite I most cordially to seek the shelter of he hut on all these point i be keenly on the alert for a explanation yet i endeavor to conceal my feeling and to assume the air of a man who find everything quite natural about he and who be much too absorb in he own personal want to have a think to spare upon anything outside himself a glance at the inside of the cottage as i enter confirm I in the conjecture which the appearance of the outside have already give rise to that it be not use for human residence and that this man be only here for a rendezvous prolonged moisture have peel the plaster in flake from the wall and have cover the stone with blotch and rosette of lichen the whole place be rotten and scale like a leper the single large room be unfurnished save for a crazy table three wooden box which might be use as seat and a great pile of decayed fishing-net in the corner the splinter of a fourth box with a hand-axe which lean against the wall show how the wood for the fire have be gather but it be to the table that my gaze be chiefly draw for there beside the lamp and the book lay a open basket from which project the knuckle-end of a ham the corner of a loaf of bread and the black neck of a bottle if my host have be suspicious and cold at we first meeting he be now atone for he inhospitality by a overdo cordiality even harder for I to explain with many lamentation over my mud-stained and sodden condition he draw a box close to the blaze and cut I off a corner of the bread and ham i could not help observe however that though he loose under-lipped mouth be wreathe with smile he beautiful dark eye be continually run over I and my attire ask and re-ask what my business might be ` as for myself ' say he with a air of false candor ` you will very well understand that in these day a worthy merchant must do the best he can to get he wares and if the emperor god save he see fit in he wisdom to put a end to open trade one must come to such place as these to get into touch with those who bring across the coffee and the tobacco i promise you that in the tuilery itself there be no difficulty about get either one or the other and the emperor drink he ten cup a day of the real mocha without ask question though he must know that it be not grow within the confines of france the vegetable kingdom still remain one of the few which napoleon have not yet conquer and if it be not for trader who be at some risk and inconvenience it be hard to say what we should do for we supplies i suppose sir that you be not yourself either in the seafaring or in the trading line ' i contented myself by answer that i be not by which reticence i could see that i only excited he curiosity the more as to he account of himself i read a lie in those tell-tale eye all the time that he be talk as i look at he now in the full light of the lamp and the fire i could see that he be even more good-looking than i have at first thought but with a type of beauty which have never be to my taste he feature be so refine as to be almost effeminate and so regular that they would have be perfect if it have not be for that ill-fitting slabbing mouth it be a clever and yet it be a weak face full of a sort of fickle enthusiasm and feeble impulsiveness i feel that the more i know he the less reason i should probably find either to like he or to fear he and in my first conclusion i be right although i have occasion to change my view upon the second ` you will forgive I monsieur laval if i be a little cold at first ' say he ` since the emperor have be upon the coast the place swarm with police agent so that a trader must look to he own interest you will allow that my fear of you be not unnatural since neither you dress nor you appearance be such as one would expect to meet with in such a place and at such a time ' it be on my lip to return the remark but i refrain ' i can assure you ' say i ` that i be merely a traveller who have lose my way now that i be refresh and rest i will not encroach further upon you hospitality except to ask you to point out the way to the nearest village ' ` tut you have best stay where you be for the night grow wilder every instant ' as he speak there come a whoop and scream of wind in the chimney as if the old place be come down about we ear he walk across to the window and look very earnestly out of it just as i have see he do upon my first approach ` the fact be monsieur laval ' say he look round at I with he false-air of good fellowship ` you may be of some good service to I if you will wait here for half a hour or so ' ` how so ' i ask waver between my distrust and my curiosity ` well to be frank with you ' -- and never do a man look less frank as he speak -- ' i be wait here for some of those people with whom i do business but in some way they have not come yet and i be incline to take a walk round the marsh on the chance of find they if they have lose they way on the other hand it would be exceedingly awkward for I if they be to come here in my absence and imagine that i be go i should take it as a favor then if you would remain here for half a hour or so that you may tell they how matter stand if i should chance to miss they ' the request seem reasonable enough and yet there be that same oblique glance which tell I that it be false still i could not see what harm could come to I by comply with he request and certainly i could not have devise any arrangement which would give I such a opportunity of satisfy my curiosity what be in that wide stone chimney and why have he clamber up there upon the sight of I my adventure would be inconclusive indeed if i do not settle that point before i go on with my journey ` well ' say he snatch up he black broad-brimmed hat and run very briskly to the door ' i be sure that you will not refuse I my request and i must delay no longer or i shall never get my business finish ' he close the door hurriedly behind he and i hear the splashing of he foot-step until they be lose in the howling of the gale and so the mysterious cottage be mine to ransack if i could pluck its secret from it i lift the book which have be leave upon the table it be rousseau 's ` social contract ' -- excellent literature but hardly what one would expect a trader to carry with he whilst await a appointment with smuggler on the fly-leaf be write ` lucien lesage ' and beneath it in a woman 's hand ` lucien from sibylle ' lesage then be the name of my good-looking but sinister acquaintance it only remain for I now to discover what it be which he have conceal up the chimney i listen intently and as there be no sound from without save the cry of the storm i step on to the edge of the grate as i have see he do and spring up by the side of the fire it be a very broad old-fashioned cottage chimney so that standing on one side i be not inconvenience either by the heat or by the smoke and the bright glare from below show I in a instant that for which i seek there be a recess at the back cause by the fall or removal of one of the stone and in this be lie a small bundle there could not be the least doubt that it be this which the fellow have strive so frantically to conceal upon the first alarm of the approach of a stranger i take it down and hold it to the light it be a small square of yellow glazed cloth tie round with white tape upon my open it a number of letter appear and a single large paper fold up the address upon the letter take my breath away the first that i glance at be to citizen talleyrand the other be in the republican style address to citizen fouche to citizen soult to citizen macdonald to citizen berthier and so on through the whole list of famous name in war and in diplomacy who be the pillar of the new empire what in the world could this pretend merchant of coffee have to write to all these great notable about the other paper would explain no doubt i lay the letter upon the shelf and i unfold the paper which have be enclose with they it do not take more than the opening sentence to convince I that the salt-marsh outside might prove to be a very much safer place than this accursed cottage these be the word which meet my eye : -- ` fellow-citizen of france the deed of to-day have prove that even in the midst of he troops a tyrant be unable to escape the vengeance of a outraged people the committee of three act temporarily for the republic have award to buonaparte the same fate which have already befall loui capet in avenge the outrage of the 18th brumaire -- ' so far i have get when my heart spring suddenly into my mouth and the paper flutter down from my finger a grip of iron have close suddenly round each of my ankle and there in the light of the fire i see two hand which even in that terrify glance i perceive to be cover with black hair and of a enormous size ` so my friend ' cry a thundering voice ` this time at least we have be too many for you ' chapter iv man of the night i have little time give I to realize the extraordinary and humiliating position in which i find myself for i be lift up by my ankle as if i be a fowl pull off a perch and jerk roughly down into the room my back striking upon the stone floor with a thud which shake the breath from my body ` do not kill he yet toussac ' say a soft voice ` let we make sure who he be first ' i feel the pressure of a thumb upon my chin and of finger upon my throat and my head be slowly force round until the strain become unbearable ` quarter of a inch do it and no mark ' say the thunderous voice ` you can trust my old turn ' ` do not toussac do not ' say the same gentle voice which have speak first ' i saw you do it once before and the horrible snick that it make haunt I for a long time to think that the sacred flame of life can be so readily snuff out by that great material finger and thumb mind can indeed conquer matter but the fighting must not be at close quarter ' my neck be so twisted that i could not see any of these people who be discuss my fate i could only lie and listen ` the fact remain my dear charle that the fellow have we all-important secret and that it be we life or he ' i recognize in the voice which be now speak that of the man of the cottage ` we owe it to ourselves to put it out of he power to harm we let he sit up toussac for there be no possibility of he escape ' some irresistible force at the back of my neck drag I instantly into a sit position and so for the first time i be able to look round I in a dazed fashion and to see these man into whose hand i have fall that they be murderer in the past and have murderous plan for the future i already gather from what i have hear and see i understand also that in the heart of that lonely marsh i be absolutely in they power none the less i remember the name that i bear and i conceal as far as i could the sickening terror which lay at my heart there be three of they in the room my former acquaintance and two new comer lesage stand by the table with he fat brown book in he hand look at I with a compose face but with that humorous question twinkle in he eye which a master chess-player might assume when he have leave he opponent without a move on the top of the box beside he sit a very ascetic-faced yellow hollow-eyed man of fifty with prim lip and a shrunken skin which hang loosely over the long jerking tendon under he prominent chin he be dress in snuff-coloured clothes and he leg under he knee-breeches be of a ludicrous thinness he shake he head at I with a air of sad wisdom and i could read little comfort in he inhuman gray eye but it be the man call toussac who alarm I most he be a colossus bulky rather than tall but misshapen from he excess of muscle he huge leg be crooked like those of a great ape and indeed there be something animal about he whole appearance something for he be beard up to he eye and it be a paw rather than a hand which still clutch I by the collar as to he expression he be too thatched with hair to show one but he large black eye look with a sinister question from I to the other if they be the judge and jury it be clear who be to be executioner ` whence do he come what be he business how come he to know the hiding-place ' ask the thin man ` when he first come i mistake he for you in the darkness ' lesage answer ` you will acknowledge that it be not a night on which one would expect to meet many people in the salt-marsh on discover my mistake i shut the door and conceal the papers in the chimney i have forget that he might see I do this through that crack by the hinge but when i go out again to show he he way and so get rid of he my eye catch the gap and i at once realize that he have see my action and that it must have arouse he curiosity to such a extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it i call he back into the hut therefore in order that i might have time to consider what i have best do with he ' ` sapristi a couple of cut of that wood-axe and a bed in the softest corner of the marsh would have settle the business at once ' say the fellow by my side ` quite true my good toussac but it be not usual to lead off with you ace of trump a little delicacy -- a little finesse -- ' ` let we hear what you do then ' ` it be my first object to learn whether this man laval -- ' ` what do you say he name be ' cry the thin man ` he name accord to he account be laval my first object then be to find out whether he have in truth see I conceal the papers or not it be a important question for we and as thing have turn out more important still for he i make my little plan therefore i wait until i saw you approach and i then leave he alone in the hut i watch through the window and see he fly to the hiding-place we then enter and i ask you toussac to be good enough to lift he down -- and there he lie ' the young fellow look proudly round for the applause of he comrade and the thin man clap he hand softly together look very hard at I while he do so ` my dear lesage ' say he ` you have certainly excel yourself when we new republic look for its minister of police we shall know where to find he i confess that when after guide toussac to this shelter i follow you in and perceive a gentleman 's leg project from the fireplace even my wit which be usually none of the slowest hardly grasp the situation toussac however grasp the leg he be always practical the good toussac ' ` enough word ' growl the hairy creature beside I ` it be because we have talk instead of act that this buonaparte have a crown upon he head or a head upon he shoulder let we have do with the fellow and come to business ' the refine feature of lesage make I look towards he as to a possible protector but he large dark eye be as cold and hard as jet as he look back at I ` what toussac say be right ' say he ` we imperil we own safety if he go with we secret ' ` the devil take we own safety ' cry toussac ` what have that to do with the matter we imperil the success of we plan -- that be of more importance ' ` the two thing go together ' reply lesage ` there be no doubt that rule 13 of we confederation define exactly what should be do in such a case any responsibility must rest with the passer of rule 13 ' my heart have turn cold when this man with he poet 's face support the savage at my side but my hope be raise again when the thin man who have say little hitherto though he have continue to stare at I very intently begin now to show some sign of alarm at the bloodthirsty proposal of he comrade ` my dear lucien ' say he in a soothing voice lay he hand upon the young man 's arm ` we philosopher and reasoner must have a respect for human life the tabernacle be not to be lightly violate we have frequently agree that if it be not for the excess of marat -- ' ' i have every respect for you opinion charle ' the other interrupted ` you will allow that i have always be a willing and obedient disciple but i again say that we personal safety be involve and that as far as i see there be no middle course no one could be more averse from cruelty than i be but you be present with I some month ago when toussac silence the man from bow street and certainly it be do with such dexterity that the process be probably more painful to the spectator than to the victim he could not have be aware of the horrible sound which announce he own dissolution if you and i have constancy enough to endure this -- and if i remember right it be chiefly at you instigation that the deed be do -- then surely on this more vital occasion -- ' ` no no toussac stop ' cry the thin man he voice rise from its soft tone to a perfect scream as the giant 's hairy hand grip I by the chin once more ' i appeal to you lucien upon practical as well as upon moral grounds not to let this deed be do consider that if thing should go against we this will cut we off from all hope of mercy consider also -- ' this argument seem for a moment to stagger the younger man whose olive complexion have turn a shade greyer ` there will be no hope for we in any case charle ' say he ` we have no choice but to obey rule 13 ' ` some latitude be allow to we we be ourselves upon the inner committee ' ` but it take a quorum to change a rule and we have no power to do it ' he pendulous lip be quiver but there be no softening in he eye slowly under the pressure of those cruel finger my chin begin to sweep round to my shoulder and i commend my soul to the virgin and to saint ignatius who have always be the especial patron of my family but this man charle who have already befriend I dart forwards and begin to tear at toussac 's hand with a vehemence which be very different from he former philosophic calm ` you _ shall _ not kill he ' he cry angrily ` who be you to set you will up against mine let he go toussac take you thumb from he chin i will not have it do i tell you ' then as he see by the inflexible face of he companion that bluster would not help he he turn suddenly to tone of entreaty ` see now i 'll make you a promise ' say he ` listen to I lucien let I examine he if he be a police spy he shall die you may have he then toussac but if he be only a harmless traveller who have blunder in here by a evil chance and who have be lead by a foolish curiosity to inquire into we business then you will leave he to I ' you will observe that from the beginning of this affair i have never once open my mouth nor say a word in my defense which make I mightily pleased with myself afterwards though my silence come rather from pride than from courage to lose life and self-respect together be more than i could face but now at this appeal from my advocate i turn my eye from the monster who hold I to the other who condemn I the brutality of the one alarm I less than the self-interested attitude of the other for a man be never so dangerous as when he be afraid and of all judge the judge who have cause to fear you be the most inflexible my life depend upon the answer which be to come to the appeal of my champion lesage tap he finger upon he tooth and smile indulgently at the earnestness of he companion ` rule 13 rule 13 ' he keep repeat in that exasperating voice of he ' i will take all responsibility ' ` i 'll tell you what mister ' say toussac in he savage voice ` there be another rule besides rule 13 and that be the one that say that if any man shelter a offender he shall be treat as if he be himself guilty of the offence ' this attack do not shake the serenity of my champion in the least ` you be a excellent man of action toussac ' say he calmly ` but when it come to choose the right course you must leave it to wiser head than you own ' he air of tranquil superiority seem to daunt the fierce creature who hold I he shrug he huge shoulder in silent dissent ` as to you lucien ' my friend continue ' i be surprised consider the position to which you aspire in my family that you should for a instant stand in the way of any wish which i may express if you have grasp the true principle of liberty and if you be privileged to be one of the small band who have never despair of the republic to whom be it that you owe it ' ` yes yes charle i acknowledge what you say ' the young man answer with much agitation ' i be sure that i should be the last to oppose any wish which you might express but in this case i fear lest you tenderness of heart may be lead you astray by all mean ask he any question that you like but it seem to I that there can be only one end to the matter ' so i thought also for with the full secret of these desperate man in my possession what hope be there that they would ever suffer I to leave the hut alive and yet so sweet be human life and so dear a respite be it ever so short a one that when that murderous hand be take from my chin i hear a sudden chiming of little bell and the lamp blaze up into a strange fantastic blur it be but for a moment and then my mind be clear again and i be look up at the strange gaunt face of my examiner ` whence have you come ' he ask ` from england ' ` but you be french ' ` yes ' ` when do you arrive ' ` to-night ' ` how ' ` in a lugger from dover ' ` the fellow be speak the truth ' growled toussac ` yes i 'll say that for he that he be speak the truth we see the lugger and someone be land from it just after the boat that bring I over push off ' i remember that boat which have be the first thing which i have see upon the coast of france how little i have think what it would mean to I and now my advocate begin ask question -- vague useless question -- in a slow hesitate fashion which set toussac grumble this cross-examination appear to I to be a useless farce and yet there be a certain eagerness and intensity in my questioner 's manner which give I the assurance that he have some end in view be it merely that he wish to gain time time for what and then suddenly with that quick perception which come upon those whose nerve be strain by a extremity of danger i become convinced that he really be await something -- that he be tense with expectation i read it upon he draw face upon he sidelong head with he ear scoop into he hand above all in he twitch restless eye he expect a interruption and he be talk talk talk in order to gain time for it i be as sure of it as if he have whisper he secret in my ear and down in my numb cold heart a warm little spring of hope begin to bubble and run but toussac have chafe at all this word-fencing and now with a oath he break in upon we dialogue ' i have have enough of this ' he cry ` it be not for child 's play of this sort that i risk my head in come over here have we nothing better to talk about than this fellow do you suppose i come from london to listen to you fine phrase have do with it i say and get to business ' ` very good ' say my champion ` there be a excellent little cupboard here which make as fine a prison as one could wish for let we put he in here and pass on to business we can deal with he when we have finish ' ` and have he overhear all that we say ' say lesage ' i do not know what the devil have come over you ' cry toussac turn suspicious eye upon my protector ' i never know you squeamish before and certainly you be not backward in the affair of the man from bow street this fellow have we secret and he must either die or we shall see he at we trial what be the sense of arrange a plot and then at the last moment turn a man loose who will ruin we all let we snap he neck and have do with it ' the great hairy hand be stretch towards I again but lesage have spring suddenly to he foot he face have turn very white and he stand listen with he forefinger up and he head slant it be a long thin delicate hand and it be quiver like a leaf in the wind ' i hear something ' he whisper ` and i ' say the older man ` what be it ' ` silence listen ' for a minute or more we all stay with strain ear while the wind still whimper in the chimney or rattle the crazy window ` it be nothing ' say lesage at last with a nervous laugh ` the storm make curious sound sometimes ' ' i hear nothing ' say toussac ` hush ' cry the other ` there it be again ' a clear rise cry float high above the wail of the storm a wild musical cry begin on a low note and thrilling swiftly up to a keen sharp-edged howl ' a hound ' ` they be follow we ' lesage dash to the fireplace and i see he thrust he papers into the blaze and grind they down with he heel toussac seize the wood-axe which lean against the wall the thin man drag the pile of decayed net from the corner and open a small wooden screen which shut off a low recess ` in here ' he whisper ` quick ' and then as i scramble into my refuge i hear he say to the other that i would be safe there and that they could lay they hand upon I when they wish chapter v the law the cupboard -- for it be little more -- into which i have be hurry be low and narrow and i feel in the darkness that it be heap with peculiar round wickerwork basket the nature of which i could by no means imagine although i discover afterwards that they be lobster trap the only light which enter be through the crack of the old broken door but these be so wide and numerous that i could see the whole of the room which i have just quit sick and faint with the shadow of death still clouding my wit i be none the less fascinate by the scene which lay before I my thin friend with the same prim composure upon he emaciated face have seat himself again upon the box with he hand clasp round one of he knee he be rock slowly backwards and forwards and i notice in the lamplight that he jaw muscle be contract rhythmically like the gill of a fish beside he stand lesage he white face glisten with moisture and he loose lip quiver with fear every now and then he would make a vigorous attempt to compose he feature but after each rally a fresh wave of terror would sweep everything before it and set he shake once more as to toussac he stand before the fire a magnificent figure with the axe hold down by he leg and he head throw back in defiance so that he great black beard bristle straight out in front of he he say not a word but every fiber of he body be brace for a struggle then as the howl of the hound rise louder and clearer from the marsh outside he run forward and throw open the door ` no no keep the dog out ' cry lesage in a agony of apprehension ` you fool we only chance be to kill it ' ` but it be in leash ' ` if it be in leash nothing can save we but if as i think it be run free then we may escape yet ' lesage cower up against the table with he agonised eye fix upon the blue-black square of the door the man who have befriend I still sway he body about with a singular half-smile upon he face he skinny hand be twitch at the frill of he shirt and i conjecture that he hold some weapon conceal there toussac stand between they and the open door and much as i fear and loathe he i could not take my eye from he gallant figure as to myself i be so much occupy by the singular drama before I and by the impending fate of those three man of the cottage that all thought of my own fortune have pass completely out of my mind on this mean stage a terrible all-absorbing drama be be play and i crouching in a squalid recess be to be the sole spectator of it i could but hold my breath and wait and watch and suddenly i become conscious that they could all three see something which be invisible to I i read it from they tense face and they stare eye toussac swing he axe over he shoulder and poise himself for a blow lesage cower away and put one hand between he eye and the open door the other cease swing he spindle leg and sit like a little brown image upon the edge of he box there be a moist pattering of foot a yellow streak shoot through the doorway and toussac lash at it as i have see a english cricketer strike at a ball he aim be true for he bury the head of the hatchet in the creature 's throat but the force of he blow shatter he weapon and the weight of the hound carry he backwards on to the floor over they roll and over the hairy man and the hairy dog growl and worry in a bestial combat he be fumble at the animal 's throat and i could not see what he be do until it give a sudden sharp yelp of pain and there be a rend sound like the tear of canvas the man stagger up with he hand drip and the tawny mass with the blotch of crimson lay motionless upon the floor ` now ' cry toussac in a voice of thunder ` now ' and he rush from the hut lesage have shrink away into the corner in a frenzy of fear whilst toussac have be kill the hound but now he raise he agonised face which be as wet as if he have dip it into a basin ` yes yes ' he cry ` we must fly charle the hound have leave the police behind and we may still escape ' but the other with the same imperturbable face motionless save for the rhythm of he jaw muscle walk quietly over and close the door upon the inside ' i think friend lucien ' say he in he quiet voice ` that you have best stay where you be ' lesage look at he with amazement gradually replace terror upon he pallid feature ` but you do not understand charle ' he cry ` oh yes i think i do ' say the other smile ` they may be here in a few minute the hound have slip its leash you see and have leave they behind in the marsh but they be sure to come here for there be no other cottage but this ' ` they be sure to come here ' ` well then let we fly in the darkness we may yet escape ' ` no we shall stay where we be ' ` madman you may sacrifice you own life but not mine stay if you wish but for my part i be go ' he run towards the door with a foolish helpless flap of he hand but the other spring in front of he with so determine a gesture of authority that the younger man stagger back from it as from a blow ` you fool ' say he companion ` you poor miserable dupe ' lesage 's mouth open and he stand stare with he knee bent and he spread-fingered hand up the most hideous picture of fear that i have ever see ` you charle you ' he stammer hawk up each word ` yes I ' say the other smile grimly ' a police agent all the time you who be the very soul of we society you who be in we inmost council you who lead we on oh charle you have not the heart i think i hear they come charle let I pass i beg and implore you to let I pass ' the granite face shake slowly from side to side ` but why I why not toussac ' ` if the dog have cripple toussac why then i might have have you both but friend toussac be rather vigorous for a thin little fellow like I no no my good lucien you be destine to be the trophy of my bow and my spear and you must reconcile yourself to the fact ' lesage slap he forehead as if to assure himself that he be not dream ' a police agent ' he repeat ` charle a police agent ' ' i think it would surprise you ' ` but you be the most republican of we all we be none of we advance enough for you how often have we gather round you charle to listen to you philosophy and there be sibylle too do not tell I that sibylle be a police spy also but you be joke charle say that you be joke ' the man relax he grim feature and he eye pucker with amusement ` you astonishment be very flattering ' say he ' i confess that i think that i play my part rather cleverly it be not my fault that these bungler unleash they hound but at least i shall have the credit of have make a single-handed capture of one very desperate and dangerous conspirator ' he smile drily at this description of he prisoner ` the emperor know how to reward he friend ' he add ` and also how to punish he enemy ' all this time he have hold he hand in he bosom and now he draw it out so far as to show the brass gleam of a pistol butt ` it be no use ' say he in answer to some look in the other 's eye ` you stay in the hut alive or dead ' lesage put he hand to he face and begin to cry with loud helpless sobbing ` why you have be worse than any of we charle ' he moan ` it be you who tell toussac to kill the man from bow street and it be you also who set fire to the house in the rue basse de la rampart and now you turn on we ' ' i do that because i wish to be the one to throw light upon it all -- and at the proper moment ' ` that be very fine charle but what will be think about that when i make it all public in my own defense how can you explain all that to you emperor there be still time to prevent my tell all that i know about you ' ` well really i think that you be right my friend ' say the other draw out he pistol and cock it ` perhaps i _ do _ go a little beyond my instruction in one or two point and as you very properly remark there be still time to set it right it be a matter of detail whether i give you up living or give you up dead and i think that on the whole it have better be dead ' it have be horrible to see toussac tear the throat out of the hound but it have not make my flesh creep as it creep now pity be mingle with my disgust for this unfortunate young man who have be fit by nature for the life of a retired student or of a dream poet but who have be drag by stronger will than he own into a part which no child could be more incapable of play i forgive he the trick by which he have catch I and the selfish fear to which he have be willing to sacrifice I he have fling himself down upon the ground and flounder about in a convulsion of terror whilst he terrible little companion with he cynical smile stand over he with he pistol in he hand he play with the helpless panting coward as a cat might with a mouse but i read in he inexorable eye that it be no jest and he finger seem to be already tighten upon he trigger full of horror at so cold-blooded a murder i push open my crazy cupboard and have rush out to plead for the victim when there come a buzz of voice and a clanking of steel from without with a stentorian shout of ` in the name of the emperor ' a single violent wrench tear the door of the hut from its hinge it be still blow hard and through the open doorway i could see a thick cluster of mount man with plume slant and mantle flap the rain shine upon they shoulder at the side the light from the hut strike upon the head of two beautiful horse and upon the heavy red-toupeed busby of the hussar who stand at they head in the doorway stand another hussar -- a man of high rank as could be see from the richness of he dress and the distinction of he bearing he be boot to the knee with a uniform of light blue and silver which he tall slim light-cavalry figure suit to a marvel i could not but admire the way in which he carry himself for he never deign to draw the sword which shine at he side but he stand in the doorway glance round the blood-bespattered hut and stare at its occupant with a very cool and alert expression he have a handsome face pale and clear-cut with a bristle moustache which cut across the brass chin-chain of he busby ` well ' say he ` well ' the older man have put he pistol back into the breast of he brown coat ` this be lucien lesage ' say he the hussar look with disgust at the prostrate figure upon the floor ' a pretty conspirator ' say he ` get up you grovel hound here gerard take charge of he and bring he into camp ' a younger officer with two trooper at he heel come clank in to the hut and the wretched creature half swoon be drag out into the darkness ` where be the other -- the man call toussac ' ` he kill the hound and escape lesage would have get away also have i not prevent he if you have keep the dog in leash we should have have they both but as it be colonel lasalle i think that you may congratulate I ' he hold out he hand as he speak but the other turn abruptly on he heel ` you hear that general savary ' say he look out of the door ` toussac have escape ' a tall dark young man appear within the circle of light cast by the lamp the agitation of he handsome swarthy face show the effect which the news have upon he ` where be he then ' ` it be a quarter of a hour since he get away ' ` but he be the only dangerous man of they all the emperor will be furious in which direction do he fly ' ` it must have be inland ' ` but who be this ' ask general savary point at I ' i understand from you information that there be only two besides yourself monsieur -- ' ' i have rather no name be mention ' say the other abruptly ' i can well understand that ' general savary answer with a sneer ' i would have tell you that the cottage be the rendezvous but it be not decide upon until the last moment i give you the means of tracking toussac but you let the hound slip i certainly think that you will have to answer to the emperor for the way in which you have manage the business ' ` that sir be we affair ' say general savary sternly ` in the meantime you have not tell we who this person be ' it seem useless for I to conceal my identity since i have a letter in my pocket which would reveal it ` my name be loui de laval ' say i proudly i may confess that i think we have exaggerate we own importance over in england we have think that all france be wonder whether we should return whereas in the quick march of event france have really almost forget we existence this young general savary be not in the least impressed by my aristocratic name but he jot it down in he notebook ` monsieur de laval have nothing whatever to do with the matter ' say the spy ` he have blunder into it entirely by chance and i will answer for he safe keep in case he should be want ' ` he will certainly be want ' say general savary ` in the meantime i need every trooper that i have for the chase so if you make yourself personally responsible and bring he to the camp when need i see no objection to he remain in you keep i shall send to you if i require he ' ` he will be at the emperor 's order ' ` be there any papers in the cottage ' ` they have be burn ' ` that be unfortunate ' ` but i have duplicate ' ` excellent come lasalle every minute count and there be nothing to be do here let the man scatter and we may still ride he down ' the two tall soldier clank out of the cottage without take any further notice of my companion and i hear the sharp stern order and the jingle of metal as the trooper spring back into they saddle once more a instant later they be off and i listen to the dull beat of they hoof die rapidly into a confused murmur my little snuff-coloured champion go to the door of the hut and peer after they through the darkness then he come back and look I up and down with he usual dry sardonic smile ` well young man ' say he ` we have play some pretty _ tableau vivant _ for you amusement and you can thank I for that nice seat in the front row of the parterre ' ' i be under a very deep obligation to you sir ' i answer struggle between my gratitude and my aversion ' i hardly know how to thank you ' he look at I with a singular expression in he ironical eye ` you will have the opportunity for thank I later ' say he ` in the meantime as you say that you be a stranger upon we coast and as i be responsible for you safe keep you can not do better than follow I and i will take you to a place where you may sleep in safety ' chapter vi the secret passage the fire have already smoulder down and my companion blow out the lamp so that we have not take ten pace before we have lose sight of the ill-omened cottage in which i have receive so singular a welcome upon my home-coming the wind have soften down but a fine rain cold and clammy come drift up from the sea have i be leave to myself i should have find myself as much at a loss as i have be when i first land but my companion walk with a brisk and assure step so that it be evident that he guide himself by landmark which be invisible to I for my part wet and miserable with my forlorn bundle under my arm and my nerve all jangle by my terrible experience i trudge in silence by he side turn over in my mind all that have occur to I young as i be i have hear much political discussion amongst my elder in england and the state of affair in france be perfectly familiar to I i be aware that the recent elevation of buonaparte to the throne have enrage the small but formidable section of jacobin and extreme republican who see that all they effort to abolish a kingdom have only end in transform it into a empire it be indeed a pitiable result of they frenzied striving that a crown with eight _ fleur-de-lis _ should be change into a higher crown surmount by a cross and ball on the other hand the follower of the bourbon in whose company i have spend my youth be equally disappoint at the manner in which the mass of the french people hail this final step in the return from chaos to order contradictory as be they motive the more violent spirit of both party be unite in they hatred to napoleon and in they fierce determination to get rid of he by any means hence a series of conspiracy most of they with they base in england and hence also a large use of spy and informer upon the part of fouche and of savary upon whom the responsibility of the safety of the emperor lay a strange chance have land I upon the french coast at the very same time as a murderous conspirator and have afterwards enable I to see the weapon with which the police contrived to thwart and outwit he and he associate when i look back upon my series of adventure my wanderings in the salt-marsh my entrance into the cottage my discovery of the papers my capture by the conspirator the long period of suspense with toussac 's dreadful thumb upon my chin and finally the move scene which i have witness -- the killing of the hound the capture of lesage and the arrival of the soldier -- i could not wonder that my nerve be overwrought and that i surprised myself in little convulsive gesture like those of a frightened child the chief thought which now fill my mind be what my relation be with this dangerous man who walk by my side he conduct and bearing have fill I with abhorrence i have see the depth of cunning with which he have dupe and betray he companion and i have read in he lean smile face the cold deliberate cruelty of he nature as he stand pistol in hand over the whimper coward whom he have outwit yet i could not deny that when through my own foolish curiosity i have place myself in a most hopeless position it be he who have brave the wrath of the formidable toussac in order to extricate I it be evident also that he might have make he achievement more striking by deliver up two prisoner instead of one to the trooper it be true that i be not a conspirator but i might have find it difficult to prove it so inconsistent do such conduct seem in this little yellow flint-stone of a man that after walk a mile or two in silence i ask he suddenly what the meaning of it might be i hear a dry chuckle in the darkness as if he be amuse by the abruptness and directness of my question ` you be a most amusing person monsieur -- monsieur -- let I see what do you say you name be ' ` de laval ' ` ah quite so monsieur de laval you have the impetuosity and the ingenuousness of youth you want to know what be up a chimney you jump up the chimney you want to know the reason of a thing and you blurt out a question i have be in the habit of living among people who keep they thought to themselves and i find you very refresh ' ` whatever the motive of you conduct there be no doubt that you save my life ' say i ' i be much oblige to you for you intercession ' it be the most difficult thing in the world to express gratitude to a person who fill you with abhorrence and i fear that my halt speech be another instance of that ingenuousness of which he accuse I ' i can do without you thanks ' say he coldly ` you be perfectly right when you think that if it have suit my purpose i should have let you perish and i be perfectly right when i think that if it be not that you be under a obligation you would fail to see my hand if i stretch it out to you just as that overgrown puppy lasalle do it be very honorable he think to serve the emperor upon the field of battle and to risk life in he behalf but when it come to live amidst danger as i have do consort with desperate man and know well that the least slip would mean death why then one be beneath the notice of a fine clean-handed gentleman why ' he continue in a burst of bitter passion ' i have dare more and endure more with toussac and a few of he kidney for comrade than this lasalle have do in all the childish cavalry charge that ever he undertake as to service all he marshal put together have not render the emperor as press a service as i have do but i daresay it do not strike you in that light monsieur -- monsieur -- ' ` de laval ' ` quite so -- it be curious how that name escape I i daresay you take the same view as colonel lasalle ' ` it be not a question upon which i can offer a opinion ' say i ' i only know that i owe my life to you intercession ' i do not know what reply he might have make to this evasion but at that moment we hear a couple of pistol shot and a distant shout from far away in the darkness we stop for a few minute but all be silent once more ` they must have catch sight of toussac ' say my companion ' i be afraid that he be too strong and too cunning to be take by they i do not know what impression he leave upon you but i can tell you that you will go far to meet a more dangerous man ' i answer that i would go far to avoid meeting one unless i have the means of defend myself and my companion 's dry chuckle show that he appreciate my feeling ` yet he be a absolutely honest man which be no very common thing in these day ' say he ` he be one of those who at the outbreak of the revolution embrace it with the whole strength of he simple nature he believe what the writer and the speaker tell he and he be convince that after a little disturbance and a few necessary execution france be to become a heaven upon earth the center of peace and comfort and brotherly love a good many people get those fine idea into they head but the head have mostly drop into the sawdust-basket by this time toussac be true to they and when instead of peace he find war instead of comfort a grind poverty and instead of equality a empire it drive he mad he become the fierce creature you see with the one idea of devote he huge body and giant 's strength to the destruction of those who have interfere with he ideal he be fearless persevere and implacable i have no doubt at all that he will kill I for the part that i have play to-night ' it be in the calmest voice that my companion utter the remark and it make I understand that it be no boast when he say there be more courage need to carry on he unsavoury trade than to play the part of a _ beau sabreur _ like lasalle he pause a little and then go on as if speak to himself ` yes ' say he ' i miss my chance i certainly ought to have shoot he when he be struggle with the hound but if i have only wound he he would have tear I into bit like a over-boiled pullet so perhaps it be as well as it be ' we have leave the salt-marsh behind we and for some time i have feel the soft springy turf of the downland beneath my foot and we path have rise and dip over the curve of the low coast hill in spite of the darkness my companion walk with great assurance never hesitate for a instant and keep up a stiff pace which be welcome to I in my sodden and benumbed condition i have be so young when i leave my native place that it be doubtful whether even in daylight i should have recognize the countryside but now in the darkness half stupefy by my adventure i could not form the least idea as to where we be or what we be make for a certain recklessness have take possession of I and i care little where i go as long as i could gain the rest and shelter of which i stand in need i do not know how long we have walk i only know that i have doze and wake and doze again whilst still automatically keep pace with my comrade when i be at last arouse by he come to a dead stop the rain have cease and although the moon be still obscure the heaven have clear somewhat and i could see for a little distance in every direction a huge white basin gape in front of we and i make out that it be a desert chalk quarry with bramble and fern grow thickly all round the edge my companion after a stealthy glance round to make sure that no one be observe we pick he way amongst the scatter clump of bush until he reach the wall of chalk this he skirt for some distance squeeze between the cliff and the bramble until he come at last to a spot where all further progress appear to be impossible ` can you see a light behind we ' ask my companion i turn round and look carefully in every direction but be unable to see one ` never mind ' say he ` you go first and i will follow ' in some way during the instant that my back have be turn he have swing aside or pluck out the tangle of bush which have bar we way when i turn there be a square dark opening in the white glimmering wall in front of we ` it be small at the entrance but it grow larger further in ' say he i hesitate for a instant whither be it that this strange man be lead I do he live in a cave like a wild beast or be this some trap into which he be lure I the moon shine out at the instant and in its silver light this black silent porthole look inexpressibly cheerless and menacing ` you have go rather far to turn back my good friend ' say my companion ` you must either trust I altogether or not trust I at all ' ' i be at you disposal ' ` pass in then and i shall follow ' i creep into the narrow passage which be so low that i have to crawl down it upon my hand and knee crane my neck round i could see the black angular silhouette of my companion as he come after I he pause at the entrance and then with a rustling of branch and snap of twig the faint light be suddenly shut off from outside and we be leave in pitchy darkness i hear the scrape of he knee as he crawl up behind I ` go on until you come to a step down ' say he ` we shall have more room there and we can strike a light ' the ceiling be so low that by arch my back i could easily strike it and my elbow touch the wall upon either side in those day i be slim and lithe however so that i find no difficulty in make my way onward until at the end of a hundred pace or it may have be a hundred and fifty i feel with my hand that there be a dip in front of I down this i clamber and be instantly conscious from the purer air that i be in some larger cavity i hear the snap of my companion 's flint and the red glow of the tinder paper leap suddenly into the clear yellow flame of the taper at first i could only see that stern emaciated face like some grotesque carve in walnut wood with the ceaseless fishlike vibration of the muscle of he jaw the light beat full upon it and it stand strangely out with a dim halo round it in the darkness then he raise the taper and sweep it slowly round at arm 's length so as to illuminate the place in which we stand i find that we be in a subterranean tunnel which appear to extend into the bowels of the earth it be so high that i could stand erect with ease and the old lichen-blotched stone which line the wall tell of its great age at the spot where we stand the ceiling have fall in and the original passage be block but a cutting have be make from this point through the chalk to form the narrow burrow along which we have come this cutting appear to be quite recent for a mound of _ debris _ and some trenching tool be still lie in the passage my companion taper in hand start off down the tunnel and i follow at he heel step over the great stone which have fall from the roof or the wall and now obstruct the path ` well ' say he grin at I over he shoulder ` have you ever see anything like this in england ' ` never ' i answer ` these be the precaution and device which man adopt in rough day long ago now that rough day have come again they be very useful to those who know of such place ' ` whither do it lead then ' i ask ` to this ' say he stop before a old wooden door powerfully clamp with iron he fumble with the metal-work keep himself between I and it so that i could not see what he be do there be a sharp snick and the door revolve slowly upon its hinge within there be a steep flight of time-worn step lead upward he motion I on and close the door behind we at the head of the stair there be a second wooden gate which he open in a similar manner i have be daze before ever i come into the chalk pit but now at this succession of incident i begin to rub my eye and ask myself whether this be young loui de laval late of ashford in kent or whether it be some dream of the adventure of a hero of pigault lebrun these massive moss-grown arch and mighty iron-clamped door be indeed like the dim shadowy background of a vision but the guttering taper my sodden bundle and all the sordid detail of my disarranged toilet assure I only too clearly of they reality above all the swift brisk business-like manner of my companion and he occasional abrupt remark bring my fancy back to the ground once more he hold the door open for I now and close it again when i have pass through we find ourselves in a long vaulted corridor with a stone-flagged floor and a dim oil lamp burning at the further end two iron-barred window show that we have come above the earth 's surface once more down this corridor we pass and then through several passage and up a short wind stair at the head of it be a open door which lead into a small but comfortable bedroom ' i presume that this will satisfy you want for to-night ' say he i ask for nothing better than to throw myself down damp clothes and all upon that snowy coverlet but for the instant my curiosity overcome my fatigue ' i be much indebted to you sir ' say i ` perhaps you will add to you favor by let I know where i be ' ` you be in my house and that must suffice you for to-night in the morning we shall go further into the matter ' he ring a small bell and a gaunt shock-headed country man-servant come run at the call ` you mistress have retire i suppose ' ` yes sir a good two hour ago ' ` very good i shall call you myself in the morning ' he close my door and the echo of he step seem hardly to have die from my ear before i have sink into that deep and dreamless sleep which only youth and fatigue can give chapter vii the owner of grosbois my host be as good as he word for when a noise in my room awake I in the morning it be to find he stand by the side of my bed so compose in he feature and so drab in he attire that it be hard to associate he with the stir scene of yesterday and with the repulsive part which he have play in they now in the fresh morning sunlight he present rather the appearance of a pedantic schoolmaster a impression which be increase by the masterful and yet benevolent smile with which he regard I in spite of he smile i be more conscious than ever that my whole soul shrink from he and that i should not be at my ease until i have break this companionship which have be so involuntarily form he carry a heap of clothes over one arm which he throw upon a chair at the bottom of my bed ' i gather from the little that you tell I last night ' say he ` that you wardrobe be at present somewhat scanty i fear that you inch be greater than those of anyone in my household but i have bring a few thing here amongst which you may find something to fit you here too be the razor the soap and the powder-box i will return in half a hour when you toilet will doubtless be complete ' i find that my own clothes with a little brushing be as good as ever but i availed myself of he offer to the extent of a ruffle shirt and a black satin cravat i have finish dress and be look out of the window of my room which open on to a blank wall when my host return he look I all over with a keenly scrutinise eye and appear to be satisfy with what he see ` that will do that will do very well indeed ' say he nod a critical head ` in these time a slight indication of travel or hard work upon a costume be more fashionable than the foppishness of the incroyable i have hear lady remark that it be in better taste now sir if you will kindly follow I ' he solicitude about my dress fill I with surprise but this be soon forget in the shock which be await I for as we pass down the passage and into a large hall which seem strangely familiar to I there be a full-length portrait of my father stand right in front of I i stand stare with a gasp of astonishment and turn to see the cold gray eye of my companion fix upon I with a humorous glitter ` you seem surprised monsieur de laval ' say he ` for god 's sake ' say i ` do not trifle with I any further who be you and what be this place to which you have take I ' for answer he break into one of he dry chuckle and lay he skinny brown hand upon my wrist he lead I into a large apartment in the center be a table tastefully lay and beyond it in a low chair a young lady be seat with a book in she hand she rise as we enter and i see that she be tall and slender with a dark face pronounce feature and black eye of extraordinary brilliancy even in that one glance it strike I that the expression with which she regard I be by no mean a friendly one ` sibylle ' say my host and he word take the breath from my lip ` this be you cousin from england loui de laval this my dear nephew be my only daughter sibylle bernac ' ` then you -- ' ' i be you mother 's brother charle bernac ' ` you be my uncle bernac ' i stammer at he like a idiot ` but why do you not tell I so ' i cry ' i be not sorry to have a chance of quietly observe what he english education have do for my nephew it might also have be harder for I to stand you friend if my comrade have any reason to think that i be personally interested in you but you will permit I now to welcome you heartily to france and to express my regret if you reception have be a rough one i be sure that sibylle will help I to atone for it ' he smile archly at he daughter who continue to regard I with a stony face i look round I and gradually the spacious room with the weapon upon the wall and the deer 's head come dimly back to my memory that view through the oriel window too with the clump of oak in the sloping park and the sea in the distance beyond i have certainly see it before it be true then and i be in we own castle of grosboi and this dreadful man in the snuff-coloured coat this sinister plotter with the death 's - head face be the man whom i have hear my poor father curse so often the man who have oust he from he own property and install himself in he place and yet i could not forget that it be he also who at some risk to himself have save I the night before and my soul be again tear between my gratitude and my repulsion we have seat ourselves at the table and as we eat this newly-found uncle of mine continue to explain all those point which i have fail to understand ' i suspect that it be you the instant that i set eye upon you ' say he ' i be old enough to remember you father when he be a young gallant and you be he very double -- though i may say without flattery that where there be a difference it be in you favor and yet he have the name of be one of the handsomest man betwixt rouen and the sea you must bear in mind that i be expect you and that there be not so many young aristocrat of you age wander about along the coast i be surprise when you do not recognize where you be last night have you never hear of the secret passage of grosboi ' it come vaguely back to I that in my childhood i have hear of this underground tunnel but that the roof have fall in and render it useless ` precisely ' say my uncle ` when the castle pass into my hand one of the very first thing which i do be to cut a new opening at the end of it for i foresaw that in these troublesome time it might be of use to I indeed have it be in repair it might have make the escape of you mother and father a very much easier affair ' he word recall all that i have hear and all that i could remember of those dreadful day when we the lord of the country side have be chase across it as if we have be wolf with the howling mob still cluster at the pier-head to shake they fist and hurl they stone at we i remember too that it be this very man who be speak to I who have throw oil upon the flame in those day and whose fortune have be found upon we ruin as i look across at he i find that he keen gray eye be fix upon I and i could see that he have read the thought in my mind ` we must let bygones be bygones ' say he ` those be quarrel of the last generation and sibylle and you represent a new one ' my cousin have not say one word or take any notice of my presence but at this join of we name she glance at I with the same hostile expression which i have already remark ` come sibylle ' say she father ` you can assure you cousin loui that so far as you be concern any family misunderstanding be at a end ' ` it be very well for we to talk in that way father ' she answer ` it be not you picture that hang in the hall or you coat-of-arm that i see upon the wall we hold the castle and the land but it be for the heir of the de lavals to tell _ we _ if he be satisfy with this ' she dark scornful eye be fix upon I as she wait for my reply but she father hasten to intervene ` this be not a very hospitable tone in which to greet you cousin ' say he harshly ` it have so chance that loui ' heritage have fall to we but it be not for we to remind he of the fact ' ` he need no remind ' say she ` you do I a injustice ' i cry for the evident and malignant scorn of this girl gall I to the quick ` it be true that i can not forget that this castle and these grounds belong to my ancestor -- i should be a clod indeed if i _ could _ forget it -- but if you think that i harbor any bitterness you be mistake for my own part i ask nothing better than to open up a career for myself with my own sword ' ` and never be there a time when it could be more easily and more brilliantly do ' cry my uncle ` there be great thing about to happen in the world and if you be at the emperor 's court you will be in the middle of they i understand that you be content to serve he ' ' i wish to serve my country ' ` by serve the emperor you do so for without he the country become chaos ' ` from all we hear it be not a very easy service ' say my cousin ' i should have think that you would have be very much more comfortable in england -- and then you would have be so much safer also ' everything which the girl say seem to be mean as a insult to I and yet i could not imagine how i have ever offend she never have i meet a woman for whom i conceive so hearty and rapid a dislike i could see that she remark be as offensive to she father as they be to I for he look at she with eye which be as angry as she own ` you cousin be a brave man and that be more than can be say for someone else that i could mention ' say he ` for whom ' she ask ` never mind ' he snap and jump up with the air of a man who be afraid that he rage may master he and that he may say more than he wish he run from the room she seem startle by this retort of he and rise as if she would follow he then she toss she head and laugh incredulously ' i suppose that you have never meet you uncle before ' say she after a few minute of embarrassed silence ` never ' answer i ` well what do you think of he now you _ have _ meet he ' such a question from a daughter about she father fill I with a certain vague horror i feel that he must be even a worse man than i have take he for if he have so completely forfeit the loyalty of he own nearest and dearest ` you silence be a sufficient answer ' say she as i hesitate for a reply ' i do not know how you come to meet he last night or what pass between you for we do not share each other 's confidence i think however that you have read he aright now i have something to ask you you have a letter from he invite you to leave england and to come here have you not ' ` yes i have ' ` do you observe nothing on the outside ' i thought of those two sinister word which have puzzle I so much ` what it be you who warn I not to come ' ` yes it be i i have no other means of do it ' ` but why do you do it ' ` because i do not wish you to come here ' ` do you think that i would harm you ' she sit silent for a few seconds like one who be afraid of say too much when she answer come it be a very unexpected one : ' i be afraid that you would be harm ' ` you think that i be in danger here ' ' i be sure of it ' ` you advise I to leave ' ` without lose a instant ' ` from whom be the danger then ' again she hesitate and then with a reckless motion like one who throw prudence to the wind she turn upon I ` it be from my father ' say she ` but why should he harm I ' ` that be for you sagacity to discover ' ` but i assure you mademoiselle that in this matter you misjudge he ' say i ` as it happen he interfere to save my life last night ' ` to save you life from whom ' ` from two conspirator whose plan i have chance to discover ' ` conspirator ' she look at I in surprise ` they would have kill I if he have not intervene ' ` it be not he interest that you should be harm yet awhile he have reason for wish you to come to castle grosboi but i have be very frank with you and i wish you to be equally so with I do it happen -- do it happen that during you youth in england you have ever -- you have ever have a affair of the heart ' everything which this cousin of mine say appear to I to be stranger than the last and this question come at the end of so serious a conversation be the strangest of all but frankness beget frankness and i do not hesitate ' i have leave the very best and truest girl in the world behind I in england ' say i ` eugenie be she name eugenie de choiseul the niece of the old duke ' my reply seem to give my cousin great satisfaction she large dark eye shine with pleasure ` you be very attach ' she ask ' i shall never be happy until i see she ' ` and you would not give she up ' ` god forbid ' ` not for the castle of grosboi ' ` not even for that ' my cousin hold out she hand to I with a charmingly frank impulsiveness ` you will forgive I for my rudeness ' say she ' i see that we be to be ally and not enemy ' and we hand be still clasp when she father re-enter the room chapter viii cousin sibylle i could see in my uncle 's grim face as he look at we the keenest satisfaction contend with surprise at this sign of we sudden reconciliation all trace of he recent anger seem to have leave he as he address he daughter but in spite of he altered tone i notice that she eye look defiance and distrust ' i have some papers of importance to look over ' say he ` for a hour or so i shall be engage i can guess that loui would like to see the old place once again and i be sure that he could not have a better guide than you sibylle if you will take he over it ' she raise no objection and for my part i be overjoy at the proposal as it give I a opportunity of learn more of this singular cousin of mine who have tell I so much and yet seem to know so much more what be the meaning of this obscure warning which she have give I against she father and why be she so frankly anxious to know about my love affair these be the two question which press for a answer so out we go together into the sweet coast-land air the sweeter for the gale of the night before and we walk through the old yew-lined path and out into the park and so round the castle look up at the gable the gray pinnacle the oak-mullioned window the ancient wing with its crenulated wall and its meurtriere window the modern with its pleasant verandah and veil of honeysuckle and as she show I each fresh little detail with a particularity which make I understand how dear the place have become to she she would still keep offer she apology for the fact that she should be the hostess and i the visitor ` it be not against you but against ourselves that i be bitter ' say she ` for be we not the cuckoo who have take a strange nest and drive out those who build it it make I blush to think that my father should invite you to you own house ' ` perhaps we have be root here too long ' i answer ` perhaps it be for we own good that we be drive out to carve we own fortune as i intend to do ' ` you say that you be go to the emperor ' ` yes ' ` you know that he be in camp near here ' ` so i have hear ' ` but you family be still proscribe ' ' i have do he no harm i will go boldly to he and ask he to admit I into he service ' ` well ' say she ` there be some who call he a usurper and wish he all evil but for my own part i have never hear of anything that he have say and do which be not great and noble but i have expect that you would be quite a englishman cousin loui and come over here with you pocket full of pitt 's guinea and you heart of treason ' ' i have meet nothing but hospitality from the english ' i answer ` but my heart have always be french ' ` but you father fight against we at quiberon ' ` let each generation settle its own quarrel ' say i ' i be quite of you father 's opinion about that ' ` do not judge my father by he word but by he deed ' say she with a warning finger upraise ` and above all cousin loui unless you wish to have my life upon you conscience never let he suspect that i have say a word to set you on you guard ' ` you life ' i gasp ` oh yes he would not stick at that ' she cry ` he kill my mother i do not say that he slaughter she but i mean that he cold brutality break she gentle heart now perhaps you begin to understand why i can talk of he in this fashion ' as she speak i could see the secret brooding of year the bitter resentment crush down in she silent soul rise suddenly to flush she dark cheek and to gleam in she splendid eye i realize at that moment that in that tall slim figure there dwell a unconquerable spirit ` you must think that i speak very freely to you since i have only know you a few hour cousin loui ' say she ` to whom should you speak freely if not to you own relative ' ` it be true and yet i never expect that i should be on such term with you i look forward to you come with dread and sorrow no doubt i show something of my feeling when my father bring you in ' ` indeed you do ' i answer ' i fear that my presence be unwelcome to you ' ` most unwelcome both for you own sake and for mine ' say she ` for you sake because i suspect as i have tell you that my father 's intention might be unfriendly for mine -- ' ` why for yours ' i ask in surprise for she have stop in embarrassment ` you have tell I that you heart be another 's i may tell you that my hand be also promise and that my love have go with it ' ` may all happiness attend it ' say i ` but why should this make my come unwelcome ' ` that thick english air have dim you wit cousin ' say she shake she stately head at I ` but i can speak freely now that i know that this plan would be as hateful to you as to I you must know then that if my father could have marry we he would have unite all claim to the succession of grosboi then come what might -- bourbon or buonaparte -- nothing could shake he position ' i thought of the solicitude which he have show over my toilet in the morning he anxiety that i should make a favourable impression he displeasure when she have be cold to I and the smile upon he face when he have see we hand in hand ' i believe you be right ' i cry ` right of course i be right look at he watch we now ' we be walk on the edge of the dry moat and as i look up there sure enough be the little yellow face tone towards we in the angle of one of the window see that i be watch he he rise and wave he hand merrily ` now you know why he save you life -- since you say that he save it ' say she ` it would suit he plan best that you should marry he daughter and so he wish you to live but when once he understand that that be impossible why then my poor cousin loui he only way of guard against the return of the de lavals must lie in ensure that there be none to return ' it be those word of hers couple with that furtive yellow face still lurk at the window which make I realize the imminence of my danger no one in france have any reason to take a interest in I if i be to pass away there be no one who could make inquiry -- i be absolutely in he power my memory tell I what a ruthless and dangerous man it be with whom i have to deal ` but ' say i ` he must have know that you affection be already engage ' ` he do ' she answer ` it be that which make I most uneasy of all i be afraid for you and afraid for myself but most of all i be afraid for lucien no man can stand in the way of he plan ' ` lucien ` the name be like a lightning flash upon a dark night i have hear of the vagary of a woman 's love but be it possible that this spirited woman love that poor creature whom i have see grovel last night in a frenzy of fear but now i remember also where i have see the name sibylle it be upon the fly-leaf of he book ` lucien from sibylle ' be the inscription i recall also that my uncle have say something to he about he aspiration ` lucien be hot-headed and easily carry away ' say she ` my father have see a great deal of he lately they sit for hour in he room and lucien will say nothing of what pass between they i fear that there be something go forward which may lead to evil lucien be a student rather than a man of the world but he have strong opinion about politics ' i be at my wit 's end what to do whether to be silent or to tell she of the terrible position in which she lover be place but even as i hesitate she with the quick intuition of a woman read the doubt which be in my mind ` you know something of he ' she cry ' i understand that he have go to pari for god 's sake tell I what you know about he ' ` he name be lesage ' ` yes yes lucien lesage ' ' i have -- i have see he ' i stammer ` you have see he and you only arrive in france last night where do you see he what have happen to he ' she grip I by the wrist in she anxiety it be cruel to tell she and yet it seem more cruel still to keep silent i look round in my bewilderment and there be my uncle himself come along over the close-cropped green lawn by he side with a merry clashing of steel and jingle of spur there walk a handsome young hussar -- the same to whom the charge of the prisoner have be commit upon the night before sibylle never hesitate for a instant but with a set face and blaze eye she sweep towards they ` father ' say she ` what have you do with lucien ' i see he impassive face wince for a moment before the passionate hatred and contempt which he read in she eye ` we will discuss this at some future time ' say he ' i will know here and now ' she cry ` what have you do with lucien ' ` gentleman ' say he turn to the young hussar and I ' i be sorry that we should intrude we little domestic difference upon you attention you will i be sure make allowance lieutenant when i tell you that you prisoner of last night be a very dear friend of my daughter 's such family consideration do not prevent I from do my duty to the emperor but they make that duty more painful than it would otherwise be ' ` you have my sympathy mademoiselle ' say the young hussar it be to he that my cousin have now turn ` do i understand that you take he prisoner ' she ask ` it be unfortunately my duty ' ` from you i will get the truth whither do you take he ' ` to the emperor 's camp ' ` and why ' ` ah mademoiselle it be not for I to go into politics my duty be but to wield a sword and sit a horse and obey my order both these gentleman will be my witness that i receive my instruction from colonel lasalle ' ` but on what charge be he arrest ' ` tut tut child we have have enough of this ' say my uncle harshly ` if you insist upon know i will tell you once and for all that monsieur lucien lesage have be seize for be concern in a plot against the life of the emperor and that it be my privilege to denounce the would-be assassin ' ` to denounce he ' cry the girl ' i know that it be you who set he on who encourage he who hold he to it whenever he try to draw back oh you villain you villain what have i over do what sin of my ancestor be i expiate that i should be compel to call such a man father ' my uncle shrug he shoulder as if to say that it be useless to argue with a woman 's tantrum the hussar and i make as if we would stroll away for it be embarrass to stand listen to such word but in she fury she call to we to stop and be witness against he never have i see such a recklessness of passion as blaze in she dry wide-opened eye ` you have deceive other but you have never deceive I ' she cry ' i know you as you own conscience know you you may murder I as you murder my mother before I but you can never frighten I into be you accomplice you proclaim yourself a republican that you might creep into a house and estate which do not belong to you and now you try to make a friend of buonaparte by betray you old associate who still trust in you and you have send lucien to he death but i know you plan and my cousin loui know they also and i can assure you that there be just as much chance of he agree to they as there be of my do so i would rather lie in my grave than be the wife of any man but lucien ' ` if you have see the pitiful poltroon that he prove himself you would not say so ' say my uncle coolly ` you be not yourself at present but when you return to you right mind you will be ashamed of have make this public exposure of you weakness and now lieutenant you have something to say ' ` my message be to you monsieur de laval ' say the young hussar turn he back contemptuously upon my uncle ` the emperor have send I to bring you to he at once at the camp at boulogne ' my heart leap at the thought of escape from my uncle ' i ask nothing better ' i cry ' a horse and a escort be wait at the gate ' ' i be ready to start at this instant ' ` nay there can be no such very great hurry ' say my uncle ` surely you will wait for luncheon lieutenant gerard ' ` the emperor 's commission sir be not carry out in such a manner ' say the young hussar sternly ' i have already waste too much time we must be upon we way in five minute ' my uncle place he hand upon my arm and lead I slowly towards the gateway through which my cousin sibylle have already pass ` there be one matter that i wish to speak to you about before you go since my time be so short you will forgive I if i introduce it without preamble you have see you cousin sibylle and though she behavior this morning be such as to prejudice you against she yet i can assure you that she be a very amiable girl she speak just now as if she have mention the plan which i have conceive to you i confess to you that i can not imagine anything more convenient than that we should unite in order to settle once for all every question as to which branch of the family shall hold the estate ' ` unfortunately ' say i ` there be objection ' ` and pray what be they ' ` the fact that my cousin 's hand as i have just learn be promise to another ' ` that need not hinder we ' say he with a sour smile ' i will undertake that he never claim the promise ' ' i fear that i have the english idea of marriage that it should go by love and not by convenience but in any case you scheme be out of the question for my own affection be pledge to a young lady in england ' he look wickedly at I out of the corner of he gray eye ` think well what you be do loui ' say he in a sibilant whisper which be as menacing as a serpent 's hiss ` you be derange my plan and that be not do with impunity ' ` it be not a matter in which i have any choice ' he grip I by the sleeve and wave he hand round as satan may have do when he show the kingdom and principality ` look at the park ' he cry ` the field the wood look at the old castle in which you father have live for eight hundred year you have but to say the word and it be all yours once more ' there flash up into my memory the little red-brick house at ashford and eugenie 's sweet pale face look over the laurel bush which grow by the window ` it be impossible ' say i there must have be something in my manner which make he comprehend that it really be so for he face darken with anger and he persuasion change in a instant to menace ` if i have know this they might have do what they wish with you last night ' say he ' i would never have put out a finger to save you ' ' i be glad to hear you say so ' i answer ` for it make it easier for I to say that i wish to go my own way and to have nothing more to do with you what you have just say free I from the bond of gratitude which hold I back ' ' i have no doubt that you would like to have nothing more to do with I ' he cry ` you will wish it more heartily still before you finish very well sir go you own way and i will go mine and we shall see who come out the best in the end ' a group of hussar be stand by they horse ' head in the gateway in a few minute i have pack my scanty possession and i be hasten with they down the corridor when a chill strike suddenly through my heart at the thought of my cousin sibylle how could i leave she alone with this grim companion in the old castle have she not herself tell I that she very life might be at stake i have stop in my perplexity and suddenly there be a patter of foot and there she be run towards I ` good-bye cousin loui ' she cry with outstretched hand ' i be think of you ' say i ` you father and i have have a explanation and a quarrel ' ` thank god ' she cry ` you only chance be to get away from he but beware for he will do you a injury if he can ' ` he may do he worst but how can i leave you here in he power ' ` have no fear about I he have more reason to avoid I than i he but they be call for you cousin loui good-bye and god be with you ' chapter ix the camp of boulogne my uncle be still stand at the castle gateway the very picture of a usurper with we own old coat-of-arm of the bend argent and the three blue martlet engrave upon the stone at either side of he he give I no sign of greet as i mount the large gray horse which be await I but he look thoughtfully at I from under he down-drawn brow and he jaw muscle still throb with that stealthy rhythmical movement i read a cold and settle malice in he set yellow face and he stern eye for my own part i spring readily enough into the saddle for the man 's presence have from the first be loathsome to I and i be right glad to be able to turn my back upon he and so with a stern quick order from the lieutenant and a jingle and clatter from the trooper we be off upon we journey as i glance back at the black keep of grosboi and at the sinister figure who stand look after we from beside the gateway i see from over he head a white handkerchief gleam for a instant in a last greet from one of the gloomy meurtriere window and again a chill run through I as i thought of the fearless girl and of the hand in which we be leave she but sorrow clear from the mind of youth like the tarnish of breath upon glass and who could carry a heavy heart upon so lightfoot a horse and through so sweet a air the white glimmer road wound over the downs with the sea far upon the left and between lay that great salt-marsh which have be the scene of we adventure i could even see as i fancy a dull black spot in the distance to mark the position of that terrible cottage far away the little cluster of house show the position of etaple ambleterre and the other fishing village whilst i could see that the point which have seem last night to glow like a half-forged red-hot sword-blade be now white as a snow-field with the camp of a great army far far away a little dim cloud upon the water stand for the land where i have spend my day -- the pleasant homely land which will always rank next to my own in my affection and now i turn my attention from the downs and the sea to the hussar who ride beside I form as i could perceive a guard rather than a escort save for the patrol last night they be the first of the famous soldier of napoleon whom i have ever see and it be with admiration and curiosity that i look upon man who have win a world-wide reputation for they discipline and they gallantry they appearance be by no means gorgeous and they dress and equipment be much more modest than that of the east kent yeomanry which ride every Saturday through ashford but the stain tunic the worn leather and the rough hardy horse give they a very workmanlike appearance they be small light brown-faced fellow heavily whisker and moustach many of they wear ear-ring in they ear it surprise I that even the youngest and most boyish-looking of they should be so bristle with hair until upon a second look i perceive that he whisker be form of lump of black wax stick on to the side of he face the tall young lieutenant notice the astonishment with which i gaze at he boyish trooper ` yes yes ' say he ` they be artificial sure enough but what can you expect from a lad of seventeen on the other hand we can not spoil the appearance of the regiment upon parade by have a girl 's cheek in the rank ' ` it melt terribly in this warm weather lieutenant ' say the hussar join in the conversation with the freedom which be one of the characteristic of napoleon 's troops ` well well caspar in a year or two you will dispense with they ' ` who know perhaps he will have dispense with he head also by that time ' say a corporal in front and they all laugh together in a manner which in england would have mean a court-martial this seem to I to be one of the survival of the revolution that officer and private be leave upon a very familiar footing which be increase no doubt by the freedom with which the emperor would chat with he old soldier and the liberty which he would allow they to take with he it be no uncommon thing for a shower of chaff to come from the rank direct at they own commanding officer and i be sorry to say also that it be no very unusual thing for a shower of bullet to come also unpopular officer be continually assassinate by they own man at the battle of montebello it be well know that every officer with the exception of one lieutenant belong to the 24th demi-brigade be shoot down from behind but this be a relic of the bad time and as the emperor gain more complete control a better feeling be establish the history of we army at that time prove at any rate that the highest efficiency could be maintain without the flogging which be still use in the prussian and the english service and it be show for the first time that great body of man could be induce to act from a sense of duty and a love of country without hope of reward or fear of punishment when a french general could suffer he division to straggle as they would over the face of the country with the certainty that they would concentrate upon the day of battle he prove that he have soldier who be worthy of he trust one thing have strike I as curious about these hussar -- that they pronounce french with the utmost difficulty i remark it to the lieutenant as he ride by my side and i ask he from what foreign country he man be recruit since i could perceive that they be not frenchmen ` my faith you must not let they hear you say so ' say he ` for they would answer you as like as not by a thrust from they sabre we be the premier regiment of the french cavalry the first hussar of bercheny and though it be true that we man be all recruit in alsace and few of they can speak anything but german they be as good frenchman as kleber or kellermann who come from the same part we man be all pick and we officer ' he add pull at he light moustache ` be the finest in the service ' the swaggering vanity of the fellow amuse I for he cock he busby swing the blue dolman which hang from he shoulder sit he horse and clatter he scabbard in a manner which tell of he boyish delight and pride in himself and he regiment as i look at he lithe figure and he fearless bearing i could quite imagine that he do himself no more than justice while he frank smile and he merry blue eye assure I that he would prove a good comrade he have himself be take observation of I for he suddenly place he hand upon my knee as we ride side by side ' i trust that the emperor be not displeased with you ' say he with a very grave face ' i can not think that he can be so ' i answer ` for i have come from england to put my service at he disposal ' ` when the report be present last night and he hear of you presence in that den of thief he be very anxious that you should be bring to he perhaps it be that he wish you to be guide to we in england no doubt you know you way all over the island ' the hussar 's idea of a island seem to be limit to the little patch which lie off the norman or breton coast i try to explain to he that this be a great country not much smaller than france ` well well ' say he ` we shall know all about it presently for we be go to conquer it they say in the camp that we shall probably enter london either next Wednesday evening or else on the Thursday morning we be to have a week for plunder the town and then one army corps be to take possession of scotland and another of ireland ' he serene confidence make I smile ` but how do you know you can do all this ' i ask ` oh ' say he ` the emperor have arrange it ' ` but they have a army and they be well prepare they be brave man and they will fight ' ` there would be no use they do that for the emperor be go over himself ' say he and in the simple answer i understand for the first time the absolute trust and confidence which these soldier have in they leader they feeling for he be fanaticism and its strength be religion and never do mahomet nerve the arm of he believer and strengthen they against pain and death more absolutely than this little grey-coated idol do to those who worship he if he have choose -- and he be more than once upon the point of it -- to assert that he be indeed above humanity he would have find million to grant he claim you who have hear of he as a stout gentleman in a straw hat as he be in he later day may find it hard to understand it but if you have see he mangled soldier still with they die breath cry out to he and turn they livid face towards he as he pass you would have realize the hold which he have over the mind of man ` you have be over there ' ask the lieutenant presently jerk he thumb towards the distant cloud upon the water ` yes i have spend my life there ' ` but why do you stay there when there be such good fighting to be have in the french service ' ` my father be drive out of the country as a aristocrat it be only after he death that i could offer my sword to the emperor ' ` you have miss a great deal but i have no doubt that we shall still have plenty of fine war and you think that the english will offer we battle ' ' i have no doubt of it ' ` we fear that when they understand that it be the emperor in person who have come they would throw down they arm i have hear that there be some fine woman over there ' ` the woman be beautiful ' he say nothing but for some time he square he shoulder and puff out he chest curl up the end of he little yellow moustache ` but they will escape in boat ' he mutter at last and i could see that he have still that picture of a little island in he imagination ` if they could but see we they might remain it have be say of the hussar of bercheny that they can set a whole population run the woman towards we the man away we be as you have no doubt observe a very fine body of man and the officer be the pick of the service though the senior be hardly up to the same standard as the rest of we ' with all he self-confidence this officer do not seem to I to be more than my own age so i ask he whether he have see any service he moustache bristle with indignation at my question and he look I up and down with a severe eye ' i have have the good fortune to be present at nine battle sir and at more than forty skirmish ' say he ' i have also fight a considerable number of duel and i can assure you that i be always ready to meet anyone -- even a civilian -- who may wish to put I to the proof ' i assure he that he be very fortunate to be so young and yet to have see so much upon which he ill-temper vanish as quickly as it come and he explain that he have serve in the hohenlinden campaign under moreau as well as in napoleon 's passage of the alp and the campaign of marengo ` when you have be with the army for a little time the name of etienne gerard will not be so unfamiliar to you ' say he ' i believe that i may claim to be the hero of one or two little story which the soldier love to tell about they camp fire you will hear of my duel with the six fencing master and you will be tell how single-handed i charge the austrian hussar of graz and bring they silver kettledrum back upon the crupper of my mare i can assure you that it be not by accident that i be present last night but it be because colonel lasalle be very anxious to be sure of any prisoner whom he might make as it turn out however i only have the one poor chicken-hearted creature whom i hand over to the provost-marshal ' ` and the other -- toussac ' ` ah he seem to have be a man of another breed i could have ask nothing better than to have have he at my sword-point but he have escape they catch sight of he and fire a pistol or two but he know the bog too well and they could not follow he ' ` and what will be do to you prisoner ' i ask lieutenant gerard shrug he shoulder ' i be very sorry for mademoiselle you cousin ' say he ` but a fine girl should not love such a man when there be so many gallant soldier upon the country side i hear that the emperor be weary of these endless plotting and that a example will be make of he ' whilst the young hussar and i have be talk we have be canter down the broad white road until we be now quite close to the camp which we could see lie in its arrangement of regiment and brigade beneath we we approach lay over the high ground so that we could see down into this canvas city with its interminable line of picket horse its park of artillery and its swarm of soldier in the center be a clear space with one very large tent and a cluster of low wooden house in the middle of it with the tricolor banner wave above they ` that be the emperor 's quarter and the smaller tent there be the headquarters of general ney who command this corps you understand that this be only one of several army dot along from dunkirk in the north to this which be the most southerly the emperor go from one to the other inspect each in its turn but this be the main body and contain most of the pick troops so that it be we who see most of he especially now that the empress and the court have come to pont de briques he be in there at the present moment ' he add in a hushed voice point to the great white tent in the center the road into the camp run through a considerable plain which be cover by body of cavalry and infantry engage upon they drill we have hear so much in england about napoleon 's troops and they feat have appear so extraordinary that my imagination have prepare I for man of very striking appearance as a matter of fact the ordinary infantry of the line in they blue coat and white breeches and gaiter be quite little fellow and even they high brass-covered hat and red plume could not make they very impose in spite of they size however they be tough and wiry and after they eighteen month in camp they be train to the highest pitch of perfection the rank be full of veteran and all the under-officer have see much service while the general in command have never be equal in ability so that it be no mean foe which lay with its menacing eye fix upon the distant cliff of england if pitt have not be able to place the first navy in the world between the two shore the history of europe might be very different to-day lieutenant gerard see the interest with which i gaze at the manoeuvring troops be good enough to satisfy my curiosity about such of they as approach the road along which we be journey ` those fellow on the black horse with the great blue rug upon they croup be the cuirassier ' say he ` they be so heavy that they can not raise more than a trot so when they charge we manage that there shall be a brigade of chasseur or hussar behind they to follow up the advantage ' ` who be the civilian who be inspect they ' i ask ` that be not a civilian but it be general st cyr who be one of those whom they call the spartan of the rhine they be of opinion that simplicity of life and of dress be part of a good soldier and so they would wear no uniform beyond a simple blue ride coat such as you see st cyr be a excellent officer but he be not popular for he seldom speak to anyone and he sometimes shut himself up for day on end in he tent where he play upon he violin i think myself that a soldier be none the worse because he enjoy a glass of good wine or have a smart jacket and a few brandenburg across he chest for my part i do both and yet those who know I would tell you that it have not harm my soldier you see this infantry upon the leave ' ` the man with the yellow facing ' ` precisely those be oudinot 's famous grenadier and the other grenadier with the red shoulder-knot and the fur hat strap above they knapsack be the imperial guard the successor of the old consular guard who win marengo for we eighteen hundred of they get the cross of honor after the battle there be the 57th of the line which have be name the terrible and there be the 7th light infantry who come from the pyrenee and who be well know to be the best marcher and the greatest rascal in the army the light cavalry in green be the horse chasseur of the guard sometimes call the guide who be say to be the emperor 's favorite troops although he make a great mistake if he prefer they to the hussar of bercheny the other cavalry with the green pelisse be also chasseur but i can not tell from here what regiment they be they colonel handle they admirably they be move to a flank in open column of half-squadron and then wheeling into line to charge we could not do it better ourselves and now monsieur de laval here we be at the gate of the camp of boulogne and it be my duty to take you straight to the emperor 's quarter ' chapter x the ante-room the camp of boulogne contain at that time one hundred and fifty thousand infantry with fifty thousand cavalry so that its population be second only to pari among the city of france it be divide into four section the right camp the left camp the camp of wimereux and the camp of ambleteuse the whole be about a mile in depth and extend along the seashore for a length of about seven mile on the land side it be open but on the sea side it be fringe by powerful battery contain mortar and cannon of a size never see before these battery be place along the edge of the high cliff and they lofty position increase they range and enable they to drop they missile upon the deck of the english ship it be a pretty sight to ride through the camp for the man have be there for more than a year and have do all that be possible to decorate and ornament they tent most of they have little garden in front or around they and the sun-burned fellow might be see as we pass kneel in they shirt-sleeve with they spud and they watering-can in the midst of they flower-bed other sit in the sunshine at the opening of the tent tie up they queue pipe-clay they belt and polish they arm hardly bestow a glance upon we as we pass for patrol of cavalry be come and go in every direction the endless line be form into street with they name print up upon board thus we have pass through the rue d'arcola the rue de kleber the rue d'egypte and the rue d'artillerie volante before we find ourselves in the great central square in which the headquarters of the army be situate the emperor at this time use to sleep at a village call pont de brique some four mile inland but he day be spend at the camp and he continual council of war be hold there here also be he minister and the general of the army corps which be scatter up and down the coast come thither to make they report and to receive they order for these consultation a plain wooden house have be construct contain one very large room and three small one the pavilion which we have observe from the downs serve as a ante-chamber to the house in which those who seek audience with the emperor might assemble it be at the door of this where a strong guard of grenadier announce napoleon 's presence that my guardian spring down from he horse and sign to I to follow he example a officer of the guard take we name and return to we accompany by general duroc a thin hard dry man of forty with a formal manner and a suspicious eye ` be this monsieur loui de laval ' he ask with a stiff smile i bow ` the emperor be very anxious to see you you be no longer need lieutenant ' ' i be personally responsible for bring he safely general ' ` very good you may come in if you prefer it ' and he pass we into the huge tent which be unfurnished save for a row of wooden bench round the side a number of man in naval and military uniform be seat upon these and numerous group be stand about chat in subdue tone at the far end be a door which lead into the imperial council chamber now and then i see some man in official dress walk up to this door scratch gently upon it with he nail and then as it instantly open slip discreetly through close it softly behind he over the whole assembly there hang a air of the court rather than of the camp a atmosphere of awe and of reverence which be the more impressive when it affect these bluff soldier and sailor the emperor have seem to I to be formidable in the distance but i find he even more overwhelming now that he be close at hand ` you need have no fear monsieur de laval ' say my companion ` you be go to have a good reception ' ` how do you know that ' ` from general duroc 's manner in these curse court if the emperor smile upon you everyone smile down to that flunkey in the red velvet coat yonder but if the emperor frown why you have only to look at the face of the man who wash the imperial plate and you will see the frown reflect upon it and the worst of it be that if you be a plain-witted man you may never find out what earn you either the frown or the smile that be why i have rather wear the shoulder-strap of a lieutenant and be at the side of my squadron with a good horse between my knee and my sabre clank against my stirrup-iron than have monsieur talleyrand 's grand hotel in the rue saint florentin and he hundred thousand livre of income ' i be still wonder whether the hussar could be right and if the smile with which duroc have greet I could mean that the emperor 's intention towards I be friendly when a very tall and handsome young man in a brilliant uniform come towards I in spite of the change in he dress i recognize he at once as the general savary who have command the expedition of the night before ` well monsieur de laval ' say he shake hand with I very pleasantly ` you have hear no doubt that this fellow toussac have escape we he be really the only one whom we be anxious to seize for the other be evidently a mere dupe and dreamer but we shall have he yet and between ourselves we shall keep a very strict guard upon the emperor 's person until we do for master toussac be not a man to be despise ' i seem to feel he great rough thumb upon my chin as i answer that i think he be a very dangerous man indeed ` the emperor will see you presently ' say savary ` he be very busy this morning but he bid I say that you should have a audience ' he smile and pass on ` assuredly you be get on ' whisper gerard ` there be a good many man here who would risk something to have savary address they as he address you the emperor be certainly go to do something for you but attention friend for here be monsieur de talleyrand himself come towards we ' a singular-looking person be shuffling in we direction he be a man about fifty year of age largely make about the shoulder and chest but stoop a good deal and limp heavily in one leg he walk slowly lean upon a silver-headed stick and he sober suit of black with silk stocking of the same hue look strangely staid among the brilliant uniform which surround he but in spite of he plain dress there be a expression of great authority upon he shrewd face and every one draw back with bow and salute as he move across the tent ` monsieur loui de laval ' say he as he stop in front of I and he cold gray eye play over I from head to heel i bow and with some coldness for i share the dislike which my father use to profess for this unfrocked priest and perjure politician but he manner be so polished and engaging that it be hard to hold out against it ' i know you cousin de rohan very well indeed ' say he ` we be two rascal together when the world be not quite so serious as it be at present i believe that you be related to the cardinal de montmorency de laval who be also a old friend of mine i understand that you be about to offer you service to the emperor ' ' i have come from england for that purpose sir ' ` and meet with some little adventure immediately upon you arrival as i understand i have hear the story of the worthy police agent the two jacobin and the lonely hut well you have see the danger to which the emperor be expose and it may make you the more zealous in he service where be you uncle monsieur bernac ' ` he be at the castle of grosboi ' ` do you know he well ' ' i have not see he until yesterday ' ` he be a very useful servant of the emperor but -- but -- ' he incline he head downward to my ear ` some more congenial service will be find for you monsieur de laval ' and so with a bow he whisk round and tap he way across the tent again ` why my friend you be certainly destine for something great ' say the hussar lieutenant ` monsieur de talleyrand do not waste he smile and he bow i promise you he know which way the wind blow before he fly he kite and i foresee that i shall be ask for you interest to get I my captaincy in this english campaign ah the council of war be at a end ' as he speak the inner door at the end of the great tent open and a small knot of man come through dress in the dark blue coat with trimming of gold oak-leaf which mark the marshal of the empire they be all but one man who have hardly reach they middle age and who in any other army might have be consider fortunate if they have gain the command of a regiment but the continuous war and the open system by which rule of seniority yield to merit have open up a rapid career to a successful soldier each carry he curved cocked hat under he arm and now lean upon they sword-hilt they fall into a little circle and chat eagerly among themselves ` you be a man of family be you not ' ask my hussar ' i be of the same blood as the de rohans and the montmorency ' ` so i have understand well then you will understand that there have be some change in this country when i tell you that those man who under the emperor be the greatest in the country have be the one a waiter the next a wine smuggler the next a cooper of barrel and the next a house painter those be the trade which give we murat massena ney and lanne ' aristocrat as i be no name have ever thrill I as those do and i eagerly ask he to point I out each of these famous soldier ` oh there be many famous soldier in the room ' say he ` besides ' he add twist he moustache ` there may be junior officer here who have it in they to rise higher than any of they but there be ney to the right ' i see a man with close-cropped red hair and a large square-jowled face such as i have see upon a english prize-fighter ` we call he peter the red and sometimes the red lion in the army ' say my companion ` he be say to be the bravest man in the army though i can not admit that he be braver than some other people whom i could mention still he be undoubtedly a very good leader ' ` and the general next he ' i ask ` why do he carry he head all upon one side ' ` that be general lanne and he carry he head upon he left shoulder because he be shoot through the neck at the siege of st jean d'acre he be a gascon like myself and i fear that he give some ground to those who accuse my countryman of be a little talkative and quarrelsome but monsieur smile ' ` you be mistaken ' ' i think that perhaps something which i have say might have amuse monsieur i think that possibly he mean that gascon really be quarrelsome instead of be as i contend the mildest race in france -- a opinion which i be always ready to uphold in any way which may be suggest but as i say lanne be a very valiant man though occasionally perhaps a trifle hot-headed the next man be auguereau ' i look with interest upon the hero of castiglione who have take command upon the one occasion when napoleon 's heart and spirit have fail he he be a man i should judge who would shine rather in war than in peace for with he long goat 's face and he brandy nose he look in spite of he golden oak-leaf just such a long-legged vulgar swaggering foul-mouthed old soldier as every barrack-room can show he be a older man than the other and he sudden promotion have come too late for he to change he be always the corporal of the prussian guard under the hat of the french marshal ` yes yes he be a rough fellow ' say gerard in answer to my remark ` he be one of those whom the emperor have to warn that he wish they to be soldier only with the army he and rapp and lefebvre with they big boot and they clanking sabre be too much for the empress 's drawing-room at the tuilery there be vandamme also the dark man with the heavy face heaven help the english village that he find he quarter in it be he who get into trouble because he break the jaw of a westphalian priest who could not find he a second bottle of tokay ' ` and that be murat i suppose ' ` yes that be murat with the black whisker and the red thick lip and the brown of egypt upon he face he be the man for I my word when you have see he rave in front of a brigade of light cavalry with he plume toss and he sabre flash you would not wish to see anything finer i have know a square of grenadier break and scatter at the very sight of he in egypt the emperor keep away from he for the arab would not look at the little general when this fine horseman and swordsman be before they in my opinion lasalle be the better light cavalry officer but there be no one whom the man will follow as they do murat ' ` and who be the stern-looking man lean on the oriental sword ' ` oh that be soult he be the most obstinate man in the world he argue with the emperor the handsome man beside he be junot and bernadotte be lean against the tent-pole ' i look with interest at the extraordinary face of this adventurer who after start with a musket and a knapsack in the rank be not contented with the baton of a marshal but pass on afterwards to grasp the sceptre of a king and it might be say of he that unlike he fellow he gain he throne in spite of napoleon rather than by he aid any man who look at he singular pronounced feature the swarthiness of which proclaim he half spanish origin must have read in he flash black eye and in that huge aggressive nose that he be reserve for a strange destiny of all the fierce and masterful man who surround the emperor there be none with greater gift and none also whose ambition he more distrust than those of jule bernadotte and yet fierce and masterful as these man be have as auguereau boast fear neither of god nor of the devil there be something which thrill or cow they in the pale smile or black frown of the little man who rule they for as i watch they there suddenly come over the assembly a start and hush such as you see in a boy ' school when the master enter unexpectedly and there near the open door of he headquarters stand the master himself even without that sudden silence and the scramble to they foot of those upon the bench i feel that i should have know instantly that he be present there be a pale luminosity about he ivory face which draw the eye towards it and though he dress might be the plainest of a hundred he appearance would be the first which one would notice there he be with he little plump heavy-shouldered figure he green coat with the red collar and cuff he white well-formed leg he sword with the gilt hilt and the tortoise-shell scabbard he head be uncovered show he thin hair of a ruddy chestnut color under one arm be the flat cock hat with the twopenny tricolor rosette which be already reproduce in he picture in he right hand he hold a little ride switch with a metal head he walk slowly forward he face immutable he eye fix steadily before he measure inexorable the very personification of destiny ` admiral bruix ' i do not know if that voice thrill through every one as it do through I never have i hear anything more harsh more menacing more sinister from under he puckered brow he light-blue eye glance swiftly round with a sweep like a sabre ' i be here sire ' a dark grizzled middle-aged man in a naval uniform have advance from the throng napoleon take three quick little step towards he in so menace a fashion that i see the weather-stained cheek of the sailor turn a shade paler and he give a helpless glance round he as if for assistance ` how come it admiral bruix ' cry the emperor in the same terrible rasping voice ` that you do not obey my command last night ' ' i could see that a westerly gale be come up sire i know that -- ' he could hardly speak for he agitation ' i know that if the ship go out with this lee shore -- ' ` what right have you to judge sir ' cry the emperor in a cold fury of indignation ` do you conceive that you judgment be to be place against mine ' ` in matter of navigation sire ' ` in no matter whatsoever ' ` but the tempest sire do it not prove I to be in the right ' ` what you still dare to bandy word with I ' ` when i have justice on my side ' there be a hush amidst all the great audience such a heavy silence as come only when many be wait and all with bated breath the emperor 's face be terrible he cheek be of a greenish livid tint and there be a singular rotary movement of the muscle of he forehead it be the countenance of a epileptic he raise the whip to he shoulder and take a step towards the admiral ` you insolent rascal ' he hiss it be the italian word _ coglione _ which he use and i observe that as he feeling overcome he he french become more and more that of a foreigner for a moment he seem to be about to slash the sailor across the face with he whip the latter take a step back and clap he hand to he sword ` have a care sire ' say he for a few instant the tension be terrible then napoleon bring the whip down with a sharp crack against he own thigh ` vice-admiral magon ' he cry ` you will in future receive all order connect with the fleet admiral bruix you will leave boulogne in twenty-four hour and withdraw to holland where be lieutenant gerard of the hussar of bercheny ' my companion 's gauntlet spring to he busby ' i order you to bring monsieur loui de laval from the castle of grosboi ' ` he be here sire ' ` good you may retire ' the lieutenant salute whisk round upon he heel and clatter away whilst the emperor 's blue eye be turn upon I i have often hear the phrase of eye look through you but that pierce gaze do really give one the feeling that it penetrate to one 's inmost thought but the sternness have all melt out of it and i read a great gentleness and kindness in they expression ` you have come to serve I monsieur de laval ' ` yes sire ' ` you have be some time in make up you mind ' ' i be not my own master sire ' ` you father be a aristocrat ' ` yes sire ' ` and a supporter of the bourbon ' ` yes sire ' ` you will find that in france now there be no aristocrat and no jacobin but that we be all frenchman work for the glory of we country have you see loui de bourbon ' ' i have see he once sire ' ` a insignificant-looking man be he not ' ` no sire i think he a fine-looking man ' for a moment i see a hard gleam of resentment in those change blue eye then he put out he hand and pinch one of my ear ` monsieur de laval be not bear to be a courtier ' say he ` well well loui de bourbon will find that he can not gain a throne by write proclamation in london and sign they loui for my part i find the crown of france lie upon the ground and i lift it upon my sword-point ' ` you have lift france with you sword also sire ' say talleyrand who stand at he elbow napoleon look at he famous minister and i seem to read suspicion in he eye then he turn to he secretary ' i leave monsieur de laval in you hand de meneval ' say he ' i desire to see he in the council chamber after the inspection of the artillery ' chapter xi the secretary emperor general and official all stream away to the review leave I with a gentle-looking large-eyed man in a black suit with very white cambric ruffle who introduce himself to I as monsieur de meneval private secretary to he majesty ` we must get some food monsieur de laval ' say he ` it be always well if you have anything to do with the emperor to get you food whenever you have the chance it may be many hour before he take a meal and if you be in he presence you have to fast also i assure you that i have nearly faint from hunger and from thirst ' ` but how do the emperor manage himself ' i ask this monsieur de meneval have such a kindly human appearance that i already feel much at my ease with he ` oh he he be a man of iron monsieur de laval we must not set we watch by he i have know he work for eighteen hour on end and take nothing but a cup or two of coffee he wear everybody out around he even the soldier can not keep up with he i assure you that i look upon it as the very highest honor to have charge of he papers but there be time when it be very try all the same sometimes it be eleven o'clock at night monsieur de laval and i be write to he dictation with my head ache for want of sleep it be dreadful work for he dictate as quickly as he can talk and he never repeat anything now meneval say he suddenly we shall stop here and have a good night 's rest and then just as i be congratulating myself he add and we shall continue with the dictation at three to-morrow morning that be what he mean by a good night 's rest ' ` but have he no hour for he meal monsieur de meneval ' i ask as i accompany the unhappy secretary out of the tent ` oh yes he have hour but he will not observe they you see that it be already long after dinner time but he have go to this review after the review something else will probably take up he attention and then something else until suddenly in the evening it will occur to he that he have have no dinner my dinner constant this instant he will cry and poor constant have to see that it be there ' ` but it must be unfit to eat by that time ' say i the secretary laugh in the discreet way of a man who have always be oblige to control he emotion ` this be the imperial kitchen ' say he indicate a large tent just outside the headquarters ` here be borel the second cook at the door how many pullet to-day borel ' ` ah monsieur de meneval it be heartrend ' cry the cook ` behold they ' and draw back the flap of the entrance he show we seven dish each of they contain a cold fowl ` the eighth be now on the fire and do to a turn but i hear that he majesty have start for the review so we must put on a ninth ' ` that be how it be manage ' say my companion as we turn from the tent ' i have know twenty-three fowl get ready for he before he ask for he meal that day he call for he dinner at eleven at night he care little what he eat or drink but he will not be keep wait half a bottle of chambertin a red mullet or a pullet a la marengo satisfy every need but it be unwise to put pastry or cream upon the table because he be as likely as not to eat it before the fowl ah that be a curious sight be it not ' i have halt with a exclamation of astonishment a groom be canter a very beautiful arab horse down one of the lane between the tent as it pass a grenadier who be stand with a small pig under he arm hurl it down under the foot of the horse the pig squeal vigorously and scuttle away but the horse canter on without change its step ` what do that mean ' i ask ` that be jardin the head groom breaking in a charger for the emperor 's use they be first train by have a cannon fire in they ear then they be strike suddenly by heavy object and finally they have the test of the pig be throw under they foot the emperor have not a very firm seat and he very often lose himself in a reverie when be be ride so it might not be very safe if the horse be not well train do you see that young man asleep at the door of a tent ' ` yes i see he ' ` you would not think that he be at the present moment serve the emperor ' ` it seem a very easy service ' ' i wish all we service be as easy monsieur de laval that be joseph linden whose foot be the exact size of the emperor 's he wear he new boot and shoe for three day before they be give to he master you can see by the gold buckle that he have a pair on at the present moment ah monsieur de caulaincourt will you not join we at dinner in my tent ' a tall handsome man very elegantly dress come across and greet we ` it be rare to find you at rest monsieur de meneval i have no very light task myself as head of the household but i think i have more leisure than you have we time for dinner before the emperor return ' ` yes yes here be the tent and everything ready we can see when the emperor return and be in the room before he can reach it this be camp fare monsieur de laval but no doubt you will excuse it ' for my own part i have a excellent appetite for the cutlet and the salad but what i relish above all be to hear the talk of my companion for i be full of curiosity as to everything which concern this singular man whose genius have elevated he so rapidly to the highest position in the world the head of he household discuss he with a extraordinary frankness ` what do they say of he in england monsieur de laval ' he ask ` nothing very good ' ` so i have gather from they papers they drive the emperor frantic and yet he will insist upon read they i be willing to lay a wager that the very first thing which he do when he enter london will be to send cavalry detachment to the various newspaper office and to endeavor to seize the editor ' ` and the next ' ` the next ' say he laugh ` will be to issue a long proclamation to prove that we have conquer england entirely for the good of the english and very much against we own inclination and then perhaps the emperor will allow the english to understand that if they absolutely demand a protestant for a ruler it be possible that there be a few little point in which he differ from holy church ' ` too bad too bad ' cry de meneval look amuse and yet rather frighten at he companion 's audacity ` no doubt for state reason the emperor have to tamper a little with mahomedanism and i daresay he would attend this church of st paul 's as readily as he do the mosque at cairo but it would not do for a ruler to be a bigot after all the emperor have to think for all ' ` he think too much ' say caulaincourt gravely ` he think so much that other people in france be get out of the way of think at all you know what i mean de meneval for you have see it as much as i have ' ` yes yes ' answer the secretary ` he certainly do not encourage originality among those who surround he i have hear he say many a time that he desire nothing but mediocrity which be a poor compliment it must be confess to we who have the honor of serve he ' ' a clever man at he court show he cleverness best by pretend to be dull ' say caulaincourt with some bitterness ` and yet there be many famous character there ' i remark ` if so it be only by conceal they character that they remain there he minister be clerk he general be superior aide-de-camp they be all agent you have this wonderful man in the middle and all around you have so many mirror which reflect different side of he in one you see he as a financier and you call it lebrun in another you have he as a _ gendarme _ and you name it savary or fouche in yet another he figure as a diplomatist and be call talleyrand you see different figure but it be really the same man there be a monsieur de caulaincourt for example who arrange the household but he can not dismiss a servant without permission it be still always the emperor and he play upon we we must confess de meneval that he play upon we in nothing else do i see so clearly he wonderful cleverness he will not let we be too friendly lest we combine he have set he marshal against each other until there be hardly two of they on speak term look how davoust hate bernadotte or lanne and bessiere or ney and massena it be all they can do to keep they sabre in they sheath when they meet and then he know we weak point savary 's thirst for money cambacere 's vanity duroc 's bluntness berthier 's foolishness maret 's insipidity talleyrand 's mania for speculation they be all so many tool in he hand i do not know what my own greatest weakness may be but i be sure that he do and that he use he knowledge ' ` but how he must work ' i exclaimed ` ah you may say so ' say de meneval ` what energy eighteen hour out of twenty-four for week on end he have preside over the legislative council until they be faint at they desk as to I he will be the death of I just as he wear out de bourrienne but i will die at my post without a murmur for if he be hard upon we he be hard upon himself also ' ` he be the man for france ' say de caulaincourt ` he be the very genius of system and of order and of discipline when one renumber the chaos in which we poor country find itself after the revolution when no one would be govern and everyone want to govern someone else you will understand that only napoleon could have save we we be all longing for something fix to secure ourselves to and then we come upon this iron pillar of a man and what a man he be in those day monsieur de laval you see he now when he have get all that he can want he be good-humoured and easy but at that time he have get nothing but covet everything he glance frightened woman he walk the street like a wolf people look after he as he pass he face be quite different -- it be craggy hollow-cheeked with a oblique menacing gaze and the jaw of a pike oh yes this little lieutenant buonaparte from the military school of brienne be a singular figure there be a man say i when i see he who will sit upon a throne or kneel upon a scaffold and now look at he ' ` and that be ten year ago ' i exclaimed ` only ten year and they have bring he from a barrack-room to the tuilery but he be bear for it you could not keep he down de bourrienne tell I that when he be a little fellow at brienne he have the grand imperial manner and would praise or blame glare or smile exactly as he do now have you see he mother monsieur de laval she be a tragedy queen tall stern reserved silent there be the spring from which he flow ' i could see in the gentle spaniel-eye of the secretary that he be disturb by the frankness of de caulaincourt 's remark ` you can tell that we do not live under a very terrible tyranny monsieur de laval ' say he ` or we should hardly venture to discuss we ruler so frankly the fact be that we have say nothing which he would not have listen to with pleasure and perhaps with approval he have he little frailty or he would not be human but take he quality as a ruler and i would ask you if there have ever be a man who have justify the choice of a nation so completely he work harder than any of he subject he be a general beloved by he soldier he be a master beloved by he servant he never have a holiday and he be always ready for he work there be not under the roof of the tuilery a more abstemious eater or drinker he educate he brother at he own expense when he be a very poor man and he have cause even he most distant relative to share in he prosperity in a word he be economical hard-working and temperate we read in the london papers about this prince of wale monsieur de laval and i do not think that he come very well out of the comparison ' i thought of the long record of brighton scandal london scandal newmarket scandal and i have to leave george undefended ` as i understand it ' say i ` it be not the emperor 's private life but he public ambition that the english attack ' ` the fact be ' say de caulaincourt ` that the emperor know and we all know that there be not room enough in the world for both france and england one or other must be supreme if england be once crush we could then lay the foundation of a permanent peace italy be ours austrium we can crush again as we have crush she before germany be divide russium can expand to the south and east america we can take at we leisure find we pretext in louisiana or in canada there be a world empire wait for we and there be the only thing that stop we ' he point out through the opening of the tent at the broad blue channel far away like snow-white gull in the distance be the sail of the blockade fleet i think again of what i have see the night before -- the light of the ship upon the sea and the glow of the camp upon the shore the power of the land and of the ocean be face to face whilst a wait world stand round to see what would come of it chapter xii the man of action de meneval 's tent have be pitch in such a way that he could overlook the royal headquarters but whether it be that we be too absorb in the interest of we conversation or that the emperor have use the other entrance in return from the review we be suddenly startle by the appearance of a captain dress in the green jacket of the chasseur of the guard who have come to say that napoleon be wait for he secretary poor de meneval 's face turn as white as he beautiful ruffle as he spring to he foot hardly able to speak for agitation ' i should have be there ' he gasp ` oh what a misfortune monsieur de caulaincourt you must excuse I where be my hat and my sword come monsieur de laval not a instant be to be lose ' i could judge from the terror of de meneval as well as from the scene which i have witness with admiral bruix what the influence be which the emperor exercise over those who be around he they be never at they ease always upon the brink of a catastrophe encourage one day only to be rudely rebuff the next bully in public and slight in private and yet in spite of it all the singular fact remain that they love he and serve he as no monarch have be love and serve ` perhaps i have best stay here ' say i when we have come to the ante-chamber which be still crowd with people ` no no i be responsible for you you must come with I oh i trust he be not offend with I how could he have get in without my see he ' my frightened companion scratch at the door which be open instantly by roustem the mameluke who guard it within the room into which we pass be of considerable size but be furnish with extreme simplicity it be paper of a silver-grey color with a sky-blue ceiling in the center of which be the imperial eagle in gold hold a thunderbolt in spite of the warm weather a large fire be burn at one side and the air be heavy with heat and the aromatic smell of aloe in the middle of the room be a large oval table cover with green cloth and litter with a number of letter and papers a raise writing-desk be at one side of the table and behind it in a green morocco chair with curved arm there sit the emperor a number of official be stand round the wall but he take no notice of they in he hand he have a small penknife with which he whittle the wooden knob at the end of he chair he glance up as we enter and shake he head coldly at de meneval ' i have have to wait for you monsieur de meneval ' say he ' i can not remember that i ever wait for my late secretary de bourrienne that be enough no excuse take this report which i have write in you absence and make a copy of it ' poor de meneval take the paper with a shake hand and carry it to the little side table which be reserve for he use napoleon rise and pace slowly up and down the room with he hand behind he back and he big round head stoop a little forwards it be certainly as well that he have a secretary for i observe that in write this single document he have spatter the whole place with ink and it be obvious that he have twice use he white kerseymere knee-breeches as a pen-wiper as for I i stand quietly beside roustem at the door and he take not the slightest notice of my presence ` well ' he cry presently ` be it ready de meneval we have something more to do ' the secretary half turn in he chair and he face be more agitate than ever ` if it please you sire -- ' he stammer ` well well what be the matter now ' ` if it please you sire i find some little difficulty in read what you have write ' ` tut tut sir you see what the report be about ' ` yes sire it be about forage for the cavalry horse ' napoleon smile and the action make he face look quite boyish ` you remind I of cambaceres de meneval when i write he a account of the battle of marengo he think that my letter be a rough plan of the engagement it be incredible how much difficulty you appear to have in read what i write this document have nothing to do with cavalry horse but it contain the instruction to admiral villeneuve as to the concentration of he fleet so as to obtain command of the channel give it to I and i will read it to you ' he snatch the paper up in the quick impulsive way which be characteristic of he but after a long fierce stare he crumple it up and hurl it under the table ' i will dictate it to you ' say he and pacing up and down the long room he pour forth a torrent of word which poor de meneval he face shine with he exertion strive hard to put upon paper as he grow excite by he own idea napoleon 's voice become shriller he step faster and he seize he right cuff in the finger of the same hand and twist he right arm in the singular epileptic gesture which be peculiar to he but he thought and plan be so admirably clear that even i who know nothing of the matter could readily follow they while above all i be impress by the marvellous grasp of fact which enable he to speak with confidence not only of the line-of-battle ship but of the frigate sloop and brig at ferrol rochefort cadiz carthagena and brest with the exact strength of each in man and in gun while the name and force of the english vessel be equally at he finger ' end such familiarity would have be remarkable in a naval officer but when i think that this question of the ship be only one out of fifty with which this man have to deal i begin to realize the immense grasp of that capacious mind he do not appear to be pay the least attention to I but it seem that he be really watch I closely for he turn upon I when he have finish he dictation ` you appear to be surprised monsieur de laval that i should be able to transact my naval business without have my minister of marine at my elbow but it be one of my rule to know and to do thing for myself perhaps if these good bourbon have have the same habit they would not now be live amidst the fog of england ' ` one must have you majesty 's memory in order to do it ' i observe ` it be the result of system ' say he ` it be as if i have drawer in my brain so that when i open one i could close the other it be seldom that i fail to find what i want there i have a poor memory for name or date but a excellent one for fact or face there be a good deal to bear in mind monsieur de laval for example i have as you have see my one little drawer full of the ship upon the sea i have another which contain all the harbor and fort of france as a example i may tell you that when my minister of war be read I a report of all the coast defence i be able to point out to he that he have omit two gun in a battery near ostend in yet another of my brain-drawer i have the regiment of france be that drawer in order marshal berthier ' a clean-shaven man who have stand bite he nail in the window bow at the emperor 's question ' i be sometimes tempt to believe sire that you know the name of every man in the rank ' say he ' i think that i know most of my old egyptian grumbler ' say he ` and then monsieur de laval there be another drawer for canal bridge road manufacture and every detail of internal administration the law finance italy the colony holland all these thing demand drawer of they own in these day monsieur de laval france ask something more of its ruler than that he should carry eight yard of ermine with dignity or ride after a stag in the forest of fontainebleau ' i thought of the helpless gentle pompous loui whom my father have once take I to visit and i understand that france after she convulsion and she suffering do indeed require another and a stronger head ` do you not think so monsieur de laval ' ask the emperor he have halt for a moment by the fire and be grind he dainty gold-buckled shoe into one of the burning log ` you have come to a very wise decision ' say he when i have answer he question ` but you have always be of this way of think have you not be it not true that you once defend I when some young englishman be drink toast to my downfall at a inn in this village in which you live ' i remember the incident although i could not imagine how it have reach he ear ` why should you have do this ' ' i do it on impulse sire ' ` on impulse ' he cry in a tone of contempt ' i do not know what people mean when they say that they do thing upon impulse in charenton thing be doubtless do upon impulse but not amongst sane people why should you risk you life over there in defend I when at the time you have nothing to hope for from I ' ` it be because i feel that you stand for france sire ' during this conversation he have still walk up and down the room twist he right arm about and occasionally look at one or other of we with he eyeglass for he sight be so weak that he always need a single glass indoors and binoculars outside sometimes he stop and help himself to great pinch of snuff from a tortoise-shell box but i observe that none of it ever reach he nose for he drop it all from between he finger on to he waistcoat and the floor my answer seem to please he for he suddenly seize my ear and pull it with considerable violence ` you be quite right my friend ' say he ' i stand for france just as frederic the second stand for prussium i will make she the great power of the world so that every monarch in europe will find it necessary to keep a palace in pari and they will all come to hold the train at the coronation of my descendant -- ' a spasm of pain pass suddenly over he face ` my god for whom be i building who will be my descendant ' i hear he mutter and he pass he hand over he forehead ` do they seem frighten in england about my approach invasion ' he ask suddenly ` have you hear they express fear lest i get across the channel ' i be force in truth to say that the only fear which i have ever hear express be lest he should not get across ` the soldier be very jealous that the sailor should always have the honor ' say i ` but they have a very small army ' ` nearly every man be a volunteer sire ' ` pooh conscript ' he cry and make a motion with he hand as if to sweep they from before he i will land with a hundred thousand man in kent or in sussex i will fight a great battle which i will win with a loss of ten thousand man on the third day i shall be in london i will seize the statesman the banker the merchant the newspaper man i will impose a indemnity of a hundred million of they pound i will favor the poor at the expense of the rich and so i shall have a party i will detach scotland and ireland by give they constitution which will put they in a superior condition to england thus i will sow dissension everywhere then as a price for leave the island i will claim they fleet and they colony in this way i shall secure the command of the world to france for at least a century to come ' in this short sketch i could perceive the quality which i have since hear remark in napoleon that he mind could both conceive a large scheme and at the same time evolve those practical detail which would seem to bring it within the bound of possibility one instant it would be a wild dream of overrun the east the next it be a schedule of the ship the port the store the troops which would be need to turn dream into fact he grip the heart of a question with the same decision which make he strike straight for a enemy 's capital the soul of a poet and the mind of a man of business of the first order that be the combination which may make a man dangerous to the world i think that it may have be he purpose -- for he never do anything without a purpose -- to give I a object-lesson of he own capacity for govern with the idea perhaps that i might in turn influence other of the emigre by what i tell they at any rate he leave I there to stand and to watch the curious succession of point upon which he have to give a opinion during a few hour nothing seem to be either too large or too small for that extraordinary mind at one instant it be the arrangement for the winter cantonment of two hundred thousand man at the next he be discuss with de caulaincourt the curtail of the expense of the household and the possibility of suppress some of the carriage ` it be my desire to be economical at home so as to make a good show abroad ' say he ` for myself when i have the honor to be a sub-lieutenant i find that i could live very well upon 1200 franc a year and it would be no hardship to I to go back to it this extravagance of the palace must be stop for example i see upon you account that 155 cup of coffee be drunk a day which with sugar at 4 franc and coffee at 5 franc a pound come to 20 sous a cup it would be better to make a allowance for coffee the stable bill be also too high at the present price of fodder seven or eight franc a week should be enough for each horse in a stable of two hundred i will not have any waste at the tuilery ' thus within a few minute he would pass from a question of milliard to a question of sous and from the management of a empire to that of a stable from time to time i could observe that he throw a little oblique glance at I as if to ask what i thought of it all and at the time i wonder very much why my approval should be of any consequence to he but now when i look back and see that my follow he fortune bring over so many other of the young nobility i understand that he see very much further than i do ` well monsieur de laval ' say he suddenly ` you have see something of my method be you prepare to enter my service ' ` assuredly sire ' i answer ' i can be a very hard master when i like ' say he smile ` you be there when i speak to admiral bruix we have all we duty to do and discipline be as necessary in the highest as in the lowest rank but anger with I never rise above here ' and he draw he hand across he throat ' i never permit it to cloud my brain dr corvisart here would tell you that i have the slowest pulse of all he patient ' ` and that you be the fastest eater sire ' say a large-faced benevolent-looking person who have be whisper to marshal berthier ` ohe you rascal you rake that up against I do you the doctor will not forgive I because i tell he when i be unwell that i have rather die of the disease than of the remedy if i eat too fast it be the fault of the state which do not allow I more than a few minute for my meal which remind I that it must be rather after my dinner hour constant ' ` it be four hour after it sire ' ` serve it up then at once ' ` yes sire monsieur isabey be outside sire with he doll ' ` ah we shall see they at once show he in ' a man enter who have evidently just arrive from a long journey under he arm he carry a large flat wickerwork basket ` it be two day since i send for you monsieur isabey ' ` the courier arrive yesterday sire i have be travel from pari ever since ' ` have you the model there ' ` yes sire ' ` then you may lay they out on that table ' i could not at first imagine what it mean when i saw upon isabey open he basket that it be cram with little puppet about a foot high all of they dress in the most gorgeous silk and velvet costume with trimming of ermine and hanging of gold lace but presently as the designer take they out one by one and place they on the table i understand that the emperor with he extraordinary passion for detail and for directly control everything in he court have have these doll dress in order to judge the effect of the gorgeous costume which have be order for he grand functionary upon state occasion ` what be this ' he ask hold up a little lady in hunting costume of amaranth and gold with a toque and plume of white feather ` that be for the empress 's hunt sire ' ` you should have the waist rather lower ' say napoleon who have very definite opinion about lady ' dress ` these cursed fashion seem to be the only thing in my dominion which i can not regulate my tailor duchesne take three inch from my coat-tail and all the army and fleet of france can not prevent he who be this ' he have pick up a very gorgeous figure in a green coat ` that be the grand master of the hunt sire ' ` then it be you berthier how do you like you new costume and this in red ' ` that be the arch-chancellor ' ` and the violet ' ` that be the grand chamberlain ' the emperor be as much amuse as a child with a new toy he form little group of the figure upon the table so that he might have a idea of how the dignitary would look when they chat together then he throw they all back into the basket ` very good ' say he ` you and david have do you work very well isabey you will submit these design to the court outfitter and have a estimate for the expense you may tell lenormand that if she venture to send in such a account as the last which she send to the empress she shall see the inside of vincenne you would not think it right monsieur de laval to spend twenty-five thousand franc upon a single dress even though it be for mademoiselle eugenie de choiseul ' be there anything which this wizard of a man do not know what could my love affair be to he amidst the clash of army and the struggle of nation when i look at he half in amazement and half in fear that pleasant boyish smile light up he pale face and he plump little hand rest for a instant upon my shoulder he eye be of a bright blue when he be amuse though they would turn dark when he be thoughtful and steel-grey in moment of excitement ` you be surprise when i tell you a little while ago about you encounter with the englishman in the village inn you be still more surprised now when i tell you about a certain young lady you must certainly have think that i be very badly serve by my agent in england if i do not know such important detail as these ' ' i can not conceive sire why such trifle should be report to you or why you should for one instant remember they ' ` you be certainly a very modest young man and i hope you will not lose that charming quality when you have be for a little time at my court so you think that you own private affair be of no importance to I ' ' i do not know why they should be sire ' ` what be the name of you great-uncle ' ` he be the cardinal de laval de montmorency ' ` precisely and where be he ' ` he be in germany ' ` quite so -- in germany and not at notre dame where i should have place he who be you first cousin ' ` the duke de rohan ' ` and where be he ' ` in london ' ` yes in london and not at the tuilery where he might have have what he like for the ask i wonder if i be to fall whether i should have follower as faithful as those of the bourbon would the man that i have make go into exile and refuse all offer until i should return come here berthier ' he take he favorite by the ear with the caress gesture which be peculiar to he ` could i count upon you you rascal -- eh ' ' i do not understand you sire ' we conversation have be carry on in a voice which have make it inaudible to the other people in the room but now they be all listen to what berthier have to say ` if i be drive out would you go into exile also ' ` no sire ' ` diable at least you be frank ' ' i could not go into exile sire ' ` and why ' ` because i should be dead sire ' napoleon begin to laugh ` and there be some who say that we berthier be dull-witted ' say he ` well i think i be pretty sure of you berthier for although i be fond of you for reason of my own i do not think that you would be of much value to anyone else now i could not say that of you monsieur talleyrand you would change very quickly to a new master as you have change from a old one you have a genius you know for adapt yourself ' there be nothing which the emperor love more than to suddenly produce little scene of this sort which make everybody very uncomfortable for no one could tell what awkward or compromising question he be go to put to they next at present however they all forget they own fear of what might come in they interest at the reply which the famous diplomatist might make to a suggestion which everybody know to be so true he stand lean upon he black ebony stick with he bulky shoulder stoop forward and a amuse smile upon he face as if the most innocent of compliment have be address to he one of he few title to respect be that he always meet napoleon upon equal term and never condescend to fawn upon he or to flatter he ` you think i should desert you sire if you enemy offer I more than you have give I ' ' i be perfectly sure that you would ' ` well really i can not answer for myself sire until the offer have be make but it will have to be a very large one you see apart from my very nice hotel in the rue st florentin and the two hundred thousand or so which you be pleased to allow I there be my position as the first minister in europe really sire unless they put I on the throne i can not see how i can better my position ' ` no i think i have you pretty safe ' say napoleon look hard at he with thoughtful eye ` by the way talleyrand you must either marry madame grand or get rid of she for i can not have a scandal about the court ' i be astounded to hear so delicate and personal a matter discuss in this public way but this also be characteristic of the rule of this extraordinary man who proclaim that he look upon delicacy and good taste as two of the fetter with which mediocrity attempt to cripple genius there be no question of private life from the choosing of a wife to the discarding of a mistress that this young conqueror of thirty-six do not claim the right of discuss and of finally settle talleyrand break once more into he benevolent but inscrutable smile ' i suppose that it be from early association sire ' say he ` but my instinct be to avoid marriage ' napoleon begin to laugh ' i forget sometimes that it be really the bishop of autun to whom i be speak ' say he ' i think that perhaps i have interest enough with the pope to ask he in return for any little attention which we give he at the coronation to show you some leniency in this matter she be a clever woman this madame grand i have observe that she listen with attention ' talleyrand shrug he rounded shoulder ` intellect in a woman be not always a advantage sire a clever woman compromise she husband a stupid woman only compromise herself ' ` the cleverest woman ' say napoleon ` be the woman who be clever enough to conceal she cleverness the woman in france have always be a danger for they be cleverer than the man they can not understand that it be they heart and not they head that we want when they have have influence upon a monarch they have invariably ruin he career look at henry the fourth and loui the fourteenth they be all ideologist dreamer sentimentalist full of emotion and energy but without logic or foresight look at that accursed madame de stael look at the salon of the quartier st germain they eternal clack clack clack give I more trouble than the fleet of england why can not they look after they baby and they needlework i suppose you think that these be very dreadful opinion monsieur de laval ' it be not a easy question to answer so i be silent ` you have not at you age become a practical man ' say the emperor ` you will understand then i dare say that i think as you do at the time when the stupid parisian be say what a misalliance the widow of the famous general de beauharnais be make by marry the unknown buonaparte it be a beautiful dream there be nine inn in a single day 's journey between milan and mantua and i write a letter to my wife from each of they nine letter in a day -- but one become disillusioned monsieur one learn to accept thing as they be ' i could not but think what a beautiful young man he must have be before he have learn to accept thing as they be the glamour the romance -- what a bald dead thing be life without it he own face have cloud over as if that old life have perhaps have a charm which the emperor 's crown have never give it may be that those nine letter write in one day at wayside inn have bring he more true joy than all the treaty by which he have tear province from he neighbor but the sentiment pass from he face and he come back in he sudden concise fashion to my own affair ` eugenie de choiseul be the niece of the duc de choiseul be she not ' he ask ` yes sire ' ` you be affianced ' ` yes sire ' he shake he head impatiently ` if you wish to advance yourself in my court monsieur de laval ' say he ' you must commit such matter to my care be it likely that i can look with indifference upon a marriage between emigre -- a alliance between my enemy ' ` but she share my opinion sire ' ` ta ta ta at she age one have no opinion she have the emigre blood in she vein and it will come out you marriage shall be my care monsieur de laval and i wish you to come to the pont de brique that you may be present to the empress what be it constant ' ` there be a lady outside who desire to see you majesty shall i tell she to come later ' ' a lady ' cry the emperor smile ` we do not see many face in the camp which have not a moustache upon they who be she what do she want ' ` she name sire be mademoiselle sibylle bernac ' ` what ' cry napoleon ` it must be the daughter of old bernac of grosboi by the way monsieur de laval he be you uncle upon you mother 's side be he not ' i may have flush with shame as i acknowledge it for the emperor read my feeling ` well well he have not a very savoury trade it be true and yet i can assure you that it be one which be very necessary to I by the way this uncle of yours as i understand hold the estate which should have descend to you do he not ' ` yes sire ' he blue eye flash suspicion at I ' i trust that you be not join my service merely in the hope of have they restore to you ' ` no sire it be my ambition to make a career for myself ' ` it be a prouder thing ' say the emperor ` to find a family than merely to perpetuate one i could not restore you estate monsieur de laval for thing have come to such a pitch in france that if one once begin restoration the affair be endless it would shake all public confidence i have no more devoted adherent than the man who hold land which do not belong to they as long as they serve I as you uncle serve I the land must remain with they but what can this young lady require of I show she in constant ' a instant later my cousin sibylle be conduct into the room she face be pale and set but she large dark eye be fill with resolution and she carry herself like a princess ` well mademoiselle why do you come here what be it that you want ' ask the emperor in the brusque manner which he adopt to woman even if he be woo they sibylle glance round and as we eye meet for a instant i feel that my presence have renew she courage she look bravely at the emperor as she answer he ' i come sire to implore a favor of you ' ` you father 's daughter have certainly claim upon I mademoiselle what be it that you wish ' ' i do not ask it in my father 's name but in my own i implore you sire to spare the life of monsieur lucien lesage who be arrest yesterday upon a charge of treason he be a student sire -- a mere dreamer who have live away from the world and have be make a tool by design man ' ' a dreamer ' cry the emperor harshly ` they be the most dangerous of all ' he take a bundle of note from he table and glance they over ' i presume that he be fortunate enough to be you lover mademoiselle ' sibylle 's pale face flush and she look down before the emperor 's keen sardonic glance ' i have he examination here he do not come well out of it i confess that from what i see of the young man 's character i should not say that he be worthy of you love ' ' i implore you to spare he sire ' ` what you ask be impossible mademoiselle i have be conspire against from two side -- by the bourbon and by the jacobin hitherto i have be too long-suffering and they have be encourage by my patience since cadoudal and the due d'enghien die the bourbon have be quiet now i must teach the same lesson to these other ' i be astonished and be still astonish at the passion with which my brave and pure cousin love this cowardly and low-minded man though it be but in accordance with that strange law which draw the extreme of nature together as she hear the emperor 's stern reply the last sign of color fade from she pale face and she eye be dim with despair tear which gleam upon she white cheek like dew upon the petal of a lily ` for god 's sake sire for the love of you mother spare he ' she cry fall upon she knee at the emperor 's foot ' i will answer for he that he never offend you again ' ` tut tut ' cry napoleon angrily turn upon he heel and walk impatiently up and down the room ' i can not grant you what you ask mademoiselle when i say so once it be finish i can not have my decision in high matter of state affect by the intrusion of woman the jacobin have be dangerous of late and a example must be make or we shall have the faubourg st antoine upon we hand once more ' the emperor set face and firm manner show it be hopeless and yet my cousin persevere as no one but a woman who plead for she lover would have dare to do ` he be harmless sire ' ` he death will frighten other ' ` spare he and i will answer for he loyalty ' ` what you ask be impossible ' constant and i raise she from the ground ` that be right monsieur de laval ' say the emperor ` this interview can lead to nothing remove you cousin from the room ' but she have again turn to he with a face which show that even now all hope have not be abandon ` sire ' she cry ` you say that a example must be make there be toussac -- ' ` ah if i could lay my hand upon toussac ' ` he be the dangerous man it be he and my father who lead lucien on if a example must be make it should be a example of the guilty rather than of the innocent ' ` they be both guilty and besides we have we hand upon the one but not upon the other ' ` but if i could find he ' napoleon think for a moment ` if you do ' say he ` lesage will be forgive ' ` but i can not do it in a day ' ` how long do you ask ' ' a week at the least ' ` then he have a respite of a week if you can find toussac in the time lesage will be pardon if not he will die upon the eighth day it be enough monsieur de laval remove you cousin for i have matter of more importance to attend to i shall expect you one evening at the pont de brique when you be ready to be present to the empress ' chapter xiii the man of dream when i have escort my cousin sibylle from the presence of the emperor i be surprise to find the same young hussar officer wait outside who have command the guard which have bring I to the camp ` well mademoiselle what luck ' he ask excitedly clank towards we for answer sibylle shake she head ` ah i fear as much for the emperor be a terrible man it be brave indeed of you to attempt it i have rather charge a unshaken square upon a spend horse than ask he for anything but my heart be heavy mademoiselle that you should have be unsuccessful ' he boyish blue eye fill with tear and he fair moustache droop in such a deplorable fashion that i could have laugh have the matter be less serious ` lieutenant gerard chance to meet I and escort I through the camp ' say my cousin ` he have be kind enough to give I sympathy in my trouble ' ` and so do i sibylle ' i cry ` you carry yourself like a angel and it be a lucky man who be bless with you love i trust that he may be worthy of it ' she turn cold and proud in a instant when anyone throw a doubt upon this wretched lover of hers ' i know he as neither the emperor nor you can do ' say she ` he have the heart and soul of a poet and he be too high-minded to suspect the intrigue to which he have fall a victim but as to toussac i should have no pity upon he for i know he to be a murderer five time over and i know also that there will be no peace in france until he have be take cousin loui will you help I to do it ' the lieutenant have be tug at he moustache and look I up and down with a jealous eye ` surely mademoiselle you will permit I to help you ' he cry in a piteous voice ' i may need you both ' say she ' i will come to you if i do now i will ask you to ride with I to the edge of the camp and there to leave I ' she have a quick imperative way which come charmingly from those sweet womanly lip the gray horse upon which i have come to the camp be wait beside that of the hussar so we be soon in the saddle when we be clear of the hut my cousin turn to we ' i have rather go alone now ' say she ` it be understand then that i can rely upon you ' ` entirely ' say i ` to the death ' cry gerard ` it be everything to I to have two brave man at my back ' say she and so with a smile give she horse its head and canter off over the downland in the direction of grosboi for my part i remain in think for some time wonder what plan she could have in she head by which she hope to get upon the track of toussac a woman 's wit spur by the danger of she lover might perhaps succeed where fouche and savary have fail when at last i turn my horse i find my young hussar still stare after the distant rider ` my faith there be the woman for you etienne ' he keep repeat ` what a eye what a smile what a rider and she be not afraid of the emperor oh etienne here be the woman who be worthy of you ' these be the little sentence which he keep mutter to himself until she vanish over the hill when he become conscious at last of my presence ` you be mademoiselle 's cousin ' he ask ` you be join with I in do something for she i do not yet know what it be but i be perfectly ready to do it ' ` it be to capture toussac ' ` excellent ' ` in order to save the life of she lover ' there be a struggle in the face of the young hussar but he more generous nature win ` sapristi i will do even that if it will make she the happier ' he cry and he shake the hand which i extend towards he ` the hussar of bercheny be quarter over yonder where you see the line of picket horse if you will send for lieutenant etienne gerard you will find a sure blade always at you disposal let I hear from you then and the sooner the better ' he shake he bridle and be off with youth and gallantry in every line of he from he red toupet and flow dolman to the spur which twinkle on he heel but for four long day no word come from my cousin as to she quest nor do i hear from this grim uncle of mine at the castle of grosboi for myself i have go into the town of boulogne and have hire such a room as my thin purse could afford over the shop of a baker name vidal next to the church of st augustin in the rue des vent only last year i go back there under that strange impulse which lead the old to tread once more with drag foot the same spot which have sound to the crisp tread of they youth the room be still there the very picture and the plaster head of jean bart which use to stand upon the side table as i stand with my back to the narrow window i have around I every smallest detail upon which my young eye have look nor be i conscious that my own heart and feeling have undergo much change and yet there in the little round glass which face I be the long draw weary face of a aged man and out of the window when i turn be the bare and lonely downs which have be people by that mighty host of a hundred and fifty thousand man to think that the grand army should have vanish away like a shredding cloud upon a windy day and yet that every sordid detail of a bourgeois lodging should remain unchanged truly if man be not humble it be not for want of have he lesson teach to he by nature my first care after i have choose my room be to send to grosboi for that poor little bundle which i have carry ashore with I that squally night from the english lugger my next be to use the credit which my favourable reception by the emperor and he assurance of employment have give I in order to obtain such a wardrobe as would enable I to appear without discredit among the richly dress courtier and soldier who surround he it be well know that it be he whim that he should himself be the only plainly-dressed man in the company and that in the most luxurious time of the bourbon there be never a period when fine linen and a brave coat be more necessary for a man who would keep in favor a new court and a young empire can not afford to take anything for grant it be upon the morning of the fifth day that i receive a message from duroc who be the head of the household that i be to attend the emperor at the headquarters in the camp and that a seat in one of the imperial carriage would be at my disposal that i might proceed with the court to pont de briques there to be present at the reception of the empress when i arrive i be show at once through the large entrance tent and admit by constant into the room beyond where the emperor stand with he back to the fire kick he heel against the grate talleyrand and berthier be in attendance and de meneval the secretary sit at the writing-table ` ah monsieur de laval ' say the emperor with a friendly nod ` have you hear anything yet of you charming cousin ' ` nothing sire ' i answer ' i fear that she effort will be in vain i wish she every success for we have no reason at all to fear this miserable poet while the other be formidable all the same a example of some sort must be make ' the darkness be draw in and constant have appear with a taper to light the candle but the emperor order he out ' i like the twilight ' say he ` no doubt monsieur de laval after you long residence in england you find yourself also most at home in a dim light i think that the brain of these people must be as dense as they fog to judge by the nonsense which they write in they accursed papers ' with one of those convulsive gesture which accompany he sudden outburst of passion he seize a sheaf of late london papers from the table and ground they into the fire with he heel ` a editor ' he cry in the guttural rasping voice which i have hear when i first meet he ` what be he a dirty man with a pen in a back office and he will talk like one of the great power of europe i have have enough of this freedom of the press there be some who would like to see it establish in paris you be among they talleyrand for my part i see no need for any paper at all except the _ moniteur _ by which the government may make know its decision to the people ' ' i be of opinion sire ' say the minister ` that it be better to have open foe than secret one and that it be less dangerous to shed ink than blood what matter if you enemy have leave to rave in a few pari papers as long as you be at the head of five hundred thousand armed man ' ` ta ta ta ' cry the emperor impatiently ` you speak as if i have receive my crown from my father the late king but even if i have it would be intolerable this government by newspaper the bourbon allow themselves to be criticise and where be they now have they use they swiss guard as i do the grenadier upon the eighteenth brumaire what would have become of they precious national assembly there be a time when a bayonet in the stomach of mirabeau might have settle the whole matter later it take the head of a king and queen and the blood of a hundred thousand people ' he sit down and stretch he plump white-clad leg towards the fire through the blacken shred of the english papers the red glow beat upward upon the beautiful pallid sphinx-like face -- the face of a poet of a philosopher -- of anything rather than of a ruthless and ambitious soldier i have hear folk remark that no two portrait of the emperor be alike and the fault do not lie with the artist but with the fact that every vary mood make he a different man but in he prime before he feature become heavy i who have see sixty year of mankind can say that in repose i have never look upon a more beautiful face ` you have no dream and no illusion talleyrand ' say he ` you be always practical cold and cynical but with I when i be in the twilight as now or when i hear the sound of the sea my imagination begin to work it be the same when i hear some music -- especially music which repeat itself again and again like some piece of passaniello they have a strange effect upon I and i begin to ossianise i get large idea and great aspiration it be at such time that my mind always turn to the east that swarm ant-heap of the human race where alone it be possible to be very great i renew my dream of '98 i think of the possibility of drilling and arm these vast mass of man and of precipitate they upon europe have i conquer syrium i should have do this and the fate of the world be really decide at the siege of acre with egypt at my foot i already picture myself approach indium mount upon a elephant and holding in my hand a new version of the koran which i have myself compose i have be bear too late to be accept as a world 's conqueror one must claim to be divine alexander declare himself to be the son of jupiter and no one question it but the world have grow old and have lose its enthusiasm what would happen if i be to make the same claim monsieur de talleyrand would smile behind he hand and the parisian would write little lampoon upon the wall ' he do not appear to be address we but rather to be express he thought aloud while allow they to run to the most fantastic and extravagant length this it be which he call ossianise because it recall to he the wild vague dream of the gaelic ossian whose poem have always have a fascination for he de meneval have tell I that for a hour at a time he have sometimes talk in this strain of the most intimate thought and aspiration of he heart while he courtier have stand round in silence wait for the instant when he would return once more to he practical and incisive self ` the great ruler ' say he ` must have the power of religion behind he as well as the power of the sword it be more important to command the soul than the body of man the sultan for example be the head of the faith as well as of the army so be some of the roman emperor my position must be incomplete until this be accomplish at the present instant there be thirty department in france where the pope be more powerful than i be it be only by universal dominion that peace can be assure in the world when there be only one authority in europe seat at pari and when all the king be so many lieutenant who hold they crown from the central power of france it be then that the reign of peace will be establish many power of equal strength must always lead to struggle until one become predominant she central position she wealth and she history all mark france out as be the power which will control and regulate the other germany be divide russium be barbarous england be insular france only remain ' i begin to understand as i listen to he that my friend in england have not be so far wrong when they have declare that as long as he live -- this little thirty-six year old artilleryman -- there could not possibly be any peace in the world he drink some coffee which constant have place upon the small round table at he elbow then he lean back in he chair once more still stare moodily at the red glow of the fire with he chin sink upon he chest ` in those day ' say he ` the king of europe will walk behind the emperor of france in order to hold up he train at he coronation each of they will have to maintain a palace in pari and the city will stretch as far as versaille these be the plan which i have make for paris if she will show herself to be worthy of they but i have no love for they these parisian and they have none for I for they can not forget that i turn my gun upon they once before and they know that i be ready to do so again i have make they admire I and fear I but i have never make they like I look what i have do for they where be the treasure of genoa the picture and statue of venice and of the vatican they be in the louvre the spoil of my victory have go to decorate she but they must always be change always chatter they wave they hat at I now but they would soon be wave they fist if i do not give they something to talk over and to wonder at when other thing be quiet i have the dome of the invalide regild to keep they thought from mischief loui xiv give they war loui xv give they the gallantry and scandal of he court loui xvi give they nothing so they cut off he head it be you who help to bring he to the scaffold talleyrand ' ` no sire i be always a moderate ' ` at least you do not regret he death ' ` the less so since it have make room for you sire ' ` nothing could have hold I down talleyrand i be bear to reach the highest it have always be the same with I i remember when we be arrange the treaty of campo formio -- i a young general under thirty -- there be a high vacant throne with the imperial arm in the commissioner 's tent i instantly spring up the step and throw myself down upon it i could not endure to think that there be anything above myself and all the time i know in my heart all that be go to happen to I even in the day when my brother lucien and i live in a little room upon a few franc a week i know perfectly well that the day would come when i should stand where i be now and yet i have no prospects and no reason for any great hope i be not clever at school i be only the forty-second out of fifty-eight at mathematics i have perhaps some ability but at nothing else the truth be that i be always dream when the other be work there be nothing to encourage my ambition for the only thing which i inherit from my father be a weak stomach once when i be very young i go up to pari with my father and my sister caroline we be in the rue richelieu and we see the king pass in he carriage who would have think that the little boy from corsica who take he hat off and stare be destine to be the next monarch of france and yet even then i feel as if that carriage ought to belong to I what be it constant ' the discreet valet bent down and whisper something to the emperor ` ah of course ' say he ` it be a appointment i have forget it be she there ' ` yes sire ' ` in the side room ' ` yes sire ' talleyrand and berthier exchange glance and the minister begin to move towards the door ` no no you can remain here ' say the emperor ` light the lamp constant and have the carriage ready in half-an-hour look over this draft of a letter to the emperor of austrium and let I have you observation upon it talleyrand de meneval there be a lengthy report here as to the new dockyard at brest extract what be essential from it and leave it upon my desk at five o'clock to-morrow morning berthier i will have the whole army into the boat at seven we will see if they can embark within three hour monsieur de laval you will wait here until we start for pont de brique ' so with a crisp order to each of we he walk with little swift step across the room and i see he square green back and white leg frame for a instant in the doorway there be the flutter of a pink skirt beyond and then the curtain close behind he berthier stand bite he nail while talleyrand look at he with a slight raising of he bushy eyebrow de meneval with a rueful face be turn over the great bundle of papers which have to be copy by morning constant with a noiseless tread be light the candle upon the sconce round the room ` which be it ' i hear the minister whisper ` the girl from the imperial opera ' say berthier ` be the little spanish lady out of favor then ' ` no i think not she be here yesterday ' ` and the other the countess ' ` she have a cottage at ambleteuse ' ` but we must have no scandal about the court ' say talleyrand with a sour smile recall the moral sentiment with which the emperor have reprove he ` and now monsieur de laval ' he add draw I aside ' i very much wish to hear from you about the bourbon party in england you must have hear they view do they imagine that they have any chance of success ' and so for ten minute he ply I with question which show I clearly that the emperor have read he aright and that he be determine come what might to be upon the side which win we be still talk when constant enter hurriedly with a look of anxiety and perplexity which i could not have imagine upon so smooth and imperturbable a face ` good heaven monsieur talleyrand ' he cry clasp and unclasp he hand ` such a misfortune who could have expect it ' ` what be it then constant ' ` oh monsieur i dare not intrude upon the emperor and yet -- and yet -- the empress be outside and she be come in ' chapter xiv josephine at this unexpected announcement talleyrand and berthier look at each other in silence and for once the trained feature of the great diplomatist who live behind a mask betray the fact that he be still capable of emotion the spasm which pass over they be cause however rather by mischievous amusement than by consternation while berthier -- who have a honest affection for both napoleon and josephine -- run frantically to the door as if to bar the empress from enter constant rush towards the curtain which screen the emperor 's room and then lose courage although he be know to be a stout-hearted man he come run back to talleyrand for advice it be too late now however for roustem the mameluke have open the door and two lady have enter the room the first be tall and graceful with a smile face and a affable though dignified manner she be dress in a black velvet cloak with white lace at the neck and sleeve and she wear a black hat with a curl white feather she companion be shorter with a countenance which would have be plain have it not be for the alert expression and large dark eye which give it charm and character a small black terrier dog have follow they in but the first lady turn and hand the thin steel chain with which she lead it to the mameluke attendant ` you have better keep fortune outside roustem ' say she in a peculiarly sweet musical voice ` the emperor be not very fond of dog and if we intrude upon he quarter we can not do less than consult he taste good evening monsieur de talleyrand madame de remusat and i have drive all along the cliff and we have stop as we pass to know if the emperor be come to pont de briques but perhaps he have already start i have expect to find he here ' ` he imperial majesty be here a short time ago ' say talleyrand bowing and rub he hand ' i hold my _ salon _ -- such a _ salon _ as pont de brique be capable of -- this evening and the emperor promise I that he would set he work aside for once and favor we with he presence i wish we could persuade he to work less monsieur de talleyrand he have a frame of iron but he can not continue in this way these nervous attack come more frequently upon he he will insist upon do everything everything himself it be noble but it be to be a martyr i have no doubt that at the present moment -- but you have not yet tell I where he be monsieur de talleyrand ' ` we expect he every instant you majesty ' ` in that case we shall sit down and await he return ah monsieur de meneval how i pity you when i see you among all those papers i be desolate when monsieur de bourrienne desert the emperor but you have more than take he place come up to the fire madame de remusat yes yes i insist upon it for i know that you must be cold constant come and put the rug under madame de remusat 's foot ' it be by little act of thoughtfulness and kindness like this that the empress so endear herself that she have really no enemy in france even among those who be most bitterly oppose to she husband whether as the consort of the first man in europe or as the lonely divorce woman eat she heart out at malmaison she be always praise and beloved by those who know she of all the sacrifice which the emperor ever make to he ambition that of he wife be the one which cost he the greatest struggle and the keenest regret now as she sit before the fire in the same chair which have so recently be occupy by the emperor i have a opportunity of study this person whose strange fate have raise she from be the daughter of a lieutenant of artillery to the first position among the woman of europe she be six year older than napoleon and on this occasion when i see she first she be in she forty-second year but at a little distance or in a discreet light it be no courtier 's flattery to say that she might very well have pass for thirty she tall elegant figure be girlish in its supple slimness and she have a easy and natural grace in every movement which she inherit with she tropical west indian blood she feature be delicate and i have hear that in she youth she be strikingly beautiful but like most creole woman she have become _ passee _ in early middle age she have make a brave fight however -- with art as she ally -- against the attack of time and she success have be such that when she sit aloof upon a dais or drive past in a procession she might still pass as a lovely woman in a small room however or in a good light the crude pink and whites with which she have conceal she sallow cheek become painfully harsh and artificial she own natural beauty however still linger in that last refuge of beauty -- the eye which be large dark and sympathetic she mouth too be small and amiable and she most frequent expression be a smile which seldom broaden into a laugh as she have she own reason for prefer that she tooth should not be see as to she bearing it be so dignified that if this little west indian have come straight from the loin of charlemagne it could not have be improve upon she walk she glance the sweep of she dress the wave of she hand -- they have all the happiest mixture of the sweetness of a woman and the condescension of a queen i watch she with admiration as she lean forward pick little piece of aromatic aloe wood out of the basket and throw they on to the fire ` napoleon like the smell of burn aloe ' say she ` there be never anyone who have such a nose as he for he can detect thing which be quite hide from I ' ` the emperor have a excellent nose for many thing ' say talleyrand ` the state contractor have find that out to they cost ' ` oh it be dreadful when he come to examine account -- dreadful monsieur de talleyrand nothing escape he he will make no allowance everything must be exact but who be this young gentleman monsieur de talleyrand i do not think that he have be present to I ' the minister explain in a few word that i have be receive into the emperor 's personal service and josephine congratulate I upon it with the most kindly sympathy ` it ease my mind so to know that he have brave and loyal man round he ever since that dreadful affair of the infernal machine i have always be uneasy if he be away from I he be really safest in time of war for it be only then that he be away from the assassin who hate he and now i understand that a new jacobin plot have only just be discover ' ` this be the same monsieur de laval who be there when the conspirator be take ' say talleyrand the empress overwhelm I with question hardly wait for the answer in she anxiety ` but this dreadful man toussac have not be take yet ' she cry ` have i not hear that a young lady be endeavor to do what have baffle the secret police and that the freedom of she lover be to be the reward of she success ' ` she be my cousin you imperial majesty mademoiselle sibylle bernac be she name ' ` you have only be in france a few day monsieur de laval ' say josephine smile ` but it seem to I that all the affair of the empire be already revolving round you you must bring this pretty cousin of yours -- the emperor say that she be pretty -- to court with you and present she to I madame de remusat you will take a note of the name ' the empress have stoop again to the basket of aloe wood which stand beside the fireplace suddenly i see she stare hard at something and then with a little cry of surprise she stoop and lift a object from the carpet it be the emperor 's soft flat beaver with the little tricolor cockade josephine spring up and look from the hat in she hand to the imperturbable face of the minister ` how be this monsieur de talleyrand ' she cry and the dark eye begin to shine with anger and suspicion ` you say to I that the emperor be out and here be he hat ' ` pardon I you imperial majesty i do not say that he be out ' ` what do you say then ' ' i say that he leave the room a short time before ' ` you be endeavor to conceal something from I ' she cry with the quick instinct of a woman ' i assure you that i tell you all i know ' the empress 's eye dart from face to face ` marshal berthier ' she cry ' i insist upon you tell I this instant where the emperor be and what he be do ' the slow-witted soldier stammer and twist he cocked hat about ' i know no more than monsieur de talleyrand do ' say he ` the emperor leave we some time ago ' ` by which door ' poor berthier be more confused than ever ` really you imperial majesty i can not undertake to say by which door it be that the emperor quit the apartment ' josephine 's eye flash round at I and my heart shrink within I as i think that she be about to ask I that same dreadful question but i have just time to breathe one prayer to the good saint ignatius who have always be gracious to we family and the danger pass ` come madame de remusat ' say she ` if these gentleman will not tell we we shall very soon find out for ourselves ' she sweep with great dignity towards the curtained door follow at the distance of a few yard by she wait lady whose frightened face and lag unwilling step show that she perfectly appreciate the situation indeed the emperor 's open infidelity and the public scene to which they give rise be so notorious that even in ashford they have reach we ear napoleon 's self-confidence and he contempt of the world have the effect of make he careless as to what be think or say of he while josephine when she be carry away by jealousy lose all the dignity and restraint which usually mark she conduct so between they they give some embarrassing moment to those who be about they talleyrand turn away with he finger over he lip while berthier in a agony of apprehension continue to double up and to twist the cock hat which he hold between he hand only constant the faithful valet venture to intervene between he mistress and the fatal door ` if you majesty will resume you seat i shall inform the emperor that you be here ' say he with two deprecate hand outstretch ` ah then he _ be _ there ' she cry furiously ' i see it all i understand it all but i will expose he -- i will reproach he with he perfidy let I pass constant how dare you stand in my way ' ` allow I to announce you you majesty ' ' i shall announce myself ' with swift undulation of she beautiful figure she dart past the protest valet part the curtain throw open the door and vanish into the next room she have seem a creature full of fire and of spirit as with a flush which break through the paint upon she cheek and with eye which gleam with the just anger of a outraged wife she force she way into she husband 's presence but she be a woman of change and impulse full of little squirt of courage and corresponding reaction into cowardice she have hardly vanish from we sight when there be a harsh roar like a angry beast and next instant josephine come fly into the room again with the emperor inarticulate with passion rave at she heel so frightened be she that she begin to run towards the fireplace upon which madame de remusat who have no wish to form a rearguard upon such a occasion begin run also and the two of they like a pair of startled hen come rustling and flutter back to the seat which they have leave there they cower whilst the emperor with a convulse face and a torrent of camp-fire oath stamped and rage about the room ` you constant you ' he shout ` be this the way in which you serve I have you no sense then -- no discretion be i never to have any privacy must i eternally submit to be spy upon by woman be everyone else to have liberty and i only to have none as to you josephine this finish it all i have hesitation before but now i have none this bring everything to a end between we ' we would all i be sure have give a good deal to slip from the room -- at least my own embarrassment far exceed my interest -- but the emperor from he lofty standpoint care as little about we presence as if we have be so many article of furniture in fact it be one of this strange man 's peculiarity that it be just those delicate and personal scene with which privacy be usually associate that he prefer to have in public for he know that he reproach have a additional sting when they fall upon other ear besides those of he victim from he wife to he groom there be not one of those who be about he who do not live in dread of be hold up to ridicule and infamy before a smile crowd whose amusement be only temper by the reflection that each of they might be the next to endure the same exposure as to josephine she have take refuge in a woman 's last resource and be cry bitterly with she graceful neck stoop towards she knee and she two hand over she face madame de remusat be weep also and in every pause of he hoarse scolding -- for he voice be very hoarse and raucous when he be angry -- there come the soft hiss and click of they sob sometimes he fierce taunt would bring some reply from the empress some gentle reproof to he for he gallantry but each remonstrance only excite he to a fresh rush of vituperation in one of he outburst he throw he snuff-box with a crash upon the floor as a spoil child would hurl down its toy ` morality ' he cry ` morality be not make for I and i be not make for morality i be a man apart and i accept nobody 's condition i tell you always josephine that these be the foolish phrase of mediocre people who wish to fetter the great they do not apply to I i will never consent to frame my conduct by the puerile arrangement of society ' ` have you no feeling then ' sob the empress ' a great man be not make for feel it be for he to decide what he shall do and then to do it without interference from anyone it be you place josephine to submit to all my fancy and you should think it quite natural that i should allow myself some latitude ' it be a favorite device of the emperor 's when he be in the wrong upon one point to turn the conversation round so as to get upon some other one on which he be in the right have work off the first explosion of he passion he now assume the offensive for in argument as in war he instinct be always to attack ' i have be look over lenormand 's account josephine ' say he ` be you aware how many dress you have have last year you have have a hundred and forty -- no less -- and many of they cost as much as twenty-five thousand livre i be tell that you have six hundred dress in you wardrobe many of which have hardly ever be use madame de remusat know that what i say be true she can not deny it ' ` you like I to dress well napoleon ' ' i will not have such monstrous extravagance i could have two regiment of cuirassier or a fleet of frigate with the money which you squander upon foolish silk and fur it might turn the fortune of a campaign then again josephine who give you permission to order that parure of diamond and sapphire from lefebvre the bill have be send to I and i have refuse to pay for it if he apply again i shall have he march to prison between a file of grenadier and you milliner shall accompany he there ' the emperor 's fit of anger although tempestuous be never very prolong the curious convulsive wriggle of one of he arm which always show when he be excite gradually die away and after look for some time at the papers of de meneval -- who have write away like a automaton during all this uproar -- he come across to the fire with a smile upon he lip and a brow from which the shadow have depart ` you have no excuse for extravagance josephine ' say he lay he hand upon she shoulder ` diamond and fine dress be very necessary to a ugly woman in order to make she attractive but _ you _ can not need they for such a purpose you have no fine dress when first i see you in the rue chautereine and yet there be no woman in the world who ever attract I so why will you vex I josephine and make I say thing which seem unkind drive back little one to pont de briques and see that you do not catch cold ' ` you will come to the salon napoleon ' ask the empress whose bitterest resentment seem to vanish in a instant at the first kindly touch from he hand she still hold she handkerchief before she eye but it be chiefly i think to conceal the effect which she tear have have upon she cheek ` yes yes i will come we carriage will follow yours see the lady into the berline constant have you order the embarkation of the troops berthier come here talleyrand for i wish to describe my view about the future of spain and portugal monsieur de laval you may escort the empress to pont de briques where i shall see you at the reception ' chapter xv the reception of the empress pont de brique be but a small village and this sudden arrival of the court which be to remain for some week have cram it with visitor it would have be very much simpler to have come to boulogne where there be more suitable building and better accommodation but napoleon have name pont de brique so pont de brique it have to be the word impossible be not permit amongst those who have to carry out he wish so a army of cook and footman settle upon the little place and then there arrive the dignitary of the new empire and then the lady of the court and then they admirer from the camp the empress have a chateau for she accommodation the rest quarter themselves in cottage or where they best might and wait ardently for the moment which be to take they back to the comfort of versaille or fontainebleau the empress have graciously offer I a seat in she berline and all the way to the village entirely forgetful apparently of the scene through which she pass she chat away ask I a thousand personal question about myself and my affair for a kindly curiosity in the doings of everyone around she be one of she most marked characteristic especially be she interested in eugenie and as the subject be one upon which i be equally interested in talk it end in a rhapsody upon my part amid little sympathetic ejaculation from the empress and tittering from madame de remusat ` but you must certainly bring she over to the court ' cry the kindly woman ` such a paragon of beauty and of virtue must not be allow to waste herself in this english village have you speak about she to the emperor ' ' i find that he know all about she you majesty ' ` he know all about everything oh what a man he be you hear he about those diamond and sapphire lefebvre give I he word that no one should know of it but ourselves and that i should pay at my leisure and yet you see that the emperor know but what do he say monsieur de laval ' ` he say that my marriage should be he affair ' josephine shake she head and groan ` but this be serious monsieur de laval he be capable of single out any one of the lady of the court and marry you to she within a week it be a subject upon which he will not listen to argument he have bring about some extraordinary match in this way but i will speak to the emperor before i return to pari and i will see what i can arrange for you ' i be still endeavor to thank she for she sympathy and kindness when the berline rattle up the drive and pull up at the entrance to the chateau where the knot of scarlet footman and the bearskin of two sentry from the guard announce the imperial quarter the empress and she lady hurry away to prepare they toilet for the evening and i be show at once into the salon in which the guest have already begin to assemble this be a large square room furnish as modestly as the sitting-room of a provincial gentleman would be likely to be the wall-paper be gloomy and the furniture be of dark mahogany upholster in fade blue nankeen but there be numerous candle in candelabrum upon the table and in sconce upon the wall which give a air of festivity even to these sombre surroundings out of the large central room be several smaller one in which card-table have be lay out and the doorway between have be drape with oriental chintz a number of lady and gentleman be stand about the former in the high evening dress to which the emperor have give he sanction the latter about equally divide between the civilian in black court costume and the soldier in they uniform bright color and graceful drapery predominate for in spite of he lecture about economy the emperor be very harsh to any lady who do not dress in a manner which would sustain the brilliancy of he court the prevail fashion give a open to taste and to display for the simple classical costume have die out with the republic and oriental dress have take they place as a compliment to the conqueror of egypt lucretium have change to zuleika and the salon which have reflect the austerity of old rome have turn suddenly into so many eastern harem on enter the room i have retire into a corner fear that i should find none there whom i know but someone pluck at my arm and turn round i find myself look into the yellow inscrutable face of my uncle bernac he seize my unresponsive hand and wring it with a false cordiality ` my dear loui ' say he ` it be really the hope of meeting you here which bring I over from grosboi -- although you can understand that live so far from paris i can not afford to miss such a opportunity of show myself at court nevertheless i can assure you that it be of you principally that i be think i hear that you have have a splendid reception from the emperor and that you have be take into he personal service i have speak to he about you and i make he fully realize that if he treat you well he be likely to coax some of the other young emigre into he service ' i be convince that he be lie but none the less i have to bow and utter a few word of cold thanks ' i see that you still bear I some grudge for what pass between we the other day ' say he ` but really my dear loui you have no occasion to do so it be you own good which i have chiefly at heart i be neither a young nor a strong man loui and my profession as you have see be a dangerous one there be my child and there be my estate who take one take both sibylle be a charming girl and you must not allow yourself to be prejudice against she by any ill temper which she may have show towards I i will confess that she have some reason to be annoy at the turn which thing have take but i hope to hear that you have now think better upon this matter ' ' i have never think about it at all and i beg that you will not discuss it ' say i curtly he stand in deep thought for a few moment and then he raise he evil face and he cruel gray eye to mine ` well well that be settle then ' say he ` but you can not bear I a grudge for have wish you to be my successor be reasonable loui you must acknowledge that you would now be six foot deep in the salt-marsh with you neck break if i have not stand you friend at some risk to myself be that not true ' ` you have you own motive for that ' say i ` very likely but none the less i save you why should you bear I ill will it be no fault of mine if i hold you estate ' ` it be not on account of that ' ` why be it then ' i could have explain that it be because he have betray he comrade because he daughter hate he because he have ill-use he wife because my father regard he as the source of all he trouble -- but the salon of the empress be no place for a family quarrel so i merely shrug my shoulder and be silent ` well i be very sorry ' say he ` for i have the best of intention towards you i could have advance you for there be few man in france who exercise more influence but i have one request to make to you ' ` what be that sir ' ' i have a number of personal article belong to you father -- he sword he seal a deskful of letter some silver plate -- such thing in short as you would wish to keep in memory of he i should be glad if you will come to grosboi -- if it be only for one night -- and look over these thing choose what you wish to take away my conscience will then be clear about they ' i promise readily that i would do so ` and when would you come ' he ask eagerly something in the tone of he voice arouse my suspicion and glance at he i see exultation in he eye i remember the warning of sibylle ' i can not come until i have learn what my duty with the emperor be to be when that be settle i shall come ' ` very good next week perhaps or the week afterwards i shall expect you eagerly loui i rely upon you promise for a laval be never know to break one ' with another unanswered squeeze of my hand he slip off among the crowd which be grow denser every instant in the salon i be stand in silence thinking over this sinister invitation of my uncle 's when i hear my own name and look up i see de caulaincourt with he brown handsome face and tall elegant figure make he way towards I ` it be you first entrance at court be it not monsieur de laval ' say he in he high-bred cordial manner ` you should not feel lonely for there be certainly many friend of you father here who will be overjoy to make the acquaintance of you father 's son from what de meneval tell I i gather that you know hardly anyone -- even by sight ' ' i know the marshal ' say i ' i see they all at the council in the emperor 's tent there be ney with the red head and there be lefebvre with he singular mouth and bernadotte with the beak of a bird of prey ' ` precisely and that be rapp with the round bullet head he be talk to junot the handsome dark man with the whisker these poor soldier be very unhappy ' ` why so ' i ask ` because they be all man who have rise from nothing this society and etiquette terrify they much more than all the danger of war when they can hear they sabre clash against they big boot they feel at home but when they have to stand about with they cocked hat under they arm and have to pick they spur out of the lady ' train and talk about david 's picture or passaniello 's opera it prostrate they the emperor will not even permit they to swear although he have no scruple upon he own account he tell they to be soldier with the army and courtier with the court but the poor fellow can not help be soldier all the time look at rapp with he twenty wound endeavor to exchange little delicate drollery with that young lady there you see he have say something which would have pass very well with a vivandiere but it have make she fly to she mamma and he be scratch he head for he can not imagine how he have offend she ' ` who be the beautiful woman with the white dress and the tiara of diamond ' i ask ` that be madame murat who be the sister of the emperor caroline be beautiful but she be not as pretty as she sister marie whom you see over yonder in the corner do you see the tall stately dark-eyed old lady with whom she be talk that be napoleon 's mother -- a wonderful woman the source of all they strength shrewd brave vigorous force respect from everyone who know she she be as careful and as save as when she be the wife of a small country gentleman in corsica and it be no secret that she have little confidence in the permanence of the present state of thing and that she be always lay by for a evil day the emperor do not know whether to be amuse or exasperate by she precaution well murat i suppose we shall see you ride across the kentish hop-field before long ' the famous soldier have pause opposite to we and shake hand with my companion he elegant well-knit figure large fiery eye and noble bearing make this innkeeper 's boy a man who would have draw attention and admiration to himself in any assembly in europe he mop of curly hair and thick red lip give that touch of character and individuality to he appearance which redeem a handsome face from insipidity ' i be tell that it be devilish bad country for cavalry -- all cut up into hedge and ditch ' say he ` the road be good but the field be impossible i hope that we be go soon monsieur de caulaincourt for we man will all settle down as gardener if this continue they be learn more about watering-pot and spud than about horse and sabre ' ` the army i hear be to embark to-morrow ' ` yes yes but you know very well that they will disembark again upon the wrong side of the channel unless villeneuve scatter the english fleet nothing can be attempt ' ` constant tell I that the emperor be whistle malbrook all the time that he be dress this morning and that usually come before a move ' ` it be very clever of constant to tell what tune it be which the emperor be whistle ' say murat laughing ` for my part i do not think that he know the difference between the malbrook and the marseillaise ah here be the empress -- and how charming she be look ' josephine have enter with several of she lady in she train and the whole assembly rise to do she honor the empress be dress in a evening gown of rose-coloured tulle spangled with silver star -- a effect which might have seem meretricious and theatrical in another woman but which she carry off with great grace and dignity a little sheaf of diamond wheat-ear rise above she head and sway gently as she walk no one could entertain more charmingly than she for she move about among the people with she amiable smile set everybody at they ease by she kindly natural manner and by the conviction which she give they that she be thoroughly at she ease herself ` how amiable she be ' i exclaimed ` who could help love she ' ` there be only one family which can resist she ' say de caulaincourt glancing round to see that murat be out of hearing ` look at the face of the emperor 's sister ' i be shock when i follow he direction to see the malignant glance with which these two beautiful woman be follow the empress as she walk about the room they whisper together and titter maliciously then madame murat turn to she mother behind she and the stern old lady toss she haughty head in derision and contempt ` they feel that napoleon be theirs and that they ought to have everything they can not bear to think that she be she imperial majesty and they be only she highness they all hate she joseph lucien -- all of they when they have to carry she train at the coronation they try to trip she up and the emperor have to interfere oh yes they have the real corsican blood and they be not very comfortable people to get along with ' but in spite of the evident hatred of she husband 's family the empress appear to be entirely unconcerned and at she ease as she stroll about among the group of she guest with a kindly glance and a pleasant word for each of they a tall soldierly man brown-faced and moustached walk beside she and she occasionally lay she hand with a caressing motion upon he arm ` that be she son eugene de beauharnais ' say my companion ` she son ' i exclaimed for he seem to I to be the older of the two de caulaincourt smile at my surprise ` you know she marry beauharnai when she be very young -- in fact she be hardly sixteen she have be sit in she boudoir while she son have be bake in egypt and syrium so that they have pretty well bridge over the gap between they do you see the tall handsome clean-shaven man who have just kiss josephine 's hand that be talma the famous actor he once help napoleon at a critical moment of he career and the emperor have never forget the debt which the consul contract that be really the secret of talleyrand 's power he lend napoleon a hundred thousand franc before he set out for egypt and now however much he distrust he the emperor can not forget that old kindness i have never know he to abandon a friend or to forgive a enemy if you have once serve he well you may do what you like afterwards there be one of he coachman who be drunk from morning to night but he gain the cross at marengo and so he be safe ' de caulaincourt have move on to speak with some lady and i be again leave to my own thought which turn upon this extraordinary man who present himself at one moment as a hero and at another as a spoil child with he nobler and he worse side alternate so rapidly that i have no sooner make up my mind about he than some new revelation would destroy my view and drive I to some fresh conclusion that he be necessary to france be evident and that in serve he one be serve one 's country but be it a honor or a penance to serve he be he worthy merely of obedience or might love and esteem be add to it these be the question which we find it difficult to answer -- and some of we will never have answer they up to the end of time the company have now lose all appearance of formality and even the soldier seem to be at they ease many have go into the side room where they have form table for whist and for vingt-et-un for my own part i be quite entertain by watch the people the beautiful woman the handsome man the bearer of name which have be hear of in no previous generation but which now ring round the world immediately in front of I be ney lanne and murat chatting together and laugh with the freedom of the camp of the three two be destine to be execute in cold blood and the third to die upon the battle-field but no come shadow ever cast a gloom upon they cheery full-blooded life a small silent middle-aged man who look unhappy and ill at ease have be lean against the wall beside I see that he be as great a stranger as myself i address some observation to he to which he reply with great good-will but in the most execrable french ` you do not happen to understand english ' he ask ` i have never meet one live soul in this country who do ' ` oh yes i understand it very well for i have live most of my life over yonder but surely you be not english sir i understand that every englishman in france be under lock and key ever since the breach of the treaty of amien ' ` no i be not english ' he answer ' i be a american my name be robert fulton and i have to come to these reception because it be the only way in which i can keep myself in the memory of the emperor who be examine some invention of mine which will make great change in naval warfare ' have nothing else to do i ask this curious american what he invention might be and he reply very soon convinced I that i have to do with a madman he have some idea of make a ship go against the wind and against the current by means of coal or wood which be to be burn inside of she there be some other nonsense about float barrel full of gunpowder which would blow a ship to piece if she strike against they i listen to he at the time with a indulgent smile but now look back from the point of vantage of my old age i can see that not all the warrior and statesman in that room -- no not even the emperor himself -- have have as great a effect upon the history of the world as that silent american who look so drab and so commonplace among the gold-slashed uniform and the oriental dress but suddenly we conversation be interrupt by a hush in the room -- such a cold uncomfortable hush as come over a roomful of happy romp child when a grave-faced elder come amongst they the chat and the laughter die away the sound of the rustling card and of the click counter have cease in the other room everyone man and woman have rise to they foot with a constrain expectant expression upon they face and there in the doorway be the pale face and the green coat with the red cordon across the white waistcoat there be no say how he might behave upon these occasion sometimes he be capable of be the merriest and most talkative of the company but this be rather in he consular than in he imperial day on the other hand he might be absolutely ferocious with a insulting observation for everyone with whom he come in contact as a rule he be between these two extreme silent morose ill at ease shooting out curt little remark which make everyone uncomfortable there be always a sigh of relief when he would pass from one room into the next on this occasion he seem to have not wholly recover from the storm of the afternoon and he look about he with a brooding eye and a lower brow it chance that i be not very far from the door and that he glance fall upon I ` come here monsieur de laval ' say he he lay he hand upon my shoulder and turn to a big gaunt man who have accompany he into the room ` look here cambacere you simpleton ' say he ` you always say that the old family would never come back and that they would settle in england as the huguenot have do you see that as usual you have miscalculate for here be the heir of the de lavals come to offer he service monsieur de laval you be now my aide-de-camp and i beg you to keep with I wherever i go ' this be promotion indeed and yet i have sense enough to know that it be not for my own sweet sake that the emperor have do it but in order to encourage other to follow I my conscience approve what i have do for no sordid motive and nothing but the love of my country have prompt I but now as i walk round behind napoleon i feel humiliate and ashamed like a prisoner lead behind the car of he captor and soon there be something else to make I ashamed and that be the conduct of he whose servant i have become he manners be outrageous as he have himself say it be he nature to be always first and this be so he resent those courtesy and gallantry by which man be accustom to disguise from woman the fact that they be the weaker sex the emperor unlike loui xiv feel that even a temporary and conventional attitude of humility towards a woman be too great a condescension from he own absolute supremacy chivalry be among those condition of society which he refuse to accept to the soldier he be amiable enough with a nod and a joke for each of they to he sister also he say a few word though rather in the tone of a drill sergeant to a pair of recruit it be only when the empress have join he that he ill-humour come to a head ' i wish you would not wear those wisp of pink about you head josephine ' say he pettishly ` all that woman have to think about be how to dress themselves and yet they can not even do that with moderation or taste if i see you again in such a thing i will thrust it in the fire as i do you shawl the other day ' ` you be so hard to please napoleon you like one day what you can not abide the next but i will certainly change it if it offend you ' say josephine with admirable patience the emperor take a few step between the people who have form a lane for we to pass through then he stop and look over he shoulder at the empress ` how often have i tell you josephine that i can not tolerate fat woman ' ' i always bear it in mind napoleon ' ` then why be madame de chevreux present ' ` but surely napoleon madame be not very fat ' ` she be fatter than she should be i should prefer not to see she who be this ' he have pause before a young lady in a blue dress whose knee seem to be give way under she as the terrible emperor transfix she with he search eye ` this be mademoiselle de bergerot ' ` how old be you ' ` twenty-three sire ' ` it be time that you be marry every woman should be marry at twenty-three how be it that you be not marry ' the poor girl appear to be incapable of answer so the empress gently remark that it be to the young man that that question should be address ` oh that be the difficulty be it ' say the emperor ` we must look about and find a husband for you ' he turn and to my horror i find he eye fix with a question gaze upon my face ` we have to find you a wife also monsieur de laval ' say he ` well well we shall see -- we shall see what be you name ' to a quiet refined man in black ' i be gretry the musician ' ` yes yes i remember you i have see you a hundred time but i can never recall you name who be you ' ' i be joseph de chenier ' ` of course i have see you tragedy i have forget the name of it but it be not good you have write some other poetry have you not ' ` yes sire i have you permission to dedicate my last volume to you ' ` very likely but i have not have time to read it it be a pity that we have no poet now in france for the deed of the last few year would have give a subject for a homer or a virgil it seem that i can create kingdom but not poet whom do you consider to be the greatest french writer ' ` racine sire ' ` then you be a blockhead for corneille be infinitely greater i have no ear for metre or triviality of the kind but i can sympathise with the spirit of poetry and i be conscious that corneille be far the greatest of poet i would have make he my prime minister have he have the good fortune to live in my epoch it be he intellect which i admire he knowledge of the human heart and he profound feeling be you write anything at present ' ' i be write a tragedy upon henry iv sire ' ` it will not do sir it be too near the present day and i will not have politics upon the stage write a play about alexander what be you name ' he have pitch upon the same person whom he have already address ' i be still gretry the musician ' say he meekly the emperor flush for a instant at the imply rebuke he say nothing however but pass on to where several lady be stand together near the door of the card-room ` well madame ' say he to the nearest of they ' i hope you be behave rather better when last i hear from paris you doings be furnish the quartier st germain with a good deal of amusement and gossip ' ' i beg that you majesty will explain what you mean ' say she with spirit ` they have couple you name with that of colonel lasalle ' ` it be a foul calumny sire ' ` very possibly but it be awkward when so many calumny cluster round one person you be certainly a most unfortunate lady in that respect you have a scandal once before with general rapp 's aide-de-camp this must come to a end what be you name ' he continue turn to another ` mademoiselle de perigord ' ` you age ' ` twenty ' ` you be very thin and you elbow be red my god madame boismaison be we never to see anything but this same gray gown and the red turban with the diamond crescent ' ' i have never wear it before sire ' ` then you have another the same for i be weary of the sight of it let I never see you in it again monsieur de remusat i make you a good allowance why do you not spend it ' ' i do sire ' ' i hear that you have be put down you carriage i do not give you money to hoard in a bank but i give it to you that you may keep up a fitting appearance with it let I hear that you carriage be back in the coach-house when i return to paris junot you rascal i hear that you have be gamble and lose ' ` the most infernal run

rascal i do not like low dress madame picard they spoil even pretty woman but in you they be inexcusable now josephine i be go to my room and you can come in half a hour and read I to sleep i be tired to-night but i come to you salon since you desire that i should help you in welcome and entertain you guest you can remain here monsieur de laval for you presence will not be necessary until i send you my order ' and so the door close behind he and with a long sigh of relief from everyone from the empress to the waiter with the negus the friendly chatter begin once more with the click of the counter and the rustle of the card just as they have be before he come to help in the entertainment chapter xvi the library of grosboi and now my friend i be come to the end of those singular adventure which i encounter upon my arrival in france adventure which might have be of some interest in themselves have i not introduce the figure of the emperor who have eclipse they all as completely as the sun eclipse the star even now you see after all these year in a old man 's memoirs the emperor be still true to he tradition and will not brook any opposition as i draw he word and he deed i feel that my own poor story withers before they and yet if it have not be for that story i should not have have a excuse for describe to you my first and most vivid impression of he and so it have serve a purpose after all you must bear with I now while i tell you of we expedition to the red mill and of what befall in the library of grosbois two day have pass away since the reception of the empress josephine and only one remain of the time which have be allow to my cousin sibylle in which she might save she lover and capture the terrible toussac for my own part i be not so very anxious that she should save this craven lover of hers whose handsome face belie the poor spirit within he and yet this lonely beautiful woman with the strong will and the loyal heart have touch my feeling and i feel that i would help she to anything -- even against my own better judgment if she should desire it it be then with a mixture of feeling that late in the afternoon i see she and general savary enter the little room in which i lodge at boulogne one glance at she flushed cheek and triumphant eye tell I that she be confident in she own success ' i tell you that i would find he cousin loui ' she cry ' i have come straight to you because you say that you would help in the taking of he ' ` mademoiselle insist upon it that i should not use soldier ' say savary shrug he shoulder ` no no no ' she cry with vehemence ` it have to be do with discretion and at the sight of a soldier he would fly to some hiding-place where you would never be able to follow he i can not afford to run a risk there be too much already at stake ' ` in such a affair three man be as useful as thirty ' say savary ' i should not in any case have employ more you say that you have another friend lieutenant -- ' ` lieutenant gerard of the hussar of bercheny ' ` quite so there be not a more gallant officer in the grand army than etienne gerard the three of we monsieur de laval should be equal to any adventure ' ' i be at you disposal ' ` tell we then mademoiselle where toussac be hide ' ` he be hide at the red mill ' ` but we have search it i assure you that he be not there ' ` when do you search it ' ` two day ago ' ` then he have come there since i know that jeanne portal love he i have watch she for six day last night she steal down to the red mill with a basket of wine and fruit all the morning i have see she eye sweep the country side and i have read the terror in they whenever she have see the twinkle of a bayonet i be as sure that toussac be in the mill as if i have see he with my own eye ' ` in that case there be not a instant to be lose ' cry savary ` if he know of a boat upon the coast he be as likely as not to slip away after dark and make he escape for england from the red mill one can see all the surrounding country and mademoiselle be right in think that a large body of soldier would only warn he to escape ' ` what do you propose then ' i ask ` that you meet we at the south gate of the camp in a hour 's time dress as you be you might be any gentleman travel upon the high road i shall see gerard and we shall adopt some suitable disguise bring you pistol for it be with the most desperate man in france we have to do we shall have a horse at you disposal ' the setting sun lay dull and red upon the western horizon and the white chalk cliff of the french coast have all flush into pink when i find myself once more at the gate of the boulogne camp there be no sign of my companion but a tall man dress in a blue coat with brass button like a small country farmer be tighten the girth of a magnificent black horse whilst a little further on a slim young ostler be wait by the roadside hold the bridle of two other it be only when i recognize one of the pair as the horse which i have ride on my first come to camp that i answer the smile upon the keen handsome face of the ostler and see the swarthy feature of savary under the broad-brimmed hat of the farmer ' i think that we may travel without fear to excite suspicion ' say he ` crook that straight back of yours a little gerard and now we shall push upon we way or we may find that we be too late ' my life have have its share of adventure and yet somehow this ride stand out above the other there over the water i could dimly see the loom of the english coast with its suggestion of dreamy village hum bee and the peal of Sunday bell i thought of the long white high street of ashford with its red brick house and the inn with the great swinging sign all my life have be spend in these peaceful surroundings and now here i be with a spirited horse between my knee two pistol peep out of my holster and a commission upon which my whole future might depend to arrest the most redoubtable conspirator in france no wonder that look back over many danger and many vicissitude it be still that evening ride over the short crisp turf of the downs which stand out most clearly in my memory one become _ blase _ to adventure as one become _ blase _ to all else which the world can give save only the simple joy of home and to taste the full relish of such a expedition one must approach it with the hot blood of youth still throb in one 's vein we route when we have leave the upland of boulogne behind we lay along the skirt of that desolate marsh in which i have wander and so inland through plain of fern and bramble until the familiar black keep of the castle of grosboi rise upon the left then under the guidance of savary we strike to the right down a sunken road and so over the shoulder of a hill until on a further slope beyond we see the old windmill black against the evening sky its upper window burn red like a spot of blood in the last ray of the setting sun close by the door stand a cart full of grain sack with the shaft point downward and the horse grazing at some distance as we gaze a woman appear upon the downs and stare round with she hand over she eye ` see that ' say savary eagerly ` he be there sure enough or why should they be on they guard let we take this road which wind round the hill and they will not see we until we be at the very door ' ` should we not gallop forward ' i suggest ` the ground be too cut up the longer way be the safer as long as we be upon the road they can not tell we from any other traveller ' we walk we horse along the path therefore with as unconcerned a air as we could assume but a sharp exclamation make we glance suddenly round and there be the woman standing on a hillock by the roadside and gaze down at we with a face that be rigid with suspicion the sight of the military bearing of my companion change all she fear into certainty in a instant she have whip the shawl from she shoulder and be wave it frantically over she head with a hearty curse savary spur he horse up the bank and gallop straight for the mill with gerard and myself at he heel it be only just in time we be still a hundred pace from the door when a man spring out from it and gaze about he he head whisk this way and that there could be no mistake the huge bristling beard the broad chest and the round shoulder of toussac a glance show he that we would ride he down before he could get away and he spring back into the mill close the heavy door with a clang behind he ` the window gerard the window ' cry savary there be a small square window open into the basement room of the mill the young hussar disengaged himself from the saddle and fly through it as the clown go through the hoop at franconus 's a instant later he have open the door for we with the blood streaming from he face and hand ` he have flee up the stair ' say he ` then we need be in no hurry since he can not pass we ' say savary as we spring from we horse ` you have carry he first line of entrenchment most gallantly lieutenant gerard i hope you be not hurt ' ' a few scratch general nothing more ' ` get you pistol then where be the miller ' ` here i be ' say a squat rough little fellow appear in the open doorway ` what do you mean you brigand by enter my mill in this fashion i be sit read my paper and smoking my pipe of coltsfoot as my custom be about this time of the evening and suddenly without a word a man come fly through my window cover I with glass and open my door to he friend outside i have have trouble enough with my one lodger all day without three more of you turn up ' ` you have the conspirator toussac in you house ' ` toussac ' cry the miller ` nothing of the kind he name be maurice and he be a merchant in silk ' ` he be the man we want we come in the emperor 's name ' the miller 's jaw drop as he listen ' i do not know who he be but he offer a good price for a bed and i ask no more question in these day one can not expect a certificate of character from every lodger but of course if it be a matter of state why it be not for I to interfere but to do he justice he be a quiet gentleman enough until he have that letter just now ' ` what letter be careful what you say you rascal for you own head may find its way into the sawdust basket ' ` it be a woman who bring it i can only tell you what i know he have be talk like a madman ever since it make my blood run cold to hear he there be someone whom he swear he will murder i shall be very glad to see the last of he ' ` now gentleman ' say savary draw he sword ` we may leave we horse here there be no window for forty foot so he can not escape from we if you will see that you pistol be prime we shall soon bring the fellow to term ' the stair be a narrow wind one make of wood which lead to a small loft light from a slit in the wall some remains of wood and a litter of straw show that this be where toussac have spend he day there be however no sign of he now and it be evident that he have ascend the next flight of step we climb they only to find we way bar by a heavy door ` surrender toussac ' cry savary ` it be useless to attempt to escape we a hoarse laugh sound from behind the door ' i be not a man who surrender but i will make a bargain with you i have a small matter of business to do to-night if you will leave I alone i will give you my solemn pledge to surrender at the camp to-morrow i have a little debt that i wish to pay it be only to-day that i understand to whom i owe it ' ` what you ask be impossible ' ` it would save you a great deal of trouble ' ` we can not grant such a request you must surrender ' ` you 'll have some work first ' ` come come you can not escape we put you shoulder against the door now all together ' there be the hot flash of a pistol from the keyhole and a bullet smack against the wall between we we hurl ourselves against the door it be massive but rotten with age with a splintering and rend it give way before we we rush in weapon in hand to find ourselves in a empty room ` where the devil have he get to ' cry savary glaring round he ` this be the top room of all there be nothing above it ' it be a square empty space with a few corn-bag litter about at the further side be a open window and beside it lay a pistol still smoke from the discharge we all rush across and as we crane we head over a simultaneous cry of astonishment escape from we the distance to the ground be so great that no one could have survive the fall but toussac have take advantage of the presence of that cart full of grain-sack which i have describe as have lain close to the mill this have both shorten the distance and give he a excellent means of break the fall even so however the shock have be tremendous and as we look out he be lie pant heavily upon the top of the bag hear we cry however he look up shake he fist defiantly and roll from the cart he spring on to the back of savary 's black horse and gallop off across the downs he great beard fly in the wind untouched by the pistol bullet with which we try to bring he down how we fly down those creak wooden stair and out through the open door of the mill quick as we be he have a good start and by the time gerard and i be in the saddle he have become a tiny man upon a small horse gallop up the green slope of the opposite hill the shades of evening too be draw in and upon he left be the huge salt-marsh where we should have find it difficult to follow he the chance be certainly in he favor and yet he never swerve from he course but keep straight on across the downs on a line which take he farther and farther from the sea every instant we fear to see he dart away in the morass but still he hold he horse 's head against the hill-side what could he be make for he never pull rein and never glance round but fly onwards like a man with a definite goal in view lieutenant gerard and i be lighter man and we mount be as good as he so that it be not long before we begin to gain upon he if we could only keep he in sight it be certain that we should ride he down but there be always the danger that he might use he knowledge of the country to throw we off he track as we sink beneath each hill my heart sink also to rise again with renew hope as we catch sight of he once more gallop in front of we but at last that which i have fear befall we we be not more than a couple of hundred pace behind he when we lose all trace of he he have vanish behind some rolling ground and we could see nothing of he when we reach the summit ` there be a road there to the leave ' cry gerard whose gascon blood be aflame with excitement ` on my friend on let we keep to the leave ' ` wait a moment ' i cry ` there be a bridle-path upon the right and it be as likely that he take that ' ` then do you take one and i the other ' ` one moment i hear the sound of hoof ' ` yes yes it be he horse ' a great black horse which be certainly that of general savary have break out suddenly through a dense tangle of bramble in front of we the saddle be empty ` he have find some hiding-place here amongst the bramble ' i cry gerard have already spring from he horse and be lead he through the bush i follow he example and in a minute or two we make we way down a wind path into a deep chalk quarry ` there be no sign of he ' cry gerard ` he have escape we ' but suddenly i have understand it all he furious rage which the miller have describe to we be cause no doubt by he learn how he come to be betray upon the night of he arrival this sweetheart of he have in some way discover it and have let he know he promise to deliver himself up to-morrow be in order to give he time to have he revenge upon my uncle and now with one idea in he head he have ride to this chalk quarry of course it must be the same chalk quarry into which the underground passage of grosboi open and no doubt during he treasonable meeting with my uncle he have learn the secret twice i hit upon the wrong spot but at the third trial i gain the face of the cliff make my way between it and the bush and find the narrow opening which be hardly visible in the gathering darkness during we search savary have overtake we on foot so now leave we horse in the chalk-pit my two companion follow I through the narrow entrance tunnel and on into the larger and older passage beyond we have no light and it be as black as pitch within so i stumble forward as best i might feel my way by keep one hand upon the side wall and tripping occasionally over the stone which be scatter along the path it have seem no very great distance when my uncle have lead the way with the light but now what with the darkness and what with the uncertainty and the tension of we feeling it appear to be a long journey and savary 's deep voice at my elbow growl out question as to how many more mile we be to travel in this moleheap ` hush ' whisper gerard ' i hear someone in front of we ' we stand listen in breathless silence then far away through the darkness i hear the sound of a door creak upon its hinge ` on on ' cry savary eagerly ` the rascal be there sure enough this time at least we have get he ' but for my part i have my fear i remember that my uncle have open the door which lead into the castle by some secret catch this sound which we have hear seem to show that toussac have also know how to open it but suppose that he have close it behind he i remember its size and the iron clamping which bind it together it be possible that even at the last moment we might find ourselves face to face with a insuperable obstacle on and on we hurry in the dark and then suddenly i could have raise a shout of joy for there in the distance be a yellow glimmer of light only visible in contrast with the black darkness which lay between the door be open in he mad thirst for vengeance toussac have never give a think to the pursuer at he heel and now we need no longer grope it be a race along the passage and up the wind stair through the second door and into the stone-flagged corridor of the castle of grosboi with the oil-lamp still burn at the end of it a frightful cry -- a long-drawn scream of terror and of pain -- ring through it as we enter ` he be kill he he be kill he ' cry a voice and a woman servant rush madly out into the passage ` help help he be kill monsieur bernac ' ` where be he ' shout savary ` there the library the door with the green curtain ' again that horrible cry ring out die down to a harsh croak it end in a loud sharp snick as when one crack one 's joint but many time louder i know only too well what that dreadful sound portend we rush together into the room but the harden savary and the dare-devil hussar both recoil in horror from the sight which meet we gaze my uncle have be seat write at he desk with he back to the door when he murderer have enter no doubt it be at the first glance over he shoulder that he have raise the scream when he see that terrible hairy face come in upon he while the second cry may have be when those great hand clutch at he head he have never rise from he chair -- perhaps he have be too paralyse by fear -- and he still sit with he back to the door but what strike the color from we cheek be that he head have be turn completely round so that he horribly distorted purple face look squarely at we from between he shoulder often in my dream that thin face with the bulge gray eye and the shockingly open mouth come to disturb I beside he stand toussac he face flush with triumph and he great arm fold across he chest ` well my friend ' say he ` you be too late you see i have pay my debt after all ' ` surrender ' cry savary ` shoot away shoot away ' he cry drum he hand upon he breast ` you do not suppose i fear you miserable pellet do you oh you imagine you will take I alive i 'll soon knock that idea out of you head ' in a instant he have swing a heavy chair over he head and be rush furiously at we we all fire we pistol into he together but nothing could stop that thunderbolt of a man with the blood spurt from he wound he lash madly out with he chair but he eyesight happily fail he and he swashing blow come down upon the corner of the table with a crash which break it into fragment then with a mad bellow of rage he spring upon savary tear he down to the ground and have he hand upon he chin before gerard and i could seize he by the arm we be three strong man but he be as strong as all of we put together for again and again he shake himself free and again and again we get we grip upon he once more but he be lose blood fast every instant he huge strength ebb away with a supreme effort he stagger to he foot the three of we hang on to he like hound on to a bear then with a shout of rage and despair which thunder through the whole castle he knee give way under he and he fall in a huge inert heap upon the floor he black beard bristle up towards the ceiling we all stand pant round ready to spring upon he if he should move but it be over he be dead savary deadly pale be lean with he hand to he side against the table it be not for nothing that those mighty arm have be throw round he ' i feel as if i have be hug by a bear ' say he ` well there be one dangerous man the less in france and the emperor have lose one of he enemy and yet he be a brave man too ' ` what a soldier he would have make ' say gerard thoughtfully ` what a quartermaster for the hussar of bercheny he must have be a very foolish person to set he will against that of the emperor ' i have seat myself sick and daze upon the settee for scene of bloodshed be new to I then and this one have be enough to shock the most hardened savary give we all a little cognac from he flask and then tear down one of the curtain he lay it over the terrible figure of my uncle bernac ` we can do nothing here ' say he ' i must get back and report to the emperor as soon as possible but all these papers of bernac 's must be seize for many of they bear upon this and other conspiracy ' as he speak he gather together a number of document which be scatter about the table -- among the other a letter which lay before he upon the desk and which he have apparently just finish at the time of toussac 's irruption ` hullo what be this ' say savary glancing over it ' i fancy that we friend bernac be a dangerous man also my dear catulle -- i beg of you to send I by the very first mail another phial of the same tasteless essence which you send three year ago i mean the almond decoction which leave no trace i have particular reason for want it in the course of next week so i implore you not to delay you may rely upon my interest with the emperor whenever you have occasion to demand it ' ` address to a chemist in amien ' say savary turn over the letter ' a poisoner then on the top of he other virtue i wonder for whom this essence of almond which leave no trace be intend ' ' i wonder ' say i after all he be my uncle and he be dead so why should i say further chapter xvii the end general savary ride straight to pont de briques to report to the emperor while gerard return with I to my lodgings to share a bottle of wine i have expect to find my cousin sibylle there but to my surprise there be no sign of she nor have she leave any word to tell we whither she have go it be just after daybreak in the morning when i wake to find a equerry of the emperor with he hand upon my shoulder ` the emperor desire to see you monsieur de laval ' say he ` where ' ` at the pont de brique ' i know that promptitude be the first requisite for those who hope to advance themselves in he service in ten minute i be in the saddle and in half a hour i be at the chateau i be conduct upstairs to a room in which be the emperor and josephine she recline upon a sofa in a charming dressing-gown of pink and lace he stride about in he energetic fashion dress in the curious costume which he assume before he official hour have begin -- a white sleeping suit red turkish slipper and a white bandanna handkerchief tie round he head the whole give he the appearance of a west indian planter from the strong smell of eau-de-cologne i judge that he have just come from he bath he be in the best of humor and she as usual reflect he so that they be two smile face which be turn upon I as i be announce it be hard to believe that it be this man with the kindly expression and the genial eye who have come like a east wind into the reception-room the other night and leave a trail of wet cheek and downcast face wherever he have pass ` you have make a excellent debut as aide-de-camp ' say he ` savary have tell I all that have occur and nothing could have be better arrange i have not time to think of such thing myself but my wife will sleep more soundly now that she know that this toussac be out of the way ' ` yes yes he be a terrible man ' cry the empress ` so be that george cadoudal they be both terrible man ' ' i have my star josephine ' say napoleon pat she upon the head ' i see my own career lie before I and i know exactly what i be destine to do nothing can harm I until my work be accomplish the arab be believer in fate and the arab be in the right ' ` then why should you plan napoleon if everything be to be decide by fate ' ` because it be fate that i should plan you little stupid do not you see that that be part of fate also that i should have a brain which be capable of plan i be always build behind a scaffolding and no one can see what i be build until i have finish i never look forward for less than two year and i have be busy all morning monsieur de laval in plan out the event which will occur in the autumn and winter of 1807 by the way that good-looking cousin of yours appear to have manage this affair very cleverly she be a very fine girl to be waste upon such a creature as the lucien lesage who have be scream for mercy for a week past do you not think that it be a great pity ' i acknowledge that i do ` it be always so with woman -- ideologist dreamer carry away by whim and imagining they be like the eastern who can not conceive that a man be a fine soldier unless he have a formidable presence i could not get the egyptian to believe that i be a greater general than kleber because he have the body of a porter and the head of a hair-dresser so it be with this poor creature lesage who will be make a hero by woman because he have a oval face and the eye of a calf do you imagine that if she be to see he in he true color it would turn she against he ' ' i be convince of it sire from the

possible for I to change ' ` indeed ' say the emperor coldly ` if you persist in such a resolution you can not expect to retain you place in my household ' here be the whole structure which my ambition have plan out crumble hopelessly about my ear and yet what be there for I to do ` it be the bitterest moment of my life sire ' say i ` and yet i must be true to the promise which i have give if i have to be a beggar by the roadside i shall none the less marry eugenie de choiseul or no one ' the empress have rise and have approach the window ` well at least before you make up you mind monsieur de laval ' say she ' i should certainly take a look at this lady-in-waiting of mine whom you refuse with such indignation ' with a quick rasping of ring she draw back the curtain of the second window a woman be stand in the recess she take a step forward into the room and then -- and then with a cry and a spring my arm be round she and hers round I and i be stand like a man in a dream look down into the sweet laughing eye of my eugenie it be not until i have kiss she and kiss she again upon she lip she cheek she hair that i could persuade myself that she be indeed really there ` let we leave they ' say the voice of the empress behind I ` come napoleon it make I sad it remind I too much of the old day in the rue chautereine ' so there be a end of my little romance for the emperor 's plan be as usual carry out and we be marry upon the Thursday as he have say that long and all-powerful arm have pluck she out from the kentish town and have bring she across the channel in order to make sure of my allegiance and to strengthen the court by the presence of a de choiseul as to my cousin sibylle it shall be write some day how she marry the gallant lieutenant gerard many year afterwards when he have become the chief of a brigade and one of the most note cavalry leader in all the army of france some day also i may tell how i come back into my rightful inheritance of grosboi which be still darken to I by the thought of that terrible uncle of mine and of what happen that night when toussac stand at bay in the library but enough of I and of my small fortune you have already hear more of they perhaps than you care for as to the emperor some faint shadow of whom i have try in these page to raise before you you have hear from history how despairing of gain command of the channel and fear to attempt a invasion which might be cut off from behind he abandon the camp of boulogne you have hear also how with this very army which be mean for england he strike down austrium and russium in one year and prussium in the next from the day that i enter he service until that on which he sail forth over the atlantic never to return i have faithfully share he fortune rise with he star and sink with it also and yet as i look back at my old master i find it very difficult to say if he be a very good man or a very bad one i only know that he be a very great one and that the thing in which he deal be also so great that it be impossible to judge he by any ordinary standard let he rest silently then in he great red tomb at the invalide for the workman 's work be do and the mighty hand which mould france and trace the line of modern europe have crumble into dust the fate have use he and the fate have throw he away but still it live the memory of the little man in the gray coat and still it move the thought and action of man some have write to praise and some to blame but for my own part i have try to do neither one nor the other but only to tell the impression which he make upon I in those far-off day when the army of england lay at boulogne and i come back once more to my castle of grosboi the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of uncle bernac by
