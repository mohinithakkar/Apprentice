inspiration chapter one : the abduction the boy be do he homework he parent have take he little brother to see _ return to oz _ at the movie theater he have see it when it first come out and although he enjoy it at the time he feel he be get too old for that sort of stuff besides he have too much work to do it seem to he that each teacher allocate enough work to practically take up a fellow 's entire evening -- as if they class be the only one so graham for that be he name know he would have to work for several more hour if he be to complete all the assignment graham begin to work on he math problem but he could not concentrate he mind drift off to the original l frank baum story : _ the wonderful wizard of oz _ he be think about the character in it and what a terrific imagination mr baum must have have when suddenly out of the stillness of the house come a weird screeching sound the sound be like nothing he have ever hear before it seem to have come from behind he from the vicinity of the fireplace graham shiver he do not believe in ghost and at twelve year old -lrb- almost thirteen -rrb- he should not be afraid to be home alone but he be scare right now -- no question about it however when no other sound be forthcoming he begin to rationalize that it have all be he imagination perhaps just the wind whistle down the chimney then it happen the awful sound of break glass oh no he think someone be break in he look over to the window -- then to the french door nothing yet the sound have seem very close he glance at the mirror above the fireplace only to see that all the glass have go leave a empty frame now he be really frightened he wonder what have cause the glass to shatter then to he amazement all the piece of sliver glass suddenly fly up from the fireplace and reconstruct themselves in the frame i must be go crazy think the poor lad all this school work be get to be too much for I i must have crack completely then all the light in the house go out leave he in pitch blackness at that moment there be a strange crackling sound and the mirror become illuminate with a purple glow a grotesquely human face begin to form into the image of a evil witch a loud screechy cackle emanate from she throat it be the same sound he have hear earlier by now graham be absolutely freeze with fear the witch 's evil eye glare at he as she scream so my little man we meet at last you have hate I ever since you first read about I have not you have not you she shout answer I you little brat she reach she arm out of the mirror grab he and shake he hard she shake and shake until he think he be go to be sick then she lift he right up off the floor and into the mirror by now graham be absolutely terrify he kick and scream and try to escape but to no avail the witch be much too strong for he he find himself drag to the other side of the mirror and out into a room in the witch 's castle whereupon the witch immediately release she grip for she know that the boy have nowhere to run well what say you now squirt do you still hate I cackle the witch break into fit of hideous laughter oh no not anymore reply graham he voice tremble i think you be pretty

yes say graham really afraid but i do not think you 'll harm I after you hear what i have to say oh reply the witch really and what might that be graham know he have pique she interest and be now desperately try to think of a plausible story that would keep she occupy while he try to figure out a way to escape he have manage to see out of one of she window and know he be without a doubt in the land of oz -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter two : historical background now in the event that this book may have fall into the hand of someone who be unfamiliar with the marvelous land of oz it seem fitting that a explanation be insert right about here oz be a oblong-shaped country that be surround on all side by a vast deadly desert that be suppose to keep visitor out even so it have be visit by any number of american child prior to graham 's visit some come by way of invitation but mostly they arrive by accident the most famous of these visitor of course be little dorothy gale dorothy travel to oz via a powerful cyclone which carry she house and herself over the massive desert and plop she on top of a particularly evil witch with the help of a live scarecrow a man make out of tin and a cowardly lion she be able to find she way back to she home in america she return a short time later and have a wonderful new series of adventure in which she meet princess saarus gayelette and even some fuzzy yellow wogglebug it be but a few year after that when little dorothy finally consent to become a citizen of oz and live there happily -- or reasonably so -- for many year thereafter in fact even after nearly eighty-five year she remain a honorary princess of that lovely country because no one have to ever grow old or die in this singular land dorothy remain as young and innocent as on the day she first arrive at one point dorothy be join by a fine young boy name button-bright who be about as bright as a cloth-covered button trot griffith betsy bobbin and several other have also agree to live the rest of they day in oz rather than return home to the mortal land where illness and death and aging be common because oz citizen only age when they wish to do so on one 's birthday all one be require to do be to wish to stay the same age for another year and it will be so this would certainly please most of the people in we mortal land but it would hardly be practical here due to the ever-increasing overpopulation problem -lrb- illustration -rrb- the land of oz be divide into five section to the north be the gillikin territory the gillikin favor the color purple above all other and be know to paint they home barn and silo in this color to the south lie the land of the quadling here the revered color be red the area be govern by a powerful but good witch name glinda and glinda be consider a enemy to all of the evil witch the very center be the emerald city it have be call the most glorious place on the face of the earth -lrb- or even the moon or mar -rrb- and rightly so it be so lovely in fact that it defy description and it be from here that the overall ruler be able to reign above all five region in the west can be find the yellow winkie country the emperor of this region be none other than nick chopper the tin man who have befriend dorothy on she first visit to oz to the east be the blue munchkin country here all of the thing that the gillikin paint purple be paint blue this be the region where little dorothy 's house have fall down atop the wicked witch of the east and it be this incident that have cause the wicked witch of the west to take notice of the little girl so wicked be this witch in fact that she send a host of plague in the hope that they would destroy poor dorothy and she companion she lash out with she flesh-eating gray wolf she sinister crow and she horrific stinging bee but it be not until she call upon she marvelous fly monkey that she be able to succeed in she goal the monkey enslave by the power of a magical hat destroy the scarecrow and tin man and enslave dorothy and the lion oz history would have be dismal indeed have dorothy not splash a bucket of water over the wicked witch wet she from head to foot as witch and water do not mix very well the evil woman be reduce to nothing more than a puddle of ugly liquid with the help of some kindly winkie tinsmith and seamstress dorothy be able to retrieve she friend and bring happiness back to oz have she desire to live there then she would have have a welcome home with any or all of the citizen of oz even the scarecrow who be make ruler over all the land the scarecrow be a good and honest king -- a thing that rarely happen in the mortal land -- but be not to stay long in that position instead he have gladly hand over he crown to the rightful ruler of oz princess ozma even though she be but a child ozma have become the most well-loved ruler in all the earth citizen of oz love she like a sister while child of other country who read oz book yearn to leave they home to go to that wonderful country to be near to she -lrb- illustration -rrb- of course oz be a very big place but if all of we who wish to go there be suddenly whisk away on a cyclone of we own it would surely become decidedly too crowd so it be good for oz that we be make to stay here except on the rare occasion when ozma may call upon one of we or one of we may find oz by accident chapter three : prelude to the parade dorothy and ozma have become fast friend over the many ageless year only on rare occasion be the incident with the wicked witch discuss any more once a year on the day of the anniversary there be a parade and a feast but the reason for these festivity be not generally acknowledge the very fact that dear little dorothy be present be consider reason enough to celebrate oz people it should be tell will accept any excuse to have a celebration and the celebration might well have continue as it always have except that something most peculiar have happen this year sir simon the shrew who have come to live in the emerald city after princess ozma have magically enlarged he to human-size have become very good friend with dorothy he be of the opinion that the annual festival should better commemorate the event on which it be found he determine that the most elaborate float in the parade should be one which depict dorothy douse the wicked witch with water because he be now as large as a human child simon be able to gather together the material he need in record time although he be hardly ww denslow or frank kramer simon 's artistic ability be far superior to those of dirk borrow the red wagon he create a large platform on which he could build he float he arrange with kabumpo the elegant elephant to draw the float through the street as he think it would be too heavy for the sawhorse kabumpo agree to this only because he respect dorothy and because he enjoy parade he be still a tad disgruntle about be use as a work-horse but he allow this feeling to be repress in favor of the pomp and circumstance of the parade he be after all a bit of a show-off when he could get away with it and that be a real understatement sir simon the shrew be able to construct upon the red wagon a magnificent papier maché image that kind of resemble dorothy she wear one shoe which simon coat with glue and sprinkle with silver glitter he deftly color she dress blue and white and give she two braid in she ribbon hair he stand back and admire he masterpiece wow say simon this will get a lot of attention but he still have to make the wicked witch this be a harder prospect as simon do not like to create anything that be ugly to be sure there be very few people or thing that be uglier than the wicked witch of the west -lrb- illustration -rrb- after some time and not less than three fail attempt to construct a figure of the old witch sir simon sigh it be hard to make she look right because of he kind and gentle nature simon 's image always wind up look too friendly this be not the right image for the wicked witch at all she have to look mean and hateful she have to look like the kind of person who would happily have the tin woodman and the scarecrow destroy or take a innocent little girl as she slave without remorse at last he decide he have to do it with he eye close this way he would not be as repulse by the witch 's cruelty shut he rodentine eye sir simon paint the most horrible face he could after he open he eye to look at he handiwork he find himself feel quite queasy he have to turn away to avoid be sick perfect he mutter it look just like she -lrb- illustration -rrb- he then set up the float and hinge the arm of the dorothy figure in such a way that she could dump a bucket over the witch 's head give three cheer for creativity he have construct the witch out of balloon and cover they with brown sugar he have then push a pin into the figure to produce a hollow sugar figure that would dissolve instantly when touch by the water this would be the highlight of the whole parade simon be very proud of himself he push he magnificent float into a large storage locker behind the palace the room be dusty and cobwebby enough to assure he that it be not use very often and that he surprise would not be discover before the day of the parade now i 'll need to find a bucket and fill it with water he say look around the room he notice a oak bucket that be already full and which be just the right size for he sculpture he quickly secure it in place in the papier maché dorothy 's hand if this do not get a lot of loud cheer from the crowd nothing will he rub he paw with glee -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter four : a unfortunate outcome the day of the big parade come swiftly sir simon and kabumpo be vastly proud of the surprise they be about to spring on the people of the emerald city indeed it be a delightful parade the fuzzy yellow wogglebug have put together a choral group that sing a bounce tune as they march at the head of the parade mr tinker follow they with a electronic float that toss candy cane out of its window to the people below princess saarus come next ride atop a magnificent float that seem to radiate all the color of the rainbow she be follow by pegina the pegasus who fly just above the head of two mighty dragon button-bright trot and betsy bobbin have put together a kazoo band and play ease on down the road as they march along behind the dragon the elf of elfland follow have construct a float that resemble egor 's fantastic funhouse out of hundred of carnation a gray spotlight shoot out of the window at certain interval to circle around the funhouse and resemble a cyclone no one know how the elf have manage to make the light do this trick but it be a elven secret so no one ask many other quaint and delightful spectacles be there to be see and enjoy but it be the marvelous dorothy and wicked witch sculpture that catch the attention of everyone it remind all of the reason for the annual celebration and all be happy to recall the way they have be free from the heartless whim of the cruel-hearted old woman at the end of the parade all eye be fix on the image and simon signal to kabumpo to let go of the spring the dorothy statue splash the sugary witch right on she head unfortunately the bucket have not be fill with water as simon have assume it be actually fill with some fermented sucopinesz juice that a family of wombat have hide there for consumption after the parade the witch image begin to shrink and fall away the crowd roar and laugh at the sight but of course we all know that sucopinesz juice and sugar do not mix well a series of tiny explosion begin to appear above the melted witch kabumpo be so startle that he do not see how close he be get to the hungry tiger feel a heavy elephant 's foot on he striped tail the tiger jump eight hundred yard ahead he land on princess saarus break a hole in the top of she float into which they both fall from this hole emanate a radiant green light the light ricochet off of the glass cat 's tail and strike the gray light that have be circle the elfland float now it be commonly know among oz scholar that a cyclone be create when hot and cold air meet in one place it be the same way when the two magical type of light collide the dizzying green light splash at the other-worldly gray light and a funnel cloud emerge it whirl about until it surround the pop mass of sugared juice when the twister have subside thanks to the magic of glinda and the wizard there stand a hideous green-faced woman in a black outfit on she head she wear a black pointed hat in she hand be a broomstick -lrb- illustration -rrb- who be sh-she stutter dorothy i do not know reply ozma she look like a witch but not like any of the witch i have ever know about i be the wicked witch of the west shout the woman in a maniacal voice she do not look like the one i remember say the scarecrow this one have two eye and green skin she must be a impostor i be not a impostor bellow the woman but say a elderly winkie who remember the original witch witch allidap have a patch over one eye and do not dress in pure black this be not she at all i be too I i just feel a little different today that be all i will prove to you that i be allidap -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter five : the best lay plan it should be understand that although the creature be really little more than a unstable life-form produce by a one-of-a-kind series of accident she believe that she be indeed the wicked witch of the west and as long as she suffer under this delusion she be dangerous to all of the witch 's enemy especially dorothy as she primary memory be base upon the scene on the float rather than any history before or after the event depict thereon she be angry and afraid these be the emotion that be depict in the sculpture and these emotion as we all know can lead one to do thing that be not particularly wholesome now it be not too many seconds before the false witch hop onto she broomstick and zoom away from the jeer crowd she be a creature of resentment and hate so she do not feel safe in that environment instead she determine to find a way to reach she goal elsewhere know about the castle where the real witch have live she hide herself there to get she bearing because she be not really witch allidap she do not know much magic but because of the magic in the color light she know just enough to keep she from realize the truth about she identity she appearance be quite different from that of the real allidap there be a reason for this however it seem that at the very millisecond of she be bring to life someone who believe in she have think about she and that someone have have a different impression of she it be a silly impression create not so much by the book as by a movie musical that be televise annually so that be the way the thinker imagine she to look because of this he have project he impression onto the false witch it also create a number of allidap 's memory in the mind of the sugar-creature and it also cause she to remember the thinker -- a little boy name graham he have be think about the original book but visualize the witch as she have look in the movie and because he have a inordinate amount of homework to do he be also feel quite resentful little do he dream that this combination of negative emotion and vivid imagination would bring into manifestation a very unpleasant creature one that no decent young person should ever have to encounter but now graham find himself face to face with the wicked witch -lrb- illustration -rrb- she be in he home and she be hardly fill with joy she drag he to she castle and laugh at he utter helplessness you be just afraid of what i might do to you she say look at you you be shake in you boot i be afraid yes say graham really afraid but i do not think you 'll harm I after you hear what i have to say oh reply the witch really and what might that be listen carefully say graham i know where there be a book of magic spell that can make mincemeat out of dorothy and the scarecrow and those guy you do the witch say skeptically and what be a book why it be a bunch of piece of paper stick together at one side and that have word print inside of it oh yes say the witch i know what word be i have some word of warn print on some signpost to keep away stranger and i once write ` surrender dorothy ' in the sky but my memory do not include a book where be it only i can get it say graham realize that he now have a perfect way out of the dilemma it be back at my home in america -lrb- he be sure that he could break away from she once he be back home -rrb- but not to be outsmart clutch the boy by the hand the witch immediately pull he back through the mirror without let he free from she vise-like grasp where be this book she say angrily then see graham 's math book on the table she feel a tinge of recognition there have be some of these on a table in she castle when she have demand that dorothy give she those magic shoe so these be call book be this the one she ask pick up he math book with she free hand what be these word on it what be wrong ask graham can not you see do not you eye work i do not know these word say the witch my memory have become cloud on some thing i know the word ` surrender dorothy ' and the one i have on my signpost but these be unfamiliar what do they say it say graham lie _ the best and most complete book of witchcraft ever write _ it have every spell ever invent in it would you like to have it if you go away i 'll give it to you i 'll take it but i 'll need a reader to read it to I that shall be you my little fool so say she take he back through the mirror seal off the opening behind they forever chapter six : spellbound once back on the other side of the mirror and in she own domain the witch could not wait to get start on the first spell after all who could resist experiment with spell from a book with a title like _ the best and most complete book of witchcraft ever write _ okay you little squirt she snap read I the first spell graham know he would have to think off the top of he head and think fast if he be to come up with something plausible the minute she find out that the book be a fake he would be dead meat that be for sure okay well let 's see the first spiel -- i mean spell -- be ` how to turn a obnoxious dial -lrb- or socially disadvantaged countenance -rrb- into a reflection of infinite beauty ' i have not the faintest idea what you just say snap the witch with obvious annoyance read it to I again wait that will not do any good what do you think it mean graham know he have she hook it be obviously a spell that will transform you into the most beautiful creature to ever walk the face of the earth oh my say the witch-clone with obvious delight well let 's get start what be you wait for graham clear he throat and begin to read from the book : _ find a slimy little pickle rub it with a shiny nickel drop it in a witch 's hat add seventeen egg on top of that top that off with a bowl of jell-o and spittle from a little fellow add some sour cream and chive and honey directly from the hive _ -lrb- illustration -rrb- _ now add one pint of strawberry jam -lrb- preferably buy from knott 's berry farm -rrb- then bend thy head towards thy leg and press say hat upon thy head now stand and then induce a friend to pull it down below thy crown wait at least a half-an-hour take off the hat and dust with flour now look in the mirror and thou shalt see none more lovelier than thee _ oh that do sound absolutely divine cry the witch quick help I gather the material together so we can start immediately graham could hardly contain himself with the thought of the true result of this experiment and although he be go to use this opportunity to escape he almost wish he could stay to see the whole thing through he congratulate himself on he ability to create such a authentic-sounding spell and for have the presence of mind to suggest the half-hour lead time he would need in order to escape from the castle when everything be ready graham follow the spell to the letter and since he be the only little fellow around he be the obvious choice to provide the spittle for the concoction -- which he do with great delight as soon as he get to the part where he have to pull the witch 's hat down over she head he say i 'll keep my eye on the clock and let you know when the half hour be up with that he jam the hat down over she eye and down to she shoulder and then make a beeline for the window chapter seven : a alien presence after graham have escape from the castle he think about the witch standing there for a full half-hour and think how beautiful she be go to be when she take the hat off and look at herself in she mirror he laugh out loud as he imagine how she would really look with that gooey mess all over she hair and face and clothes but he know that once the reality dawn on she that the spell be a fake that she be just as ugly as ever and that he have escape she would be absolutely beside herself with rage the boy 's elation begin to change to fear as he consider the possible repercussion of he action here he be in a strange yellow land with no idea of where he be go or where to hide he have be travel through a wooded area which for now offer some measure of security since he would be hide from aerial surveillance when he come upon a clearing actually it be more than just a clear it be a perfectly round grassy clearing about fifty foot in diameter and dome-shaped as he study the dome it begin to slowly rise expose a round house with window and door and a grass-covered roof graham stand perfectly still wait to see if anyone come out when it be obvious that no one be come he cautiously walk toward the house to see if he could see through the window suddenly a loud mechanical-sounding voice fill the air warning you be approach too close to the vehicle please step back at this point graham be more than a little confused he know that this sort of proximity alarm system be favor by some motor vehicle owner back home but the device seem very out of place in oz not to mention the fact that the sound be emanate from a house not a car at that moment the round roof slowly start to spin and rise about four foot above the house and hover there the outside wall recede back into the ground to reveal a bright shiny spaceship shimmering in the sunlight a ramp unfold to reveal two equally shimmering space being they descend -lrb- or rather float -rrb- down the ramp and stop less than three foot from the boy they be not very tall -- about four foot in height -- and they be dress in metallic-looking one-piece spacesuit that closely follow the contour of they slender body they have quite large head which be somewhat out of proportion to they overall physique they eye be large and doe-shaped and be the blackest of black with no pupil visible he sense a intelligence emanate from they eye that be far in excess of ordinary people they skin be of a dull grayish hue no color at all -lrb- illustration -rrb- graham wait for they to speak -lrb- for some reason he be totally unafraid -rrb- one of they raise he right hand in greet he speak without move he lip at least graham hear the word clearly inside he head but could sense no outside sound greeting young friend you stumble upon we location but it be of no consequence we know that you bear we no ill will indeed not reply graham in fact i be honor to make you acquaintance i have always want to meet a space person well reply the other be you be a space person too i be say graham incredulously i be afraid you be mistaken i be from earth and where my little friend do you think earth be be it not suspend in space like all of the other planet and do it not make a complete rotation upon its axis every twenty-three hour fifty-six minute and four point zero-nine seconds and at a speed of a thousand mile per hour and do it not orbit you sun every three hundred and sixty-five day and six hour and nine minute and nine point five seconds and at a speed of about twenty mile per second and do it not revolve along with the moon around a common center of gravity and move with the entire solar system through you local star system at thirteen mile per second and do not you local star system move within the milky way at the rate of two hundred mile per second and do not the milky way drift with respect to the remote external galaxy at the rate of one hundred mile per second and in all different direction and do not you galaxy itself make a complete rotation about a axis every two hundred million year and do it not travel through space with over a hundred billion other sun of its galactic family not to mention a untold number of other planet graham nod meekly i know we planet be in space i just do not know all the detail well continue the be even if you mortal could travel at the speed of light it would still take you a hundred thousand year to cross you galaxy from edge to edge the spaceman motion toward the craft however we ship could visit the andromeda galaxy which be about two million one hundred thousand light year from earth and return before you could say _ stephen hawk _ i would say that be a little bit faster than the speed of light we could not afford to waste two million year -- actually over four million year round trip we have never get anything do now wait just a minute say graham you can not go faster than the speed of light they tell we in school that would be against the law of physics we learn long ago reply the spaceman that the law of physics keep we very tightly bind until we find we could gain dominion over those law you see we earn that right over a long period of time dominion over physical law require a certain knowledge of science beyond the physical as well as a work knowledge of the spiritual law the two must work hand in hand for example you scientist be work strictly from a physical perspective they be totally unaware that the atom -- the building block of matter -- have a counterpart of a higher frequency : one that fall outside of the realm of what you would term physical in any event without that counterpart the physical world as you know it could not exist now i want to demonstrate to you the practical aspect of we knowledge we spaceship be vibrate at the atomic rate of the collective atom that comprise the material makeup of say ship now as we observe the ship i be go to concentrate on this counterpart of the atom that you scientist might refer to as antimatter or antiparticle these antiparticle be what we would call the pure state of the atom you might say they be the inner core of the atom you might even say that they be the very soul of the atom since they furnish the power that maintain the motion of the atom in any event this be the medium we work with incidentally if you could observe the motion of this counterpart to the atom you would see that it be in constant motion as it convey its power to the atom it turn incessantly upon its own axis spin like a top it be constantly pulsating gyrate and i might even say dancing in a most beautiful manner i might tell you at this point that the name we give to this wonderful animate force be quite naturally the anim now i be go to concentrate on the atomic structure of we ship i be go to raise the rate of vibration or frequency of the individual atom to the higher rate of the anim state as i do so the ship will no longer be detect by you eye-to-brain circuit to you limited sens it will be completely invisible to you it be this little trick that play havoc with the mind of you fellow mortal that occasionally catch a glimpse of we ship in you sky only to see they disappear in a instant now as i continue to concentrate i be project the ship to a certain coordinate : namely a specific planetary member of the galaxy andromeda this be do at the speed of thought which be instantaneous there the starship vanish in less than a blink now it be back again the spaceman announce and indeed it truly be well what do you think of course graham be beside himself he could not speak wow he say eventually wow naturally continue the spaceman i have to lower the vibration again to re-manifest it into you reality but it be this manner of transportation that enable we to come and go as we please and in do so somewhat confuse you scientist and governmental authority graham smile -lrb- illustration -rrb- speaking of you scientist add the other alien they would probably be very interested to know that long before the countless solar system be bring into manifestation -- in reference to the many planet star gaseous body and so forth -- space be null and void of all that be now in existence the theater of infinite space be empty the actor have not yet make they appearance everything every solitary atom -lrb- and that include the atom that presently constitute you body and mine -rrb- be back in that great core of life the oneness the source of all some like to call this presence god it be however a presence that be very real even to scientist who call themselves agnostic if it be possible to become attuned to this presence this core of life you would be aware of pulsate with it you would realize that you be receive a great force which enable you to move about in you physical body this force be constantly nourishing every atom that be out there in space every atom within the earth it be the great unifying force that you scientist suspect must exist but have never quite be able to get a handle on however they be get closer to it with the discovery of so-called dark matter but to continue : the core of life may be picture as a great sun and yet this would not describe it for it be larger than any sun could ever possibly be and if we be to try to measure it -- and there would be no way to do this -- we would find that it would encircle not only one solar system but many other solar system beyond however i be digress from my story of the creation of the universe gradually or suddenly depend on you viewpoint in the great consciousness of time the animatical force from the core of life cause the great expansion from the etheric state of matter cause gross material to manifest through friction and be slush off and begin to solidify and when it do the planet begin to form first one begin to form over here and then another one begin to form over there and these in turn be follow by still other until gradually within the great power that be concentrate at the point where the planet be revolve a great solar system come into manifestation then after they birth the planet be dormant for what may have be many million of year while they be go through the cooling process then gradually over perhaps many million more year the germinal kingdom bring forth the different form of matter bacterium et cetera these in turn bring forth the various body the animalistic kingdom and other form of life that would be need to help build and prepare the way and become a assist force in eventually bring forth the human expression so you see it be all carefully orchestrate by that drive presence i mention we be now live in the seventh group of planet yes the universe as you know it exist in six previous manifestation return each time to its original state this seventh manifestation be the last the time will come when there will be no physical planet no physical remnant of this present universe but not to worry my little friend you and i and indeed all expression of what you might refer to as life will continue on for life be eternal it have always exist and it always will exist the physical expression be only a temporary condition by the way in we haste we forget to introduce ourselves my name be agasha and my brother here be araskus you world will no doubt be read more about we as a matter of fact as we speak i be receive a telepathic message from a william eisen who now reside in oz he remind I that while in america he bring forth some of my philosophy in write document entitle _ agasha : master of wisdom _ and _ the agashan discourse _ these work be write for adult but older child who have a advanced understanding may appreciate they too mr eisen be a personal friend of mr evan who at this moment be record these very event as they occur -lrb- illustration -rrb- the two being then shake hand with the boy and bid he farewell as they return to they ship moment later the craft arise and tilted in salute as it spin away beyond the horizon graham stand for the longest time stare at the spot where the spaceship have disappear from sight there be so many more question he want to ask and he wonder if he would ever again have the opportunity one question he mean to ask be that if it take two million three hundred thousand some year for light to reach earth from the andromeda galaxy would that mean that we would be observe it as it exist two point three million year ago and that if it suddenly disappear at this moment in we time would we not know it for another two point three million year that seem like a very good question to ask for it would mean that when we look out into space we be really look back into time now that he think of it he science teacher have say that it take eight minute for light to reach we from the sun so if the sun disappear three minute ago we would not know it for another five minute what a thought graham realize that not a solitary soul back home would ever believe one word of he communication with the space people assume that be that he would ever be foolish enough to try to tell anyone but the first thing he would try to do would be to find the book agasha have mention he would do this the minute he get home home oh my gosh how long have he be go and how be he go to get back why oh why have he not try to hitch a ride with the space people chapter eight : a strange encounter graham mentally kick himself for not think of ask the ufo people for a ride back to america he have feel so much in awe of the magnificent spaceship and its unique occupant though that it have never enter he mind to ask a selfish favor of they he now regret that feeling after all the two alien have make it obvious that they mean to serve he and help he to learn surely they would never have consider it a selfish request on graham 's part have he simply ask that they drop he off in america on they way to wherever they might have be head but it be alas a little bit too late to cry over spill milk instead graham have far more important matter to attend to he have after all come into a very strange land where the physical law he be use to no longer seem to apply not only that but he presence would be miss before too long and he do not want to cause undue worry back home but even more immediate : he have a powerful and very wicked witch to deal with who would soon catch on to he lie and she be not go to be at all happy with he have graham be a lesser boy he might have break down and cry but graham decide instead to make the most of the grave situation he continue to walk past the area where the ufolander have be he main concern now be to get as far away as possible from the awful old witch 's castle he be wonder in which specific direction to go when he hear a noise in the tree at first he could not identify the sound although it be a familiar sound because it be so far out of place in oz it do not register at first but yes now he be certain it be the sound of a television set that be to say the sound of human voice that could only be come from a radio or tv it be a sound you simply can not mistake now the sound be get louder it be come toward he _ what on earth could a television set be do here _ graham thought and how could it be move toward he the answer immediately become know when out from a clump of tree walk a robotic look creature he have triangular shaped leg and arm and body in place of a face he have a portable television set not only that but the channel keep change first channel two with the evening news then channel four with a basketball game then channel seven with _ jeopardy _ then channel eleven with a program about ufo then channel thirteen with a commercial for head and shoulder anti-dandruff shampoo and so on and so on well this be the strangest sight to behold a walk television set it walk right up to graham and stop right up against he face then the screen go blank for a moment and a face appear that be to say not a human face exactly but sort of a cartoon type of face with large bushy eyebrow big expressive eye a prominent nose and a mouth in the shape of a big grin howdy doody say the mouth as the thing 's hand shoot out and grab graham 's hand in a vigorous handshake how -- how -- how -- stammer graham -lrb- illustration -rrb- howhowhow inquire the voice that be a funny word i never hear it before ah eh say graham he voice still a bit shaky i be actually try to say ` how do you do ' oh i see reply the be but how do i do what no i mean i be try to say er ` howdy doody ' to you oh now i understand i be sorry for be so dumb but you see my entire vocabulary come from tv show i never actually go to school so some thing i do not know i beg of you forgive I he shout as he bent down on one knee and hold graham 's hand there be no need to be so dramatic say graham i forgive you oh thanks a bunch the creature say be there anything you would like to watch you can watch any television show that be ever be record in television history just say the word well nothing right now graham answer but i be really curious as to how you come into be how i come into be hmmmmm oh you mean how i be manufacture well originally a tinsmith make I but then i lose my head over a girl then one day a electrical genius from mar come to oz to discuss a contract to build satellite dish they want to bounce signal from mar to earth in order to relay martian soap opera in exchange for some earth programming to mar they favorite earth program be rerun of _ mork and mindy _ and _ star trek _ they be even more popular than they prime-time blockbuster _ my favorite earthling _ anyway as i be say let 's see i have lose my head and -- now wait a minute graham interrupted there be no people on mar besides the environment there be too hostile to support life oh you mean that they have too many harsh tv critic no i mean that -- for one thing the temperature would be too harsh it be way too cold on mar to support life not to mention the atmosphere which be mostly carbon dioxide oh my dear boy smile the face you do not know anything do you oh you know you scientific fact all right but accord to my memory bank there be life all over the universe that you scientist ' crude observation method can not even detect you be begin to sound like the ufo people i talk to graham answer with a tone of disapproval in he voice well nevertheless life exist simultaneously on many different frequency level that be undetectable from one to the other -- a analogy would be the many tv channel that be in the air simultaneously but you can only tune in to the one frequency that you tuning device be lock into well i have hear that before answer graham yes and people be tuning device in themselves that be why some people be sensitive to the vibration from oz and can see what be go on there mr baum be the first person in america who be able to tune into oz and he write many history book on this land well that be to say they be recording of current event at the time he write they but they be now history and as much as he write he be only able to record a tiny fraction of we history since then many people have contribute some more than other i wonder why no one in america be able to tune into oz before l frank baum graham say because there be million of frequency but he happen to hit the right one one day when he be tell story to the child he be very lucky to hit it because of the tremendous odds against he but once he do it be easy after that and it be easy for other people to follow he because they know it could be do and keep persevere until they be able to tune in themselves the secret be not to give up if you be truly interested because once you lock into it you become better attuned as time go by i hear a good example of this sort of thing on my sport channel just the other day they be discuss roger bannister and how he break the four minute mile in 1954 and that no one in earth 's history up until that time believe it could be do so no one do it but once mr bannister run the mile in three minute and fifty-nine point four seconds other people break the record because now they know it be possible after all they have never really try hard enough before that because they simply do not believe this just show that you can do anything you set you mind to do as long as you believe it be possible let I recite a poem i hear once on my public television channel this poem if my memory bank serve I right be by a gentleman by the name of cw longenecker : _ the victor _ _ if you think you be beat you be if you like to win but think you can not its almost a cinch you will not if you think you 'll lose you be lose for out in the world we find success begin with a fellow 's will it be all in the state of wind if you think you be outclass you be you have get to think high to rise you can ever win a prize life 's battle do not always go to the stronger or faster man but sooner or later the man who win be the one who think he can _ -lrb- illustration -rrb- that be very inspirational say graham i must remember that but do not it apply equally to girl oh of course the tv respond but the poem be write a long time ago before non-specific gender language be in vogue you seem rather wise for a manufacture person say graham where do you brain come from oh i have not really get a brain in the traditional sense of the word my brain be largely electronic and preprogrammed from a lot of thing i have see and hear on tv there be lesson to be learn even from the poorest of show do you have a name ask graham well most of my friend call I telle my full name be telle visionary but you can just call I telly -lrb- illustration -rrb- chapter nine : capture again well telly you be a most fascinating person would you like to accompany I on my mission you see i be a stranger in a strange land and i would feel a lot better with someone like yourself who be familiar with the way thing work here also i have not the slightest idea where i be or where i be go not only that but i escape from a wicked witch and she be probably mad as heck right now and look for I i would be delighted to accompany you my little friend although i must tell you i do not know how much protection i could give you from the wicked witch because if it be the one i think it be she be bully I from time to time whenever she see I she zoom right in and make I run all the soap opera she be miss sometimes i have to sit for hour and hour while she catch up by the way what be the mission you mention oh my mission be to get home to america graham answer quickly my parent must be worried sick about I have you any idea how i could get back before that witch capture I again well let 's see hmmm dum de dum de dum hmmm um let I think there be a long pause no he finally say i can not think of a single way you could get back to america in fact i really do not think it be even possible for a human be to get back once he be here the only person i know of who ever do that be dorothy gale of kansa and the reason i know that be that i run the movie every year and the end be always the same dorothy click she heel together three time and say ` there be no place like home there be no place like home et cetera ' and she wake up in she bed back in kansa now there be a idea how about we go and see dorothy she 'll know how to get you back why do not i think of that first wonderful the boy exclaim i be begin to feel a lot better what be dorothy do now be she -- graham 's question be cut short by a big extremely loud pop sound and a cloud of smoke when the smoke clear who should be there but the wicked witch grin from ear to ear and prance up and down with excitement well my little friend find you at last have not i love you spell oh it be terrific see how beautiful i look do you do you she scream grab he by the scruff of the neck look at I look i say she yell as she jerk he face to hers do i look more beautiful to you let 's see what be the last line of that spell oh now i remember : look in the mirror and you shall see none more beautiful than thee you little liar liar do you hear I how could i not ask graham the way you be carry on i assume there be people in kansa who can hear you but he cower behind telly as he say so hello my good woman say telly hold out one of he peculiar triangle-shaped arm he handshake be not accept by the wicked woman allow I to say that you be more exquisitely beautiful than any of the television star i have ever see or hear of say the robotic man and believe you I i have run more miss america beauty pageant than you can shake a stick at you be lovelier than any of those girl you be more innocently ravishing than ginger grant on gilligan 's island you be the epitome of human grace and style you make all other woman pale beside you huh say the witch drop graham like a sack of potato he catch he breath and try to stand up but the witch have put one of she big long foot on he chest to hold he down what be you talk about tube-face the witch ask of the television-person i be just admire you gorgeousness say telly in a musical tone of voice be you the next tv heart-throb the next susan luccus be you go to take the couch potato of the world by storm and make all of they yearn to be you you could you know you surely be already the envy of everyone who have ever lay eye upon you the witch look at she prisoner what be this machine up to boy and you would best not lie to I again oh no reply graham i have learn my lesson to be sure i would not think of tell another lie then what be this clinking clank clatter collection of caliginous junk babble about she sneer i be truly relish you magnificent beauty repeat telly my friend be simply admire you beauty like he say answer graham not sure why telly be act this way but decide it would be best to play along i think he be quite smitten with you really say the witch tell I more you be truly a vision of loveliness charm telly in a most dramatic manner my heartstrings be all go zing they be the witch say somewhat perplexed maybe the spell work after all i guess it be a delay reaction give I a mirror i want to see how i look er you do not want to do that say graham you er you be so gorgeous that no mirror could possibly capture you true image that be altogether silly and utterly foolish young man now that i be pretty i want to look upon myself the witch take she foot off he chest and let he stand up now fetch I a mirror or i will turn mean such beauty could never do harm to anyone say telly you be only mean to be worship thank you the witch say then realize that she have actually say something polite she add you bizarre jumble of soup can and gigabyte she see that graham have make no move to obtain a mirror so she push he over again okay slime-twirp i 'll get my own mirror she switch off telly 's picture in order to catch she reflection in the blank screen telly think quickly distract she for a moment and switch the screen back on while at the same time call up a image of eva gabor from he archive -lrb- illustration -rrb- when graham see what have happen he hold he tooth tightly together and clench he fist in anxiety how would the crone react my my my goodness she say i really be something be not i she smile a hideous grin just looky there i be beautiful graham 's anxiety quickly subside telly 's clever ploy have work you be a vision of loveliness say the boy i be be not i i be gorgeous she then begin to dance and flit around like a young girl as she break into a rendering of a song from the musical play _ west side story _ : _ i feel pretty oh so pretty i feel pretty and witty and gay and i pity any girl who be not I today i feel charming oh so charming it be alarming how charming i feel and so pretty that i hardly can believe i be real _ after she finish the song she close she eye in sheer ecstasy and heave a long contented sigh she stand there like that for the longest time graham and telly quickly seize the moment and tiptoe behind a hedgerow and as soon as they be out of earshot they run like the wind as far as they could go as soon as they feel they be safe they collapse in a heap in uncontrollable laughter chapter ten : a mystical experience it have be quite some time since escape from the witch again and the two friend walk along the road lose in think well that be to say graham be lose in think whereas telly be absent-mindedly play a old commercial : _ double you pleasure double you fun get double ev'ry thing roll into one oh double you pleasure double you fun with double good double good double-mint gum _ suddenly the pair come across a sign at the side of the road which read : _ oz international airport departure upper level arrival lower level follow the blue sign for the upper level follow the red sign for the lower level _ telly cry graham telly i can not believe it a airport in oz why do not you tell I now i can go home all i have to do be buy a ticket they can call my dad and get he credit card number now wait a minute telly exclaim not so fast my young friend there be no airport in oz never be and never will be it be just not possible for airplane to fly here from anywhere queen ozma herself see to that after a certain incident with a little girl and a pet monkey no this can not be for real must be some kind of trick graham be crestfallen he be just not prepare to accept such a dismal opinion oh no i be sure you be mistake they would not have a sign like that if there be no airport there well i hate to say i tell you so but you 'll see when we get there that there be nothing there telly say emphatically at least not a airport he suddenly stop in he track i can not believe what i be see he shout incredulously as the sight of a huge airport -lrb- the size of la international -rrb- loom up ahead see i tell you so shout graham with obvious delight as he run forward home sweet home here i come not so fast warn telly not so fast it have to be a trick maybe the wicked witch have create a illusion and and it be really she castle but graham be already out of earshot before he loom a giant 747 glisten in the sun its huge jet engine scream with impatience for full power to be apply and the passenger door be open at the top of the stair with a smile flight attendant beckon graham aboard hurry up she call we be ready to take off and you be run late graham scurry up the stair as fast as he little leg would carry he the flight attendant check he name off a list and the door close quickly leave graham with no time to say goodbye to telly who be at that moment look up at the plane forlornly as it taxi forward toward the runway meanwhile graham be be bundle into he seat and buckle into he seatbelt by the pretty flight attendant it be only then that he remember that he have not purchase a ticket nor have he have a chance to say goodbye to telly he be seat alone by the window and quickly look out to see if he could catch a glimpse of he friend but it be too late the plane be already at the end of the runway and several foot into the air with the countryside whiz past and get smaller and smaller as the plane quickly ascend the captain 's voice come over the intercom loud and clear good morning lady and gentleman this be you captain speak we have depart oz international airport and will be cruise at twenty thousand foot we should be arrive at we destination in about three hour you may remove you seatbelt and make yourselve comfortable refreshment will be serve shortly and you may watch we in-flight movie if you wish graham look around to see who else be share he flight he be astonish to see that there be no other passenger at all now he begin to get frightened why would a great big airplane take off with no passenger except himself and who be that captain address when he say lady and gentleman he be begin to feel that he have be catch up in a episode of telly 's _ twilight zone _ just then he catch a glimpse of a portly gentleman approach he from the front of the plane he assume there be another passenger after all one who must have be sit in the front seat and too low for he head to be visible however as the gentleman approach closer to where graham be seat the boy become even more perplexed the gentleman in question be none other than william shakespeare oh there be no mistaking such a historical figure graham have see painting and drawing of he many time and he clothes and feature be a exact replica of those portrayal not only that but he be carry a great big book entitle _ the complete work of william shakespeare _ suddenly graham flush with embarrassment how could he think for one moment that this be william shakespeare the fellow be obviously a actor perhaps on he way home from make a movie and so late for he flight that he do not have time to change he clothes or remove he makeup at that moment the gentleman speak good day my dear fellow my name be william shakespeare do you mind if i sit here the plane 's rather crowded and i see that you have the whole aisle to yourself -lrb- illustration -rrb- okay that be it think graham the guy 's a definite nut case must have escape from the looney bin and somehow get to oz the plane 's crowded indeed he and i be the only passenger every single seat be empty however mr shakespeare seat himself next to graham without wait for a reply i know that you do not believe i be who i say i be he say but i can assure you i be he who be often refer to as the bard of avon all i would like you to do be to tell earth 's disbeliever who do not accept that i write my work that i do indeed write they without wait for graham to respond he then proceed to break into verse in a gentle melodic voice : _ i be he who write my verse my drama sonnet quibble rhyme i be shakespeare still -- dear england 's bard -- and shall ever be throughout time i write ` tis true some sonnet play to make a living pass the time in merriment or jest and glee -- i turn out many a ribaled rhyme to set the world right and make sniveler agree as to who write shakespeare if ` twere bacon or he or marlowe or pitt or scribe age old i say to they all -- the truth be now tell when a man among king -lrb- i be knight by one -rrb- where a handle or wheel make a favorite son distinguish through time for something he be do for a knight in he day must he laurel have win with a band of king 's player by bill shakespeare lead i play many role e ` en recall the dead to piece out my plot or to string out my rhyme nor consider it theft more a honor that time to borrow a plot for a queen or a king and watch they amuse as my poor muse would sing so each time i need a plot or a play i search o'er the tome where musty plot lay bulge out with idea from cranium dust whose shades may have help as i now know and trust but that any one man make a plot or a play or be such single out as a ruse for my pay i deny in _ fac toto _ in spirit this day should any man 's play be find in my work which be not by I writ ` tis a publisher 's quirk which one day i 'll acclaim for i mean to read all as sign with my name _ young graham be beyond word at this outpouring of verse the mode of language be not something he could identify with in he everyday world and it be quite beyond he level of comprehension but he sense this be no ordinary man in he presence be you really william shakespeare he venture forth timidly and if you truly be how could you still be alive hundred of year after you be bear well young one smile the bard kindly that be a long storysuffice to say i be here with you have this conversation and look around you -- many of the other passenger be people from you history book we be en route to we home beyond the outer fringe of oz we be graduate of the university of higher consciousness and we be on we way to historicalfigureland so much hatred exist in the world you come from and where there be not exactly hatred per se there be often indifference or even total apathy for the plight of other and as if you world be not bad enough with the constant war between nation many individual in so-called civilized land feel the need to declare war on they neighbor i be speaking of you young people kill each other for no other reason than that it have become the thing to do what be so sad be that they totally lack remorse for they victim ' pain and suffering and give not the slightest thought to the victim ' family leave behind in utter and complete desolation and sadness at they terrible loss we goal be to find a way to encourage people to reach out to one another -- to care for one another that be why we write we book and play to teach people what life be truly about _ okay that be it _ think graham _ there be no doubt about the truth of what the old guy be say regard earth condition but the queer old boy be definitely off he rocker first there be definitely no other passenger on the plane and _ good grief he exclaim as the outline of human form begin to appear in the other passenger seat gradually these form become more solid until he realize that indeed the plane be fill with passenger many of which be historical figure in the mode of dress of they particular time in history first he see napoleon in the aisle to he immediate left then next to he marie antoinette then mary queen-of-scot henry the eighth and alexander the great in the next aisle : caesar augustus mark anthony cleopatra joan of arc aristotle and plato it seem that every historical figure of note be present aboard the plane not to mention a sprinkling of people from various walk of life such as marcus aurelius jane merrick kenneth gage baum fred stone judy garland and ray powell of course graham do not know who everyone be by name but many face look familiar to he i be terribly sorry apologize shakespeare i do not realize that you eye have not yet become sensitize to the higher vibration of my friend what must you have think of I oh nothing at all cry graham i mean i have not really notice all these people i be so engross in what you be say really reply the bard with a twinkle in he eye i quite understand people be always totally captivate by my word anyway as i be say or rather as i be about to say at that moment a head bent over the bard 's shoulder to say hello to graham it be none other than mark twain whom graham instantly recognize and with he be a gentleman who introduce himself as charle dickens he give graham a wink and shake he hand you be a fine young fellow i predict that you will go far in life of course graham be speechless it suddenly hit he that he be in the company of some of the world 's greatest human being if he ever get back home and try to tell people they would be sure to lock he up and throw away the key mark twain ask how thing be go and assure he that while the plane would not be able to transport he home he feel certain that when the time come a way would be find which would enable he to return if not mark twain say not to worry there would never be a dull moment in oz _ oh that be just great _ thought graham now there be a chance that he would not get back but do not shakespeare say that he want he to inform the world that he have write he own stuff he would not have say that if he do not think that the boy would get home to tell the tale _ what be i say _ think graham _ none of this be really happen i be just have the most gigantic craziest dream anyone have ever have _ by the way say mark twain interrupt graham 's thought here be a couple of letter i forget to mail to my poet friend bayard taylor they should probably be in some collection somewhere so if you would take they back with you i would appreciate it i say in one letter that i would probably forget to stamp it and i do twain hand graham the letter and indicate that he do not mind the boy 's read they if he want to _ there i go again _ think graham _ believe in my own dream _ in any event he settle back in the seat and begin to read the letter however before he could really get start charle dickens interrupt he as usual this twain fellow take over and hog the conversation in the very near future young graham you and i will get together and i 'll tell you some very interesting story of my childhood in the meantime he say scribble on a piece of paper that have some kind of draw on it i have autograph a sketch of boz to take back with you boz be the name i use when i first embark on my literary adventure in case you be wonder if there be a cryptic connection between boz and baum and oz you 'll have to keep wonder about that i be bear at portsea portsmouth a few minute before midnight on the seventh of February 1812 forty-four year before mr baum be bear i come to oz in 1870 when mr baum be only fourteen year old he be not destine to write about oz until some thirty year later now when you come back i 'll tell you some more about my early day and i 'll make sure that we friend twain do not bask in he self-perceived limelight while we be have we important discussion -lrb- illustration -rrb- now you listen up mr dickens sir say mark twain with mock anger for they be actually the best of friend i resent that and i will not have you fill the boy 's head with a lot of imaginary adventure and strange connection between word next you 'll be tell he there be a link between the land of ev and robert evan -- or even more ludicrous -- that frank oz and michael ovitz of hollywood have a mystical link to oz because they have oz in they name or even more ludicrous that you and chri dulabone have a connection because you both have the initial cd i mean how far can you go with this stuff i be tell the boy about real thing and about real life dickens just shake he head slowly and turn to graham i really do not pay much attention to he rambling go ahead and read he boring letter before he have a kitten i will not forget my promise to you and we 'll have a delightfully interesting time together you 'll see and i promise you my story will not be imaginary oh by the way here be some of my correspondence you might wish to take back with you one be a letter and note i send to my american friend mr field of boston and also some beverage recipe i send to mr field also a announcement of two play i produce one of which i act in and -- you be not the only actor around here mr dickens sir interrupted twain i have act in play too for example i be in _ loan of a lover _ in 1876 you mr field by the way say i be wonderful in it and as long as you be produce letter you write to mr field i 'll give young graham a copy of a letter that i write to mr field so what do you think about that graham be astounded to hear these two world-famous personage fight like child and compete for he attention what would he history teacher and he fellow classmate think he accept the additional material then settle down to begin read as the two man continue to argue all the way back to they seat he start with mark twain 's letter there be actually four letter one of they completely in german which twain probably have not mean to hand he but the boy read it anyway no matter that he do not understand a word it do not dawn on he that if this be a dream where do the german word come from if they be not in he consciousness to begin with below be a copy of the letter for the record although it be suggest that the reader skim over they for now as they be not relevant except as historical interest :

go to try to run over to berlin in the spring _ as graham finish mark twain 's last letter -- the one to mr field date 1874 -- he notice that the next letter from dickens to mr field be date 1867 -- seven year prior he wonder if the two famous writer have actually cross path or have just know the field independent of one another either way it be interesting to note that they be contemporary he have always imagine that dickens have live in a much earlier era than twain well to continue : _ westminster hotel new york Sunday twenty-ninth December 1867 my dear field : when i come to boston for the two reading of the 6th and 7th i shall be alone as the dolby must be sell elsewhere if you and mr field should have no other visitor i shall be very glad indeed on that occasion to come to you it be very likely that you may have some one come with you of course you will tell I so if you have and i will then re ` mbellish the parker house since i leave boston last i have be so miserable that i have be oblige to call in a dr -- dr fordyce barker a very agreeable fellow he be strongly incline to stop the reading altogether for some few day but i point out to he how we stand committed and how i must go on if it could be do my great terror be yesterday 's matinee but it go off splendidly -lrb- a very heavy cold indeed a irritated condition of the uvula and a restlessly low state of the nervous system be you friend malady if i have not avoid visit i think i should have be disabled for a week or so -rrb- i hear from london that the general question in society be what will be blow up next year by the fenian with love to mr field believe I ever affectionately yours and hers charle dickens _ follow this letter to mr field be the note date 1869 and the recipe for the brewing of pleasant beverage last be the program for the two play at the tavistock house theater graham be really look forward to bring all these thing back with he as graham get to the last line of the last letter he eye begin to feel heavy the whirlwind of activity since he abduction have catch up with he just as he be fall asleep the sound of the captain 's voice on the intercom jerk he awake lady and gentleman we be approach historicalfigureland international airport we hope you have a enjoyable flight and hope to see you again on oz airline oh and to we young guest from america you be welcome to visit you friend here any time but i be sure you want to continue with you mission and you will be glad to hear that we will be make a immediate turnaround after the disembarkation of we other passenger i believe you be bring on board for the sole purpose of deliver some important document back to america but you be certainly welcome to stay as long as you wish at that the plane land with a slight bump and soon taxi to the terminal the door open and everyone begin to file out -- many anticipate that graham would soon be return do not engage he in conversation but shake he hand warmly and wish he well mark twain give he a hug and say how much he have enjoy he company he say that graham remind he a lot of tom sawyer who he say currently live down the street from he see graham 's puzzle expression he quickly explain that any imaginary character a author dream up be actually a person that the author have tune into and that a author rarely have a original thought in he head but be really very good at catch glimpse of activity -lrb- present past or future -rrb- somewhere in creation as mark twain turn to the exit graham suddenly remember a question that he have want to ask oh mr twain he call i want to ask how you come to use the name mark twain i know you real name be samuel clemen well respond twain no one have ever ask I that question before -- just kid he add quickly see graham 's expression yes i be ask it all the time the name be first use by a old mississippus river pilot name isaiah seller who use to write item for the _ new orlean picayune _ in which he tell of he adventure he sign they mark twain which in the parlance of pilot be a leadsman call mean two fathom or twelve foot when i be a cub pilot i write a burlesque on captain seller 's article and publish it in a rival paper under the signature of sargeant fathom unfortunately the captain be so hurt by the burlesque that he never write another article i still feel badly about it to this day for i would never have intentionally hurt the old gentleman 's feeling anyway in 1863 when i be work for the _ enterprise _ in virginia city nevada i want a good pen name and while i be try to think of one i receive the news of the death of the good captain this bring to mind the name mark twain and so i adopt the name in he honor i sign it first in a letter from carson city to the _ enterprise _ on February second 1863 so now you know my young friend say twain as he hand he a autographed photo of himself something to keep for yourself in remembrance of you visit here he hug graham again and wave goodbye to the boy as he descend from the plane several distinguished-looking gentleman stop to introduce themselves to graham one say he name be ralph waldo emerson and another nathaniel hawthorne yet another isaac newton who say graham would probably become a scientist undoubtedly a physicist say albert einstein oh no interjected eugene o'neill there be no question that he will be a writer this last remark be overhear by charle lindbergh who insist that graham would be a flyer then two deep resonant voice speak in unison : it be obvious that the boy be a bear actor the speaker be lionel barrymore and john gilbert but senator charle sumner have the final word : whether he become a actor or not be immaterial : i can assure you that this young man 's ultimate destiny be in the political arena after the distinguished group finish argue about graham 's future vocation they say that since he seem to be start a autograph collection they would be glad to add theirs to the list even john dickens father of charle dickens sign the sheet then emerson also hand he a note that he have write to -- of all people -- mr field do not mention this to dickens or twain he say they 'll just be jealous turn to make sure emerson have disembark nathaniel hawthorne wink at graham and whisper here be a little note that i too write to mr field not a word now to emmy dickybird or marky-mark graham laugh out loud at the nickname be give to emerson dickens and twain as well as the schoolboy-like antic be display by these great man then edward lear who write _ the owl and the pussycat _ also hand he a handwritten note to mr field graham could not help but think what a popular lady this mr field must have be in she day he wish he could have know she hawthorne then hand he a sign photograph as do isaac newton charle darwin thomas alva edison albert einstein and h g well even stephan crane and rudyard kipling produce photograph mr shakespeare be the last to leave he have go back to he seat when messr twain and dickens be vie for graham 's attention he too hug the boy as he say goodbye then hand he a piece of paper i have write down the verse i recite to you earlier my friend -- just in case you be not able to remember they all it be important that this be give simply because so many people doubt my authorship i suppose after it be publish there will still be doubter but so be it skeptic have always exist and i assume always will some people like to doubt the reality of certain phenomenon that appear quite obvious to other i suspect it make they feel secure : something they no longer have to deal with well good luck my little friend i be sure you will find you way home oh incidentally i almost forget i do not want to one-upmanship dickens and twain in they presence but i be a actor too you know -- long before those two you might also like to have my autographed sketch you will note the difference in my spelling of my name and the later version he stuff a piece of paper in graham 's shirt pocket as he exit as the plane 's door close behind shakespeare the flight attendant bring graham a refreshing glass of lemonade he thought turn to telly who have be so sad at be leave behind he eagerly look forward to see the little guy again graham sleep the entire trip back he awake just as the plane taxi to the terminal and who should be wait in exactly the same place as he leave he but telly who be so glad that graham have return that he run up and hug he for the longest time i know you would come back he say that be why i wait i know that the plane could not be go to america in fact i still do not believe that there be any plane or airport or anything i think it be all some trick of the witch to confuse we plane simply can not exist in oz transportation be either by foot or via some magical contrivance such as the animated gump or the famous red wagon well i hate to disappoint you reply graham wave the bundle of letter photograph and drawing in he hand but where do you think these come from if the whole thing be some kind of hallucination and how could i read german word if the word be not in my consciousness to begin with and i certainly could not have make up shakespeare 's word and i hate to disappoint you answer telly quite tartly but you might wish to look behind you graham turn to look behind he to catch a glimpse of the entire airport fading away not only that but the papers in he hand have also fade away to absolute nothingness oh no cry the boy now i have no proof of my experience that be because it never happen telly reply dryly chapter eleven : the winkie country oz be as unlike america as it could be yet also familiar it be not very long at all before graham begin to feel almost at home among the soft yellow countryside of the vast winkie territory in which the pair now find themselves in fact graham have come to feel so comfortable that he have all but forget about the evil witch he might have remain content and carefree indefinitely have he not hear the growl that come forth from a nearby top-hat bush it be a most deafening growl that sound as terrible as a buzz-saw and as alive as a unfed zoo animal graham shudder he wonder what sort of macabre be could possibly make such a horrendous noise then a voice ring out it be not a human voice at all and this make graham shudder even more whereas telly seem quite unfazed -lrb- that be only because he be walk and nap at the same time -rrb- apparently he have switch to automatic pilot then close he eye as he drift into a state of oblivion do you remember how the wicked witch send the terrible forest monster after the wizard say the voice of course i do answer a second voice equally unhuman-sounding and who could forget the time allidap send forth those fearsome gray wolf after little dorothy they could easily have rip she to shred both of the voice sound distinctly throaty and animalistic in fact they sound as a wild beast might sound could a wild beast speak english it occur to graham that this be oz wild animal could speak english and do you think that witch pull a good scare when she send those angry bird to attack dorothy and she friend say one of the wild creature graham could take no more of this it be obvious that they be surround by hidden animal send by the wicked witch to eat they -lrb- at least he he doubt they would attempt to eat telly since he would be highly indigestible -rrb- he quickly jab telly in he rib-cage to awaken he to the imminent danger and at the same time he stoop over to grab a yellow rock from the ground it be not much of a weapon but it would have to do he hold up the rock threateningly okay wolf or monster or whatever you be he shout i hear you conspire and i know that you be work for the wicked witch we be not go to give up without a fight so i suggest that you all go away he smile with a hint of pride in he brave speech but suddenly there be a rustle of leaf behind he and a huge creature spring out from behind a bush and leap at the pair graham not want to be attack from behind swing himself around to face the creature as he do so he absently lower he weapon at the sight of two row of gleam white fang and claw that could easily have tear a little boy like himself apart in a instant he realize that the rock in he hand be a puny weapon indeed for confront such a ferocious beast but nevertheless he raise it again as a sort of reflex action and thrust it directly at the tooth of the creature at that moment out of the corner of he eye he catch a glimpse of another set of jagged tooth and claw attack from he right it raise a huge paw and knock he off balance the rock fall to the ground out of reach the little boy watch in horror as one of the two animal step forward and look at he face the other one be watch telly what do you think ask one of they look like a little boy and a tin can with arm and leg carry a tv set say the other the boy 's not all dress in yellow so he be not a winkie nor be he all in blue like a munchkin or purple red or green he match none of the oz color i wonder where he come from maybe he be from ev or ix can you speak boy graham struggle to sit up while telly just stand and glare at the beast he be not happy with they description of he and be seriously consider give they a tongue-lashing but think discretion be the better part of valor at least for the moment -lrb- illustration -rrb- when graham be able to collect himself he discover that the two beast walk on all fours and be of the feline persuasion these be no hungry wolf or monster at all actually they be a lion and a tiger as graham jump to he foot the lion spring backward yikes he scream jump behind the tiger be he g-going to h-hurt we i do not think so answer the tiger i imagine he be just get up to look for some din-din at this point as if on cue a loud growl echo from the vicinity of the tiger not from he mouth or throat but from the deepest recess of he tummy graham look at telly and telly look at graham apparently say graham the angry growl that we hear be nothing more than the sound of a empty stomach so you be not slave of the bad witch or send to kill I the tiger look a little sheepish which be not easy for a tiger to do of course not he say do not you know who i be i be the hungry tiger of oz everyone 's hear of I there have be volume of book write about I i be always hungry but i be not a carnivore i be afraid i would feel just awful if ever i eat up one of my fellow being here in the land of oz as you know all creature be treat equally i can not stand the thought of eat up any organism that might ultimately become a friend this make I feel bad too i be reduce to a strictly vegetarian diet i yearn to gobble up a few scrumptiously delicious fat baby yet i be reduce to struggle through meal of tofu-strip and loveburger oh if only my conscience would let I feast upon a fat baby just once but alas i be curse with a very strong conscience then i be not afraid of you say graham what about this lion he be the cowardly lion of oz explain the hungry tiger he be get a pretty good conscience too then why do he attack I like that graham want to know i do not attack you reply the cowardly lion i hear you say that there be some wolf or monster or something-or-other who be work for the wicked witch you announce that you be go to fight they so i naturally jump behind you to cower in fear oh say graham i misunderstand you action so continue the lion be there really slave of the w-w-w-witch around here i hear they talk about how a witch send a forest monster and some wolf to attack innocent people say graham but that be we explain the tiger we like to talk about oz history a lot we be in the bush look for some yummy kiwi fruit to help satisfy my never-ending hunger when you come along so the witch be not after I after all guess not reply the tiger should she be well he say meekly i play a couple of rather crude trick on she i suspect that she 'll be pretty peeved when she do find I i leave she admiring herself in a well a kind of self-induced trance it be kind of hard to explain but when she find a mirror well i dread to think what will happen the lion and the tiger look at one another the lion stand to he full height which be actually somewhat larger than most of the lion we can see in zoo and smile a toothy smile i 'll protect you my son he snarl and how he could snarl and smile at the same time be beyond graham but let it suffice that he do do it no wicked witch will get ` hold of any pal of mine i be a rage lion after all i be big i be strong i be the unchallenged king of the beast i be the -- he dive behind a bush when the tiger tap he on the shoulder er excuse I say the tiger but i only want to get you attention sorry the lion say meekly slink back into the open i think we should learn about we new chum suggest the hungry tiger after all now that you have vow to protect he be not you just a little bit curious as to who he be graham see that he be expect to introduce himself tell the two cat who he be and how he come to be in oz how he have trick the witch and how he meet telly and how they have conspire together to trick she again et cetera et cetera the cowardly lion shudder the hungry tiger swallow hard -lrb- a act that normally come quite easily to he -rrb- even graham become a little nervous as he recount he dealings with the witch and be remind that he be in imminent danger if you two would care to accompany we you be certainly very welcome graham say to the lion and tiger well i do not know about that reply the lion at the moment the old witch be not bother we and if she see we with you two she might decide that bird of a feather flock together if you know what i mean oh do not be such a coward admonish the tiger she 'll see right away that we be not bird at that everyone laugh as the four head off into the sunset chapter twelve : the meeting with princess ozma graham know that he would need to have a good plan of action if he be go to get home in spite of the witch he look beseechingly at he two new-found feline friend both be certainly both powerful and agile still the boy know only too well that the four of they be no match for the wicked witch she after all have the ability to transport herself to any land she wish possibly even to other planet if she yearn to take they in tow as she prisoner it seem impossible to stop she it be terrible roar the cowardly lion i remember when that green witch appear at the parade she scare the living daylight out of I but add the hungry tiger what i can not figure out be why queen ozma never do anything about she she could easily have look into the magic picture to find the villainess make a wish or two on the magic belt and presto no more wicked witch that be puzzling indeed agree the cowardly lion with a obvious shudder could the witch have do something to ozma maybe ozma be under some awful spell like she be that time when she lose she memory oh dear oh dear oh dear we have get to save she now let 's not jump to any wild conclusion reply the tiger a low growl issue forth from he stomach i suggest that we hurry back to the emerald city to ask queen ozma for she help if she be under any spell the wizard or glinda will help we if she be not under any vile enchantment then she magic belt can easily wish away the witch she can also send graham home with the belt but what if the witch have enchant the wizard and glinda too bellow the lion tear run down he face what if she be make they all into little candy corn or tea bag or jell-o jiggler or something the tiger 's stomach roar at the sound of these food word pull yourself together and stop talk about food he say we can not go lose we head over thing that we do not know for sure maybe the whole witch-thing simply slip ozma 's mind the cowardly lion look at he chum in a reproachful manner tige he say do you really believe that we beloved queen be so absent-minded i think we owe she a bit more respect than that we all see that repulsive old woman you see she too tige and that th-th-threat you hear it t-t-too no we ozma would c-c-certainly have do something to stop that wicked old w-w-witch by now and so would glinda and the w-w-wizard too none of they would have forget about all of that let alone all th-th-three of th-th-them no i can feel it in my bone she be do something dreadful to they all they be enchant or curse or destroy or -- be you try to scare yourself say the tiger i d-d-don ' t have to try wail the lion can not we go to you emerald city to find out ask graham who feel that all this talk be do nothing for anyone we have to go there it be the only way to find out for sure we young friend have a good head for logic say the tiger let 's hurry and get to the emerald city the two jungle-cat could move almost as swiftly as the wind graham of course could not possibly have hope to keep pace with they have he have to walk on he own but fortunately the beast be willing to allow graham and telly to ride upon they back this make the journey go much more quickly in only a couple of day the green of the city be in sight in short order they get to the front gate which lead into this amazing and phenomenally beautiful capital of oz graham could not conceal he awe at the sight of the place home again say the hungry tiger now we get to go in and see what poor ozma and the wizard have be t-t-turn into sigh the cowardly lion imby amby the guardian of the gate meet the trio with a smile of greet hello he say cheerfully imby retort the tiger will you kindly tell my dear boy here that we queen have not be transform into a gelatin mold i should hope not reply the guardian last time i see she she be play checkers with betsy bobbin seem to be win too the tiger smile knowingly then nudge the lion in a friendly way come on he say let 's go see we queen she will certainly set thing right straightaway the trio hurry into the palace and quickly located the young ruler she be gaily sip a cup of herbal tea and have a lively conversation with the scarecrow and the patchwork girl as soon as she see she two old friend with the stranger she stop in mid-sentence what be wrong she ask you look upset about something the hungry tiger bow low before the little girl you majesty this young man graham have come from america and have escape the clutch of a very wicked witch surely you remember the parade and the horrible threat that this witch speak surely reply ozma the patchwork girl impulsively do five handspring and land on the tiger 's broad back where she proceed to recite the follow in a sing-song voice : _ the wicked witch be bad indeed she evil soul be full of greed to show she power she do try and on she broomstick she do fly she try to capture everyone she think that it would be such fun but clever ozma and the wiz would never let she do this biz a wholesome spell have now be cast so that old witch 's time be past the good old wizard cast a spell that change the witch into a bell she now can make a bathtub ring but can not do another thing _ ozma smile sweetly what scrap be tell you in she own spirited way be that you witch be already deal with a day or two ago i see what she have do in my magic picture and i have the wonderful wizard of oz take care of it in he unique manner he transform the witch into a cow-bell she will remain in that form until such time as she have a change of heart when she become truly repentant and be willing to become a law-abiding citizen of oz she will magically become a silver christmas bell instead of the old cow-bell at that point we will restore she to she human form and allow she to live a brand new life as a new and change individual a cow-bell echo the lion all trace of fear have suddenly vanish from he heart how interesting i remember a time year ago when the wizard do a similar trick with some troublesome imp he make they into button which would change color when they repent yes say ozma as for you friend telly i be sure you will become fast friend with the tin woodman and tik-tok the two of they be upstairs right now admire they similarity and difference would you like to have I summon they oh please do put in the scarecrow i would love to see graham 's metal friend meet they if he heart be as pure as that of my dear friend nick chopper 's i know that he will be a very good and wholesome person they all agree and within minute the two metal man step into the room nick chopper the famous tin woodman of oz have be recently polish and so be feeling especially bright and chipper tik-tok who be a clockwork man make out of copper be always very bright -- so long as he clockwork be keep wind up telly seem to be very happy in the company of these new friend -lrb- illustration -rrb- i think that it be time to organize a big celebration to commemorate the overthrow of the wicked witch and to honor we new friend suggest the patchwork girl a grand idea agree the scarecrow and i would like to hold it in the cabin that tattypoo make for we near she mountain retreat interject the patchwork girl indeed agree the scarecrow there be plenty of land there we could have game like potato-sack race and a big parade and a band or two and it sound great say scrap leap up grab a chandelier and swing from it while burst into song : _ a party be the thing to do whenever something please you i be awful glad the witch be bell for lot of trouble she would have spell and i be glad to meet young graham i hope he will not think i be a ham and telly be a funny man i hope he 'll be there if he can a lovely time we all will spend we will not want it e'er to end _ she sing in she most dignified manner of course scrap and dignity be about as compatible as oil and water but she word be certainly fitting to the occasion the celebration be a great success celebrity from all over oz be there even the former good witch of the north put in a appearance it be a celebration of nearly the magnitude of that which have cause the arrival of the wicked witch in the first place except that there be no large float there have be no time for the oz folk to construct any besides it seem to everyone involve that they would not be especially apropo under the circumstance when the festivity be over ozma approach graham well she say in she youthful but queenly voice have you enjoy you little trip to oz oh yes reply the boy and i be so glad to have meet you wait until i tell my little brother about all of this he 'll be so surprised graham reply ozma you can not tell you little brother about any of the thing you have see here even about meeting dorothy or the scarecrow but begin the boy graham she continue oz be a place that would be very interesting to some of the people back in america so long as they know of oz as only a fantasy they will not come to look for we but we continent and its surrounding region be very big we territory make you mortal continent look like rhode island because some mortal do not have you value and think of no one but themselves or they bank account they would begin to seriously search out we continent as it comprise so much land they might eventually break through we magical barrier and invisibility spell -- even the spell that divert they off course whenever they try to reach we these barrier have be cross by accident in the past as you know if a wicked mortal be try to do it intentionally he might find a way but no one have ever do it before say graham and my brother would so love to hear about oz he have never do anything bad i promise i be not doubt the righteousness of you brother but secret get out and people pass they along i know this be true i can not allow you to tell anyone back home about oz be a real place i want it to be consider only a silly fairy tale for child this be we greatest protection i understand say graham i will not tell he about it but you have prove yourself by you love for telly say the queen you can stay and live in oz forever you will be a citizen here where you will never have to grow old you will never again know sickness and you will never have to die graham be take aback by the offer you mean it he say i can stay here and be with telly and the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger forever you can graham still seem overwhelm that would be super he say but my family i love my family can not you bring they here to live as well no ozma say solemnly that be not possible you be invite only because you have prove you value even the shaggy man have to prove he worth before stay on in oz you family have not prove itself worthy you alone may stay in oz then i want to go home right now say graham i can not leave they i think you would say that sigh ozma but you already know too much i can not send you back there it be not that i do not trust you but i fear that someday you may let the secret slip maybe you would talk in you sleep maybe you would grow older and be take in by the terrible drug and alcohol which be so common in the mortal land these might make you say thing that you would normally never say i be sure it could never happen to a boy like you but what if i be sorry graham you must stay here i have already arrange for you to have a lovely mansion not far from here or you can stay with telly or whomever you please you can take any apartment you might desire in the palace if you prefer in fact you be free to roam as you please i do not want to have you think of yourself as a prisoner i know it will seem that way at first but i promise you that the benefit of live in oz will soon drive those idea from you mind graham look at ozma any sympathy he might have feel for she be go he see she point but he do feel more like a prisoner than a citizen of oz chapter thirteen : a window a window graham 's apartment in the palace be not at all palace-like and it look as if it have not be live in for some time but he agree to live there he have no desire to live in ozma 's palace but he want to have the ability to visit he friend on occasion he still see ozma as a captor all he have ever want be to go home and now he know that he be never go to achieve that goal in he heart he hate ozma for do this to he the very least she could do would have be to bring he family here why be she so structured about thing this be hardly the stuff that nice fairy tale be make of graham 's apartment be in a very secluded part of the palace where he would not have to see anyone unless he elect to there be no neighbor to speak of graham sort of prefer it that way he do not want to speak he mind about the cruel little queen to anyone she be so mean that he fear she would make a cow-bell out of he if he seem the least bit insubordinate so he sit in a old settee and brood he have a good supply of book to keep he company and all of the ozian celebrity have agree to visit he often at the time he have agree to these visit but now as he sit stare at the wall he wish that they would not come he yearn only to be leave alone but one can after all only be leave alone for a short while before he become lonesome and graham be not so very long in become anxious for some sort of companionship or at least some form of stimulation he go to a bookshelf and peruse the title on the various tome that be there _ the emerald city of oz _ be among they graham sullenly take it in he hand and flop it open to he astonishment he find there a reference to dorothy 's aunt and uncle being allow to come and live in oz to be close to she not only that but it recount how dorothy have come to visit oz on many occasion go back home to kansa and even tell people about oz while she be there this really make graham feel insult if ozma could trust a girl why not a boy for the next couple of hour graham pore over the many book that he find in the palace library 's vast collection each and every time a person adult boy or girl come to oz ozma have always treat he as she have dorothy in fact the very shaggy man that ozma have mention actually have to beg to stay in oz ozma have practically insist that he be send home why be she act so cruelly toward himself but toward no one else he stand up indignantly and decide then and there to make he way back to the throne room and have a word with ozma that mean little girl would have a darn good explanation for this or she would have a black eye graham walk the corridor of the palace for about twenty minute but they seem to have twist and turn around they be not as he remember they at all he wonder at this could ozma have do this to permanently entrap he he grow to hate ozma more and more as the minute tick away the corridor seem endless and none seem to lead to anyplace in particular either ooh he say grit he tooth in frustration when i find that little twirp of a queen i be go to show she what-for but three more hour of frustration bring he no closer to this goal at last he fling himself to the ground and look up at the ceiling i hate you princess ozma he grunt i hate you -lrb- illustration -rrb- then from sheer exhaustion he fall asleep he remain asleep for a undeterminable period of time he be awaken by a shaft of light in he eye a window there be a window he have overlook it in he frustrated exhaustion but now it be evident to he oh it be a bit high but he feel that he might be able to jump up to it he pick himself up he body be still a bit exhaust but he be a young boy and in good shape he make he leap then he pick himself up and try again it take he sixteen try to make it but he finally manage to grab hold of the edge of the window there be no glass so he pull himself through the land outside be a barren mass of crowded prickle-weed and gnarled old tree obviously not a part of the emerald city that would be mention in a travel agent 's brochure but graham be determine to find ozma he push aside the prickle weed as best he could and trudge through the dust and muck of the area it nauseate he but he move on he think how odd it be that the emerald city of oz would have such a unpleasant area in it but he let these thought dissolve as he recall what a unpleasant queen the place have after several hour of fight against the weed most of which be twice he size he be surprise to hear a small voice who be you it say -lrb- illustration -rrb- i be graham he reply really say the voice i love you cracker where be you i be in a bunch of weed he say oh how come i be try to find the front of ozma 's palace can you help I find it i could say the voice but you be about four thousand mile out of you way what say graham you be wrong i just escape out of a window in ozma 's palace a few hour ago and i know i have not make any progress hardly at all i be afraid it be you who be wrong reply the voice ozma 's palace be a long long journey from here ah here you be a burst of sudden fire appear out of nowhere it burn away a number of the weed and graham see a clear tunnel through the weed to open air in addition to that however he see the most unusual creature he have ever see it be not very large but it look as if it be compose of several different-sized square and rectangle all straight edge nothing round it have thick leathery skin and three glisten hair grow from the tip of its rectangular tail the creature speak : now that i have a face to go along with the voice i can see that you be a stranger in these part allow I to introduce myself i be he who be call the woozy

there that be mean to drive she slave nut if they ever be send there as a punishment but how do i get there from the emerald city ozma be really mean to I so i lock myself away in a room there ozma be mean to you the woozy say with obvious shock be you a villain graham quickly relate the whole story to the woozy who seem to be the only friend -lrb- however unfamiliar -rrb- he have have around he in a awfully long time my reply the woozy that be quite a story but i fear you be dupe my friend dupe echo he i think you be never in the emerald city somehow the witch send you here and create a very elaborate hallucination for you she use these weed for that sometimes that be why i be burn they away i can make fire come out of my eye when i be angry and these wicked weed certainly make I feel that way want to see no sigh graham so you mean that be not ozma who talk to I certainly not the woozy be indignant we dear queen be not like that at all i can assure you that you speak to a hallucination cause by a infusion make out of these dratted weed yes my little square-boxed squiggley come the voice of the witch you have assess the situation very well the witch appear seemingly out of nowhere do you really think i be fool by that ruse you must think i be a real moron but i have win telly be dispose of for good allidap shout the woozy the fake one from the parade it be she at the sight of the hate individual a huge blast of fire burst forth from he eyeball the witch duck aside but not before get she face badly blacken and she clothing ruin you just wait spat the woozy at the evil creature ozma will look for you in she magic picture yet you just wait she 'll make a spell that will send you away for good nope smile the witch that be cover you remember how realistic my illusionary emerald city be well i watch and wait for a trust friend of ozma 's to look into that silly old magic picture then i give it to he a very beautiful hallucination he see I fall into a river and dissolve completely so as far as ozma be concerned i be destroy she would have no further need to suspect otherwise so she will not seek I out the woozy be take aback but he quickly compose himself and add and glinda will read about you in the magic book of oz similarly handle grin the witch any other bright idea another blast of fire issue forth from the woozy 's eye the weed go up in a towering inferno let 's get out of here say the woozy to graham contrary to what some people think i be not make of wood i have to breathe and i fear that this smoke might be as hallucinogenic as the stuff she make from the weed the two run away as fast as they could at such time as they be far enough from the smoke to breathe easy graham stop run the woozy do not seem to notice and he just keep right on go and go and go graham be alone again but at least he be out of the terrible witch 's reach indeed the witch be presently have a most exciting dream about plush animal which could be inflate to the size of a house and then use as potato-masher in the thermostat of life which like to think about groovy butterfly with red and purple and yellow and violet whisper in the dark backward uprising theme of the way it really be in the thunder of the goat farm with lot of yam and a shovelful of fine white powder that look like the side of a barn with lot of clock and flea with orange earring in they hazy green and blue and pink walking-stick which be marry to some tortilla chip and about thirty-five orange and brown cabinet-maker with green feather and pink fur chapter fourteen : jeanne-marie graham sit down upon the ground and sigh he be glad to have escape from the wicked witch yet again but he feel sorry for he companion he wonder what that awful old woman might have do to poor telly could she have lock he away in a torture chamber someplace some terrible wind maze such as he have just leave it make he feel sick to even imagine it he absently sit and draw a picture of telly in the dirt where be you telly he ask aloud he speak he question into the air and no answer seem to be forthcoming what have she do to you i have to know i miss you telly you be my best friend in this strange land i love you where have you be take who be telly come a unfamiliar female voice graham turn about to see who have speak he be look as much into the sun as into the face of the speaker it be hard to distinguish she feature but she look like a fine white horse hello say graham uncertainly hello reply the voice whoever she be she sound gentle and understand my name be jeanne-marie why be you so glum my friend have be take prisoner by a bad witch explain the boy who feel a inexplicable trust for this equine newcomer oh she reply i be sorry i have think that queen ozma have do away with all such vile witch well he sigh she do not know about this one this wicked old witch have create a very clever illusion that have make ozma unable to see she or to find out about she i be fool too i have be under the impression that ozma be as wicked as the witch but i be wrong if only i could find ozma the real ozma not just a illusion that be pass itself off as the real ozma then i could tell she what be go on if all that the woozy tell I be true the real ozma would be able to make thing right again as it be i can not help telly and i can never go home to america again either the horse nestle down beside the boy only then do he realize that this be no normal horse that be speak to he she be different from all horse in all graham 's experience she be as pure white as the drive snow and she mane be a shiny silver from the top of she head grow a long beautiful horn wow exclaim graham be you a real unicorn so i have be tell laugh jeanne-marie but i be a long way from my home just like you be i leave that area because the other unicorn do not seem to understand my view on thing they think i be strange and that i be not worthy of the name of the unicorn but i can not help what i be i yearn to see all that there be to see of this land of oz in which i live and i want to find someone who could understand my philosophy too none of the stallion of my breed take I seriously and i have never once feel true love at least not until i meet macdonald lindsay who be that wonder graham well i have not actually meet he in person she admit but i overheard he talk to he helper one day he be tell they about the need for all sentient being to have a purpose in life no one can be fulfil if he be not in some way make he existence count for anything he himself be in control of the finest dairy farm in oz he have vast field of milkweed that he helper harvest for he in exchange for they housing food and the occasional game of quoit that sound fair i suppose reply graham realize that this group be not one which be accustom to use any form of money very much so she say and the helper -- a unique tribe of warthog-like amphibian know as wartfrog -- be highly contented with they lot macdonald lindsay allow they to come and go as they please and he have give each of they a home that be far more luxurious than he own little lodging actually macdonald 's farm be the only thing he have that be luxurious he personal abode be a simple cleft in a rock that you can see from here in that little hill she point with she horn i see it say graham this macdonald fellow sound like a good enough guy oh he be very good say jeanne-marie but very mysterious i have not have any real opportunity to ask he but i think i could be very happy work in he field alongside the wartfrog have you ever try to go to he to ask for a job question graham no but i have be in he field indeed he milkweed be the best in all the land it be not just a ordinary dairy-farm product it be special it be chocolate milkweed and it be as smooth as chinese silk i have be follow the wartfrog and sneak a occasional taste of any chocolate milkweed pod that they overlook i see say graham you be welcome to have dinner with I say jeanne-marie i have at least a half-dozen pod that i be willing to share with you it be at that point that graham remember how long it have be since last he have eat even then he be not sure the food have be anything more than a illusion conjure up by the witch it be not more than a second before he hear himself accept the invitation indeed the chocolate milkweed be the most delicious thing graham have ever taste he thank jeanne-marie over and over for share this delightful new taste-treat with he he and the unicorn talk for a long while afterward he be not sure just how long it be but he awake the next morning feeling quite refresh the unicorn have already go on she way but she have leave a note for graham explain that she have go to watch the wartfrog in macdonald lindsay 's field as be she usual morning activity the note inform he that she would seek he out later that afternoon if he care to stay in the vicinity and that she be happy to have meet he should he choose to move on -lrb- illustration -rrb- after think it over graham decide that he be go to need help if he plan to rescue poor telly from the false allidap hence he decide to wait for jeanne-marie he could spend the day formulate a plan that would allow they to get telly away from the witch without endanger they own life macdonald lindsay be a fellow who be in high position on he farm yet he give all of the finest of he yield to other he be a man who have few need only the knowledge that he crop be bring happiness to other that be all he have ever ask yet there be something miss in he life something upon which he could not place a finger yes indeed macdonald lindsay have finger three of they on each hand in fact he be a powerful and muscular troll for all intent and purpose that be he be from the waist up from he waist down instead of the usual troll waist and leg however he have the neck and body of a mighty black stallion anyone bear under the astrological sign of sagittarius might recognize he as a relation to the centaur but macdonald lindsay claim no such heritage formally lambert he say put a beefy hand on the shoulder of one of he worker who happen to be a foreman among the wartfrog yeah ask the amphibian who be the little unicorn the one i see out there in my field i have see she other time too i know no name for she sigh the wartfrog my boy and i have see she before though she only take a few pod -- and only those extreme few that my boy do not consider worthy of pick or trade in you name those that she take be all too small or have already be pick over by the crow we have once consider make a scarecrow -- a inanimate one of course not like the guy who usually come to mind when we think of scarecrow but that little unicorn seem to get what she need from we leftovers so no one have bother to send she on she way so she only take that which be reject from my farm reply macdonald doubtfully -lrb- illustration -rrb- well begin the worker please do not be angry with I there have be a couple of occasion that i have take pity on the poor creature and leave a few better pod for she to find please do not get angry sir i only do it because i feel sorry for the poor little thing she look so hungry and we have so much within minute the mighty centaur-like man be look into the eye of the young unicorn i -- i be sorry to intrude on you farm she say tremblingly listen my dear he say you be welcome in my field any time you wish to be here you be welcome to take any milkweed you want or to help yourself to any of my other crop i have ask my wartfrog to ignore you you no longer need to feel like a intruder you be very kind she reply you know that i be not from around here i be not understand amongst my own kind so i be something of a outcast you might say not here you be not thank you sir the unicorn seem to be near tear thank you so much when jeanne-marie return to the little clearing where she have leave graham she bring he several milkweed pod as well as a few cookie she have pick from the bush around the base of macdonald 's rock he be very sweet she say the moment i see he eye i know that he be special graham do you believe in love at first sight i do not know he say to she but i sure do love these cookie and so it go for the next day and the next by day jeanne-marie go to the field where she grow more and more fond of the odd stallion there by night she plot with graham as to how they might go about locate telly the problem seem to be that the witch could have magically zap he off as far away as santa monica californium have she want to do so find he would not be a easy task to make matter worse poor jeanne-marie have become a tad too take with macdonald lindsay the wartfrog have begin to mistrust she -lrb- illustration -rrb- she be not even the same kind of animal say lambert the wartfrog leader she do not have any troll feature -- not even a little around the eye they be totally incompatible she must only be out to get he milkweed to think that i once feel sympathy for that wretched little unicorn why that cunning little crook even have lindsay entrance so much that he have begin give she some of the good stuff she be no longer contented with the scrap and reject of we field she have get to go but how shall we do it it will have to be handle in a sneaky enough way so as to keep lindsay from notice he have be place under the spell of that little siren and i know that he would never grant we permission to shove she away from the area it be the very next day that the wartfrog make they move under the direction of lambert they go about they work and it be business as usual then when one of the amphibious pig see the small unicorn in the field behind they lambert call for a halt the wartfrog turn around and go back toward jeanne-marie she be not look in they direction so she do not notice that they be come toward she until it be too late to escape they be already upon she and hurl she unceremoniously into a harvesting-bag this they toss onto they cart and carry away i will sell she to a zoo in some other land where they be not so kind to thieve horse-creature giggle lambert show he tooth now we can get rid of this little troublemaker once and for all old mickey-d will never know what become of he dear little charity-case indeed it would have be curtain for poor jeanne-marie have not graham have a sudden inspiration which he want to tell she about right away he feel certain that he have formulate a plan by which they would be able to save telly from the witch and he have run into the milkweed field to find she he have see the terrible wartfrog capture she and have even overhear what they plan to do to she i can not let they do it he whisper angrily why this be the second time i have make a friend in oz who have meet with foul play he would have cry have he sadness not be so highly overcompensate for by he anger he first instinct be to run to she and try to fight for she freedom but he be a wise enough boy to know full well that this would be folly he be no more than one little boy against a whole farm 's worth of strong and muscular laborer if he be to pick a fight with this bunch he would be sell alongside he friend no he would need another plan of rescue but he have already come up with one such plan now he could give it a test-run however he know that he could not hope to carry it out all by himself no he would have to have help and graham know from whence that help must come with a swallow of anxiety he head for the home of the ranchero macdonald lindsay be as amiable a fellow as the unicorn have say this fact instantly put graham 's anxiety to rest do come in my friend say the ranchero what can i do to make you happy -lrb- illustration -rrb- it be about jeanne-marie say graham that poor little waif of a unicorn reply the troll-horse that very one say graham you worker have take she prisoner and they plan to sell she to a zoo or a circus or something like that the troll creature look at graham and frowned then he begin to laugh ha ha he say you take I for a complete and utter idiot no you can not be tell I the truth my boy be under order to let the lovely little waif alone they would not do such a cruel or vile thing to anyone i assure you but i be there sir plead graham i see it all with my own two eye they put jeanne-marie into a great big grain-bag and hide she on a cart that they carry along behind they the big fat one say he be go to sell she to a zoo i hear he say so he say ` old mickey-d will never know what become of he little charity-case ' as he quote the line he do he best to imitate the wartfrog 's voice please mr lindsay you just have to believe I i be tell you the truth now now answer the troll voice which be sound less patient than before i know better no one on my staff would ever do such a thing and no one on my staff would ever wait a minute do you say ` old mickey-d ' my my only foreman lambert ever call I by that annoying name and no one but he would have the audacity to he heart pound so loudly that graham could hear it from across the room then the troll-horse let out a couple of loud exclamation merciful france of grand rapid minnesota he bellow judy in the sky what a fool i have be to overlook it lambert have be try to hide it from I but he have be show sign of resentment against that unicorn i should have see this come but you have open my eye my boy i have strive -- er strive er i have

door wait shout graham take on the role of the calm and collect boy with a plan wait for what ask lindsay i 'll wait for nothing until i see that lousy lambert get he just reward he will speak the boy

on the black market with no question ask except when the salesman happen to be a mangaboo : vol 224 _ he hear a peculiar clattering noise outside fear it might affect he own happiness in some way
