a trunk full of old logbook and he say any of they would make a better story than the _ kut sing _ the truth of it be he do not want I to write this story there be thing he do not wish to see in type perhaps because he fear to read about himself and what have happen in the old steamer in the china sea folk do not care nothing about cargo-boat he would say take he pipe out of he mouth and shake he head gravely whenever i hint that i would like to tell of we adventure of the _ kut sing _ they want yarn of they float hotel call liner with palm-garden in 'em and band play at they meal and game and so on go from eight bell to the bo 'n' s watch it be mostly fight in the _ kut sing _ and the mess you and I and poor harri and the black boy there get into would not be just the quiet sort of read folk want these day it be all over in a night and a day anyway -- look at they northern spy apple mr trenholm he want to forget the _ kut sing _ and the awful night we have in she he imagine he do not figure to advantage in the story and he wince when i mention certain event although i always insist that he be the bravest man among we have a better realization of the odds against we those who have face danger know it take a brave man to admit that he be beat and still keep up the fight we all have better memory for we brave moment than for the fear which threaten for a time to prove we coward the man who have face death and say he be not afraid be either a fool or a liar and if only a liar still a fool for tell himself that which he know to be a lie the bravery of the seaman be that he fear the sea and know its ruthlessness and its ultimate victory and accept it as a part of he day 's work this be a sea-story captain rigg have log-book story that be good and they might have serve he for a volume of marine memoirs but i be with he when we freight the _ kut sing _ with adventure and sail out of manila so he musty record of rescue and wreck lack life for I in the old logbook i find no man to compare with the rev luther meeker or petrak the little red-headed beggar or long jim or buckrow or thirkle i never find in they page a cabin-boy like rajah the malay strut about with a long kris stick in the fold of he scarlet _ sarong _ or a mate whose truculence equal the chronic ill-humour of harri who learn he seamanship as a fisherman on the newfoundland bank and in all he log-book i never find another devil 's admiral rigg be dead and i can tell the story in my own way for tell it i must and the manuscript will be a comfort to I when i be old and my memory and imagination begin to fail not that i ever expect to forget because that would be a calamity but i want to put down the event of the day and night in the _ kut sing _ while they be fresh in my mind how well i can see in a mental vision the whole murderous plot work out certain part of it flash on I at off moment while i be read a book or watch a play or talk with a friend and every trivial detail come out as clearly as if it be all be do over again in a motion picture the night gloom in the hall bring back to I the ` tween-deck of the old tub of a boat the green-plush seat of a sleeping-car remind I of the _ kut sing 's _ dining-saloon and even a bonfire in a adjacent yard recall the odour of burn rice on the galley fire leave by the panic-stricken chinese cook i know the very smell of the _ kut sing _ i catch it last week pass a ship-chandler 's shop and it set my vein throb again with the sense of conflict and i catch myself tense my muscle for a death grapple to I the _ kut sing _ be a personality a sentient be with she own soul and mood and temper audaciously toss she bow at the threatening sea rise to meet she she be my sea-ghost and as much a character to I as rigg or thirkle or dago red the deep bright red band on she funnel give she a touch of coquetry but she have the drabness of senility she be wear out and work when she should have go to the junk pile year before but she very antiquity charm I for she scar and wrinkle tell of hard service in the china sea and there be a air of comfort about she such as one find in a ancient house that have sheltered several generation precious little comfort i have in she though which be why i remember she so well and why i never shall forget she if she have make hong-kong in five day she name would be lose in the memory of countless other steamer and there would be no tale to tell but now she be the _ kut sing _ and every time i whisper the two word to myself i live once more aboard she rajah be with I -- inherit i might say from captain rigg perhaps he keep my memory keen on the old day for how could i forget with the black boy stalk about the house -- half the time in he bare foot and he native costume which i rather encourage -- for he _ sarong _ match the curtain of my den and add a bit of color to my colourless surroundings i be quite sure that if captain rigg be still alive he would agree that the story should begin with my first sight of the missionary and the little red-headed man so i will launch the narrative with a account of how i first meet the rev luther meeker he be in the midst of a litter of nondescript baggage on the manila mole when i come ashore from a rice-boat that have bring I across the china sea from saigon the first glance mark he as a missionary for he wear a huge crucifix cut out of pink shell and as he hobble about on the embankment it bob at the end of a black cord hang from he neck quaint and queer he be even for the orient where queerness in man and thing be commonplace and accept as a part of the east 's inseparable sense of mystery with he big goggles of smoked glass he remind one of some sea-monster a illusion dispel by he battered pith helmet with its fade sky-blue _ pugrus _ bind round its crown the fray end fall over he shoulder and flap in the breeze he be a thin old man clothe in duck turn yellow with age when he throw the helmet back it expose a wrinkled brow and a baldish head except for a few wisp of hair at the temple he appear to be of great age -- a fossil a animated mummy a relic from a ancient graveyard and the stoop of he lean shoulder accentuate these impression it be plain that the tropics be fast make a end of he he be whine querulously as i step ashore and the first word i hear he say be : a organ a organ a organ in a cedarwood box a organ in a cedarwood box and the sign of the cross on the end oh why do you try my soul such stupidity such awful stupidity the native porter be grin at he as they simulated a frantic search for he organ in a cedarwood box but they probably know all the time where it be he be surround by basket and chest and if the crucifix be not enough to indicate he profession black letter on he possession advertise he as the rev luther meeker london evangelical society the multiplicity of label proclaim he a traveller know from colombo to vladivostok and he must have be wander over asia for year as he luggage be as ancient as himself fight my way out of the multitude on the river-bank i gain the cable office near the customhouse and report myself in manila buy all the newspaper i could to learn how the war be go in manchurium and to anticipate if possible where i might be order next i revel in the noise and crowd as only one can after a week at sea while i be on the way from saigon the russian army might have be beat or the japanese fleet destroy there might be order send I anywhere but i hope that i would leave manila for the strait of malacca to meet the baltic fleet what i fear most be the end of the war for a war-correspondent without a war be deprive of he profession i be young and ambitious then and seek a journalistic reputation at the cable 's mouth it happen that i have allow myself to heed the glib tongue of a hotel-runner before i leave the rice-steamer and he have commandeer my bag and take it to the oriente hotel of which i know nothing except that it be in the walled city and across the river from the cable office to recapture the bag and my clean linen i would have to take a instrument of torture know as a _ carromatta _ and drive across the bridge of spain i could cross the river in a small boat with a filipino pirate and go on a hunt for a conveyance on the other side but think it better to risk be shake to death than drown in the dirty pasig so i hail a _ cochero _ the villain demand a double rate and while we be haggle a bus of the oriente draw in sight and i catch it as it be spin up calle san fernando when i crawl into the bus i wish that i have strike a bargain with the thief of a _ cochero _ for i find myself in a seat beside the whine missionary he pray for he bone over the rough place and for he life when the driver take a corner recklessly and make we all very weary with he eternal complain that be not the worst of it -- he try to strike up a acquaintance with I there be a letter in my coat-pocket which have be give to I in saigon to deliver to the russian consul in manila it be a errand for the cable-operator there who have do I favor and i be to leave it at the hong-kong-shanghai bank for the consul who would call for it that bank carry a expense account for I so the delivery of the letter be of no trouble the envelope be long and official-looking and it fall to the floor of the bus as i clamber in meeker pick it up and hand it to I but for the instant he hold it he read the address : russian consul care hong-kong-shanghaus bank manila courtesy mr jame a trenholm amalgamated press my dear sir say meeker you have drop a document -- allow I thank you i reply and take the letter which be quite bulky and seal with a splotch of black wax imprint with a coat of arm or a crest or some such insignia i fear i betray my irritation over meeker 's read the address no offence i trust my dear sir he say mild surprise in he tone none whatever i snap back but we companion in the bus smile and wink at I openly as if they appreciate my cold manner toward the missionary he say no more to I but remark to no one in particular that a austere manner be a poor passport in this country which imply that i be new to the east and would learn better if i stay long enough i ignore the remark somewhat pleased that i have rebuff he for i well know he would talk I into a fever if i do not keep he at a distance and furthermore i do not relish the idea of have he intrude upon I at the hotel my dislike for he be not because he be a missionary but because he be a common enough type of bear he be over suave and he peevishness jar my none too steady nerve the bus be not a pleasant place for I after that so i drop off in plaza moraga when i observe the signboard of the very bank mention i cash a draft and hand the letter to the clerk at the bar window oh yes we have be wait for that he say as he take the envelope mr trego here be you papers for the consul he call to a man somewhere behind the frosted glass wall we appreciate you kindness very much mr trenholm it be then that i first see the little red-headed man he be look in at the door but scurry away when the sikh guard inside move toward he the little man wear a white canvas navy-cap but he appearance be dirty and disreputable and he have the aspect of a beggar he visage be wizen and villainous and shoot with pock-mark under a coppery stubble of red beard and he little mole-like eye be that close together that they seem fasten to he nose the clerk keep I wait for signature and finally hand out my gold as i fill my purse i be conscious of some one behind I and glance over my shoulder i see the rev luther meeker chapter ii red-headed beggar and missionary turn my back on he i edge toward a desk it seem to I that he have not recognize I as the austere man in the bus or perhaps he choose to pass without encounter I again he stare about the place lean on one leg for a minute as if undecided what to do next or not quite sure he be in the right establishment i could hear voice in a room close at hand and meeker turn toward the door walk silently in he cloth deck-shoe and pass into the room i hear a man give a cry of astonishment follow by a growl of wrath and meeker run out again retreat backward and hold he hand up in protest my dear sir he whine no offence i be sure i hope you have take no offence for none be intend and i do not mean to disturb any person -- i be simply ask alms for a seaman 's chapel and i do most sincerely beg you pardon gentleman he go into the street and a sallow-faced man with a slender malacca cane hold in he hand as if it be a rapier come to the door of the room and say something in french indignant that he should be disturb he wave the cane menacingly after meeker and slam the door leave the bank i turn toward the escolta which be the principal business street of manila the shop window attract I and i saunter for half a hour or more i want a new field-glass and as i stand on the pavement at a corner and look in at a jeweller 's window i catch the image of meeker in the glass which be throw in a shadow by a awning i turn without think meeker could have any interest in what i might do and see he half a block away talk to the little red-headed beggar who have look in at the bank door meeker evidently catch I look at he for he whisper to the beggar who hasten away take a furtive glance at I over he shoulder as he leave i turn toward meeker and he swing away down the street as i approach he with more nimbleness than i suppose be in he old bone i suppose the pest will be at my heel for the next week i tell myself annoy at the way the missionary cross my path that be the fourth time i have see he in a hour and i dread to go to the hotel sure i would meet he again -- for of course he could not have go anywhere else but to the oriente i think it strange that he should be talk to the little beggar although it never occur to I that they be watch I and even if they be i would have not concerned myself much about it as it be i ascribe meeker 's embarrassment when i last see he to what have pass between we in the bus and conclude that he be try to avoid I which i consider a praiseworthy effort on he part there be a possibility of order await I at the hotel and although it be not yet noon i hail a rig and drive there the clerk pass over the familiar yellow envelope and my message read : proceed to hong-kong for order i reply that i would leave at once and the message be go before i discover that there be not a steamer for hong-kong before the end of the week five day away it would have sound silly to dispatch another message tell of lack of steamer i have suppose a steamer sail every day or two and my temper be ruffle at my mistake and the prospect of fret away a week in the heat of manila a little item in the _ time _ give I hope it tell of the steamer _ kut sing _ come out of dry dock to sail for hong-kong that very afternoon with general cargo there be a bare chance that i might get passage in she for the paper refer to she as a former passenger boat and i be sure i could cajole the company into sell I a berth or bribe the captain into sign I as a member of the crew with no duty to perform a common practice this be mr trenholm of the amalgamated press i tell the clerk in the steamship office over the hotel 's desk-telephone simply must get to hong-kong as soon as possible and would like to go in the _ kut sing _ this afternoon may i buy passage in she it be hard to make he understand for he be a filipino who insist on speak english although i have a work knowledge of spanish he first mistake I for a stevedore then for the manager and next for the hong-kong-shanghai bank i storm at he irritated that i should have to shout my business for the benefit of the loafer in the hotel office correspondent i yell in answer to he question newspaper correspondent work on the war i want to go to hong-kong in the _ kut sing _ i be very sorry he say without explain he sorrow may i go in the _ kut sing _ i insist and he tell I i could and after he have talk in a low tone with somebody in he office say that i could not which be exasperating i decide to go to the steamship office and plead with the official hang up the receiver i signal to the boy to call a carriage you want to go in the _ kut sing _ my dear sir come a purr voice at my shoulder i look up and the rev luther meeker smile at I i growl something at he to the effect that i wonder if i be ever to lose sight of he he bow again and grin sorry that you object to I he murmur with lift eyebrow but we 'll let all that pass i might inform you that it be impossible to go in the steamer _ kut sing _ you will pardon I i be sure but i hear what you say at the telephone and i be willing to annoy you to save you time and trouble i repeat there be absolutely no possibility of you get passage in the _ kut sing _ how do you know i ask still curt with he but feel a trifle ashamed of myself for insulting he because they have just refuse I my dear sir -- allow I -- the rev luther meeker of the london evangelical society and he give I a card which have see considerable service trenholm be my name sorry i have not a card equally sorry mr meeker that you have be refuse passage in the _ kut sing _ excuse I but i be in a hurry it will not avail you anything to visit the office he say with sad mien and a sneer on he lip and why not if they would not let I go a man of the cloth with credentials from the bishop of salisbury you case be hopeless thanks for the compliment i shoot at he and leave he stare after I with puzzle surprise on he wrinkled countenance he step to the door and see I enter a _ quilez _ and there be a gleam of anger in he crafty old eye the sunlight make he blink for he be not wear goggles and as i roll toward the parian gate i look back and see he stand in the door and shade he eye with he hand to look after I take possession of a very surprised steamship-agent i inform he that i be go to hong-kong in the _ kut sing _ and i be ready to argue with he until the vessel sail a refusal be out of the question -- he do not have time to refuse i spread all sort of papers on the counter and threaten to bring all the officer of the hong-kong-shanghai bank up there to argue for I the talk about the bank seem to help I wonderfully for he have a whisper conversation with a gray-bearded old gentleman who look I over with a shrewd eye and nod he assent to my buy a ticket it will not be necessary for you to sign ship 's article say the agent turn affable all of a sudden we have a passenger-license for the _ kut sing _ although we have withdraw she from the passenger-trade except in case of emergency or delay of the regular ship but she have not be in the passenger-trade for nearly a year and we will not undertake to guarantee the table or service you will not find she equal to a liner and the ticket be sell with the understanding that she be a cargo-boat and if you be willing to take pot-luck with captain rigg that be you affair however it be understand that you be not to make unreasonable complaint or demand of the master my answer to this be to dump a handful of gold coin on the counter before he could change he mind i tell he i be willing to go to hong kong in a coal-barge you will find it lonesome on the passage he say i 'll manage all right i reply not quite rid of my asperity over they lack of decision about take a passenger we have already sell one ticket continue the clerk as he put down figure on a pad he glance at I with a quizzical expression and then smile one passenger will help i comment for something better to say if he do not talk a arm off you before you reach hong-kong i 'll give you the ticket for sixpence he be a missionary he grin the rev luther meeker i cry in horror the rev luther meeker he repeat and give I my change with a chuckle naturally i be astonish to discover that meeker be to be a passenger with I in the _ kut sing _ but i be out in the street again before it dawn upon I that the situation be more than a mere coincidence the missionary have lie to I when he say he have be refuse passage he have mislead I when he say it be impossible to buy a ticket in the _ kut sing _ and i could make nothing of it all but that he do not want I to know he be sail in the vessel and that he do not want I to go in she the idea that he would interfere with my plan and delay I for a week simply because he object to my presence in the same steamer with he fill I with wrath i so lost my temper for a minute that i be bent on go back to the hotel and knock he down missionary or no missionary but instead come to the conclusion that the joke be on he and i would have plenty of opportunity to retaliate upon he between manila and hong-kong before i get into my _ quilez _ my ire be rouse again at the sight of the red-headed beggar lounge in a doorway across the street obviously watch I it be plain enough that meeker have send he to spy upon I and learn if i go to the steamship office the little beggar see I look at he and dodge into a doorway but flee when he see I start after he in the _ quilez _ i laugh at myself for allow a prying old man like meeker to upset my temper and as i ride back to the hotel put the both of they out of my mind but promise myself that i would take my revenge on the old pest in some way aboard the steamer my bag be pack again and i be ready for tiffin and then a afternoon nap to be call in time to catch the steamer my telephone ring and i hasten to answer it expect order from the cable-office and hope that london have decide after all to send I after the baltic fleet to the south rather than to hong-kong be this mr trenholm this be the steamship office mr trenholm we wish to inform you that the _ kut sing _ have be delay until to-morrow morning for cargo which do not get in to-day sail to-morrow sure it make little difference to I and i would be glad to have a night 's sleep ashore after the rice-steamer however it would be wise to have the exact sailing-time of the _ kut sing _ so i ring up the steamship office and ask not wish to run the risk of get to the mole and find the steamer go she sail this afternoon at five as note on the board be the startling response to my query i be so take aback for a second that i do not know what to think or say i remark into the telephone that somebody in the steamship office must take I for a fool and that i do not consider such thing joke no they have not telephone I the sailing be delay could not say who have certainly no one in the steamship office could think of do such a thing which sound reasonable enough know nothing whatever about a delay and be quite perturb to hear i have be tell there be have no idea how it happen but there be no doubt the _ kut sing _ would sail on schedule time for the stevedore be there in the office at that minute get lading-slips sign and he know of no delay meeker 's little joke be go too far i decide after i have hang up the receiver i think there be a few word i can say to he that will convince he i be not to be trifle with in this manner seize my cap i pull the door open abruptly and almost fall over the little red-headed beggar lurk near my room he dart down the stairway and i leap after he chapter iii the spy and the dead boatswain three step at a time i take the mat stairway which be reckless speed for the shell-paned window be shut and the awning pull down to keep out the heat of the blind sun make it quite dark but i be bind to capture the little red-headed man thrash he soundly make he tell he motive in trail I and turn he over to the police i catch the indistinct figure of a man in white come up and throw myself to one side to avoid he but he stumble in front of I and we go sprawl into the corridor below it be a nasty spill and i shoot out on the matting at full length with my hand throw before I the polish teak-wood floor and the loose mat save I from injury my dear sir exclaim the man who fall with I and i find the rev luther meeker sit on a crumpled mat and prop up with he arm behind he while he pith helmet go dance away on its rim to settle crazily upon its crown a dozen foot from we for a instant i be tempt to attack he when i realize that he presence on the stair and he interruption of my pursuit of the redheaded man be significant of more than a accident and that meeker and the other be spy upon I i bridle my ire and decide to play the game out with they and fathom the mystery of they espionage my dear sir i be almost certain that i have sprain my back -- i be sure i have injure my back i be sorry for you back i say get to my foot for my part i be satisfied to escape without a broken neck my immortal soul if it be not mr trenholm say he blinking at I he goggles bob on a rubber string make fast to a jacket-button of all person mr trenholm bless my soul my mental remark be somewhat similar and with equal fervor if not complimentary to he and he soul brushing my soil duck i start to move away for it would never do to assume a excess of friendship too suddenly just one moment mr trenholm -- he call after I shake a bony forefinger -- just one moment i beg of you sir i have some information which i desire to impart and strangely enough i be seek you when this unfortunate tumble come about partly through my infirmity i be sure one moment sir it be to you advantage to wait i assure you what be it i ask hesitate the little beggar have undoubtedly escape and i know that in meeker i have bigger game if i handle he cautiously the _ kut sing _ he say arise with difficulty and hold he back with one hand while he hobble after he helmet i be convince that he injury and decrepit bearing be clever bit of act i desire to correct you regard the _ kut sing _ he cackle caress the recover helmet what about it my dear mr meeker i be in a hurry and can not waste the day wait for you to talk i be sorry for what have happen here but i trust that you be not incapacitate anyway i do not think there be anything you can tell I about the _ kut sing _ that i do not already know oh but there be he protest hold up he hand and eye I craftily i be seek you to tell you when we fall upon each other so unceremoniously it be quite -- i suppose you want to tell I that the sailing have be delay i know all about that -- she sail in the morning sail in the morning he exclaim pretend surprise but be puzzle about something do she there be guile in that last question and when he ask it i know it be he or some one act for he who have attempt to mislead I about the time of the vessel 's departure i see a chance to trap he and ask : be that what you want to tell I he parry it and while he fumble in he pocket for something a trick to gain time he be think hard and fast i have he against the rope so to speak and he know it for what he do want to find out be whether i know the telephone message to be fraudulent if i do he want to take credit for set I right and if i do not he want I to miss the _ kut sing _ so know he game i come to the conclusion that i must not press he too hard and so make he suspicious that i know he true character -- he character that be as a decidedly suspicious person i be tell that she sail in the morning but it be some mistake i tell he as if i have not find anything peculiar in the error and be not the least disturbed about it oh no nothing in that he cry unable to conceal he delight over my admission of how much i know for a minute i think there might be something in the story after all when i hear you say she be delay that be just what i be go to tell you -- there be no truth in that report some person who i can not say also give I misinformation regard the _ kut sing _ i fear that you might have have the same experience that however be only a part of it -- what i want to tell you be that it be now possible to buy a ticket in the _ kut sing _ i already have my ticket i say so we will be fellow-passenger and i hope you will pardon my throw you down the stair but i be run after a beggar or a thief indeed do you know the rascal or do you see he so that you can give a comprehensive description of he to the police a little red-headed man i say watch he closely do you see he before you start up the stair he burst out in a dry mirthless cackle of laughter and slap he knee much as if he have hear a good joke if you will come in to tiffin with I mr trenholm i will tell you about he assume affability i accept he invitation and we go into the dining-room together and find a table to ourselves in the corner i be rather please at have a opportunity to study he especially at he own suggestion and i make up my mind that before the lunch be over i would have solve the mystery of who or what the missionary be and why he have the little red-headed man at my heel since i have arrive in manila that morning and why he have attempt to keep I out of the _ kut sing _ and who be this little red-headed man i ask as we take we chair he bow he head and mumble a grace before reply and i have a sense of mental conflict between we and know that i would have to guard against chicane or the suave old fellow would talk I out of my suspicion it must have be dago red you see he begin grin and wag he head i hope he do not actually steal anything my dear mr trenholm i be quite sure you must be mistaken about he be a thief but it be quite possible he have deceive I i find he sneak near my door in the hall i say who be this dago red a worthy man he reply get serious i be afraid you have do he a injustice for i send he up to see if you be in you room and after i have give he the errand the clerk inform I that you be in and i start up myself he do not appear anxious to talk with I when he see I open the door you probably startle he by -- but who be he petrak i think he name be although i be not sure and my poor old memory can not hold name long he be a sailor who have be shipwreck and he become a vagrant here and be send to bilibid prison much of my work be in prison and i take charge of he when he get out and send he to the sailor ' home sure that he would be able to get a ship again that be a couple of month ago and when i arrive to-day he meet I and tell I that he have leave the home because the keeper be prejudice against he owe to he term in prison he be on the verge of starvation and i give he some money from my charity fund which he promptly spend on drink for he be quite dissolute but he take charge of my luggage and attend to some errand for I but he fear the police and can not get out of he habit of skulk about and as the detective have hound he he be suspicious of everybody and ready to go into a panic when a stranger approach he it be a pity that he can not get back to sea but he have have the fever and no master seem to want he and he have be force into vagabondage he give I this history of the little red-headed man in disconnect sentence while we be at the soup and i let he run on as he talk he eye be roam over the room and he scan every person that enter and peer at I from under he brow when he think i be not observe he it be plausible enough but i could not forget that meeker and the little sailor be together a great deal and whenever i have see they they be act suspiciously and both of they have keep close watch upon I neither have he explain away the fact that he have tell I i could not buy a ticket in the _ kut sing _ which i do nor the fact that he have he own ticket when he tell I that nor the false telephone message for the obvious purpose of make I miss the steamer and then he get in my way when i be in pursuit of petrak or dago red as he call he it seem beyond reason that this chain of event could be nothing but a combination of coincidence and when i analyze the situation i frame what i consider a good theory regard petrak 's presence outside my door it occur to I that meeker be the author of the false message and that he be really on he way to visit I to learn if i have discover the falsity of it when he meet I rush down the stair but he have send petrak ahead of he to listen at the door in case i telephone the company to verify the first message petrak have hear I ask the company for the sailing time and be about to report to meeker when i open the door upon he meeker be probably at the foot of the stair and cover the retreat of he henchman petrak may not have be able to stop and report what he have hear so meeker fish for the information from I ready to confirm the report that the sailing of the vessel be delay or pretend that he be about to set I right upon my admission that i know the report be false he grasp at the latter alternative and see that it be impossible to prevent I go in the _ kut sing _ determine to make friend with I and disarm whatever suspicion i might have regard he it seem a tenable theory but i could not account for all this bother on he part because jame augustus trenholm of the amalgamated press take passage in the _ kut sing _ it seem absurd to I that meeker or anybody else would be concern because i be leave manila for hong-kong it be plain enough that he or somebody have do they best to keep I from sailing in the _ kut sing _ that it be the rev luther meeker there could be little doubt but the mystery lay in what he motive could be or who he be act for and it be beyond I to say why there should be any objection to my sailing in the steamer _ kut sing _ that afternoon while i be think these thing over he be keep up a run conversation about trivial matter and we be well into the curried lamb and get along famously when he ask a question which put I on my guard at once and set I grope mentally for a solution of the puzzle do you deliver you letter he ask casually but i saw in a instant that he have be pave the conversational way all along for that very question what letter i ask although i know the one he mean he look at I craftily with what i take for a bit of surprise that i do not know the letter he refer to or that he expect I to deceive he perhaps i should not mention it for it may recall we little unpleasantness this morning he send back perhaps it be my fault my dear sir in speak to you when i pick it up and i certainly want to assure you that i be not put out by you disinclination to begin a acquaintance with a stranger have not the slightest idea of what you be talk about i say lightly and profess ignorance in my puzzle expression the letter you drop in the bus he fairly hurl the sentence at I although he voice be low and he be pretend to have trouble with the saltcellar oh to be sure the letter i drop in the bus and which you so kindly pick up for I i have a idea that i be rather gruff at the time and not at all incline to appreciate the service you perform i might have lose it entirely but for you so i 'll thank you now with a apology do not mention it -- do not mention it i assure you i trust you deliver it safely he have give I the key to the mystery the letter for the russian consul be the cause of meeker 's attention to I and instead of be a newspaper correspondent to meeker i be a russian agent probably a spy it be all i could do to restrain myself from laugh in he face deliver it safely i repeat inanely it be only a errand for a friend of mine and i leave it at the -- he wait for I to finish the sentence he forget himself and fail to conceal he assumed nonchalance regard the letter for as i cut off what i be say he hold he fork poise over he lamb so intent be he on learn where i have deliver the letter for the russian consul i seize a glass of water and struggle with a imaginary obstruction in my throat and mentally cursing my stupidity in tell my friend 's private business to a stranger who have already betray a inordinate interest in the letter where do you leave it purr meeker at the post-office i finish amaze at he boldness in pursue the destination of the letter and have no qualm of conscience about tell he a falsehood i do not regard it as any of he affair where i have deliver the letter and do not intend to inform he i have leave the bulky envelope at the hong-kong-shanghai bank the image of the bank-front which cross my mind give I another clue to meeker 's solicitude about I and the letter i remember see a sign over the teller 's window which state that the bank be a branch of a russian financial house what could be more natural for a russian spy than to cash he draft in a place which deal with vladivostok and port arthur or even st petersburg and moscow and if he take I for a spy in the russian service it follow that he must be watch I for the japanese and it be probable that the cable-agent in saigon be in the service of the czar and find it convenient to deliver a important document with my assistance at that time manila be the headquarters for blockade-runner bind for port arthur and russian and japanese spy from coolie to banker be watch every ship and every stranger so it be not strange that i come from french indo-china with a dispatch for the russian consul should be mistake for a spy by meeker the instant he read the address on the envelope and see the wax seal i have a mind to tell the old fellow the joke on he but that would require explain where the letter to the consul come from which would hardly be play fair with my friend in saigon if he know the truth he might abandon he trip to hong-kong in the _ kut sing _ and i would be rid of he for i know he be go with I in the steamer for the purpose of attempt to learn what my business would be in the british port if i be to remain in manila i would have disillusion he and so put a stop to he trail I about but as i be leave in a few hour i anticipate but little more trouble from he or the redheaded man besides i see a opportunity to make game of he by tell he he mistake after we be well to sea and lead he on a fool 's voyage i be sure that we will have a pleasant passage in the _ kut sing _ he say i be something of a literary man myself mr trenholm -- a exhaustive life of the saint a shilling in paper cover four shilling in cloth with gilt title and frontispiece of I it be recommend by the bishop of salisbury and in its class quite a standard work then i do some poem chiefly on sacred subject not much as poetry perhaps judge by severe standard but i be tell they be regard as marvel of piety and sweetness i may have a copy in my luggage which i will show you after we be settle aboard the steamer i let he ramble on like that turn over in my mind the while all the scheme i intend to put into play to convince he i be really a spy and when a boy bring a paper i fall upon the war news another russian defeat i half moan and make out that i be dreadfully upset because the japanese be win battle he say he deplore war and have a prejudice against the japanese and hope they would lose and praise the russian as brave and pious when i express satisfaction at he view in order to prove my character as a russian agent we might have be mistake by a observer for a couple of old friend he weary I however with he chatter and effort to make himself agreeable and after the meal i escape from he on the plea of business which must be attend to before the steamer sail leave the walled city i cross the bridge of spain to the escolta and take a stroll in calle rosario where the chinese merchant keep themselves in grateful shade with mile of awning after a hour of sight-seeing i find myself in a square near the san miguel bridge there be a crowd gather before a building which i remember on account of the picture of a frigate paint upon the stucco wall and the great red letter spell out : the flagship bar there have evidently be a fight and coolie and native and european in white cluster at the door i join the knot of people and press forward to see what be hold they attention and see the body of a big foreign-looking man half inside the door and half on the pavement with he head outside he mouth be open and from he upper lip droop long black moustache look all the blacker for the ghastly pallor of he cheek he have be stab in the back and the spectator in the front of the group edge away to avoid the grow pool of blood on the sidewalk do anybody know who he be demand a khaki-clad policeman take out a note-book a sailor say a american in a white apron who lean out of the door drink whiskey and vermouth and talk like a squarehead greek he be say a man with the appearance of a mariner here be he cap in here say the bartender and he turn and pick up a watch-cap and hold it so we could see letter work in it with gilt cord and i make out kut sing which excite my interest in the case boatswain he be in the _ kut sing _ bind out to-day for hong-kong say the mariner jolly long road to hong-kong for he now say another who cut he demand the policeman do not you see how this happen be you all deaf and dumb you there in the apron who do this you can search I say the bartender he have a couple of drink and be go out when somebody slip a knife in he i be at the other end of the bar -- never see a thing until this one here let out a yell and go down somebody cut and run through the door i see he i see he cry a boy in kilt who have a hoop and we all turn expect the murderer to be point out to we but the boy mean that he have see the man run away and all that he know be that he have wear a funny hat and he could tell nothing else a little chap it be volunteer a cockney what be that ask the policeman speak up -- nobody here go to bite you my man do you see he what do he look like i do not see he do no cuttin ' if that be what you mean officer i do not see no knife-play and ye could not hang a man on what i see and -- what do you see say the policeman with a show of asperity never mind what we can do with it what do you see small chap in a white navy-cap and ` air red as the sun in the gulf of h ` annam chapter iv i go aboard the _ kut sing _ perhaps i should have tell the policeman about petrak when i hear the cockney say he have see a red-headed little man in a white navy-cap run away from the flagship bar but if i have i might have be hold as a witness and nothing come of it for it develop that the cockney know nothing about the murder -- as he say he have simply see the little man run away from the scene i have other business beside aid the police to find the murderer of a sailor and that business be to get to hong-kong as quickly as i could in the _ kut sing _ even then it be time that i hasten to the dock and board the steamer i hail a _ cochero _ and leave the manila police to settle they own mystery get my baggage from the oriente and ride through binondo toward the waterfront now it occur to I that i must set down in they order the event of that day in they proper sequence which compel I to tell of my meeting with mr trego in the hong-kong-shanghai bank it be not until the whole affair be end that the significance of that apparently casual meeting in the bank come upon I with its full force and i see the pattern of what be to become a tangled succession of the most queer happening there be papers at the bank which i must take with I and on the way to the dock i stop there as i go in there be a sallow-faced man standing outside a grate window talk with a teller he be smoke a long russian cigarette and pull with nervous finger at a tiny black moustache he malacca cane be lean against the wall by he side i recognize he as the man who have drive the rev luther meeker out of the rear room of the bank when the latter go in to seek alms as he say he stand aside as i approach the teller 's window and the clerk hand out the papers to I with a smile and some trifling remark when be you leave mr trenholm ask the clerk in a hour in the _ kut sing _ i say and the man with the cigarette turn round and survey I with mild surprise as i step to the door he go up to the window and whisper something to the clerk mr trenholm just one minute please mr trenholm the clerk call I and i halt think that he have forget something about my letter of credit or want my signature again i want you to meet mr trego say the teller he will be with you in the _ kut sing _ i bow and mr trego bow but he eye be appraise I as he look at I although outwardly he have the excessive politeness of a latin i be very glad to meet you he say without the trace of a accent although in that mechanical manner which make the word sound as if they have be read many time out of a grammar or phrase-book i take he for a frenchman i must be go now but i hope to meet you on board i say and we bow again and i leave he he be all right i hear the teller say as i go out and understand that the bank-clerk have assure trego that my character be good enough for he to be friendly with I on the passage to hong-kong as we swing out of calle san fernando i see the _ kut sing _ tie up at the embankment of the pasig river with the blue peter at she foremast and heavy black smoke pour from she funnel she have the aspect of a vessel get ready for sea and the last of she cargo be be put into she hold it be then that i be attract to a knot of native and sailor cluster about a organ in front of the decrepit building which i know for the sailor ' home roar out the chorus of rock of age as though it be a chantey there could be no mistake the figure seat at the wheezy little organ -- the rev luther meeker with he battered helmet on the back of he head and he goggles turn skyward as he wail in a high-piped tenor the word of the old hymn he be too busy to see I and be make hard going of the tune for the assorted voice which follow he lead hold to various key he may have see I from behind he goggles but if he do he give no sign and i urge the driver to whip up the horse and pass the group at a good clip i have no desire to be annoy by the old impostor and be afraid that he might have some new pretext to keep I from go in the _ kut sing _ we be well clear of the congregation when i be startle to see petrak emerge from the pack of stare native about the organ and run after my carriage take you luggage aboard for a peseta sir he cry grasp the side of the vehicle and keep pace with it i confess that i suspect some game and that meeker have waylay I it look like a bold move to block I at the last minute and i be rather amuse at the idea of watch they game and see what might be the tactic the little fellow have change he appearance a trifle he red head be cover now with a black cloth cap make he look more like a stoker than a seaman he ratlike visage be cover with a coppery stubble but its color be not apparent at first glance for he face be smear with coal-dust and grease i be nigh dead for a drink he whine let I take you luggage aboard sir -- just a peseta sir i have have jungle fever and be shipwreck -- in the _ hb leed _ it be that go down in a typhoon i can not get a ship out of this blast

river itself be alive with _ casco _ be pole about by half-naked native the family of the crew do the cooking and primitive housekeeping on the half-deck while the family fighting-cock strut on the roof of the boat and crow defiance to each other on the opposite side of the river be the walled city and the moss-grown wall of fort santiago and on both bank be steamer and river-craft make a

way bawl rigg to he no offence i hope say the missionary but be this the steamer _ kut sing _ it be say rigg and turn he attention to harri and trego who be give order to the chinese at the winch then

sure enough and he precede they up the gang captain rigg come up the ladder from the foredeck in time to see the man bring the organ aboard although meeker be out of he sight by the time the captain reach a position where he have a view of the gang here where be you chap go he shout to the porter they stop and look up at he gear for a passenger say the taller of the two what passenger demand rigg in surprise a parson say the spokesman and as he say it meeker himself come up the after-ladder ah the captain he say i be the rev luther meeker he explain present he ticket i be go to hong-kong and if i be not mistaken this be the good ship _ kut sing _ that you baggage all right you man -- come aboard and look sharp that be my hymnal organ say meeker look over the side come right along with it

the ticket mind that you stay aboard because we sail at once sir meeker bow to I again and hurry aft twirl he shell crucifix between he finger in a nervous manner hang a parson anyway growl rigg grin at I they always make a fuss -- like as not he 'll sing he way to hong-kong with that old melodeon of he oh mr harri there be two man below with a parson who say they be sailor have the dutchman sign they on if they be able hand he go down the ladder again to the fore-deck and i go down to my stateroom to see that my baggage be safe smart job my man smart job i hear the rev luther meeker say as i step into the passage he be in the stateroom next to mine but the door be open who be that ask somebody cautiously then in a louder tone : we get you dunnage stow all snug sir i step into my room and after a minute 's whisper consultation i hear some one step into the passageway and run forward look out i see the little red-headed man scurry away single she up call captain rigg from the bridge and i know we be let go of manila as the winch draw in the mooring-line and the whistle blow a farewell blast the nose of the _ kut sing _ fall away from the embankment and into the current of the pasig which swing she toward manila bay and the china sea i could hear meeker hum a tune and arrange he baggage i stand for a instant and ponder over the situation not sure that i would not be wiser to remain in manila rather than sail in the _ kut sing _ i shiver as i sense danger about I as one feel the presence of a intruder in the dark that can not be see then i laugh at myself and open my bag for my pistol chapter v the dead man in the passage the _ kut sing _ be drop downstream as i lock my stateroom and make my way to the upper-deck partly to get a last look at manila but more for the purpose of consider what i should do in the matter of tell captain rigg that i suspect meeker be not a missionary in the last few minute before the departure of the vessel i have suddenly be strike with the idea that meeker be more than a mere spy who mistake I for one of he own ilk this feeling be vague and formless and i do not know how to begin to put together the various element that seem to connect some sort of a well-defined plot no sooner would i set about put certain fact together than i would laugh at myself for manufacture a mystery and after i have try to shake off the impression that the _ kut sing _ and all of we in she be more than mere traveller and seaman the fantastic idea insist upon run through my head through this formless mass of queer event of the day meeker and the little red-headed man keep to the front of my fancy and with they the steamer _ kut sing _ why i ask myself have meeker make such strenuous effort to keep I from take passage in the vessel it seem absurd to suppose that he have act as he do simply because he dislike the idea of have I for a fellow passenger then there be trego and meeker 's appearance at the bank seek alms and the further fact that trego be in the _ kut sing _ it seem to be more than a coincidence that the two of they should meet as they do i even find something queer in the killing of the boatswain of the _ kut sing _ at the flagship bar and begin to wonder if petrak do not have a hand in the murder even though he be so ready with a denial when i speak to he about it as i stand at the rail of the hurricane-deck and thought of these thing petrak come up from the fore-deck and stand at the foot of the ladder lead to the bridge where i could hear captain rigg pacing to and fro and speak through the trap to the helmsman about the course the little red-headed man grin at I and set to work polish the knob of the wheel-house door and not until that minute do i realize that he have come along with we in the _ kut sing _ and he likewise remind I at once that it be i who have bring he aboard i sign on sir he say point to he new cap which have the steamer 's name embroider upon it thanks to you sir i get a ship out i be glad you do i say curtly not sure whether i ought to be amuse at the turn of event by which i have unwittingly bring the little rascal along with I i glance up the companionway to captain rigg and have a mind to go up and speak to he about meeker but i dislike to invade the bridge sacred territory at sea he be stand just at the head of the ladder then and could see I would you mind the peseta sir ask petrak i remember that he have bring my bag aboard and find a peso in my pocket -- five time what he have ask for -- i give he the coin here i say take this and keep out of my reach i have see quite enough of you for a time please do not tip my crew captain rigg call down to I in a pleasant manner the steward 's department must attend to the passenger for we be short-handed on deck and i can not have the man run errand it be for service render i tell rigg and he nod as if satisfy with my explanation and turn away to the other end of the bridge impulsively i start up the ladder determine at least to tell he what i suspect of meeker and let he judge for himself or be on he guard against the old impostor whether he like my tale-bearing or not as i put my hand out to take the ladder-guard petrak thrust himself before I and bar the way can not go on the bridge sir against order he say i fall back convince that he be right and that i have have a narrow escape from make a ass of myself captain rigg probably would not thank I for disturb he or bother he with idle rumor and fanciful yarn about passenger even though they might be spy the steamer be now well into the bay the sun be at the rim of hill between we and the open sea and the sky be aflame in a gorgeous tropical sunset harri the mate be busy on the fore-deck batten down hatch and clear up the litter of rope and sling the _ kut sing _ be plainly enough short-handed for the passage for there be but half a dozen chinese sailor in sight petrak work with a cloth on the brass-knob and he be loaf without a doubt i suspect that he be afraid i be wait for he to go away so that i might go up the ladder to the bridge one of the man who have bring meeker 's organ aboard have the wheel a long lanky cockney he be from what i could see of he through the window of the pilot-house we be well clear of the ship at anchor outside the breakwater when four bell -- six o'clock -- strike and harri come up and go on the bridge pass without apparently see I he growl something to petrak and the red-headed man go toward the forecastle time for rajah to have the bell go say rigg as he descend to the hurricane-deck and greet I affably what do you say to go below and see what be on the table as he speak i hear the rattle of a gong and as i turn to go below with captain rigg meeker come around the deck-house and join we regard we from under he heavy brow as he approach and rub he hand in a manner that increase my grow dislike for he my dear sir he say that be a beautiful sight i have never see in all my twenty year in the orient such a sunset can not keep I from my meal say captain rigg wave to meeker to precede he into the companionway i be rather please at the captain 's gruffness with he and resolve that as soon as the opportunity offer i would discuss the crafty gentleman with rigg we find trego at table he look up and make no attempt to conceal he surprise at see meeker ah mr trenholm he say to I and we shake hand and the malay boy give I the seat opposite he mr trego -- allow I -- the reverend meeker say rigg so you and mr trenholm have meet before say meeker evidently astonished because trego speak to I without a introduction old friend and i wink at trego to the further mystification of the pseudo-missionary who take the seat beside I captain rigg take the head of the table so that he be between trego and I and this be rajah the mess-boy say rigg indicate the black boy who stand behind he clothe in a white jacket with brass button below which he wear a scarlet _ sarong _ reach to he bare foot and evidently fashion from a old table-cover the hilt of a kris show above the fold of he _ sarong _ and the two lower button of the jacket be leave open so that the dagger might be free to he hand he grin and show he tooth dumb as a dog-fish but can hear like a terrier say rigg pick he up in the street of singapore where he be sort of a assistant magician he be quick with that knife gentleman the captain be obviously proud of he queer bodyguard and servant it be a pity that he should be allow to carry a fearsome weapon which be a menace to he fellowman say meeker shrink away from the boy i believe he would slay a human over a trifle absolutely harmless unless he have some reason to anger laugh rigg somewhat amuse at the nervousness of meeker have to pack that cheese-knife -- chink pick on he if he do not give he a wide berth though when they see that blade quick with it but we should lead the barbarian to the light say meeker it be a dreadful example for christian to set such people they should not be allow to carry such weapon -- the practice lead to crime soup all around rajah say rigg as if to close the subject do you carry deadly weapon mr trenholm do you approve of the bearing of arm i always have a weapon at hand i reply seriously one never can tell when it will be need in this country and i believe in always be ready for a emergency indeed and be it possible that you have a dagger conceal upon you person no dagger but this be my right bower -- tap the butt of the pistol on my right side -- and this be my left bower and i tap my left side mr trego burst out laugh at this much to the discomfiture of meeker who glare at he and edge away from I and do you carry such death-dealing machinery mr trego ask meeker a sneer in the question trego reach for he malacca cane in a instant he have whip it apart and present a delicate point toward meeker who recoil at the suddenness of the unexpected thrust with I at all time say trego when the captain stop laugh and my cabeen -- eet ee one beeg arsenal like you call it in you language yes a pitiable example for the heathen say meeker i trust that you be not arm to the tooth as the expression go captain i do not want to spoil you appetite say rigg of course mr trego need those thing as he be -- a passenger say trego give the captain a quick glance a passenger say rigg blankly to be sure a passenger now mr meeker i wish you would say a grace if it please you meeker bow he head and mumble something which i could not make out besides i be much more interested in a little byplay between captain rigg and trego which begin as soon as meeker and i have piously cast we eye downward it be a signal convey by trego to the captain in which he caution he to silence about something by put he finger to he lip as if some subject be taboo rigg nod as if he understand before meeker have finish trego look at he and scowl to convey to the captain that he do not like the missionary the weather be go to be fine from the way it look now say rigg in a altered tone as if he want to shift the conversation into more congenial line i trust we will all do we best to stay up to the weather in that respect -- quick passage and good company keep everybody on good term and in good spirit he add significantly then he begin give we the stock-joke of the china sea and tell story of he younger day when he have better command than the old _ kut sing _ he be a bluff but likable old sea-dog but i see that he observe meeker closely as he talk and i know that he be none too well take with he so the meal go on well enough night have fall upon we with tropical swiftness and a cooling breeze be blow through the open port charge with the salt tang of the sea the _ kut sing _ be hum along and there be a soothing murmur through the ancient tub as she shoulder the gentle swell of the bay the saloon be cozy and we dally at table chiefly because we do not like to leave while rigg be tell he story although i would have prefer my cigar on deck there be something about the little party in the saloon of the _ kut sing _ that evening that hold my attention to I the air seem charge with a foreboding of something imminent -- something out of the ordinary something to be long remembered i tell myself in a premonition of thing to come that i should always remember captain rigg and the rev luther meeker and trego and rajah and the very pattern of the parti-coloured cloth on the table the creak of the pivot-chair and the picture of the japanese girl in the mineral-water calendar which sway on the bulkhead opposite my seat i can see they now as clearly as if i be back in the old _ kut sing _ with the chatter of the chinese sailor come through the port to spice the tale of the china coast which rigg keep go we pick up corregidor light which wink at we through the port as we enter the channel somebody look in at the door of the passage and rigg wave a napkin at he tell mr harri to call I if he need I he say and then to we : it be clear and mr harri my mate know the boca grande like the palm of he hand he be well launch into another of he long yarn and have a fresh cigar between he tooth when the pitching of the steamer tell we we be head into the china sea we be clear of the channel by the time he have finish the adventure he be relate and trego be begin to fidget we all move as if to leave the table i sign the two man you bring aboard mr meeker say rigg what be they name that i do not know for certain reply meeker i believe the chap in the navy-pantaloons be know as -- buckrow and the other the tall briton be call ` long jim ' or some such name by he companion they both appear to be worthy man and it make I sad to see they on the beach in manila for the need of passage to hong-kong or some other place where they would be more likely to get a ship that be why i intercede in they behalf and it be very kind of you captain to make it possible for they to better themselves for idle man in these port fall into evil and it be best that they should keep to the sea they be both well speak of by mr marley who have charge of the sailor ' home two sailor that i see trego ask the captain mr meeker bring two man aboard with he to carry he gear explain rigg they want to get out of manila and as i be short-handed for chink i let 'em work they passage they sign with the commissioner and will get four hong-kong dollar for the trip trego frown as he toy with a bamboo napkin-ring but say nothing you red-headed chap be a good man at the helm say rigg to I he be get the wheel now and with the other two i 'll have good quartermaster the chinky be poor steerer meester trenholm ee breeng a sailor too demand trego turn he black eye on I in a manner that i could not understand he bring my baggage aboard say i somewhat annoyed he offer he service to captain rigg and be hire and it be no affair of mine the little man with hair of red persist trego decidedly red know as i do that he have charge of the ship -- a fact which he evidently wish to keep from meeker and I judge from he signal to the captain -- i understand in a way he interest in the crew pardon captain say trego abruptly i must go to my cabeen for some cigarette soon i will return i hope you will be here it strike I that he suggestion that captain rigg wait for he be more in the nature of a command than a request rajah serve coffee again and the three of we fall silent it be a awkward situation for we all feel embarrassed -- at least i do as a result of trego 's displeasure over the method of recruit the crew i wish that i have leave petrak on the dock meeker take a old newspaper from he pocket and unfold it on the table carefully i think i have something here which will interest you both he begin it concern -- my glass will you pardon I for a minute while i get my glass from my room i 'll be back presently and he bow himself out the old shark be funny say rigg i hold to what i have say about parson -- i do not like 'em aboard I i glance at the passage and wonder if i would have time to whisper to rigg about meeker before the latter return he want to hold some sort of service for ` ard this evening continue the captain i be suit if the crew be it be not that i be against the sailing direction in the bible mind mr trenholm or a ungodly man for i be a deacon back home in maine i do not like this chap -- he look too slippery to suit I meeker come back and close the bulkhead door behind he adjust he glass and pick up the newspaper as he take he seat my dear sir he resume i want to read this little article to you and then i 'll explain it more fully to you i be sure that you will find it of interest mr trenholm as a literary man and a member of the press even if in no other way and you my dear captain rigg will be interested because it concern the sea and you may have some knowledge of the fact when i be in aden four -- no five year ago it be -- i meet a most remarkable gentleman most remarkable he tell I a story that be pass strange and -- he be interrupt by the bulkhead door fly open violently and rajah with he hand throw up and terror in he eye run toward captain rigg make frantic effort to frame word with he lip sally ann cry rigg in alarm jump up what the devil have happen to give the boy such a turn he be nigh out of he wit rajah pointed to the open door but we could not see into the passage beyond the triangle of light throw out from the gimbal-lamp in the saloon the boy run toward the door and point again and then draw back in fear draw he kris and raise it in a position of defense captain rigg run to the door and i follow he with my hand on my pistol meeker crowd against my shoulder in the dim light ooze into the passage we make out a indistinct figure what in sally ann 's name be this shout rigg dart out and seize the object which he pull toward the light it be the body of mr trego stab to the heart the sailor 's sheath-knife which have kill he still in he fatal wound what the blue blaze do this mean demand captain rigg turn to we as if we could explain the tragedy what in the name of sally ann have happen here tell I that can that be we friend mr trego who be with we but a minute ago ask meeker aghast as he gaze at the waxen feature of the dead man it be mr trego right enough shout rigg it be trego and no doubt of that well i be blow who could have do such a awful thing whisper meeker stare at I with wide-open eye who could have do this do not ask I captain rigg bawl at he do not ask I he be quite dead say meeker lean forward again in the midst of life we be in death he hold he hand over the dead man and say a prayer chapter vi the red-headed man make a accusation that be all very pious and accord to hoyle say captain rigg break into wrath as meeker finish he prayer over the body of trego but i would have you know sir that the _ kut sing _ be no bally chapel and i do not take murder aboard I as a regular custom and let it go at that somebody will have to answer for this at the end of a rope or my name 's not rigg hereafter when there be pray to be do i 'll order it i be merely speed a depart soul say meeker that be all very well mr meeker but i have get to see what this be all about and why -- mr trego be supercargo in charge of the ship and -- rigg stop suddenly when he realize that he have tell we the secret which trego wish keep from we well i have get trouble enough he say confuse at what have happen nothing irregular i trust say meeker raise he eyebrow in mild surprise and observe I cautiously too blast irregular to suit I say rigg gentleman i may as well tell you that this man be down on the passenger-list as a passenger like yourselve but at the last minute before we sail he show papers as supercargo and announce that he be in charge of the ship and that he represent the charter party the truth of he statement be bear out by a messenger from the owner he tell I that he would explain it all as soon as we get to sea and now he have be kill be it any wonder i be upset about it it be pass strange say meeker will you have to turn back to manila on account of this my last order to proceed to hong-kong at the best speed still stand the dutchman rajah -- the dutchman and he make a sign to the malay boy to call the second mate the three of we gather at the end of the table and steady ourselves in the minute we wait for the dutchman who soon come clump down the passage he nearly stumble over the body lie just outside the coaming of the door and then stop and stare at the dead man gott he say and then look at rigg questioningly take the bridge and have mr harri muster the crew -- all hand and look sharp say rigg have every man jack of 'em up here and let we see what they have be about have mr harri muster the crew hear I do not stand there like a barn-owl relieve mr harri and have all hand aft he hurry away and that be the last i ever saw of the second mate of the _ kut sing _ rajah and a chinese sailor spread old canvas close to the door inside the saloon and lift trego 's body on it harri come up the passage and lean against the door he have on a old pair of dungaree trousers and a jacket that have be white and he bare foot be thrust into native heelless slipper this be a nice mess be not it he growl look coldly at the scene before he who let the knife into he that be what we want to find out at once say rigg have all hand up here the watch below and all muster they in the passageway and let they in here one at a time the white hand first we have get to get at the bottom of this affair right away mr harri like as not somebody 'll know the knife cap'n suggest the mate that be it mr harri bring 'em up here with a sharp turn and no lay back and you be here so i can find out what every man have be at in the last quarter of a hour -- you know what this mean we sit down at the table rigg at the end in a pivot-chair swing toward the door of the passage he take off he glass and wipe they in a officious manner and send rajah for a pad of paper and a pencil then this poor mr trego be not a passenger say meeker lean he elbow on the table and scanning rigg closely gentleman begin the captain clear he throat and adjust he silver-rimmed spectacles again i be go to hold a inquiry now and as witness to what take place i think you should know the fact in the case as far as i know they there be something about this business that have carry by with I never have anything like this happen aboard I in the thirty year that i have have a command first time since i have have a master 's ticket that i have not have the full confidence of the owner this man trego be very mysterious and why he want to sail as a passenger when he be supercargo and keep it from you gentleman be past I perhaps i should not have say anything about this end of it until i have examine he papers but as witness i want you to know the fact as they lay a most mysterious affair -- most mysterious agree meeker shake he head and finger he shell crucifix what be the detail of the man 's come aboard captain i be not quite clear on that point he be down as a passenger just as you gentleman be i never see he before until mr harri call I forward before the line be cast off he tell I that this man want to take charge of lade the last of the cargo -- cargo that be manifest as machinery he papers be right and the messenger from the owner make it all as he say it be not for I to question the act of the owner but i should have be advise of the circumstance however mr trego be go to explain it may be all right and nothing out of the ordinary but now that this have happen i be all back and i be leave to guess what it all means if i can what be the cargo ask meeker machinery so far as the manifest say several case -- by george he have it stow in the storeroom -- he be interrupt by harri bawling in the passage and the chinese stoker swarm up the fire-room ladder chatter and yell to they mate below the news of the murder have spread through the ship and have create a great turmoil the mate thrust a man into the doorway whom i recognize as one of the man who have bring meeker 's organ on board here be one of the new man sir say harri say he have be for ` ard since go off watch he be next at the wheel sir now then begin rigg with pencil poise what be you name in the ship 's article buckrow sir say the sailor stare at a lamp and avoid the figure of trego almost at he foot i observe he closely and be not please with he

spell it for the captain who examine the crew list to verify he he say that he be know as long jim by he mate he do not seem to take the murder as a serious matter but answer captain rigg 's question calmly he eye rove over the interior of the saloon take we all in very coolly there be a gleam of amusement in he eye as he look at meeker as if he think it a joke that the missionary should be sit on a inquiry board meeker return he gaze in a disinterested manner sway in he chair with the motion of the ship and fumble he shell crucifix as if it be a talisman to guard he against danger crannish be dismiss and the next be petrak he impudently wink at I as he step into the light and hitch up he trousers in a nonchalant manner that be amusing he have he shoe in he hand and he have evidently dress in a hurry to obey the summons of the mate petrak 's my name sir and they make a joke on my head by make I out ` dago red ' sir be bo 'n in -- he be relieve at eight bell sir have the wheel in the

bunk where i say it be strike I blind captain rigg be nonplussed for a second at this and he hesitate then he look at buckrow who be try to get past harri into the passage again buckrow wait a minute my man where 's you knife my knife say buckrow in amazement my knife yes the knife you have when you be here first where be it now it be not in you belt buckrow reach to he hip and consternation pull

along with you mate here have the body wrap with some firebar mr harri to be bury in the morning that be all double iron mr harri i never do for he and that gent know it wail petrak as harri put he

interfere the gent in the white suit know all about it i do for this chap and the writin ' chap that i bring he bag aboard pay I for it say he would and give I some of the money on deck to-day you see he cap'n -- you see he hand-in ' I the silver sir he be in it too and -- why my dear mr trenholm exclaim meeker get to he foot aghast at the accusation of the little red-headed man my dear sir i could hardly believe such a thing of you and we dine with you -- here you hold up shout rigg what do this mean mr trenholm i remember now that i do see this man take money from you and i tell you not to be tip the crew what have you to say he be to give I ten pound -- shut up roar harri to petrak what have i to say i gasp astounded at the turn of affair and hardly able to believe what i hear from petrak i know nothing about it the man must be crazy i be not so sure of that retort rigg i must confess mr trenholm that i be somewhat surprised to find that you carry two pistol and you must admit that you bring this man on board with you you seem to know he know he the little rat have be follow I about manila all day i think i be to be rid of he until you take he as a member of the crew -- ten pound i be to get for a killin ' of that chap there shriek petrak that be what he be pass I the silver for this day sir they 'll hang I now -- they 'll hang I it look very awkward for you mr trenholm say meeker sadly i be about to denounce the missionary and tell he how i have see he and petrak together much in manila but i be so angry for a minute that i think it better to hold myself in check for the time i stand before they for a few seconds wonder what i should do and then my rage get possession of I and i reach for a pistol intend to hold meeker under the muzzle of it and make he confess he true character and admit that petrak be he friend rather than mine as i throw my hand back my wrist be seize and i turn to see rajah behind I hold my arm in a firm grip he menace I with he kris and grin calmly my dear mr trenholm say meeker smile blandly one crime should serve you purpose for this evening it seem to I captain rigg step up and relieve I of my pistol and i know that i have make a fool of myself by attempt to draw the weapon i be very sorry about this mr trenholm say the captain chapter vii i turn spy myself meeker stand with fold arm and grin at I as he see my pistol take by the captain and for the first time since i have see he he drop he sanctimonious pose and look anything but the decrepit old missionary which he have always seem he shoulder be square and he head throw back and there be mockery in he eye but it be not so much he insolent and triumphant look which take my attention as the manner in which he stand upon the heave deck of the saloon he knee have that limp sea-bend of the sailor and he out-turned toe seem to grasp the uncertain rise and fall of the carpet beneath he foot he be a mariner now not a preacher for no landsman could hold himself so easily in a vessel which pitch and roll in the long swell of the china sea i look at he defiantly and he eye seem to dare I to speak out and say the thing which be in my mind he seem to understand that i be try to frame a denunciation for i be white to the lip with rage at he you seem determine to sail in the _ kut sing _ mr trenholm he say : so you insistence to be a passenger be to slay a fellow-man be it i be shock beyond measure you hound i scream you have play you card well you and you little red-headed scoundrel if you think i be a spy you will find -- tut tut sally ann say captain rigg we can not have any of that hold you tongue sir or i 'll have you in iron if you 'll give I ten minute privately captain i 'll tell you who this devil -- i be a man of the cloth and i will not countenance such language shriek meeker in a attempt to check I but i could see that i have cut he deeply for he whiten and step toward I with close fist do not you call I devil you know nothing of I -- tell it if you will -- what do you know where do you get that name gentleman gentleman say rigg still hold one of my pistol in he hand and keep a eye on the bulkhead door for the return of the mate he be a japanese spy i say he be no missionary at all but a spy and the fool believe that i be in the russian service he try to hold I in manila and when i would not listen to he lie he have take this way to discredit I probably have I hang it be all a plot -- that will do command rigg you have not be try yet mr trenholm you can tell all that to the judge if you go on this way i will be compel to make a prisoner of you i be not take that red chap 's word for what he say about you but if you go on like this i will have to put you in confinement otherwise you will simply be restrict to you cabin until we reach hong-kong i will have to make sure that you have no more arm and if you will promise to remain in you room that will do until this matter be turn over to the court and then you may state you case be you not go to put this man where he can do no more harm ask meeker you can see for yourself that my life will be in danger unless this man be make a prisoner i protest against he be allow he liberty -- i have no desire to be find in my bed as poor mr trego be find here a few minute ago you will be protect say the captain mr harri be that you take mr trenholm here to he room and remove all he luggage and see that he have no more arm even so much as a pocket-knife then lock he in he room i protest against such treatment captain rigg if you will give I ten minute so that i may tell my story i will willingly obey any order you may give even to become a prisoner in my room but i think that it will be better for you to know the fact about this case and what i have learn about this mr meeker in manila and what be it you have learn cry meeker advance on I again in a menacing manner and plainly surprise at what i have say a few thing about you and petrak that captain rigg should know i retort mr harri take mr trenholm to he room and the mate take I by the arm and lead I down the passage as i go out meeker grin after I and whisper something to captain rigg behind he hand harri open the door and thrust I before he into the dark stateroom and command I to light the gimbal-lamp pass I a match when i have the lamp light he take a quick glance inside that man meeker be a spy i begin it be for he that petrak kill trego and all day in manila he and that little fellow be at my heel -- stow that say harri take what you need out of yer gear and hand the rest of it out and mind that thar 's no gun-play about it i be well heeled and if ye make a move i 'll let daylight through yer innards look lively now i take a pair of pajamas and a few toilet-article from my bag he would not let I have my razor or any of the packet of papers or my money belt when he have take my grip he demand my clothes and leave I in my pajamas and lock the door with a growl of caution about monkey-business we hai not takin ' no chance with gent like ye be he say and mind that ye stick close here 'cause we have get a watch outside and the first time we ketch ye up to any dido we 'll have ye below with brass bracelet on with yer pal petrak where ye belong at this he slam the heavy oak door and turn the key in the lock my first emotion be anger and the sense of humiliation i be beat outwit capture by meeker and by my own stupidity but i realize that the battle have but just begin and my first task must be to attempt some defense some counter move against the old fraud who have draw he plot about I for he own mysterious object i berate myself for my conceit in imagine that i could play with such a dangerous man as meeker prove himself to be especially since i have see through he disguise almost from the first one of two thing in manila would have save I from my position -- either i should have tell meeker at once that he be mistake in think I a spy and warn he to keep clear of I or i should have tell the police that i be be annoy by a suspicious character i have have grounds enough for make a complaint against meeker and petrak when i find the little red-headed man sneak outside my door in the hotel and the suppose missionary block my pursuit on the stairway even if the police have give I no satisfaction i could have warn meeker that i would not submit to he espionage -- a hundred way of protect myself from the fellow come into my mind as i sit there on my berth and review what have take place in manila before i ever go on board the _ kut sing _ but that be all past and it do I no good to go over the mistake i have make i be bitter at myself for allow petrak to bring my bag on board for i have thus give he a opportunity to claim I as a ally in the murder the best that i could make of the whole affair be that meeker take I for a spy as i have suspect from the first and in order to prevent I from go to hong-kong for some purpose oppose to the plan of he master have do he best to keep I out of the steamer then when he find that he could not block I in go he do the next best thing and come with I to further embarrass I and prevent I from accomplish the object of my suppose mission in hong-kong he have get I involve in a crime from which i know i would have a great deal of difficulty in get myself free especially as petrak seem willing enough to testify against I even though he should hang for the murder it seem beyond reason that they should kill trego simply to have something of which i might be accuse it seem to I that my own death would have be a easier way to get rid of I i begin a analysis of every event which enter into the total of the mystery seek for some key which would aid I in assort the tangled bit that only need to be arrange properly to bet the solution much as a jig-saw puzzle be work out if i have a proper begin it would all be easy enough the killing of the boatswain in the flagship bar seem significant although i could not connect it with meeker 's plot against I and i have to lay that episode aside until i see it in its proper relation to the other part stand near the lamp i write down on a scrap of paper each event in its proper order from my first sight of meeker that morning as i arrive at the mole from saigon when i have make a note of the delivery of the letter to the russian consul at the bank i find trego and meeker together -- the spy disguise as a missionary seek alms and trego drive he out of the room it be obvious enough to I that in deliver the letter i have walk into some sort of a plot of which i have no knowledge for meeker be not only spy upon I but he be spy upon trego or the bank the next time that trego enter the list be when i be introduce to he in the bank of little importance in itself but worth a great deal when connect with the fact that trego leave manila in the _ kut sing _ and in charge of the ship to the amazement of even captain rigg trego kill as i put that down it flash upon I that he have be strike down before he have tell captain rigg why he have papers as supercargo -- and a few minute after he have show that he be suspicious of meeker i be baffle and realize that it be a waste of effort to attempt to theorize about the snarled web in which i find myself enmesh one thing be apparent enough and that be meeker do he best to keep I out of the _ kut sing _ as he say and i reach the conclusion that it be not I so much as the steamer which concern he when he seek to divert my path from the vessel if i have take he broad hint in manila i would have cancel my ticket and probably never see he again there be little comfort in prove that my own blunder have lead I into such a mess i throw the pencil down and sit on the edge of the lower berth my anger be give way to alarm i begin to realize that perhaps be a prisoner be the safest for I while on the steamer for if meeker have bring about the death of trego because the supercargo suspect he why should he not attempt to kill I after what i have say about he to captain rigg i remember that he have show concern when i offer to tell rigg about he -- he be ready to strike I down on the spot and he plea that i might attack he be make more for the purpose of have I put out of reach of the captain than for he own protection i be still a passenger even though confine to my room and he know that i might find a opportunity to tell my story to rigg at least i be safe for the night and i know nothing could be do in the way of explain thing to rigg before morning i decide that i would ask for paper and write a brief account of meeker and petrak for he and let he judge for himself i blow out the lamp and open the port but hook it so that the heavy brass-rimmed glass act as a shield for I as i lay in the upper berth i have no desire to have a pistol thrust through the port while i be asleep and after what have happen i be ready to see danger in anything the steamer be well to sea and there be a stiff breeze blow which make she pitch and roll heavily she beam and joint groan every time she buck into a sea and the wash at she freeboard and the spray break on the deck outside make a great racket she old engine jolt and jar and vibrate every inch of the _ kut sing _ and i could hear the whir of the propeller as it lift out of the water when she head plunge into a swell but although i try to put everything out of my mind and get some sleep my imagination conjure up possible situation for the next day conference with captain rigg fight with meeker a confession force from petrak that he have lie when he charge I with complicity in the murder i tumble and toss in my berth and count a million sheep jump a fence work at the multiplication table and resort to other device to get into a doze but every new creak every groan of the strain timber keep I wide awake one of the most irritating noise be the grate of some object hang on the bulkhead close to my head i could not hear it when the vessel pitch but when she take a long roll to starboard it rattle a second and then rasp along the board locate the sound in the dark i groped along the plank to find the loose object and my finger come upon a small metal rod i seize it and lift it from a hook and with the tip of my finger find it to be a key bound out of my berth i go to the door with it certain that it be a spare key to the stateroom cautiously i try it in the large old-fashioned lock and it turn back easily i try the knob and the door swing inward i close it again and debate for a minute what i should do and decide that anything could not be worse than lie idle in a cell make up my mind to venture out and call upon captain rigg if i could find he or do a little spy on my own account to learn of any new development since i have be dismiss from the saloon and imprison i hold the door open a few inch for several minute and listen for some suspicious sound in the dark passageway i remember that harri have say something about a guard at the door but although i strain my eye in the darkness i could see no one each end of the passage be cap by a penumbra of dim light for although the sky be overcast the open air be not so dark as the intensify gloom of the passage my courage grow as i stand in the doorway and i step out close the door silently and not lock it but knot the key in the string of my pajamas i listen for a minute at meeker 's door but hear nothing he room be next to mine but further aft with one or more door between he and where the passage give on the open after-deck captain rigg 's room be on the same side but away forward under the end of the bridge close to the open ladder which lead down to the fore-deck in my bare foot i make no noise and slowly make my way forward to see if there be a light in captain rigg 's room before i have go far i hear a murmur of voice and then see a sliver of light from the jamb of a door there be a conversation go on in the captain 's room but i could not distinguish the voice i go on to the forward end of the superstructure and discover a port-hole in the captain 's cabin partly open and by go up three step of the bridge-ladder i have a partial view of the room captain rigg be fully dress and sit at a shelf which drop from the wall he be sort out papers and harri the mate be stand over he talk you must be mistaken mr harri i hear the captain say make I third cook if i be exclaim harri who seem to be in a irritable mood i know what i be talk about cap'n i run my thumbnail along the edge of it sally ann 's black cat mr harri all i ask ye to do cap'n be come down and have a look at it for yerself that be what this be all about i be tellin ' ye we get somethin' on we hand i tell ye we have get to do somethin' about it right away or we 'll have more trouble what if the crew smell a rat you get a little too excited about that murder mr harri i would know all about that the owner would not send I to sea with such as you say and say nothing to I nor the charter party either they would use a liner and about forty man for anything like that i be crazy enough now what with this murder and mess without get myself stir up over anything like that you better get some sleep we 'll find in the morning that you make a mistake but i have a light on it insist harri it be thar i tell ye and i make sure i do not come botherin ' of ye with no cock-and-bull story like this unless i know i hold a bull 's - eye light on it and it show plain as cape cod light one of they chist get spring and i think maybe i would make a mistake when i put the light on it but when i rub my thumbnail on it i know i be right i know the feel i tell ye every cuss one of 'em be the same too i tell you mr harri i have have tomfoolery enough for one night and i be not go down in the hold and dig around in cargo and get the crew suspicious they be stir up enough as it be with what be go on to-night and i guess that be what ail you cuss it all cap'n rigg exclaim harri in exasperation ye ought to know i do not get gally for a little blood spill i slep ' in a bunk all one night in the _ martha pillsbury _ with a man what do not have any head and never turn a hair ye know that old barkentine whaler that cap'n peabody sell dang it all cap'n that be what this man trego come aboard as he do -- that be what he be here fer it come down at the last minute and he boss the job of gettin ' it aboard would not let a man touch it but have he own chink from shore-side get it aboard with sling from the davit and watch 'em stow it in the storeroom it be not in the hold when i come across the key to the room i make up my mind i would have a look at it tin milk marked tinned milk i say tinned milk hell i wash my hand o ' the whole cuss mess if ye do not look at it and see for yerself i do not want the responsibility and we have get to take some precaution that be what the killin ' be for and i 'll bet a clipper-ship to a doughnut-hole that writin ' chap trenhum know about it and he be not no writin ' chap neither thar have be bad business and there 'll be more from what be below mark my word come below and look at it you look it over in good shape with a light say captain rigg evidently in doubt as to what he should do it ought to be on the manifest you know mr harri cuss the manifest it be down as machinery and marked tinned milk what more ye want they get thing switch somehow and that be plain as the nose on yer face i have my thumb on it i tell ye then if that be true it explain why mr trego be so mysterious and why he want to be a passenger to the other that be what he be aboard for right enough and like as not he would have tell I if he have be leave alive long enough it do not strike I reasonable that he would keep anything like that from I -- not with the way thing be go these day the master of the vessel ought to know in a case like that and a scraped-up crew rigg begin to button he coat of course that be what he be so close-jawed for and that be why the owner be so close-jawed like as not they do not know -- charter be for cargo and they do not bother they head about that part of it some sort of a sneak game about it of course but we have get to mind we p 's and q 's now the owner nor the charter party can not help we none with it now say i and as master ye be get to do as ye see fit all this monkey-business to-night come from it i do not like the passenger and i do not like these new whites in the crew they know one another i be tellin ' ye the long chap and buckrow sail with petrak they pretend they do not know one another -- all bosh -- thick as flea when no one be a watchin ' of 'em see how buckrow be so smart handin ' over he knife to the red chap when he get in a jam i say where do we git they three jewel -- the writin ' chap bring the little red killer and the parson bring the long fellow and buckrow look funny to I cap'n -- and we do not want no devil 's admiral aboard of we mr harri exclaim captain rigg get to he foot you be not fool enough to believe story about the devil 's admiral be you that be all newspaper talk and water-front gossip i be not so doggone sure about that cap'n -- bein ' gossip of course i do not suspect nothin ' like that aboard here but from what chip aker tell I before he die after the loss of the _ southern cross _ i be not so sure this devil 's - admiral talk be all folderol chip could not tell much before he go under but the _ southern cross _ be board by the devil 's admiral sure enough -- do not they find a sextant out of she in a store in shanghaus ship that go down in typhoon do not have they chronometer pop up in shanghai a year later i be tellin ' ye there be not nobody ever see this here devil 's admiral sure enough that live to tell it but ship do not always go down in deep water and never a boat get off or a life-preserver or a spar or a door find on the beach thar 's be bloody work in the last three or four year in these water -- look at the _ legaspus _ never a man jack out of she and sail from manila as we do for hong-kong and never hear of steamer she be too right in the steamer-lane they say the devil 's admiral get she and i more 'n half believe it sally ann sally ann say captain rigg i guess i better go down mr harri and look this thing over and get it off yer mind or ye 'll be fret yerself and lose sleep with such yarn run wild in yer top-piece i do not like this night prowl a mite but take the bull 's - eye along and never a bit of light until we be in the storeroom i do not want the crew hug we heel on this trip below 'cause ye may be right about it at that be sure the slide be shut in that lantern and call the boy to watch for we be sure that glim be douse -- i do not want anybody to know about this i slip off the ladder and clung to the superstructure out of the range of the light which spurt from the open door as harri come out he go aft for rajah and when he return in a minute captain rigg be stand at the head of the fore-deck ladder wait for they harri whisper something and i see the three figure descend to the fore-deck and hear they enter the companionway to the lower deck i follow they chapter viii mr harri have a few idea clutch the iron hand-rail of the ladder lead to the fore-deck i go down as quickly as i could for half a minute i stand on the wet plate of the deck drench by the spray which sweep the head of the vessel every time she lurch forward into the sea above I i could make out the dim shape of the bridge and superstructure and i could hear the wind slatt the storm-apron lash along the bridge-rail and the singing of the funnel-stay but it be so black overhead that i could not distinguish any figure on the bridge the forecastle-head could barely be make out and the winch-wheel and ventilator on deck be inchoate mass which take shape only when they be within reach the green starboard-light throw a sickly glare over the surge which rise to the rail i have to feel my way along and not release my grip until i have find a hold on something else if it be dark on deck the appalling gloom below be terrifying and nothing seem stable -- there be time when i mistake the bulkhead for the deck when the vessel take a long roll and labor to right herself i find myself in a maze of stanchion below and after i have pass under the hood of the companionway lose my bearing for a time until i discover that i have to turn aft to make any progress everything seem to be make as much of a clatter as possible between deck and i seem to be directly over the engine fire-door be clang close at hand and the chinese fireman be bawl behind a bulkhead so my difficulty be not so much to keep silent myself as to recognize sound which would give I a clue as to where captain rigg and the other have go for a time i be on the point of get back to the deck above for it be a foolhardy business with nothing to gain that i could see and no end of trouble if i should be catch stalk captain rigg on he mysterious expedition to the storeroom my silk pajamas now thoroughly wet clung to I and the salt water begin to sting and my wet stocking be sticky and uncomfortable and form bunch under my toe but i keep they on for the little protection they afford my foot but i keep crawl aft until i come squarely against a solid wall and know it for the bulkhead of the forward part of the superstructure as i be in some sort of a passage it must lead to a door and i fumble to find its outline i find the knob although it seem to be on the wrong side as thing will in the dark and i try the door but it be fast just as i be about to turn away i detect the sound of voice behind it and know that rigg and the mate be inside and that i have find the room which contain the mysterious cargo bind to know what they be talk about i make another effort to open the door a little i do not succeed but i find a big key protrude beneath the knob and draw it out so i could hear better and even get a glimpse of the interior all be dark inside except for a small circle of light throw against the bulkhead in such a way as to illumine a box which be brace against the wall i know this light come from the bull 's - eye lantern and that if i open the door a inch or so those inside could not detect it but when i try the key i find that the door be unlock but hook inside so i take the key out again and put it down on the deck and take another survey of the limited portion of the room visible to I i could hear harri talk in a low tone and captain rigg ask question and by put my ear to the keyhole i hear enough to get the drift of they conversation although in this position i could not see what they be do tinned milk say harri and he laugh let the boy hold the light say the captain pry it open a bit more harri and let I have a good square look at it i do not believe there be more than one box at that -- which would not be no great trouble for we make a devil of a racket to git it break open say harri use some sort of a tool on a box thar 's two chist here to tell the truth about it one be heavier than t ` other and bind with iron strip and this outside one be cleat with tin i 'll rip the whole work open cap'n if ye say the word no no mr harri sally ann not that just enough so i can see and have no doubt about it -- i do not want no guesswork they make it fast right enough growl harri i never see no tinned milk nurse so particular as this blow I if i do but when i start this side so 's i could get my thumb in i be jerry smith -- here cap'n -- quick while i hold this side out -- put you thumb in there and feel the aidge it feel like it take the light from the boy and hold it down so i can get a look at it -- no let he keep it mr harri -- you hold the board out so i can see it in good shape -- down rajah down low so i try to see what they be do but all i could make out be captain rigg as he bent low between I and the object on which the light be turn i put my ear back to the keyhole sally ann sally ann i hear captain rigg exclaim and then he whistle blast I if ye be not right mr harri i know i be right growl harri can not fool I with that -- it feel like it and look like it and that man trego fit into the game to a t i think he be a mighty shady customer from the first look i get at he when he come alongside and boss thing when he get that knife throw in he i think i would come down here and have a look around on my own hook and thar ye be cap'n but sally ann what be we go to do with it we can not leave it here can we maybe it would be better at that say harri but i look at it this way cap'n -- somebody know it be here that be what maybe the parson maybe that mr trenhum maybe petrak know about it maybe buckrow and long jim know but anyhow whoever have that knife hook into trego know and ye can put that in yer pipe and smoke it but i do not believe anybody would broach cargo we can keep the door lock and bury this under a mess of stuff say spare chain and a lot of old heavy gear broach tophet snort harris ye call this cargo cap'n rigg wal if ye do i do not broach cargo think a man that would kill trego or get he kill would stop at broach cargo to git he paw on this that be true enough say rigg it be bad business to have it aboard mr harri i hope nobody in the ship know about it if they find out it may lead to trouble and i be too old to have trouble with my ship now i have have trouble enough this night as it be -- that be not the idea at all cap'n say harri entirely out of patience ye have have trouble already and all over this and ye 'll have more of it and ye can not avoid it we get some pretty fancy passenger aboard and i 'll bet my shirt the parson and mr trenhum know and what be more that parson be not no more a parson than i be -- if he be a parson i be a bishop now they two bring a bad lot aboard with 'em -- petrak thar in iron and this buckrow and long jim it do look queer admit rigg trego have he suspicion all the time cap'n they get he before he could tell ye what he guess trego never like the both of 'em when ye come to look this thing over in yer mind a little at a time it git plain to I ye see the parson bring long jim and buckrow and tryhum or whatever he name be brung petrak to do he part of the dirty work now look what i be sayin ' cap'n we get short-handed quick thar in manila do not we i be turnin ' that over in my mind too somebody cut the boatswain do not they the police get that lascar quartermaster who we have for lampman do not they that be two man go be not it look a here the police come aboard lookin ' for a little red-headed sailor they say do the killin ' and i tell 'em they be dreamin ' but they say the lampman who they take for the murder blame it on a little red-headed sailor i just tell 'em i guess the lampman be they man and they say a parson tell 'em he do the killin ' but they want to find this little red-headed sailor 'cause he have some hand in it so some witness say see what i be drivin ' at i do not know about no red-headed man and i do not want to we have to get out of manila and i do not want to be monkeyin ' around with no court nor judge and i let the police have they own say and agree with 'em when i see a chance to keep clear and disagree when i see it would delay we to get tangle up in the killin ' of the bo 'n well i do not see what all that have get to do with this say captain rigg ye do not look a here one of we man cut up a red-headed little sailor have a hand in it of some sort a parson tell the police we lampman do it and thar go another of we hand who do we git in they place a parson for a passenger and two man of he own he bring aboard look like he make room for 'em cap'n you have be read book say captain rigg what i need be a mate not a detective but go on mr harri -- maybe ye be right -- i be get old and trustful that be not my main p ` int either continue harri what i mean be this -- come to think it over the lampman do not leave the ship 's side until after the greek be cut up ashore it be the parson who put the police on to the lampman this same parson mr harri ye be not sure about that oh shucks think thar 's fourteen thousand parson runnin ' around manila with a red-headed sailor that be too handy by far with a knife be not i get brain in my head he have to make room for he pal aboard here do not he it be plain as cape cod light to I cap'n well what do it all mean you suppose this be what they want ye do not guess they kill the bo 'n and this trego just for friendship sake do ye if ye want to know what my personal private feeling be it look like we have be board by the devil 's admiral sally ann 's black cat say rigg that story be start by some sea-lawyer full of gin and the newspaper take it up for fun there be not no more a devil 's admiral than there be a _ fly dutchman _ wal do not i see the _ fly dutchman _ off the cape with my own eye when i be second in the brig _ peerless _ ye can not tell I thar be not no _ fly dutchman _ and ye can not make I believe thar be not no devil 's admiral -- i have be tell some thing about both of 'em and dang I for a blue-nose fisherman if i do not believe in 'em both who be you devil 's admiral aboard here then the parson you be full of hashish you be bother lately with you head mr harri that be all right cap'n when a man look overside and say ten knot and better and the log say ten knot and a shade he be not no landsman he spit to looward like a commodore that parson and i have have my suspicion right along all buncombe you be readin ' too many manila newspaper yes and i see a few thing on deck too that be not get nothin ' to do with newspaper petrak buckrow and the long lime-juicer be all pretty thick when no one be lookin ' at 'em and they do not let on to know each other neither askin ' one another they name when i be standin ' by and soon as my back be turn thick as fly at a molasses-barrel sneakin ' round and whisperin ' ` who be the red chap ' ask long jim from buckrow when he know i can hear ` say he be out of a collier ' say buckrow speakin ' loud a purpose so i can hear the next i know cap'n reddy be tellin ' long jim that buckrow never pay he that two bob for a round of drink in the flagship bar before the cuttin ' do not that sound funny then when petrak take the wheel i ask he if he know long jim and he say not afore he come aboard and buckrow say the same they all lie and ye remember how buckrow help petrak with a knife when he be in a tight jam thar at the door i put two and two together and i be here ezra harris you mate to tell ye that they make four and ye can not git away from it -- and what be more this trenjum be in with the parson and the other three devil 's admiral or no it do not look nice to I do you think buckrow and the other two know about this mr harri it be not clear to I so far as that go but trenjum and the parson do i look at it this way -- they know ye do not know and that trego might tell ye so they up and let a knife into he before he can tell and then we be up in the air if i have not find it they would keep we guessin ' until they be ready to get in some more fancy work the lord know what that trenjum be a slick customer -- i do not believe he ever writ anything for a newspaper anyway -- he be too tall and strong-lookin ' to make he livin ' with a pencil this trenjum and the parson be in together for all of they lettin ' on they do not like one another what business have a writin ' chap with he breeches full of pistol like he have in the saloon ye can not tell I writin ' chap eat they meal with gun enough in they clothes to arm a landin ' - party no sir a pretty pickle sally ann but i have get a nice mess aboard I and i be hang if i know what it be all go to come to i have half a mind to throw the whole lot in iron and work the ship with the chink now ye be talkin ' like somebody say harri but go slow and git 'em one at a time when it be convenient so they will not suspect nothin ' if ye go after the whole gang at once i 'll bet ye have a fight on yer hand grab one and then the other so ye 'll git 'em separate : and keep 'em separate so they can not talk it over or ye 'll have a peck of trouble on yer hand it be no small matter to put passenger in iron mr harri they would make trouble for I when they get into port they 'll make a cuss sight more trouble for ye aboard here be my way of lookin ' at it we get petrak anyway for a start he say trenjum get he to do it and trenjum tell ye meeker have a hand in it just say one accuse the other and when ye come to find this aboard ye have to put 'em in iron 'cause it look like they be hatchin ' mutiny in the crew then we 'll slam the other two in iron on suspicion and they bein ' crew ye get a right to do that what be the good o ' bein ' master if ye can not protect yerself and yer ship trenjum be safe enough as it go for now but i would make he fast below when we have the other and see what sort of a talk he put up if we git 'em to tellin ' on one another then we have get the whole yarn out and ye will not have no trouble with the port authority do not that sound sensible to ye i do not see any other way out of it say rigg i suppose the best thing to do be to go up and take the parson he room be next to mr trenholm 's the two of 'em will know what be go on but we do not care then we 'll take buckrow and long jim i guess ye would see it that way cap'n i be willin ' to stand double watch and take the wheel myself and with the dutchman doin ' the same we 'll manage to get the old packet to port right enough we 'll go right up say captain rigg and i hear they move toward the door blow out that stink lantern say rigg for a instant i have a wild idea of take the key and lock they in and then make term with the captain and argue he out of the conviction that i be in league with meeker and offering my service in capture the other but i know harri could not be convince that i be not in whatever plot be afoot and that i could put no faith in any agreement captain rigg might make while the mate be with he besides i have bear out the mate 's suspicion by be below spy upon they and the wiser course would be for I to get back to my stateroom and let they find I there then i might be able to discuss the whole affair with they and prove that i be the victim of a plot myself as it be i have linger at the door too long and harri lift the hook inside and nearly step on I as he stumble into the dark passage i crawl out of he path so that when the three of they come out they be between I and the companionway to the upper deck where 's the cuss key whisper harri i think i leave it in the door light a match say rigg and he begin to move he foot along the deck sure you do not put it in you pocket mr harri who be that cry harri suddenly and i be sure he have see I crouch against the bulkhead i be about to surrender myself and explain my presence below when i hear the patter of foot and somebody bound up the ladder and crash into a ventilator as he gain the deck above somebody be listen i 'll bet my hat say harri i have get the key -- it drop out he lock the door and they hurry down the passage rigg tell rajah to go get he and then i hear they run forward toward the forecastle as they get on deck i run for the ladder as best i could glad of the chance to get out of the black hole and wonder who could have be down there with I i step upon something which slip from under I and i go down sprawling sure that i have gash my foot for i have feel a sharp edge as i fall i find that my stock be not cut and be get to my foot again when my hand come in contact with the object which have trip I i have step upon a large shell crucifix chapter ix a fight in the dark daze for a minute by the discovery that meeker have be lurk in the passage while i be listen to captain rigg and harri in the storeroom i lean against the companionway and finger the shell crucifix wonder how near meeker have come to make a end of I of course the finding of the crucifix down there and the man who run up the ladder when surprise by rigg mean nothing else but that meeker have be below either before or after i follow the ship 's officer down the fact that he be between I and the companionway be proof enough that he have come after i have take my position at the keyhole of the storeroom but if i be incline to make theory and draw conclusion about meeker there be other thing go on to distract my attention there be much shouting and run on deck and before go up i listen in the hope of learn what be take place but the roar of the sea the throb of the engine and the thumping of my own heart prevent I from make any sense of the tumult above i have a fear that rigg have discover that i be miss from my room and that he have find meeker likewise absent from he quarter no matter what have come about i be in peril as long as i remain where i be both from rigg and harri and from meeker and he assassin and no matter which side win above whether meeker be take or rigg and harri kill i would be regard as a enemy by the victor the best thing for I to do be to surrender to rigg at once and secure my pistol that i might get into the fight with he against meeker and he henchman that seem to be a easy solution of my trouble until i consider that rigg and harri be certain that i be the most dangerous man on board before i could say a word i might be seize and iron if not shoot on sight perhaps the wiser course would be to get to my room and barricade myself until affair be more settle or until we have the light of day and i could know with whom i be deal with one hand on the rail of the ladder and the other clutch the crucifix i debate with myself about what i should do while above I i could hear rigg and harri yell to one another although i could not make out what they be say i hear harri say something about the parson and there be shout from the bridge and all hand seem to be run over the main-deck like madman i start up the ladder bent upon learn what be happen and watch my chance to slip back to my room through the darkness before i have go three step i be halt by a terrific noise between deck in the direction of the storeroom several heavy blow be strike in rapid succession against a bulkhead follow by a rend crash and splinter timber a iron bar ring on the deck-plate as it be throw down and there be a rattle of chain go down the ladder again i crouch in a corner for i be sure that the racket below would attract the attention of rigg and harri and that they would be down to investigate i would have wager that some one have break into the storeroom contain the mysterious cargo whisper reach my ear from the end of the passage and then i hear petrak yell in he fretful whining way : hold it down bucky hold it down ye beggar it be my bleedin ' hand ye get will ye mind dry up about the paw say a voice lucky for ye it be not yer neck in a rope can not break the chain can i ` thout givin ' ye a twist ye fool there it be now -- right aft and on deck red and follow I close we 'll git 'em off right enough when ye git above deck what be matter if yer flipper be clear something rush toward I in the dark and again i hear the musical tinkle that make I think of chain-armour i press my body against the board to be clear of the ladder and make out the figure of a man crouch down and feel he way along the passage he stumble up the ladder and then i hear petrak close behind he pant and cursing and the break chain on he hand rasp along the bulkhead wait for I can not ye bucky wait for I stop a bit and give I a hand up -- oh come along and stow the gab call buckrow from the head of the companion but in suppress tone keep yer lip shut the afterguard be on deck here and i do not know where thirkle be slip along and give we a hand with a knife or a gun look like we 'll settle the business quick now petrak go up the ladder he progress over each iron step plain to I by the jingle of the chain dangle from he wrist and before i have settle in my mind what have happen the pair of they be go buckrow have rescue the little red-headed man from the ship 's brig i crawl up the ladder still hold the crucifix for it be the only thing in the form of a weapon i possess and the manner in which i grip it improvise it into a hilted dagger although i remember keep it more for evidence against meeker than for any other purpose if the sly rascal be still make a fool of rigg or deny that he have be below i feel that he crucifix would be proof against he which he could not deny when i emerge from the hood of the companionway i find a high wind be drenching the deck with spray and everything be black and wet and slippery the vessel be labor and although there be nothing that could be call a storm she be buck into head-swell that rattle she from stem to stern and the gust of wind whip the tip of the wave across she fore-deck spitefully and without warn there be probably twenty foot of open well-deck between I and the foot of the ladder lead to the saloon-deck and then i have the dark passageway to traverse for another thirty or forty foot aft before i could gain my room i brace myself between the hood of the companion and a thrumming ventilator and listen for some hostile sound i be conscious of dim form all about I although i could not see they and i feel as if i have blunder into a desperate game of hide-and-seek thrust my hand before I into the darkness i stumble toward the ladder as i be about to grasp it i encounter a wet jacket and the next instant i find myself grip in a pair of arm the finger of my enemy shut on the light fabric of my pajama-jacket i strike at he with the point of the crucifix and land a glance blow in he face for the knuckle of my hand brush he jaw the sharp edge must have cut he for he utter a stifled groan and as he recoil from I partly from my blow and partly as the result of a deep roll of the vessel i wriggle out of my jacket and run forward in my flight i bumped into ventilator stumble over a hatch-coaming and pull myself along the sway rail-chain toward the bow of the vessel in the scuffle i have lose the crucifix but i have also escape from the man who have grab I and while i be in a panic and do not know where i be go i hope to be able to regain the ladder on the port side and get back to my room once i have throw my assailant off my track i reach the break of the forecastle head but do not go into the bow because i know i could not hope to escape from they if i do not keep open some means of retreat i halt at the closed scuttle of the forecastle for from there i could have my choice of get aft again along either rail i clung to the wooden hood naked to the waist and sweep continually by the spindrift from the sea which meet the vessel as my eye grow more accustomed to the darkness i could distinguish the outline of the machinery on deck the foremast and the companionway forward of the superstructure i could make out the bridge and the funnel well enough to see a figure move over the rim of the storm-apron the vessel roll and the side-light throw red and green glare over the sea on either side as i stand there wait for some sound which might tell I the position of the mysterious man who have attack I eight bell be strike on the bridge and i know it be midnight i expect that there would be some answer from the bow as there should be a man on lookout there and the faint double note of the bell in the wheel-house should have be repeat from the ship 's bell near to where i stand i have about decide to make another sortie toward the ladder when i hear a commotion on the bridge and then a yell as a man might give who have be stricken suddenly with death it chill my blood for i know that another blow have be strike which take another life on board the _ kut sing _ and i realize that the striking of the bell have be a sort of signal for the assassin after a minute i hear harri bawl : the dutchman have be kill ho cap'n -- the dutchman have be knife on the bridge the devil and all ye say shout captain rigg from the fore-deck and i hear he clamber up the ladder and know it must have be he who grab I as i be about to gain the upper deck who be it mr harri what in god 's name be this mr harri mutiny be this mutiny aboard I he be mount to the bridge they get the dutchman repeat harri they do for he -- he be dead as a red mackerel it be mutiny mr harri say the captain ye know cuss well what it be shout harri as loudly as though captain rigg be still below i come up to take the watch and find the dutchman hangin ' over the port ladder bleedin ' like a dead goose more work of yer fine passenger that be what it be and ye know why a lantern flicker above the storm-apron and then swing in the break of the bridge-rail at the ladder-head and i see harri move something which hang limply as he drag it behind the canvas there be a wrathful conference as the two of they inspect the body of the second mate and as i watch i see a lancelike tongue of fire outside the halo of light cast up from the lantern follow by the report of a pistol shot which reach my ear after i have see the flash for the wind check the sound on top of this come a rip rending noise and the figure of a man swing to the lower deck carry with he a portion of the storm-apron which volley in the wind for a minute and then be sweep away as he let go of it there they go bellowed harri come on cap'n we 'll git the hound now and he lead the captain down the bridge-ladder rigg still carry the lantern which swing crazily as he drop three step at a time w ` ere the bloody ` ell be ye bucky call a voice which i know to be that of long jim w ` ere be ye i s ' y ye miss ` im ye fool miss ` im dead jolly nice mess ye make of it be be ye bucky shut yer bloomin ' face growl buckrow what if i do miss he it be you that spoil my aim fall against the lashing as ye do so the blast thing carry

one of the murderer and so prove to rigg that i be not in league with they this impulse to aid the captain 's side of the fight come to I swiftly and i put it into action at once by jump directly in long jim 's path at the head of the forecastle ladder i plan to grab he arm and hurl he back yell at the same time to harri not to shoot that it be i trenholm and that i be hold long jim it be a foolish enough thing to do for in the excitement of the minute harri would have undoubtedly shoot I and long jim too and with good reason for he would have suspect a trap if i have ask he to hold he fire and approach we in the dark as it happen long jim be throw himself forward in a sort of dive beneath the hood of the scuttle just as i thrust my body against the open he shoulder catch I in the stomach and my head and foot fly out and we grab each other and go tumble down the old wooden companion together and roll into the black forecastle blime I i think ye be down afore I bucky gasp long

what they be say i lay under the bunk at the very foot of buckrow daze and bruise from my fall yet keenly aware of the situation and strangely cool thrill and fascinate with the drama be play about I i know that i have small chance of escape with my life if my presence should be discover by the man who lay in wait for harri and the captain but it be not fear which keep I a auditor when i might well have be a actor to good purpose i desire to see what would be the end of the act and far from be terrorize as i should have be i enjoy the invisible scene it be not that i be unmindful of the danger but that i be surprise at myself for feel no fear i 'll give all hand a minute to get up and if they be not i 'll be down thunder harri i know yer down thar buckrow along with jim and the red

then he crash down the wooden ladder the forecastle be illumine by a flash and buckrow 's pistol boom and then a second flash on the other side of the forecastle show I the face of the rev luther meeker at the entrance to the forecastle behind a pistol which have send a second bullet at the mate and the rev luther meeker be the man who have be address as thirkle and who seem to be in command of the other something roll into the smoke-laden hole and sprawl on the plank near I and i could hear it gasping and choke leggo my coat cap'n leggo my coat say the form and i know it be harris wound to death in a minute he be still and then the scuttle above rattle peremptorily mr harri be ye hurt mr harri oh mr harri we get he all right whisper buckrow that settle mr matey well and good hey

scuttle good lord be not i to have no officer what be to become of my ship with such a crew aboard I sally ann sally ann come on down cap'n say a voice startlingly like harri 's it be meeker or thirkle as he man call he imitate the high-pitched nasal twang of the dead mate that you harri cry rigg hopefully what be the matter mr harri i hurt myself cap'n come on down plead thirkle in a constrain voice like a man in pain i do for buckrow but i hurt my rib why do not ye come down i can not navigate this way -- i be hurt who be my mate in the _ jennie lee _ demand rigg tell I that mr

ship we can let the fire-room chink and the nigger go until morning we 'll take the bridge and keep the old tub go until day and then pick out a good place to drop she when we have get what we want petrak 's get the wheel now and we can do for the chink come day bless if i know what have become of trenholm but we 'll find he in time and attend to he proper remember : make for the bridge once we have get the skipper quick now the three of they sneak up the companionway chapter x the devil 's admiral for several minute i listen breathlessly wait for some sound which would indicate that captain rigg have be kill or capture by the three who have go up the companionway after he but when i hear no cry or shot or sound of a struggle i begin to formulate plan for get back to my room or find the captain and beg he to let I help he fight against thirkle and he man lie huddle under the bunk in the bilge-water which swing from side to side as the vessel roll i must admit that i would have present a sorry spectacle to any one who could have see I clad only in the trousers of my pajamas and suggest anything but a fight man but in spite of the poor part i have take so far in the fighting i have no fear of a encounter with the man who seem likely enough to take possession of the _ kut sing _ and murder all on board i tell myself that it be not my fault that i have be strip of my arm and make a prisoner and blame captain rigg for allow thirkle -- in the character of the rev luther meeker -- to throw all the suspicion of the murder of trego on I and hold he own liberty and good-standing as a passenger i fully realize the danger which confront I and the ship and as i crawl from under the bunk in the forecastle i have little hope of ever escape from the vessel alive it be no time to go over past mistake no time to moan over what have happen i long for action but with both captain rigg and thirkle and he man against I it look as if i would have little chance no matter which side be victorious in the battle that be be fight for the ship i have to crawl over the body of the mate in order to get clear of the tier of bunk and think it possible that harri might have a pistol in he clothing or have drop one as he fall into the forecastle i examine he pocket i get no pistol but do find a box of match and stand with my back to the scuttle to protect the flame from the wind and also to shade the light from the open scuttle i strike a match and hurriedly look over the litter deck of the forecastle i strike several match at interval in this way wait between light to make sure that no one have see the flash from the upper deck if harri have have pistol he murderer must have take they i do find a dozen or more cartridge of heavy calibre loose in the side-pocket of he coat but those and the match be all that result from my ghoulish work in the brief illuminations of the forecastle i have see clothing of the crew hang from nail and i dress myself in light-blue nankeen frock and trousers which have belong to a chinese sailor for the jacket button in the back and smell strongly of opium as do the whole forecastle the port be all fast but leak and what little air come in descend through the scuttle so the place still reek with acrid powder-smoke that bite the throat and eye the deck be strew with pannier and cup that clatter to and fro with the motion of the ship the water under foot and the accumulation of refuse rice and food make it difficult to keep a footing without cling to the bunk at either side there be a slush-lamp swinging from a string and i have a mind to light its rope wick and search through the chest for a weapon but i do not want to remain too long below although i could not bring myself to leave empty-handed the only place which offer a weapon make a hasty search in the dark i find a broken knife and a iron belaying-pin the knife-blade be break within a couple of inch of the handle but diagonally from the point so that it present a end that might be dangerous at close quarter ten minute be probably spend in my exploration of the forecastle although in my nervous haste it seem a hour and i stop frequently to listen for intruder and for some indication of how the fight be go on deck with the handle of the belaying-pin grip in one hand and the knife in the pocket of my nankeen jacket ready for a emergency i feel my way along the port side toward the foot of the companion determine to get out of the stink hole and try my chance in the open my plan be to find rigg if i could and if he be besiege attack thirkle and he man from the rear although i know full well my disadvantage against they arm as they be with plenty of pistol but i trust to the darkness and hope that i might outwit they by a bluff that i also have firearm unless i could outmanoeuvre they before daylight and join force with rigg i know we have small chance against they in daylight if indeed they have not already eliminate the captain from the fight i have a gleeful picture of myself challenging thirkle in the dark and urge he and buckrow long jim and petrak to come and take I tell they at the same time that i would give they shoot for shot and caution my imaginary force to hold fire until the enemy be close at hand i imagine that a bold manner and the surprise they would receive at my appearance in the fight would diminish they confidence and give they a wholesome respect for I until i could gain the saloon-deck and ally myself with rigg then all my brave plan go to smash as i hear some one sneak down the companionway for a instant i be in a panic of terror and chagrin that i have linger long enough to give the enemy time to return but i determine that i might as well fight there as anywhere else and brace myself against the bunk i draw my knife and raise the belaying-pin prepare to begin the attack as soon as my visitor get within reach i could hear he breathe gently as he come down one step at a time and from the light smack on each succeed board i know that he be barefoot he be feel he way along as if in strange territory and i know that it could be neither one of the chinese crew nor one of thirkle 's band as i stand there wait for he to come within reach i hear a peculiar fluttering which puzzle I until my memory serve I and i remember that this queer swish sound belong to rajah the dumb malay mess-boy i know it must be rajah probably seek for rigg but i also know that he would have he deadly kris and i shiver for myself at the prospect of be deal a blow from that awful irregular blade which he could wield so expertly now i do not want to kill or wind rajah for if rigg be still alive the boy would be a valuable member of we party and if rigg be dead i hope that i might win the boy to my side i could have strike he down with the heavy iron pin as he grope he way out of the companion but there would be small satisfaction in kill he for it would simply be do a job which would please thirkle and make he task of take the ship all the easier neither do i expect to be able to explain to the malay that i be not he enemy for he could not make any reply to my pleading and the only answer i might get would be the awful kris i thought of crouching in he path and adopt football tactic -- tackle he low as soon as he stumble upon I but that way have its danger for he would undoubtedly have he knife and would make short work of I before i could overpower he as it happen i have no choice in the matter and we come together suddenly and unexpectedly with a lurch of the vessel he be nearer to I than i imagine and as he throw up he knife-arm toward the bunk the blade clang against the board and he shoulder strike I i grab for he wrist and at the same time drop the pin which must have fall on he foot twist he arm i make he drop the kris and then as i flung he backward over a chest go with he and startle by the attack i have he pinion to the deck and helpless before he know what have happen rajah rajah i whisper frantically as he attempt to squirm out of my grasp number four number four good man -- no fight number four that be my number at the saloon-table and i think he must recognize I by that he hiss in the manner which he have to convey that he understand a order but i hold he as gently as i could for a minute and try to demonstrate to he that i mean he no harm and speak the peace-language of pidgin-english common enough in the orient he lay quiet and make no resistance hiss and i let go of he and fumble for he kris i find it and then pat he head as he still lay upon the deck and he pat my hand in turn and kiss it and then i give he he blade at which he be overjoyed i strike a match then that he might see I and by sign-language try to make he understand that we should go on deck and search for thirkle and the other before we have finish we silent parley i hear a noise at the scuttle and then rigg whisper : rajah rajah i be wonder what i should say to he afraid that i might frighten he away again or that when he recognize my voice he would be all the more convinced that i be against he or make some startle exclamation which would betray he presence to thirkle and also give he the information of my whereabouts before i make any sound rajah have rap a signal to he and i hear he come down rajah scratch my hand and feel for the matchbox in my pocket and as captain rigg reach the foot of the companion i strike a match and hold it before my face between rajah and myself good god cry rigg and he back toward the companion hold up he hand in terror as he think that i have capture rajah captain i call as the match go out it be trenholm ready to fight with you i be not with that murder crew i do not kill trego do not be a fool but give I a chance to help you do not kill trego he say amaze i know you do not kill trego but you have the red chap do it for you no i do not the money i give that little devil be for bring my bag on board and he tell you that i pay he for kill trego so that meeker or thirkle would get I out of the way i tell you that i be not with that gang give I a gun and i 'll help you in this fight who be that dead man on the deck he ask how come you down here that be harri thirkle and buckrow kill he thirkle there be no thirkle aboard here thirkle why that be -- thirkle i say be the rev luther meeker he be the head of the whole gang then poor harri be right he moan feeling for a chest and sit down upon it harri be right i could hear despair in he voice -- he be master no longer but a broken dispirited old man cheer up captain we 'll beat they yet i say as cheerily as i could we be lose he moan light the slush-lamp -- they will not bother we now but let 's get on deck and give they a fight i say it will not do any good to stay down here -- the board at the scuttle rattled and we listen i stooped and grope for the belaying-pin they get below growl buckrow after a minute he slam the scuttle-board shut and we hear a heavy thumping sound and the clanking of a chain we be lose moan rigg they be make the scuttle fast with rail-chain all hand lose and the lord have mercy on we light the slush-lamp mr trenholm -- we be dead man what be they game i ask in doubt as to the meaning of what he say about the rail-chain although i be dismay by the ominous sound at the scuttle and know that we must be prisoner in the forecastle there be no escape from here say rigg they hold the ship now and they 'll scuttle she before day come i strike a match and light the swing slush-lamp which make a dismal smoking flame and add to the heat and the multitude of smell which make the forecastle a hole of torture but the light be comforting and rajah creep to he master 's side and clung to he arm the boy 's mouth open and he eye full of question so they get poor harri say rigg still sit on the chest and gaze at the body of the mate i tell he not to come down but he would have he way i think i could get down here and find one of he pistol they be go i tell he i make a search for they and be about to get out of here when i hear rajah come down it be lucky i do not kill the boy -- or that he do not kill I but that be all do and over captain and we ought to begin to plan for we escape be there no way out of here he put he pallid face in he hand and shake he head and it be then that i realize he age and he helplessness he have give up the fight you do not realize we situation mr trenholm or what all this mean or the man we be against that forecastle bulkhead be line with sheet-iron on the other side to keep the crew from broach cargo and even if we should cut through it we would come against cargo in the hold and would be no better off i admire you pluck but you do not know the odds against we they 'll loot she and scuttle she before the sun be well up and we 'll go down in this trap help I lift poor harri into a bunk we stow the body of the mate in a lower bunk and cover it with straw and some of the clothing of the chinese rigg sit down again and stare at the litter deck but we must fight to the last minute i say we can not give up like this even if we be trap you certainly do not intend to surrender now i know captain that the odds be great but we can fight can not we you do not know he almost wail beat he knee with he hand you do not know what it all means of course i tell you they 'll loot she and scuttle she when they have do they work aboard and we be doom man but what be there to loot in this old tub i ask prefer to have he tell I of the mysterious cargo than to take the time of explain how i have follow he and harri below that be what they want he say talk to himself more than to I harri be right but we find out too late they get mr trego before he could warn we and it be not my fault if i die for it I j rigg master of sail and steam for thirty year and never a ship lose nor a dishonest dollar in all my life not to know what be in my ship it be not I that lose she god know but that be what the owner will say and that be what everybody will say -- if they do not say something worse when the truth come out ` rigg go and he ship go ' they 'll say and then other will wink and whisper : ` and you know the _ kut sing _ be ballast with gold ' and who be to know i never steal it gold i say you say there be gold aboard yes gold he almost shout at I chest of gold coin a dozen or more that be what they be after and that be what they 'll get and that be what it be all about -- trego and all the rest of it and you never know i ask more to take he mind off he trouble and rouse he fight spirit than for the information for the detail matter little to we now mr trenholm he begin with fervor if i have know there be any danger i could have meet they i have face death enough in my day not to fear it and i be no weakling if i be a old man but a master should know what be in he ship and what be before he and not be catch in a mess of lie and sneak but perhaps the owner do not know -- the ship 's in charter for the voyage and mr trego take charge at the last minute look back now i be mind to think they be afraid i would turn pirate at the sight of a few chest of gold they think they be slick but there be other just as slick lay line to beat 'em and here i be without officer or crew or ship and jail in my own fo ` c ` sle doggone it i guess all hand know about that gold but I what do they do kill my bo 'n ashore take the lampman for it and make I so short-handed that i ship a gang of pirate as passenger it be understand that there be to be no passenger this trip but the owner see a chance to make a few dollar extra and the charter party say all right i hear that much and then the banker who act for the charter party say to another : ` it will make it look more ordinary to carry passenger if there be some care exercise ' some care they give I a parson that be a pirate and he make I suspect you of a murder and you bring one of he very man aboard -- and I like a fool ship he -- and the other two he bring with he organ but the gold -- why should they ship so much gold in this manner for the russian he say i go through trego 's papers and the best i can make out of a lot of foreign writing be that it be go to hong-kong to buy coal for the baltic fleet at first they be go to make they headquarters in manila and do the business there but the most of the tramp -- collier -- be british and they find it easier to do business out of hong-kong i suppose because the japanese could keep close watch of suspicious vessel make manila a port of call ye see all the bank out here be full of spy -- chinese clerk and all hand -- and they be watch day and night the master of the collier and the blockade-runner into port arthur will not take check or other money -- they want it slap down in solid gold before they will sail and this gold have to be land in hong-kong the jap might send a couple of cruiser for it if they ship it openly so they try to sneak it through like this and with all they hiding and lie and sneak there be a leak somewhere and these fine chap aboard we lay line to git it -- and here we be and still fight captain i say do you ever hear of the devil 's admiral mr trenholm i never do who be the gentleman i never believe in the story myself but harri do and now i be sure that he be right two year ago a ship leave singapore for bombay and never be hear from until she chronometer turn up in swatow or somewhere a portuguese jew have they in a pawnshop and he say he buy they from a chink for seven mex dollar they never find the chink but there be the ship 's name or the captain 's name write in the case with a pencil then last year the steamer _ legaspus _ left manila for hong-kong with cattle and christmas goods and passenger and never be hear from some say she go out to run the blockade before port arthur and the jap sink she but the other say the devil 's admiral get she and then the story begin and when a ship be overdue or never hear from people begin to say the devil 's admiral have she but who be he captain that be it mr trenholm nobody know he never leave a man alive to tell the tale some say he be a big chink some say he be a big black man from the african coast who be mate in a whaler some say he be a officer in the british navy they find a man die from starvation and wound in a boat that get away from he and the poor chap tell a crazy story that they could not make head or tail of and he die before he tell enough to help any but he say it be the devil 's admiral and he crew that get 'em pearler he go after first and then he get bolder and go after sailing-ship and now they say he go after steamer and get the _ legaspus _ and mr trenholm i believe he be aboard here now but who -- we hear heavy blow strike against a bulkhead and the shriek of a door as it be tear from its hinge they be break into the storeshold explain rigg they have get the gold and the next move will be to get away with it in the boat after they have open she sea-valve and down we 'll go with the old _ kut sing _ but what make you think we have this devil 's admiral aboard i ask thirkle be suppose to be the name of the devil 's admiral and thirkle be -- we rev luther meeker mr trenholm we be dead man chapter xi a council of war we be dead man repeat rigg smile grimly we 'll never see another day this slick devil will be back in manila or up the china coast pray he way out of the country with the gold cache somewhere to wait until he come for it he can take enough of it with he to buy a schooner -- part of it be in bank of england note -- but the rev luther meeker will never be hear from again because _ he _ sail in the _ kut sing _ he will not i rage test the weight of the belaying-pin i 'll batter my way out of here and take he by the throat if it be the last act of my life if you will not fight i will i brace my foot on the plunge deck of the forecastle and shake my head like a maddened animal the sea outside assail we bow and they fury thrill I and seem a part of my desire to slay i tear off my jacket and start for the scuttle with the belaying-pin grip in my hand bent on batter down the barrier which keep we from the upper deck not that say rigg seize I you 'll have they down upon we or they 'll turn the firehose down the scuttle and drown we like rat i have break too many mutiny mr trenholm you can not do that but let 's do something i plead we might as well be plan something as to be sit here weep over what have happen we stop to listen as the hammering between deck grow louder the pirate be smash the chest that hold the gold and to we in we prison the noise of they work be ominous -- as if they be build a gallows and we be condemn man they have get it say rigg when they have stow the boat with it they 'll open she sea-valve and down we 'll go if there be a chance in the world mr trenholm i would fight but be a landsman you do not understand how these thing work out they be probably drive she toward the coast now -- we have be make a easting as i can tell from she roll and as they 'll be well off the steamer-lane by daylight they may wait until they can see where they will make they landing but if we give they trouble they 'll make sure of put we out of the way before they abandon ship take it calm and we may see a way out of it but there be nothing to gain by open the fight again fix as we be it be a dismal outlook i confess impress by he coolness in spite of he surrender to the situation you may be right but if you will put you wit to work you may see a way if i have any cartridge -- cartridge have you a pistol he draw a heavy revolver from he pocket and drop the empty cylinder into he palm and i give a roar of joy at the sight of it for i know that it would take the bullet i have find in harri 's pocket a forty-four here these will fit and i pluck a handful of the precious cartridge which be suddenly transform from so much useless lead and powder into deadly missile which might yet save we life and the ship we luck have turn i cry slapping he on the back and put six of the greasy slug into the cylinder and snap it back into position we can fight they now captain only let I get sight on one of those murderer and i 'll drill he -- thirkle and buckrow and the whole lot of 'em you will not get the chance he say they be too wise to come prowl around if there be a chance of get a bullet and they will not bother they head with we now -- it be the gold they want -- there they go again there be a shot on deck and then we hear heavy shoe pound over the deck and a wild yell over we head as a man get a bullet or jump into the sea i run up the companion to the scuttle-hood and listen and with the pistol ready try to make out what be go on i could hear thirkle call to petrak and then the scream of chinese shot in rapid succession and the patter of bare foot scamper on the iron deck-plate in a few minute the battle seem to be transfer to the superstructure and the after-deck and from then until the port of the forecastle become gray disk in the false dawn there be scarcely a quarter of a hour that be not mark by a pistol-shot or the death-cry of a victim we know it be a ruthless slaughter and that thirkle be work out the ancient creed that dead man tell no tale i linger in the scuttle and try my luck on it with the broken knife hope that i might cut a aperture which would admit the muzzle of the pistol or my hand so that i might grasp the chain on the outside and pull they free after a hour or more of labor i manage to split away a small piece of board but in the dim light from the sway slush-lamp i make slow progress in my cramped position i have to hold fast with one hand and sway with the motion of the ship work away splinter from the thick panel which move from right to leave in a iron groove the scuttle be build on a iron frame securely bolt to the deck and i know it could resist any attempt we might make to break it off by work in the narrow companion which be not wide enough for two man it be weary work for the smoke below seek a outlet up the passage and make my eye ache the wind that whirl through the crack of the hood bring spray with it and the water drip constantly and the thunder of a occasional sea as it sweep the forecastle-head make such a dreadful noise that i be sure each visitation mean that we be overwhelm captain rigg crawl up to where i be and ask I if i have solve the problem of get out i do not guess you 'll make much of a job of it he whisper it be a even bet they have get a ton of chain lash over the hood and if ye dig through the wood ye would need a file after that come on down and have a bite i find a sack of old sea-biscuit and a bottle of water stow in one of the spare bunk i go below with he and we make a sorry meal of mouldy biscuit that have be in the forecastle a year or more and share the water which be satisfy -- even though warm greasy and unpalatable rajah have go to sleep in a upper bunk and we eat in silence for a few minute i be on the verge of despair as i see that rigg have give up in spite of my effort to hearten he after the story he have be tell that very evening about mutiny and wreck and fight against odds it seem unbelievable that he should submit so tamely to thirkle and he man as he sit opposite I on the sea-chest and eat mechanically of the broken bit of biscuit i observe he closely and it seem that he have age twenty year in the last few hour he hair seem whiter he face grayer the line in he cheek and forehead deeper and he chin and jaw have lose they firm set which prove he a commander of man as i consider all these thing and see the pity of it i forget he age and be angered i be bind to make he do something -- put my youth and strength and hopefulness and fight spirit with he experience and knowledge of ship and find a way out i determine to make he do something anything rather than mope and whine even if i have to threaten he with he own pistol which i have take from he without so much as ask he for it he do not want it anyway now captain rigg i begin i know you have be a fighter all you life and i know you can suggest something better than -- that be right he break in raise he hand to stop I i have live too long and my fighting day be over my year have come upon I all at once and they be a burden -- too much of a burden to bear and fight too i be weary from fight i be older than i think i be i have be in these water too long and these latitudes take the mettle out of a man when he have reach my age i never feel it as i do now and i guess the owner know it and that be why i do not get one of they new boat but this be not my fault mr trenholm do not you see it be not my fault i should have know what be aboard and then i could have be prepare as it be this thing be too big for I now and i be ready to strike my color it be my honor that fret I now you honor it would not be the first ship that be be lose captain even if it be the first one you have lose and -- i know what you be think of boy you think i be afraid well i be ready to die -- that be nothing if i think i could save you and rajah here i would do it -- it be my duty i have be in harder place than this and i be a hard man to handle and i have have my battle and mutiny and worse some of 'em before ye be bear lad they all weigh I down now and it be not what be ahead of I that be fret I now but what be after I -- the thing they 'll say some of 'em who do not know I well do not you see they 'll think i make off with the gold i have not consider the case in that light but now i see that he be worry of what would be say while i be think only of my life -- he consider that he would lose life and honor and as he still have he new england conscience honor weigh deeper in he scale i feel ashamed that i have plan to make he last hour harder i know how it will go he say it be be do and tell of before and the master be always blame and this be no decent end for I i be know from saddle rock to kennebunkport as a brave man and a capable master even if old i stay out here because i have a good billet with the red funnel people up to the time the jap buy they ship then i take the _ kut sing _ only for a year it be to be but i hold on longer wait to get a big ship to take back home and then quit my boy be a lawyer in bangor -- and smart too -- and i have get a daughter a schoolma'am in boston and they have both be beg I to come home but somehow i hate to go back since my wife die mr trenholm i do not want to bother you with all this now but it be no decent end for I i say all the man scatter over the globe to-day some that go as boy with I will have to hear old man rigg turn pirate at the last and scuttle he own ship that be how it will go boy and you can not understand fight i would walk into hell in my bare foot with never a thought of the way back if i could die with a honest name -- but this be not no way for I to go along with a passel o ' gold then if you be concern about what will be say of the mystery of the loss of the _ kut sing _ there must be a way to let the world know of we end and the fate that overtake the ship and at the same time a chance of make trouble for we mr thirkle after we be go what do you mean he ask some message i say more to find something to interest he and brighten he the story of the _ kut sing _ and the rev luther meeker thirkle the devil 's admiral or whatever he be call should be tell and as it be my business to deal in information i can write it all down and we will seal it in this bottle and set it adrift how 's that captain a good scheme he say smile at I the very thing mr trenholm i have some papers and envelope here in my jacket and a stub of pencil for the log-book and while you be at you write i 'll fashion a stopper for the bottle and a buoy we pour out the last of the water in a pannikin and keep it for rajah and i rip open a couple of envelope and set to work on they with a stub of pencil while captain rigg take my knife and begin to whittle a piece of board i put down briefly but clearly the story of how the rev luther meeker and buckrow long jim and petrak come aboard the _ kut sing _ give they description as well as i could remember then i tell of the killing of trego and all that have happen aboard the steamer and about the gold and the plight we be in skeletonize the narrative much as if it be to be file as a news-cable then i put down the name and address of my relative and those of captain rigg it be a queer job write one 's own obituary in the forecastle of the old _ kut sing _ put down the name of street in boston and bangor and san francisco and make we will -- which we do when we find the space at we disposal get scant although i have little enough to give or bequeath chiefly a pair of chinese jingal and a good pair of riding-boot with silver spur it take a deal of time for i write in the smallest possible character and be careful to make they legible -- no small task consider that the vessel be still roll and pitch although it grow calmer toward morning we do not have any method of measure the time for no bell be strike -- at least none that we hear -- and captain rigg do not have he watch with he for he have not be back to he cabin from the time i see he leave it with harri to explore the mysterious cargo in the storeroom as i write i be hammer my brain for some solution of the problem before we for although i take pain to make the story complete i be hope that captain rigg would finally hit upon some scheme which would release we from the forecastle and give a opportunity to do battle with we captor i take a measure of pride in write the story too for i know there be a good chance that it might be my last and i have vision of it be print in the newspaper some day i 'll cut a little pennant from rajah 's _ sarong _ say rigg with a grin and he reach up to the sleep boy and hack off a bit of he skirtlike garb we 'll make a fancy job of it mr trenholm while we be at it the back of those sheet with the stamp and postmark and the address to I will be good proof that it be not a hoax folk do not put much stock in bottle wash up by the sea these day and we 'll have to offer a reward for have it forward say to my son and then he 'll be sure i guess he would give a hundred dollar to know what become of he old daddy -- and the girl too put that in mr trenholm and i 'll put in as a sort of p that captain rigg intend to make a fight for he ship as soon as he have sign this i say you better not put that in he say wearily it be not so and i be something of a churchman even if it be only to please the wife i be no hypocrite and i do not want to have anything in that sound like a brag just sign it and let it go at that no i 'll put that in i insist look at he seriously i will not have they say after get this that you give up and take you fate too easily which they might you have be a fighter all you life and i know you do not intend to quit now here be what i 'll say : ` captain rigg wish it understand that after set this message adrift he and trenholm and rajah determine to die fight rather than go to they doom at the pleasure of thirkle and he man as this be launch upon the water of the china sea the whole story be not tell and we be confident that the devil 's admiral and some of he man will yet die ' oh that sound like a boy mr trenholm -- you better leave it out no sir this be my story and you will please sign it now for what it be worth it be not the truth he demur but it be i say and he sign it and i know that he be take new hope he unscrew one of the port to leeward and although we let much water into the forecastle he throw the bottle out at a opportune moment and then slam the port shut again mr trenholm he say as he climb down from the top bunk drip and smile i guess you be right about what you write there last -- i calculate that there be a bit of a fight leave in captain rigg yet although i do not for the life of I see what chance i have get of fight anybody but if you be ready to try i be ready to see what can be do i know it captain i cry take he hand if you 'll do the planning i 'll do the work and we 'll beat they yet chapter xii the battle on the bridge now it be all very well for captain rigg and I to sit down there in the forecastle of the _ kut sing _ and consider way and means of save ourselves and the steamer from the devil 's admiral but although we make many plan we have to drop they all there be no way out of the place except through the scuttle and we work at that and scheme about it but the wooden frame be bind inside with steel rib and on the outside with chain and we have no tool equal to the task nothing but a jack-screw could wrench the cover from the deck when the starboard port turn gray with the light of morning we have give up there be nothing to do but wait for something to happen and all we could foresee be we doom in the vessel the sea have calm and captain rigg unscrew one of the port and look out just as the sun pop up over the hill of the philippine coast land shout captain rigg as he open the port and i climb up on the bunk and open a port for myself that be the zambale coast of luzon and they have be make a good easting all night but we be run north now -- see that point ahead it be really a island -- the little sister i be sure -- and dasol bay lie to the north up the channel between the island and the mainland he be run to get into that channel behind the island and scuttle she there -- he know he business in a few minute the island stand clear of the coast and i could make it out low and green and fuzzy with a rim of white sand run back to the fringe of the jungle and a ruffle of comber on the shingle we could hear the boom of the wave ashore beat at the base of the barren brown hill of the coast he be well off the track of the steamer here say rigg but he will not delay much longer now unless he can get in behind the island and then he can take he own time because he can pick up a sail before he be sight through the end of the channel that island cap a little bay and he 'll be snug as a bug in a rug to do he work let 's have a look on deck and see what be up rajah leap out of he bunk and after look around for a minute in confusion at he strange quarter drink the water we have save for he in the pannikin and then put he face to a port-hole and survey the land i take the lead up the companion with the pistol ready hope that one of the pirate might be close to the tiny slit i have cut in the board and would offer a target i apply my eye to the hole the rev luther meeker still in he suit of duck and pongee shirt and batter pith helmet just as i have see he on the mole in manila be pacing the bridge in the calm commanding way that mark the man accustom to command he be puff contentedly at a cigar and there be something amusing in the manner in which he cock he head to one side to survey the sea and then the land with a critical eye from side to side he tramp swing on he heel at each end of the bridge like a grenadier sentry and give petrak who have the wheel a stern look as he pass buckrow be at the port end of the bridge with a glass to he eye scan the rim of the sea but meeker or thirkle keep aloof from he man and he might well have be a admiral on the bridge of he flagship -- the devil 's admiral indeed take a look at they i whisper to rigg and make way for he at the scuttle peephole blast he rage rigg as he see the scene on the bridge i never think i would live to see the like of that but how do he keep she engine go the fireroom crew must know what have happen i say what be left of 'em do say rigg he be likely get a few man below who think they will get a share of the loot if they keep up steam perhaps the filipino chief be at he post keep the chinky go -- leave that to the devil on the bridge -- he know he game he draw back into the companion and i look out again i could see a pair of shoe stick out past the donkey-engine just abaft the foremast but the machinery hide the man from I presently a strip of canvas flutter in the breeze and long jim stand up with a sail-needle and a length of sail-twine in he tooth and cut out a square of tarpaulin on the deck look at the cockney i say to rigg i can not make out what he be up to he study the sailor for a minute and then draw back and whisper : sew sack to carry the gold away they be get ready to scuttle she the starboard boat be hang in the davit ready to lower away when we be behind the island there be a channel a mile wide in there and deep sounding he may find a anchorage until night and then get away in the dark but i be afraid he will not take that long because he know a coast-guard cutter be liable to spy he out this coast be be watch pretty close by the navy and the jap and the custom because there be so much blockade-running it may be that he be plan to maroon we on the island that would not be he way the devil 's admiral never leave a man alive four man will get out of the _ kut sing _ and you know who they be he be not the man to take a chance of meeting you or I or even let we tell about he it be ` dead man tell no tale ' with he you may be sure of that i take my turn at the little window which be not wide enough to let the muzzle of my pistol through or i would have fire upon they they each wear a pair of pistol big black long-barrelled weapon thirkle 's be quite plain for he swing they from a belt over he white jacket as i could see when he approach the opening at each end of the bridge where the ladder-head end it will take about a hour at this clip to have the island abeam say rigg after he have go below and look through the port they be drive she again likely he have a agreement with the black gang to stick to the fireroom but whatever it be he will not keep he word it be death for every man jack of 'em when he have finish with 'em long jim be ply the needle again and buckrow and thirkle be hold a conference at the wheel and study a chart i could see the red head of petrak nodding to they as they submit some point to he but he keep he eye ahead of the steamer evidently steer for some point of land thirkle finally fold up the chart and tuck it in he pocket and buckrow take he post again at the port end of the bridge and study the western horizon i see a chinese in blue nankeen come out of the starboard passage below the bridge and cautiously look up at the bridge he do not see long jim so intent be he on look up but when the cockney draw a pistol he scream shrilly and flee into the passage he long queue stick out behind like a attenuate pennant so swift be he flight thirkle and buckrow come down to the fore-deck and gather the sack which long jim have fashion before they go down the ` tween-decks companion thirkle look forward toward the forecastle and hesitate a minute as if he be in doubt about we be secure enough but he go down after the other and we hear hammer behind the bulkhead again petrak remain at the wheel a jaunty figure with a white canvas cap on he flaming head and one of captain rigg 's best manila cigar between he tooth he manage the wheel with one hand hold a pistol ready with the other and look the ship over from time to time they be steer to pass in behind the island say rigg as i go below it be about four mile ahead now and they be at half steam again because the reef be bad in here -- coral-bank and ledge run out from the mainland when they get she in the lee of the island they 'll make a quick job of she and we too if i do not make a quick job of they with the pistol i say you keep three bullet -- you 'll need they when the green water be spilling in here and he give I a significant look despair be upon he again but i could not bring myself to feel that death await we weak and hungry and thirsty life be still strong and the desire to live if only to have vengeance on thirkle and he man keep up my courage there be some way out -- some way we can get the upper hand when the water come in i 'll be ready to give up but not until then he smile sadly and shrug he shoulder look pityingly at rajah who be play at some sort of a game with grain of rice in a pannikin we go up the ladder again to see what the pirate be about for it be quite still in the hold and silence seem more ominous than a telltale clatter buckrow and long jim come up with a bulge sack slung in a rope thirkle give they a hand up the ladder to the boat-deck but he let they do the hard work petrak slip a lash over the wheel and lean over the bridge-rail grin down at they and make some remark which cause buckrow to laugh so inordinately that he drop he end of the rope and the sack fall on the head of the ladder he pull it up on the deck and thrust he hand into he trousers-pocket draw out a handful of gold coin and hurl they up at petrak they strike the remnant of the storm-apron and rattle to the fore-deck some of the glittering disk pelt thirkle who be halfway up the ladder petrak throw out he hand to catch the coin and i see that he wrist be still encircle by steel band thirkle reprimand they and petrak go back to the wheel and buckrow and long jim hoist the sack into the boat and stow it while petrak hold the speak of the wheel with one hand he rasp at the iron upon it with a file cut away the heavy manacle rigg and i take turn at the scuttle and see thirkle and buckrow and long jim carry up a dozen or more sack some be put in the second boat farther aft and out of the range of we vision hide as it be from we by the corner of the superstructure during the time they be below we could hear they smash the treasure-chest while they be busy in the storeroom i hack away at the scuttle-board which be thick and of hard wood well seasoned by continual wetting and dry in the tropic sun to make matter worse i find that it be full of brass nail drive in from the outside and rigg tell I some sailor have put a border of nail round the board and make a crude nameplate by spell out the name of the vessel with nail-head the blade of my knife encounter these nail and i make slow work of cut a hole large enough to admit the muzzle of we pistol when they have all the gold up they stow the boat with tin goods and cask of water then they open a bottle of wine and drink its contents and thirkle hurl it toward the forecastle and it smash on the iron plate within a few foot of we buckrow and long jim disappear in the saloon after this and thirkle look he chart over again and motion to petrak to alter the helm he be head she in for the strait say rigg he have better allow for that tide-rip that come down through or she 'll have she head swing round at this speed before he know where he be at the steamer seem to be gradually lose headway and the throbbing of she engine be become less pronounced i observe also that the smoke from she funnel be begin to hang over she and curl down upon the bridge but in spite of she slow down the musical ripple at she bow increase and rigg say it be due to the set of the current against we which come through the channel very strong as the island cut out a deep current and bring it to the surface of the sea in the narrow passage between the island and the mainland it be a bad hole in there he say he need more speed to handle she right in there and -- something be up i tell he as i see thirkle listen a second and step quickly to the engine-room telegraph and throw it over i could hear the sharp clang of the bell but the next instant there be a terrific roar and the superstructure begin to vomit steam through the engine-room skylight just abaft the little wheel-house the boiler yell rigg she be blow off and there be a steam-pipe go or somebody below have open she whole inside up the _ kut sing _ be a white volcano amidship and i see thirkle yell frantically and buckrow and long jim appear in the passage below and yell to thirkle wave they arm and then dash up the ladder to the bridge suddenly they start back and group themselves about petrak at the wheel with draw weapon and the next instant i see a half-dozen form emerge from the welter of steam and dash at the pirate they be chinese and filipino stoker but one of they seem to be the leader and he wear a engineer 's cap and be strip to the waist i see the puff of smoke from the pistol of the four pirate -- petrak put he back to the wheel and fire over thirkle 's shoulder -- but the awful racket of the steam-pipe drown the report two of the chinese fall at the first volley and a third evidently wound turn in he track and jump over the rail another hack viciously at thirkle with a long knife but he could not reach he thirkle stand with he foot wide apart and he helmet on the back of he head and fire coolly and swiftly the filipino in the engineer 's cap drop the iron bar with which he have advance in the rush and put both hand to he stomach and stand within six foot of thirkle look at he in a surprised way and finally throw up he hand as if he have lose he balance and curl over backward to the deck a filipino topple over the bridge-rail and strike in a heap on the fore-deck and lay still but i could not tell whether it be the fall or a bullet that have kill he one chinaman slide down the ladder-rail whirling like a acrobat in the air before he land and another follow he but they be the two last and buckrow and long jim start after they the first start for the forecastle and begin to throw off the chain stand between I and the deck so that i could not see what be happen for a minute he work frantically jabber all the while and as i think call to he companion he could not have be at work more than a minute but to I it seem a hour or more and i pray that he might succeed in open the scuttle and i wonder at he surprise if he should throw back the sliding-board and see I come out with upraised pistol but a pistol speak close at hand and the narrow slit in the board let in the sun again and i see the chinaman fall just outside buckrow and long jim be run back to the bridge thirkle yell something to they and they nod and go through the starboard passage the uproar of the escape steam be die out and i tell rigg what i have witness the filipino in the cap be the chief engineer and we know that he have lead a last sortie against the pirate determine to die in a last effort to defeat they rather than be shoot down or leave to drown sally ann say rigg if that chinkie have clear away the chain there we might have get out of here and put in a hand 's work too he will not have steerage way on she -- she engine have go dead now feel she swing with that current they have start again i say feeling a tremor in the vessel here we go cry rigg they have open she sea-valve we listen and stare at each other for a minute while the water suck and gurgle and the _ kut sing _ begin to vibrate from the flood pour into she gradually she head begin to swing to seaward away from the island as the current catch she and as i look out i see thirkle and buckrow in the forward boat lower away there they go i yell and we dash below hope that we would have a shot at they as they get clear of the vessel but as the ship be swing outward and we port be so far forward we be keep swing away from they and all we have be a bare glimpse of the two boat pull away from the ship one of they be tow the island be close at hand a half-mile or more although it seem almost within reach but we lose sight of that in a minute as the head of the _ kut sing _ stand toward the open sea and she stern begin to settle they have to get out of she when pedro cut she engine out and lower she boiler it rush they game because he want to hide she in behind the island but it will not make much difference now mr trenholm -- hear that she be fill rapidly we be drift broadside in the current now sweep down the coast and sink at the same time i run up the companion and begin to struggle with the scuttle-board again hope that the chinaman who be seek shelter from the pirate ' bullet have make it possible for we to escape the board be looser and i slip it to one side nearly a inch and then it jam again trenholm trenholm yell rigg frantically from below what be it i call hate to lose a second in my effort to get the board free he do not answer and i call to he again before the word be out of my mouth i be sprawl on all fours on the deck below chapter xiii we plan a expedition i have be throw down the companion by a appalling crash and a sudden lurch of the steamer as she careen to port it seem to I that the bottom plate be be rip out of she and she be settle on she side with a succession of thump which i take to be she last effort to keep afloat the sea be almost to the open port on the port side and as i try to gain my foot on the tilted deck of the forecastle i fall against the outboard of the line of bunk she be aground scream captain rigg at I she be go smash flat into a bed of coral see that green streak run away from we to seaward that be a reef run out from the mainland and we have pile up on it and if we do not slip off we be safe until it come on to blow he run to the starboard side and climb the bunk to look through the port there it be all around we hear she settling she be make a bed for herself in the coral-patch and she be not take any more water she be safe as a church mr trenholm if the tide do not lift she off enough to pull she into deep water or the current swing she she 'll hold until the sea come up but she be pretty deep and lay steady she 'll break up right here that be small comfort for we i say nursing my bruise they have go in behind that point and make a landing say rigg still look through the port we 'll be out of here in jig-time now where be my match here you and rajah fish for water with these tin on a string and wet down all these rag pull all the water in here you can he light the slush-lamp again and i wonder what he be about i be not quite sure whether he know of a way to get out of the forecastle or have lose he reason he be all bustle and business in a minute i think we want to keep the water out i remark stow that talk and obey order say rigg sharply digging grease out of the can of the lamp with he finger and pick the wick to make it burn better look lively now with that water and i 'll show you a trick or two now that they have abandon ship i 'll take a hand in this business myself what be the plan i ask burn the cuss scuttle off a mite at a time grease a bit of the board and then hold the flame of the lamp on it and when it get too lively heave some water on and put it out and begin again haul a couple of barrel of water in here and spill it under the bunk so we can git at it with the pan if the fire start to git away from we clap on man we need every minute now rajah and i rig they with string and set to draw water through the port-hole on the port side which be not a hard job for the swell come within a couple of foot of we hand as we hold the tin outside we fill sea-chest the rubber crown of a couple of old sou ` wester and dump water through the slat of the tier of bunk so that it lodge in the angle between the side of the ship and the deck while we be at this task rigg be up in the scuttle and from time to time we could hear the crackle of flame and then the hissing of the water as he extinguish the burning plank the thick smoke come down the companion and burn we eye and nostril as it escape through the port rigg come down every few minute to get a supply of water he be black as a chimney-sweep but he report good progress and grin at we discomfort from the smoke and heat finally we hear rigg hammer at the char board with the belaying-pin i have get it through he yell to we from a smoking shower of black fragment of the board and i run up to he and see the sun through the chain around the frame of the scuttle the link be glowing with heat and we dash water on they in a short time we have wrench they apart so rajah could get through the strand then he throw off the bar of we prison and rigg and i gain the hot plate of the slope fore-deck crawling over the body of the dead chinese which we roll into the sea they be clean go say rigg crawl up to the starboard side and scanning the island and the channel they go in behind that point and it be a good chance they 'll be back if they see she be still afloat let they come i say be there any more weapon in the ship i have get a few gun stow where even thirkle could not find 'em or at least harri hide some away always afraid of mutiny he be and he get one with a vengeance poor chap it be my ticket to a penny whistle we 'll find thirkle and he man on the island then you 'll go after they captain well i would rather guess so he say vehemently i be on fair ground now and if they do not come back to burn the ship i be the man to hunt they out of they hole ashore but what i be afraid of be they will hide the stuff and make for the mainland or put off to the north in the boat to see if they can not be pick up by some steamer for the north coast they 'll report the _ kut sing _ lose and thirkle 'll figure on get back here before folk be suspicious of course the people who ship that gold may smell a rat and keep tab on he but he 'll see that he get clear he 'll report she founder far from here -- leave that to he i doubt if he 'll quit this place as long as he see a foot of the _ kut sing _ above water be you game to go after he mr trenholm i be with you to the end of the whole game -- i want to see it play out now win or lose i know you would i suppose i have be a bit of a old woman mr trenholm but i never look for the likes of what be aboard last night there i be alone you might say blind as a owl on what be go on around I and when thing begin to go bad they have you mixed in it so i take you for one of 'em they have I flat aback for a time there -- i do not know my own name from sally ann 's black cat it look like the whole ship be against I and when i see harri go i be clean out of sounding i tell he that he have realize the danger better than i do and that i have not be hamper by the sense of responsibility or the possibility of disgrace oh i lose my wit for a time there and we can not get away from it -- i be all fuddled but i 'll show ye i have get more fight in I than ye look for if ye 'll see I through with it all or nothing i say we 'll give he a gamble for the whole pot now and i think it be time they get a run for they money in my way of think they have have it too easy that be business say rigg doggone my cat but we 'll give 'em some lead to go with the gold or my name be not rigg we 'll find out if this devil 's admiral or thirkle or the rev luther meeker or whatever he call himself be so bad as he make out to be -- eh mr trenholm we shake hand on the compact lie there on the sizzle iron deck-plate that reflect the ray of the sun in shimmering heat-wave make we expose position intolerable after the thirst and smoke and hunger we have endure in the forecastle then that be settle mr trenholm now we 'll have to step careful until i look up what be left of the weapon and we can not know what trap they have lay for we about here come on and keep close we scramble along the port side take care of we footing for the rail-chain be strip off the stanchion and with the deck at a awkward angle there be danger of slip into the water captain rigg lead the way up the saloon-deck ladder and we enter the passage the captain and rajah go to he cabin the first door and i run aft to my stateroom hope to find my pistol the room be ransack and my bag empty and the pistol go some of my garment be throw into the passage and i get a duck suit a pair of deck-shoe and a cap here be my gun say rigg have 'em stow down back of the chart-locker -- three of 'em -- and you 'll find a canister of ammunition for that big gun of yours in mr harri 's room that give we two gun apiece and i guess we can give 'em some lively time if we come across they bow again we belt on the weapon and hurry into the saloon which we find a wreck there be bundle of tinned meat on the table and a litter of rope and bit of canvas bottle of mineral water have be hurl at the bulkhead and into the sideboard mirror curtain be tear down table-covers go and the pivot-chair smash and the fragment pile in a corner partly burn they be go to fire she say rigg but that trouble with the black gang and the loss of steam make 'em change they mind they be afraid the smoke would attract the attention of some pass ship that be once thirkle make a mistake -- we never would have get out of she if he have leave this fire go we gather tin of biscuit and bottle of mineral water and have a feast out of what the pirate have discard rajah have he kris in the forecastle while captain rigg and i enjoy we cigar rajah go out on a explore trip through stateroom and galley and in the bridge wheel-house it be near noon now mr trenholm and we ought to get away in a hour or so the boat they leave be smash but i can rig a raft with hatch-cover good enough to take we to the island we 'll take plenty of grub and water and if they do not give we a fight from shore before we land we can cache we supplies and take we time look for that sweet gang we 'll keep out of sight as much as we can before we leave and we might wait until dark but i be for get off in jig-time unless we see they come back i would like to see thirkle and the other rowing out here i say have a mental vision of a ambuscade for they as they draw alongside in the boat it be ten to one they will if they be not too busy hide the gold or have a fight over it all i be afraid of be they 'll get away from we in they boat but before they leave it be a sure thing they 'll take a look at the _ kut sing _ to see if she be topside yet and then come out to burn she -- which mean stand by to repel boarder for we likely they have get they eye on we now or on the ship but we 'll keep a sharp lookout and if they come snoop back we 'll blow 'em out of the water if thirkle see the steamer ye can leave it to he to come back and see how we be and make a clean job of it i be not so sure he do not plan that anyway devil of a fine joke we 'll make of it for he if he do come out and think we be still coop up in the fo ` c ` sle we set about the work of get ready to leave the ship keep to the starboard side which be low in the water and away from the island rajah be post in the chart-room on the bridge with a old spy-glass rigg dig up and the black boy keep steady watch on the island and the channel with a occasional turn to the open sea in the hope of raise a vessel the chronometer be go along with the other navigate instrument the log-book and manifest the cabin clock be stop at twelve and captain rigg 's watch which have hang over he bunk be miss we find two dead chinese in the galley bullet-splintered woodwork dry blood and empty shell and burn rice on the galley stove the ship 's carpenter have barricade himself in he workshop a little deck-house on the after-deck the door be open and we gather that he have desert he stronghold when he hear the water rush into the hold but whether he have be shoot or drown we have no way of know he have provide himself with a bucket of rice and bottle of water evidently with the intention of prepare for a siege spend cartridge at the head of the stoke-hole ladder tell of a desperate fight there probably before the attack on the bridge by the engineer and he man but we waste no time over these sign of what have happen during the night simply observe they as we go over the vessel to see if any of the crew be in hiding and seek such thing as might be of use in build the raft all the tool be carry forward and i help the captain get off the hatch-cover of the forehold and he nail they together with plank from the top of the cargo in this way we make a rude catamaran some twenty foot long and five foot wide a plank be put on its edge all around make a low freeboard to hold we provision and to serve as a protection against bullet in case the pirate should fire upon we while run ashore life-line be fasten to the side so we could take to the water in a emergency and with we body partially submerge use we pistol to good advantage and offer poor target captain rigg seem to foresee every possible danger and go about he preparation to meet the pirate as calmly and methodically as if he be fitting out to go on a picnic thirkle have take every precaution to make the _ kut sing _ another mystery of the sea without so much as a life-buoy be find with she name on it we find the ring-buoys hack to bit especially that section of they which have the steamer 's name paint on the side the name paint on the two smash boat have be rip from they stern and everything that would float be lock securely in cabin or make fast captain rigg fashion a sail out of a tarpaulin and step a mast well forward and with other thing we take signal-pennant and a british ensign and from the foremast of the _ kut sing _ he fly a signal of distress and a message in the international code about pirate or some such thing so that in case thirkle should get away in the boat and be pick up he would have a great deal of difficulty in explain about himself if the same vessel should sight we color flag take a look and see that the boy be not busy up there at a nap say rigg and i mount to the bridge keep well cover and to the seaward side of the chart-house rajah be wide awake lie just inside the coaming of the chart-room door chew contentedly at he _ betel _ and hold the spy-glass over the brass doorplate direct toward the island he grin at I as i enter through the door on the port side i take the glass and search the horizon of the sea but there be no sign of a sail or a smear of smoke neither could i find any trace of the pirate on the island which have a pile of volcanic rock rise out of its northern end i seek for some sign of human habitation on the brown bare hill of luzon bake in the sun but that part of the coast be a wilderness desolate and forbid the _ kut sing _ be lie secure as if in a dock sprawl out on the coral floor of the sea like some dead thing she stern completely under water and she port rail almost to the break of the forecastle head at the crest of the gentle swell the island give we a lee from the strong current but at the first sign of heavy weather she would break up a school of small shark scout around she and one big fellow with he fin out of water like a trysail loaf at a distance as if sure of he prey the comber purr on the shine stretch of beach and the ripple of the current whisper at the side of the vessel and in the peace that surround we rigg 's hammer make a terrific clatter keep a sharp lookout mr trenholm he call up to I i have get a job for ` ard which must be attend to now and i 'll call for you in a bit of a while he go down the forecastle ladder with he arm full of new canvas and by the time i have finish another cigar he be up again beckon to we i go below to he and he take I into the forecastle and i see what i know to be the body of harri sew up and ready for burial i know he would want to go into the sea rather than be bury ashore or be leave here so i have do the best i could for he say the captain we 'll take he along to deeper water and if you do not mind we 'll drop he away from the cattle that have go down hereabout and nothing will ever disturb he i 'll say some sort of a prayer we carry the body up and get the catamaran over the side and stow with food and water and cigar and such thing as rigg know we would need if we have to make a camp on the island i also write out a brief account of what have befall we since leave manila closing with the explanation that we be go after the pirate we leave this message between the cover of a old book and nail to the saloon table with chalk arrow draw on the floor and about the ship point toward it there any person who should board the vessel in we absence would find direction to come to we assistance but about the gold we say nothing simply state that there have be a mutiny and that pirate have loot the ship and offer a reward of ten pound to each man in the party who should come to we rescue and a thousand pound or five thousand dollar in general to the man who should direct the party to seek we -- this to be claim either by the master of the vessel or the owner of the vessel which furnish the expedition before embark we have a hasty meal and drink a toast to we success and the confusion of the devil 's admiral and he man we look to we pistol and ammunition and thrill with the prospect of battle feel better than we have since the death of trego as the ship be list over so far we have little trouble in get the raft into the water as it float alongside i feel like give a cheer but as captain rigg have do most of the work and have go about he task as dispassionately as if he be build a hencoop i stifle my emotion and hold she off while rigg step aboard we catch the breeze from the land as soon as we clear the steamer and we round she bow and head for the island steering to pass the point of rock which jut out from the island into the channel rigg say that he would cut she in toward shore or the coast of the mainland before reach the point unless the pirate show themselves we 'll make a northe up the channel he say if they think we be get away they may take after we in a boat or fire from the shore but if we show we be go to land they will keep hidden and take we by surprise if we should head straight in now they would likely hide in the brush and pot-shot we as we land when we be in the surf but you watch old cap rigg and if we do not give this devil 's admiral the fight of he life before this little party be wipe out i 'll go back on the farm in maine he can not come aboard I and perform like that without get pay for it -- bloody thirkle devil 's admiral nor nobody else you watch my smoke young man the leg-o ' - mutton sail pull steadily and we slap along through the water at a merry pace with the water bubble at the lee rail and the ripple froth up through the seam in the plank it be a wet craft but we be in we bare foot with we trousers roll up rajah be in the bow with he _ sarong _ twist into a belt and he black shoulder and arm bare to the sun he head swathe in a turban make from a fade green port-curtain give he a outlandish aspect remind I of a pilgrim return from mecca we have get johnny sharkee for a escort say rigg point aft and i see the fin of the big man-eater cut the water in we wake if he do not sheer off by the time we be ready to make a landing we may have to give he a bullet or two but i want to get in without any racket if i can we be soon in deep water and rigg make fast he tiller while he read a burial service out of a pocket-testament and we drop the body of harri over the side it be a brief enough ceremony and i be incline to believe that captain rigg make it altogether too much a matter of little account until i see there be a tear in he eye and he hastily use the binoculars on the island put you helm to starboard he direct i want to keep screen behind the point and gradually work in toward shore then we 'll make a quick run for it in near the point if they do not show by the time we have the inlet on this side of the rock abeam they probably go around the point and we 'll hunt for 'em on that side if we can make a safe landing we slop along for another while and slowly work in until we have the beach less than five hundred yard away swing she for the open sea again say rigg i 'll trim the sail so if they be watch we they 'll think we be make a board to run out keep low all hand and at the first shot drop to the deck and keep covered and we 'll maneuver out of reach until dark if they press we we 'll let 'em get up close so they 'll think we have no weapon and then we 'll open up on 'em at close range and settle it the raft go about clumsily on the other tack and heel over so that she port side be deep in the water which afford we good protection from the island we keep close watch on the edge of the jungle but nothing menace we although the tangle of brush and creeper might have be full of man and we little the wiser over with the helm now but not too quick and hold she steady when she stand for the land and do not get scare at a little surf keep she head on until she grounds and then take to the water and rush ashore with some of the gear while i get the rig down see that you keep you pistol out of the water and dump the gear in the brush rajah will hold she steady while we lighten she a bit and then we 'll drag she in with the swell the raft turn in a great circle and plunge for the roller straight before the breeze the captain cut away the stay just before she strike and we go into waist-deep water on a hard sandy bottom the heave of the incoming swell threaten to break she open in the middle as she swing broadside against the hard shingle we lose a few thing which do not matter much but as we match and biscuit and spare ammunition be seal in oil can along with salt and cigar most of such stuff as break loose float ashore and we save it we chief difficulty be in save the small cask of water and the sack full of cooking utensil and camp tool i dance a lively jig as i run into the burning sand and rigg have to laugh at I as i retreat out of it and put on my shoe while stand in the water but he take the same precaution when we have hide we store just inside the fringe of the jungle we sink the raft close under the ledge of rock by fill she with big stone and while we be busy at this work rajah go up on the point and conceal himself among the boulder in a position where he could get a view of the beach beyond we keep we pistol sling about we neck on shorten belt and whenever the opportunity offer watch the beach and jungle we be keep on the alert for we could not shake off the disconcerting feeling that we be be watch from the brush by the pirate get ready to ambush we at they leisure the minute we relax we vigilance look at rajah i say to rigg he look like a big red and green and black lizard crouch up there in the rock that black boy be a big help say rigg the lad have more savvy than ye would think he seem to know just what to do in any emergency and fight a mad arab that i ship in aden make for I one day in the red sea i do not mind the chap till he be ` most on I and a bit more and he would have I rajah get he with the kris lucky for thirkle the boy have lose it last night when they have I go over the bow he be after thirkle then when a sea come over and upset he and away go he knife and -- a pebble hit the water near we and we look up to see rajah wildly wave he arm to we he have spy something on the other side of the point chapter xiv the pursuit ashore seize we pistol we hurry ashore and when rajah see we come he turn he attention to the beach again and level the glass in the direction in which he have find danger the ledge be cover with loose fragment of soft volcanic stone and rigg and i have to be careful in make the ascent to the top of the ridge for every time we seek a foothold we threaten to bring down a avalanche of debris and not know what rajah have see or how close the pirate might be we be afraid of give the alarm with a crash of loosen rock i gain the top first and brace myself between a couple of boulder take a careful survey of the beach on the other side before crawl over to rajah the point be a angle in the shore and the beach run off sharply to the left five hundred yard away the glare of the sun bother I at first and i think the black boy have give we a scare for nothing until i detect a movement in the fringe of the jungle close to where the shore line merge with the water of the channel i watch it closely for a minute and make out the figure of a man move cautiously rajah wriggle himself over to I and i take the binoculars and when i have put they on the man in the distance i see buckrow walk slowly in we direction with he head bent to the ground as if search for some object he be so close in the glass that i could see the stripe in he cotton shirt and the button down the side of he navy trousers what be it gasp rigg breathe hard after he climb and test the rock before he climb up to where i be perch between two pinnacle of slatey stone can you see anything trenholm it be buckrow he be act queerly and i can not make out just what he be do take a look and see if you can tell he take the glass and study the pirate who be loaf along in a aimless fashion stop every few step to scan the hill of luzon he be take bearing on that mountain-peak or some other beacon say the captain he be get a small compass without the glass i could see buckrow get down on he knee in the sand and put something down before he then he stretch at full length with he hand raise from he elbow to shade he eye from the sun he be take sight on the big peak say rigg it look to I as if they get a bearing on it from where they have stow the gold and buckrow want to get the same bearing from the beach and leave a marker as a middle point and a guide to where the treasure be conceal the opposite reading of the compass from the bearing of the peak would be a leader to the cache the bearing he take extend behind he will run pretty near to where the gold be hide he be particular as a swede skipper with that sight he be take finally buckrow crawl into the jungle again and disappear we wait for a quarter of a hour keep close watch on the beach but we see he no more he make a little beacon with three stone explain the captain i be not sure just what it mean but thirkle be not the man to leave such work to buckrow you can bet thirkle will know how to find the gold again without ask buckrow for the bearing there be some deviltry afoot and my best guess be that the pirate be not get along none too well among themselves with that treasure we 'll have to scout along the beach and pick up they trail and run 'em down carefully anyway i be glad they be here but we 'll have to hustle along now or they 'll be cut out of this and if they get the boat into the water we 'll have to let 'em go without a shot that 'll give we a hard job because we 'll have to take a chance of leave the gold to get help and have they come back for it while we be go we be well satisfy to know that the pirate be on the island and that we have find they before they be aware of we escape from the _ kut sing _ now we have a good opportunity to stalk they and give they a surprise we scramble down from the burning rock and fill we pocket with extra ammunition and biscuit and each take a small bottle of water we clothes be well dry and altogether we find ourselves ready for battle if we can crawl up on 'em while they be all together and turn loose with we pistol from cover we have get 'em say rigg the three of we ought to lay they out before they know what be up we ought to even the number before we pistol be empty i say two of they ought to drop at the first volley it be no quarter either mr trenholm unless we have one of 'em so he can not do any damage and then we might give he a chance to live so he can hang but they 'll have no mercy on we if they get the upper hand i would like to take thirkle back to manila alive just to get at he history i would like to get thirkle myself mr trenholm but it be thirkle we 'll have to get first of all if we can he be more dangerous than all the other and as you be the best shot keep plug at he until you get he but i be afraid it be not go to be so easy as we figure out one thing be in we favor : they do not know we get out of the _ kut sing _ and it be likely they have be so busy bury the gold they do not know the steamer be above water but if they get a sight of she before we drop on 'em then we 'll have a pretty pickle on we hand the backbone of the point run back into the jungle and we find it a hot and hard climb through the tangled vine and thick shrubbery after we have reach the other side we crawl out on the beach and make a careful reconnaissance to the north we progress slowly along the rim of sand where the brush be sparse allow we to keep a good lookout ahead we go along a few yard at a time step out occasionally to reconnoitre the sand-reach ahead we find that the northern end of the island be higher than we suppose at first a labyrinth of ravine slope down to the sea we ought to pick up the trail before long say the captain we 'll probably find the boat in some of these gully where the water come close up but they could not very well cover they track if they pull the boat out and they would not be mind to be so careful not look for anybody to be after they this early the captain and i keep close together sneak along with we pistol cock quiet as possible rajah bring up the rear and in this formation we march along alert for danger at time the rustle of a bush in the breeze put we on we guard and we crouch down with muscle tense and pistol raise or the flutter of a bird over we head or the shrilling of a insect or the creak of a tree sound a alarm which would delay we but rajah 's sense of hearing be very keen and whenever we stop from such sound he would grin at we and push on ahead we trust a great deal to he woodcraft for he be at home in the jungle rigg be a few yard ahead of I when i see he stop abruptly and motion I forward with a gesture of caution he point through the bush and as i creep up i see a white patch through a tangle of green leave it be a boat he whisper it be here they make they landing and we 'll have to go slow now maybe buckrow or some of the other be about sleep or keep watch we crawl up carefully let rajah go ahead to scout we find both boat hide in a patch of _ colgon _ grass screen from the sea by a rank growth of vine and young bamboo the boat be cover with freshly cut palm-leaf and a litter of dead dry vine pull from a uproot tree there be a little inlet run right up into the jungle so the pirate have have little trouble in get the boat ashore use a block and tackle on a convenient cocoanut-palm the grass and bamboo thicket be well trampled and we could see the mark in the moist ground where the sack of gold have be pile one of the sack have evidently burst for we pick up several gold coin in the mud and find a sail-needle in a loop of twine where they have repair the sack now whisper rigg when we be sure none of the pirate be lurk about we 'll take the plug out of the boat and hide they and the oar and take a look around to see where we lad have go it be no easy job to go very far with that gold and they will not hurt themselves with work know they have plenty of time and think there be nobody to be after they we take the oar and boat-plug quite a distance away up the beach and bury they in the sand opposite a tree of peculiar formation and then begin to skirt the territory around the boat to pick up the trail of the pirate we find where several bamboo pole have be cut close to the dry rocky bed of a old stream and the remnant of rope they cut these pole to pack the sack away say rigg they cache can not be far away and we 'll have to work like cat now the old water-course lead back into high ground through a caon and there be unmistakable sign that the pirate have follow the waterway patch of sand where pool have form during the rainy season be full of track in both direction and we know they have make several trip from the boat up the caon and we set out upon the trail we let rajah take the lead this time for he have a way of get through the overhang branch silently and he bare foot move among the loose stone and sand with as little noise as a snake might make bent nearly double with he kris grip in he right hand he keep in advance of we we might easily have be take for pirate ourselves as we skulk along with we pistol raise crawl under low bush dodge behind tree-trunk and peer ahead into the dim place of the jungle in spite of the shade it be hot in that ravine labor under the excitement of the man-hunt and suffer from loss of sleep and the weariness of the siege we have undergo in the steamer the heat weaken we the bed of the stream full of dead twig and loose stone in place a succession of step where there have be cascade in the torrential little river be a hard road it would have be hard enough to travel with no effort at caution but we be force to pick every step and keep bent low or fall flat to avoid a fall and racket captain rigg make hard going of it and have to stop every few yard to regain he breath although he make no complaint i suspect that he heart be trouble he for he keep put he free hand to he side and when he get out of breath he face take on a purplish tint i be afraid i 'll have to rest a bit he whisper to I during one of these attack i 'll be all right in a little while but i be too old to keep up to the pace of you and the black boy there he crawl into the brush a few foot and lay down and i see he have about reach the limit of he effort for the day he be more exhaust than i have realize we call rajah back and while rigg be rest i go ahead a way with the idea of watch for the pirate to return and prevent they from surprising we do not go too far or stay too long caution the captain as i set out we ought to keep close together mr trenholm and fight together assure he that i have no intention of leave he with rajah i go up the trail a few rod and as i be about to turn back i see a level stretch ahead where the trail of the pirate lead away from the bed of the stream into a patch of high thick grass thirkle and he man have cut a narrow lane through this grass by trample down the stalk and my curiosity get the better of my caution and i decide to explore a little farther stoop low i run through this open space and gain the jungle on the other side and find myself near a ledge or low rocky cliff that be so overgrown with rank weed and vine and giant fern it be hardly noticeable until i be close against the wall the cliffside be damp and green with moss and the ground be moist and springy the cool of the place be grateful after the heat of we climb up the rocky bed of the creek i be about to return and urge captain rigg to press on to this place when i hear the subdue murmur of voice away to the right and the swishing of foliage i be puzzle and alarm to discover that the voice be in the direction i have come from or back across the trail fear that the pirate be return to the boat by some short route which might take they to where rigg be hide i run through the grass lane again and find that the person i be stalk be still farther away i leave the trail and sneak some twenty yard into the foliage anxious to see who they be and what they be about they be make slow progress seemingly go a few yard and then stop to talk in low tone when they would go on again and by move ahead while they be push through the brush and proceeding with caution while they stop i rapidly overtake they although they be a good distance off the trail keep over to port i hear long jim say mind they bramble or ye 'll have the eye of I bloomin ' well knock out i be all skin about the neck from ` eavin ' away at these pole drop it a bit red chapter xv two thief and a fight there be a metallic thud as they let down a burden which i know must be a sack of gold i lay quiet for a minute and then begin to wriggle through the brush to get a glimpse of they and in case it prove to be the camp learn what might be the most advantageous method for we attack my back be break i hear petrak whine what with packin ' the whole blast cargo into the hill and this jaunt now why could not he leave it close to the beach i want to know who want to be packin ' it out again some day like a coolie snug enough i say close down to the water and who be to know think we be buryin ' of it for kingdom come fine job he be makin ' of it ` e 's no bloody monkey thirkle be not say long jim it be we that be the bloomink idiot ` my last ` aul ' say ' e ` you last haul ` ell ' say I to he i tell he to mind the rest of we ` as a ` and in the gold as well as in the gittin ' of it ye think ` e 's goin ' to let we in on this not thirkle reddy it be every bloody man for ` imself now and the devil take the ` indmost which he will i say think ` e would ` ave the whole of it all to himself do he i knowed ` e would give we dirt when it come to some big cut like this and that be why i be for gittin ' mine and goin ' on with it this wise ` eave up reddy and skip for it i crawl up and peer through the bush just as they be shoulder a bamboo pole from which be sling the sack of gold they go on and i follow they confident that they would lead I to thirkle 's camp although the direction of they march puzzle I and i could make no sense of they complaint other than that they dislike the labor of transport the gold as i fall in behind they follow almost in they track i discover that they be follow no trail but be make a new way to the beach and when they come to where the go be easy they rush ahead in such a panic that i suspect they be in flight from thirkle and when they begin to argue over the direction they should take i realize that they be run away from thirkle they be steal a sack of the gold and make for the boat to escape with it bear to port i say say long jim keep off the old road or ye 'll have the beggar after we keep to port if ye know what be good for we they let down they burden again and i see long jim stoop to peer back but i be off on they flank again and keep well conceal i be in a quandary now as to what to do it might be better for we to let they escape for then we would have only thirkle and buckrow to fight and a sack of gold matter but little yet i know that they might take both boat and then captain rigg and i and rajah would be maroon on the island except for the raft which be not a fit craft to put to sea in we would be but little better off on the mainland and it would be week probably month before we could be rescue by a vessel or could reach a native town on the coast i have a mind to fire on they but i do not know where thirkle be and i be afraid of captain rigg get lose if he set out in search of I on hear the shot tell ye that do he ask long jim tell ye to do for I hey that be the lay say petrak tell I he would send ye down the trail with I and to keep draw up close to ye and when i see my chance to hook a knife into ye and be sure and make a clean job of it but i be no man for that jim mind when ye split a bob with I in riccolo 's boardin ' - house in st paul 's square i do not do for no man what split a bob with I and we be shipmate before we ever know thirkle and we 'll be shipmate again jim with this ` ere ask long jim ye think i would look at a bloody ship short of bein ' owner myself when we get away with this sack of guinea it be a pub for the two of we in liverpool down near the regent dock like gentleman or i be a beggar blow I if i do not forget about the gold say petrak laughing but i mean it the way of shipmate jim : and that be why i could not do for no such as he say ` hook yer knife in he quick and sharp under the kidney ' say thirkle to I he say he 'll make a gent of I be as there would be only himself and bucky and I leave there would be upward of ten thousand pound man and man share and share alike and all the same that be thirkle for ye jim -- that be thirkle it be all fine long as we do not make no great haul just enough for a bit of a good time ashore but now we be rich and he want to shut we honest chap that help get it out of the cup up i 'll take this sack for mine and split fair with ye jim and it be better than thirkle would give the two of we and i be not savin ' as how he would not slit we throat in the bargain to get back again what little he give we best give he a wide berth and he 'll do for bucky too mind what i say that ' e will say long jim ` e 's thick with bucky now but mind yer eye when ' e git bucky close haul goin ' ` ome think bucky 'll ever find ` be way back to this place thirkle 'll do for ` im -- right ye be red -- just as ` e would do for the two of we red bucky be a good sort too we be all good sort say jim we be all good sort and fine man reddy when the bloomink loot be come and there be windpipe to slit and ' e have to ` ave ` and to do the work for ` im ye mind what he tell I reddy what be it thirkle tell ye jim i would give a bob to know be it about I jim tell I the same bloody thing ' e tell ye say jim shut one eye and make a grimace to impress petrak what be that jim i do not remember of what ye mean tell I to do for ye down the trail the beggar say petrak gawd strike I blind if ' e do not ` take a walk for yerself down the trail with petrak ' he say ` mind when ye get a chance and ` ook a knife in he kidney and do it neat and clean and then there 'll be only three of we to cut this pile ` ere three way -- I bucky and yer own self jim ' that be what ' e say reddy strike I blind like you do i say i 'll do it ye see he gyme we would do for each other in a fight and so take the job off 's ` and buckrow and ` im think it be do now but ` e 'll get bucky at the last too or i be a beggar that be ` be gyme red -- do for all of we and ` ave the gold all to ` imself -- and no sailorman what know what ` e 's be up to out ` ere come around to tap on ` be window of a night when ` e 's asleep and ask for the price of a drink or ` e 'll have the police down on ` im and tell scotland yard ' e 's the devil 's hadmiral he want the pile to ` imself and never a bit more do ' e care for the likes of we than for the throat we have cut for ` im for the gettin ' of it all sure say reddy he want it all for himself to be a fine gentleman and a church member and have he tipple and fine eatin ' we better move on a bit now jim or they 'll be after we they shoulder the pole again and go on and i follow they for a time try to estimate the position of captain rigg on the trail from where i be but in the excitement of follow petrak and long jim i have lose my bearing they course through the jungle have be devious and without much clearness as to a general direction for first one would advise one way and then the other another and there be time when they have be compel by the brush and gully to go out of they way but i have a general idea that by turn sharply to the right i might come across the trail and even if it happen to be below where the captain and rajah have stop i could soon come up with they there be nothing to gain by keep after reddy and long jim now that i be sure they be run away from thirkle 's camp rather than toward it i think it would be much better to let they go than to fire upon they and so either alarm captain rigg or warn thirkle and buckrow that there be other they have not count upon on the island even petrak and long jim might not get away very easily when they find the oar and boat-plug go i reason that if we could come upon thirkle and buckrow and make short work of they we might even overtake the pair of thief and capture or kill they as we go along the jungle thin and we come into a forest where the tree be sparse and there be little underbrush and as there be a open space ahead i conclude not to cross it but to wait and see they go out of sight and then try to pick up the trail when they enter the clearing they dump the sack and fall upon the ground and as they lay look in my direction there be nothing for I to do but drop behind a convenient shrub and wait for they to go on before i move they light cigar and fall to gossip evidently in some argument for they gesture betray they vehemence although i could not make out what they be say they continue the conversation until i lose my patience and begin to begrudge the time i be waste to no advantage while captain rigg be probably fret about I and might go away to search for I i wait another ten minute but they show no disposition to go on and i stealthily begin to draw out of the bush we have come through a grove of wild hemp-tree and keep the bush that have conceal I between I and the pirate i crawl to one of these wide-spreading bunch of gigantic leaf droop to the ground and manage to get behind it but as i roll under the stalk a bird rise near I and scream shrilly in long-drawn cry of alarm and several of its young hunting for cover set up a racket in the dead leaf on the ground i lay still for a minute hope that the two pirate would not think anything amiss but the mother bird wheel above I scream and dart down and i hear petrak and long jim cursing and run toward I i jump up behind the tree and look through the big leaf see they come with draw pistol blow I if it be not the bally pressman say long jim stop within a hundred foot and peer through the tree that be trenholm there or i be a dutchman that be who it be i call to they cock my pistol come on and see what you get you be in the _ kut sing _ say petrak queerly he knee shake as if he have see a ghost you be dead in the _ kut sing _ have it you own way i tell he maybe i be dead in the _ kut sing _ along with captain rigg and the rest of they for that very reason you have better not bother with I i keep my pistol rest in the hollow of a hemp-stalk think it would be better not to let they know i have a weapon for i know they have no more relish for use they firearm than i do if i show the gun to they they would then keep in cover and could attack I from two side if i could keep it a short-range fight i have the advantage as long as i hold the tree against they and they would not hesitate to expose themselves to my fire what ye doin ' of ` ere demand long jim where 's the skipper and all the rest we leave aboard that be for you to find out i say you would not shoot a helpless man would you not a bit of it he grin come on out and ` ave a bit of a parley he let he pistol drop and he and petrak exchange glance which betray they glee at have I in they power as they think go away and let I alone i say simulate fear of they i do not want to have anything to do with you leave I alone ye be a follerin ' of we say long jim where the bloomink ` ell ye be ye see thirkle where be thirkle where ye 'll never clap eye on ` im ye can be bloody well sure of that cut round t ` other side of ` im red and we 'll settle ` be ` ash petrak start off to the left of he to circle and get behind I and long jim begin to draw near cock he pistol again and raise it and leer at I do not ye turn about or move he say turn yer ` ead and yer a dead ` un he be within five yard of I and i see he make a signal to petrak who be approach I from behind i glance back quickly and see the little red-headed man steal up on I with he knife on he hand i lift the pistol and see long jim stop and open he mouth in surprise i fire at the triangle of he naked breast where the shirt be unbuttoned from the neck he curl over backward as if break in the middle and fire he pistol straight up into the sky and then lay still chapter xvi the gold and the pirate certain that long jim be dead i turn on petrak and present my pistol at he the little fiend be survey I blankly take aback at the sudden shot he stand within twenty pace of I with he leg wide apart and he knee bent as if he be on the deck of a plunge vessel dismay on he face and the blade he have intend for my back hold limply before he i could see the butt of a big pistol hang from he belt in a holster he have make from the top of a old shoe but he make no motion to reach for it the finger of he left hand be twitch splay out as if from fear and he mouth be open show he yellow tooth if you move i 'll kill you i say have a mind to take he and compel he to lead rigg and I to thirkle 's camp do not shoot he whine do not shoot where do ye git the gun sir we never know as how ye have it do not shoot mr trenhum ye mind how i take yer luggage aboard where 's thirkle and buckrow i demand up there he say swing he free hand in the direction we have come and i see the familiar crafty look come into he eye how far quite a bit sir in a cut of a clift with the booty how far not far it be not mr trenhum roundaboutish but not far and i be thinkin ' i might lead ye on to 'em sir if ye would let I have the sack we have sir ye do for jim right enough but that be my sack now throw down that knife and unbuckle you belt and see that you do not reach for a pistol i say there be something in he manner that lead I to believe he have a trap for I either he have see long jim move or thought thirkle and buckrow might come down upon we if he could keep I talk he drop the knife and as he reach for the buckle of the belt i turn my head in a involuntary movement to make sure that long jim have not recover a action breed by the suspicious manner of petrak the pirate be lie as he have fall with he arm over he head and he pistol a yard away but the little red-headed man turn and run in the flash of my eye i fire at he as he scurry behind a sprawling hemp-tree but miss and he never stop and i stand and listen as he crash through the brush it would have be senseless to pursue he as he have keep on toward the beach away from the direction of thirkle 's camp i know he be not go back to the other and reason that he would hardly dare to return to thirkle who have probably miss the sack of gold or would demand explanation which petrak would have difficulty in give i pick up the knife and go and look at long jim see he be dead i take he pistol but give he scant attention be afraid thirkle or buckrow might be about investigate the sound of the shot petrak 's estimate on the distance of they hiding-place have be rather vague i turn away to the west in the direction i feel sure the trail must be and when the ground be clear run as fast as i could i make about half a mile in as straight a line as i could and then begin to worry for although the ground have slope in front of I i feel that i should have cross the bed of the stream which be the trail we have follow i keep on my face and hand scratch by prickly vine and my clothing tear by fight through thicket and a panic begin to grow on I that i be lose although i refuse to admit it i soon have to stop run from exhaustion the torment of the heat and thirst and the four big pistol drag at my belt and the ammunition in my pocket begin to hang heavy i begin to fear that darkness would come on before i could find the trail despair begin to get the upper hand when i catch the dull boom of a pistol-shot and it so startle I that i could not decide the direction it come from i stop to listen afraid that thirkle have find captain rigg and rajah soon there be another report and then a third and what puzzle I most be that they seem to be just where i have come from the echo come back to I from the hill and die away in dismal reverberation in the jungle it seem to be some signal but whether from the captain or thirkle i have no way of know i be tempt to fire a shot in reply but decide to wait for another i turn in my track and start back although not on the same trail i have come over but to the right of it i blame myself for leave the captain for i should have keep with he no matter what happen i have make a fine mess of my scout trip but find some excuse for myself in the fact that i do right in follow long jim and petrak and have a good reason to believe that they be go to the pirate camp i try to reason out the significance of the three shot i have hear they might mean that captain rigg have fire on thirkle or that thirkle have fire on he in a kind of frenzy at my own helplessness i figure the various combination of the three shot as i go along but all the time i be in a frantic haste to find the trail finally i find the dry bed of a little stream but a careful search show no sign of any person have be over it and it seem to I in my upset sense of direction that it should lead the other way but remember that i have leave the bed of the creek to follow long jim and petrak i come to the conclusion that the pirate have abandon the creek or have turn off from it to cache the gold i start down it hope that it be the one which would lead I to the captain my courage be freshen and take a slow trot jump from stone to the hard sand dodge over-hanging branch and scramble up on the bank to avoid creeper i cover a great deal of ground in a short time i keep close watch on the clear space for track and carry my two pistol in the front of my belt long jim 's pair well behind i be run and jump along in this way as quietly as possible when i hear a low peculiar gruff growl i stop in my track and listen crawl into the bush i rest on my knee with a pistol in each hand my mouth wide open so as to breathe silently for i be pant from my flight ye do not look to bucky for this do ye i hear buckrow say so close at hand that it startle I there be no reply to he question and after a few minute i crawl toward he i find myself in a outcrop of volcanic rock and beyond the face of a sheer ledge the soil be moist ten foot away from the bed of the stream and bamboo and the thick coarse _ colgon _ grass be as high as my shoulder keep well hide in the bamboo and grass i creep to a high spot and right under the edge of the cliff i see thirkle sit on a sack of gold with he hand across he knee hold a piece of rope and gaze down at it as if in doubt what to do with it he bare bald head be bow low buckrow be lie in front of he with he chin prop in he hand he be smoke a cigar and look at thirkle behind they be pile the sack of gold close to a wide crack in the cliff a sort of caon wide enough for a man to enter and overgrow at the top with brush and green frond for the cliffside be wet and drip and veil with moss get it in yer old skull that bucky be a fool hey say buckrow blow a cloud of smoke at thirkle well i be bad buckrow and i be bad buckrow afore ever i see ye and i have a bit of brain of my own afore ever i meet up with ye thirkle ye can bear that in mind see how ye come out when ye monkey with I they other two fool go off in the wood and plug one another but that be not I thirkle yer sharp thirkle ye always be a sharp one but ye be not sharp enough for bucky and it be I that be tellin ' ye that thirkle make no reply but keep he head down stare at the rope in he hand as if he be consider some weighty problem want it all hey go on buckrow think i be goin ' to put my neck in a rope for ye and then let ye hog it all hey maybe ye can fool the other but i be bad buckrow i be and i do not let the like of you mr thirkle hang nothin ' on I -- leastway not so easy as ye look for why i have my eye on ye and every move ye make after ye send reddy and jim away to slit one another 's throat think i would fall for it do ye see what come of it ye see do not ye i be bad buckrow thirkle move uneasily and clear he throat but do not lift he head or give any answer but when he put he head to one side and shake it i see a red patch on he scalp over he right ear and a smear of blood down he cheek then i realize that the rope over he hand make he a prisoner and that buckrow have turn against he want to do for I too do ye i know yer game old boy i see they eye of yours on I and murder in 'em and it be I ought to know when ye plan to cut a man down -- i know thirkle know ye would turn on I some day this way when we make

nasty weather ahead for you thirkle -- never fret about bucky dead on the wrong tack repeat thirkle as if talk to himself i look to you for better than this and trust you too i want to play fair with ye bucky because ye have get brain which a man would not think to hear ye now brain enough not to be cut down like a bullock by thirkle when the last come to the last reddy and jim be not fit man to trust with a heap of gold like this bucky and it be you that know the truth of what i say they would have the whole thing cut open in a week once they get into some port with they pocket full of sovereign and they skin full of rum and they mouth full of babble in the public house of they wealth and how smart they be first we would know petrak would be tell how we take the _ southern cross _ and the _ legaspus _ and the _ kut sing _ best of all and last now would not that be the way with he once he get at the gin hey bucky he could be watch and he lip keep shut say buckrow would you want to trust yer neck to petrak 's close lip tell I that bucky could ye sleep with petrak and he bragging and long jim and he bragging and the two of 'em whisper together consider the friend they make when drunk why bucky man long jim would tell the whole tale to a barmaid for a smile as he come near tell that girl in malta with the whole mediterranean fleet ashore in valetta if it be not for I we would be in a jam what with the story that be go the round about we then and a po out of the _ implacable _ try to chum with I i want to play fair with ye bucky because yer too smart to let the drink get the better of ye -- but what be the use i do not want to argue with ye go on and play it alone if ye think ye can well right ye be say buckrow scornfully that be the true word ye speak now thirkle ye do not want to argue with I right-o -- a man can not argue with cold steel -- and what be more ye will not if i be bad buckrow i know ye have get a smooth lingo when ye get in a trap but ye can not squirm out this time i 'll hold the weather of ye this commission thirkle ye 'll never get away with it bucky it take more brain than ye have get to handle half a ton of gold not that ye be not get the brain so much as ye do not know how to handle 'em there be many a man foremast with more brain than he skipper but that do not make he skipper it do not take no skipper to handle cargo of this sort say buckrow ye can not do it alone bucky how about come back for it what 'll ye tell the crew that come back with ye do not i plan it all out to get it i plan this job and make fair weather of it do not i you and the other could not do it alone you know that well ye will not get away with it ye can be sure of that it be not in ye bucky to do the job the hardest be to come yet as ye 'll see when ye go about get this away all clear never ye fret about I thirkle i turn a couple of trick afore ever i cross yer bow lay to that i be not the dog of a sailor ye take I for i be a gent once and i 'll be a gent again and no thanks to ye thirkle it do not take no brain to spend a guinea at a time even if a man know he have a house full of 'em and i can be respectable too and take my drink alone in my own house i 'll grant ye be no fool bucky it all look nice and easy but who take ye out of the gutter in sarawak where would ye be to-day if it be not for thirkle tell I that bucky buckrow puff at he cigar a minute and seem to consider the matter before reply i be down and out right enough then thirkle but i be not the kind to stay down long thirkle what with fever and jail and a bad cut in the hip i be in a bad way but no fault of mine only my cuss luck i have have my hard goin ' in my life and now i be to take it snug the hangman be around the corner that time in sarawak and close-hauled on a course that would fetch he alongside ye in no time say thirkle look up and smile wearily never ye mind about the hangman mr thirkle he be around the corner with ye too for that and more than once ye mind hong-kong who save ye from the hangman in hong-kong i ask ye that it be bucky but that have no stop on ye here when ye plan to do for I i save ye from the hangman too and now the score be even and ye can not whine if i come yer own game on ye i do not deny ye serve I a turn in hong-kong bucky and that be why i be to play fair and above board with ye here ye think ye know I and who i be and who i be but ye do not bucky and if ye do ye would have more think about what yer up to here thirkle i be know as and as thirkle i 'll die and i be rough in my way and language because i have fall into those way with my man when i be a sailor i be as sailor be and when i be a parson i know how to play it but ye have never see I as a fine gentleman maybe ye would like to know who i be before i be thirkle and get to be the devil 's admiral as they call I for the want of something better see i have play my game careful and keep they all in the dark it be naught to I who ye be or be thirkle ye can not oil I out of it with all yer fine talk -- i be to do for ye when i be mind and yer slick talk can not save ye buckrow get up and sling a rope over he shoulder and begin to make a sling so that he could balance a sack of gold on each end of it i be a officer in the navy bucky say thirkle with a sly grin a officer exclaim buckrow halt in he work a officer in the navy with the queen 's commission at my back and a admiral 's flag ahead say thirkle pleased with the impression he have make that be what bucky now ye see i be the lad to finish the job here in fine style that be why i can get away with this gold which you can not i can show a wad of five-pound note and not have scotland yard at my heel or charter a ship and crew and go about it businesslike and take my time at it nice job ye 'll make of it come back here for this gold you have get the whip hand now and i 'll let it go at that but when they have get ye on the gallows which they will remember what thirkle tell ye sit here in the thick of it which ye think ye 'll spend for high life in london before ye ever get it to london ye 'll find it be another tune ye 'll play maybe ye think ye can fill a ship with gold and sail to the dockhead and lift it out and let it go at that -- they 'll take the gold and hang you that be what no doubt ye think the owner of this gold will not have a word to say when they find the _ kut sing _ overdue maybe ye think the looting of she be the easiest part of it but ye 'll find murder be easy while keep it quiet be another tale and another trick any man with a knife can go out and stab a man in the back but he find what come after the worst of it it look easy to ye because we get away with the _ southern cross _ and the _ legaspus _ -- but when ye mount the gallows ye 'll see the best of old thirkle 's trick be to keep he track clear and thing run sweet they 'll take you and wring it all out of ye the whole murderous story and swing ye from a high place ye 'll end on the gallows bucky never ye fret about the gallows i 'll get this gold away neat and clean if it take I twenty year and i be the lad that can wait until the time be ripe maybe ye can say thirkle but all i want you to remember be that thirkle say ye could not and my word will come to ye when ye take those thirteen step up to the rope just keep that in mind bucky buckrow make no reply but busy himself again with the sling and as he get down on he knee with he back toward I i decide that it be time that i take a hand in the proceedings with thirkle bind i have nothing to fear from he and i begin to draw myself up from the ground intend to get on one knee and then empty my pistol into buckrow who be not a dozen yard away if it have not be that there be a great deal of high dry grass that would crackle if i try to run through it i would have attempt to rush in on buckrow and knock he senseless with the butt of a pistol but as thirkle sit face in my direction and there be little chance of get to buckrow before thirkle would see I and give the alarm or buckrow hear I come i know the only thing to do be to kill or wind buckrow even though i have to shoot he in the back it seem a unfair advantage and nothing better than the act of a assassin but i reason that thirkle or buckrow would have little mercy on I if i fall into they power so i arise cautiously and parting the grass before I reach for my pistol chapter xvii the art of thirkle so jim 's do for ye say say buckrow good job ye make of it come back this way and good job for I ye do and the worse for thirkle clean job all around bucky and i be back to have my cut of the pile and then i be sure of dream for that be the voice of petrak and it seem to I that petrak ought to be million of mile away although i could not quite settle in my mind just how it be except that i know it could not be petrak speaking -- i be dream it and yet i could not be dream that awful pain in my head i try to open my eye but could not then the _ kut sing _ do not go down at all say thirkle 's voice nice job you two will have get clear of this place with the gold now we dear friend mr trenholm be not alone i 'll bet a hat on that bet yer hat with the devil himself for all the good it will bring growled buckrow this be not none of you affair mr thirkle and i 'll thank ye to pipe down and wait until we ask ye to talk what be up now bucky ask petrak what be wrong now and what be wrong with thirkle 's head be up -- we get thirkle too that be what he try to do for I and i sap he and there he be nice as pie want it all he do reddy do not he look calm and peaceful there with he hand cross like a dead one that be mr thirkle for ye all nice and snug so he can not cut a man 's throat when a chap be not mind of he try it on I no sooner as ye and long jim be go and i give he what he come for blow I for a blind beggar say petrak and i open my eye and see the three of they thirkle face I and buckrow and petrak standing over I as i lay on my back on the damp ground that be mr buckrow sneer thirkle he want it all reddy and he 'll play you the same when he get it he want it all and do not waste you time count up the guinea ye 'll have because buckrow will have 'em all and you and i dead and go under ground hereabouts so thirkle want to do for ye hey bucky who look for it but he ought to know better as to come any smart trick with ye bucky and we be pal be not we bucky say we be pal if ye like and i 'll do my part pal we be reddy and never ye mind enough of what he say to put in yer eye we can split the gold ourselves and leave mr thirkle here with this friend of ours ye know i 'll play fair with ye red -- ye know that do not ye sure say petrak here 's my paw on it bucky and good luck to we and long life and merry time that be a heap of gold for two bucky shake for a square show say buckrow and the two villain shake hand across my body i have close my eye again but peep through partly open lid as often as i dare and how come ye do for long jim ask buckrow and petrak move uneasily and clear he throat jim play nasty with I bucky never look to he for it but we be down the trail a bit and he up and turn on I with a knife cuss if i know what for and i do not have time to ask he particulars but have to drill he and drill he i do as i be no man to stand for knife-play and as i be trot myself back who should i come on but the writin ' chap here stretch in the grass so for a time i think he have be stretch for good when up he pop and reach for a gun and i give he the butt fair behind of the ear lucky job bucky lucky for ye and lucky for I as he would do for ye clean in another turnabout and then with thirkle there as he be a fine time i would have of it but it be not myself i be mindin ' nohow bucky but you as i have my gun and could have drill he after he drill you but i could not stand to see ye get it in the back as he mind to give it lucky for ye hey bucky we can play fair on that score can not we bucky not for I and he would have ye and -- oh stop yer whine and lie say thirkle it be yer own pelt ye take care of and now ye want to get thick with bucky but it will not do ye a bit of good reddy he 'll do for we all now but if ye get any sense stir up mr trenholm here and find what be become of the ship and he mate step on the gentleman 's neck and see if he be dead while yer gam away here ye do not know how many more be in the bush hereabout with gun ready to chip ye stir he up and let 's see what happen to the _ kut sing _ that he be here at all it be plain she do not go down petrak kick I in the rib and i groan and open my eye as if i have just recover consciousness for i do not care to let they know i have be listen to any of they conversation what be all the trouble i ask look about and then sit up and gaze at the three pirate as if i be still confused everything lovely say thirkle grin at I you old friend mr petrak put you to sleep i be indeed surprise to find you so well after all that happen on board the _ kut sing _ and you belt there which bucky remove seem to be well fill with weapon what become of my old friend captain rigg and where be the _ kut sing _ she go down i say know that my time would be short if they know the steamer be still above water for every minute it lay on the reef there be a possibility that it would be sight by some pass vessel i know that if i tell they it be still there buckrow would probably murder thirkle and I and hasten away either to burn the vessel or escape in the boat and how do you get away and where be rigg persist thirkle i cut away the forecastle scuttle with a knife and crawl through the chain just as she go down but captain rigg could not get out that be all very fine say thirkle but you collect a good deal of hardware out of a sink ship how come you with four pistol and if my eye serve I right two of those belong to long jim petrak wink at I at this and i take the cue i find long jim dead in the trail and take he two pistol and the other be my own which i have when i go into the forecastle and i have hope to use they on some of you fellow but you get the better of I and how do you and captain rigg get along together we do very well after i have convince he that i have no hand in the murder of trego you gentleman certainly know you business i must say oh do not include I in the compliment say thirkle bow to buckrow and petrak these be the man who be entitle to the credit for the success of the expedition so far and now that they have the gold they have decide to dispense with my service and whatever be do i will have no further hand in it we will wish they luck my dear mr trenholm and as we be in the same boat now i trust that what little animosity you may have bear against I in the past can now be forget mr buckrow have the game in he hand now ye say the _ kut sing _ go down clean ask buckrow not a sign of she i say captain rigg and the black boy go with she and i have not a minute to spare perhaps it would have be just as well if i have go with she too good exclaimed thirkle you see buckrow i tell ye she have go like a lead and bury she truck i know it would be a clean job and now ye can go ahead -- i quit small thanks to you growl buckrow fine pair of fool ye 'll make laugh thirkle stretch I and the two of ye 'll hang remember that reddy the two of ye 'll hang it take thirkle to plan the job and it 'll take thirkle to finish it mr petrak will you kindly look in my jacket-pocket over there there be a bottle in it and i would like a bit of stimulant buckrow and petrak run for the bottle and both take a long pull at it give thirkle a bit say petrak who still seem to have a good deal of respect for the prisoner that be a nasty smash ye give ` im bucky give it he if ye mind reddy but be polite to he he be a officer in the navy afore he turn pirate reddy a navy officer thirkle a navy officer ask petrak i be a navy man myself when i be a boy he step to thirkle and hold the bottle to the prisoner 's lip be ye a officer -- a navy officer thirkle he ask somewhat awestricken at the idea we have a little chat mr buckrow and myself while you be away say thirkle after he have have he drink real chummy we get ho yes real chummy thirkle so chummy red he be ready to let a knife into I and now he say he be in the navy well up to he flag too and the queen 's commission all nice and handy he think he be too nice to mix with the likes of we he say as how we will not know how to blow the loot ladylike and decent mind that reddy ho ho ho it be this way reddy explain thirkle we old friend bucky think i be jealous of he and want it all to myself but i never have such a thought long jim be the one i do not like and never do but you and bucky be two after my own heart and -- he like we reddy interrupted buckrow he like we both and you best but he like we give he another drink and he 'll cry for he sin mr buckrow i mean every word i say declare thirkle and he mean it for the shrewd rascal be talk for he life there be gold enough here for all of we and we 'll divide it now and each take he share and split it to the dollar leave it to I and i 'll get it off for you safe and easy but try to go it alone and the two of ye 'll hang hang understand that reddy the two of you 'll hang and it be thirkle that say it and thirkle know but thirkle can help ye if ye let he taffy he be givin ' we now reddy say buckrow see that petrak be be impress by thirkle 's argument ye 'll hang the two of ye say thirkle taffy if ye like mr buckrow they 'll have to take I first and that be not so easy as ye make it bluster buckrow do not mind he reddy they 'll get ye say thirkle nod he head they 'll get ye the minute ye land anywhere with a dozen of they gold piece where 'll ye go with it that be what i want to know where 'll ye clear from tell I that no doubt ye 'll land in manila with a boat-load of gold and say yer out of the _ kut sing _ and she go down and all be lose but you two and the cargo of gold and they 'll let ye keep it and send ye on yer way with no question ask ye mind what he say bucky petrak be get nervous mind what he say if ye like say buckrow i be man enough to get away with it thirkle or no thirkle that sound very big mr buckrow but where will ye go easy enough it would be if this island be off the track of ship but the minute ye make a west ten mile with a boat-load of gold or empty-handed pop ye go into the hand of a coast-guard cutter or a ship fine time ye 'll have tell ye find it or that ye get out of the ship by yerself back to manila ye 'll go and slam into bilibid prison and all about ye in the papers and all about the gold and then ye 'll be in a nice fix ye think because it

conversation to petrak who be more easily influence and have a hearty dread of death or prison thank bucky when ye start up the thirteen step they 'll be the hardest thirteen step ye ever take in yer life reddy -- and the last a man 's in a bad way when the shadow of the gallows fall across he bow and the priest begin to pray i look for a better end for ye than that petrak but go ahead and take he advice and see where ye come to do not mind he reddy say buckrow hoarsely pass the bottle and let the old devil croak you stick to bucky now here 's where i stand go on thirkle it be the last i 'll

reddy ye do not stand to lose anything do ye i be not the man to squeal when i be down but we go into this thing together the whole of we with we eye open to split it even here be the three of we and we 'll count it out right here by the piece or the sack then ye leave it to I to get it away for ye clean and neat i be a gentleman i be and i can play a gentleman 's game which ye two can not i can buy a schooner or a yacht and look natural about it and no question ask and make a big show and live at the best hotel and nothing thought of I have plenty of money but you two -- why show a guinea sober or drunk and they 'll grab ye on suspicion ye steal it ye would look real nice mr buckrow buy a ship to come back here for it would not ye -- or mayhap ye would leave that part of it to petrak how 'll ye get away with it if yer so sharp about it demand buckrow what can ye do outside what we can do -- hey thirkle i have get it all plan out ye can bank on that i do not get this gold here without know what i be at or how i be go to draw through that be not my way as ye know i have in mind a sloop-rigged yacht lie in shanghaus wait for a buyer pretty little white thing she be and i can get she for a song and take enough of this with I to turn the job i can play meeker again which you chap do not seem to know i tell the _ time _ man on the waterfront over the telephone five minute before we sail to make a personal item about how the rev luther meeker missionary would sail next week for hong-kong in the _ tame _ and to tell the shipping-office to reserve a ticket for I nobody know i go in the _ kut sing _ for sure and i could drop into manila to-morrow as meeker and not a man the wiser we 'll buy this little yacht and i 'll turn she into a missionary boat buy she with fund furnish by the london evangelical society as i 'll tell 'em i 'll call she the _ bethlehem _ and cruise along the china coast put in at port to hold service then we 'll sneak away some day and drop down here with chink in the crew and we 'll get this gold aboard in such way they will not suspect what it be then it be a easy matter to make away to any port we want and fill away for london in a liner with the gold strew along in the bank here and there or pack with book or other junk and freight how 's that mate and when it be all do we can go to the devil and you 'll take the gold i know the palaver thirkle if ye please i 'll take my chance alone with the gold say buckrow then hang i wash my hand of the two of ye and may the devil mend ye thirkle raise he bind hand as he say this and there be tragedy in he grim old face and pity for the two on whom he have apparently pronounced the death-sentence but i could see in he shrewd eye that he be act a part -- he be laugh at they while plead for liberty petrak begin to whimper and he look at buckrow appealingly let he loose bucky he beg let thirkle loose or we 'll hang as he say and we 'll split it share and share alike let he loose so he can do for we rage buckrow let he loose so he can make off with it and then knife we when it come handy i know he black heart yet buckrow be in a quandary and in spite of he fear of thirkle seem inclined to free he evidently find it hard to make he own decision and prefer to have some one to give the order he toss he cigar away and stand watch thirkle chew a blade of grass ye can deal with I mate but ye 'll find ye can not argue with the judge go on thirkle in a quiet tone keep he eye on the ground ye 'll find ye can not talk the turnkey into liberty and it will be too late the morning the hangman open the door and say ` come ' and -- stow that gab or i 'll let a knife into yer hide snarled buckrow and he go over to the pile of sack and begin kick the brown canvas nervously thirkle begin to chuckle quietly sway he shoulder from side to side in he simulated hilarity petrak who be stand close to he look at he in surprise it will be a fine joke say thirkle in a low tone as if speak to himself they do love to hang a red-headed man poor petrak they 'll have a great joke with he -- oh ye there petrak my lad well i be sorry for ye but ye can not blame I if bucky get ye in a jam he say he can go it alone now and do not need thirkle but wait until the death-watch be pacing outside the door like a swedish skipper and ye have only get a hour leave on earth and then ye 'll wish ye would stick to thirkle i 'll bet all this gold here ye 'll wish ye have thirkle then but thirkle will not be there to help i say stick to bucky if ye like but ye 'll find he be not thirkle good-bye reddy i never look for ye to come to this but i can say ye 'll hang if you go it with bucky i do not do it thirkle i do not put ye where ye be whimper petrak i be for cuttin ' ye loose but bucky be not he be mad at I and i can not argue with he but if ye say a word or two he 'll mind ye and remember petrak if ye can not make he see it right ye 'll hang -- the two of ye -- and ye know thirkle always have it as it be thirkle whisper something to petrak which i do not catch and then the little rascal go over to buckrow and begin to talk with he quietly and finally begin to plead for thirkle ye be afraid of he sneer buckrow ye be afraid of thirkle with reef-knot on he hand and ye 'll be afraid of he when he be dead ye coward i be not afraid of he bucky but he say we 'll hang and so we will if we do not let he have a hand gettin ' this gold clear away he 'll do for we and then what good will the gold be to we reddy ye know the devil as i do jind now he be get this pile he 'll settle we when he see he way to it let he go bucky let he go the night 'll be on we in a hour or so and then what 'll we do leave it to thirkle and it 'll come out all right and i know it and you know it bucky there be the two of we to he and we 'll make he play it fair now the two of we 'll play it fair without he say buckrow come on and stow this gold and have do with the job that be a end of it say thirkle no use to talk of it more do for I now i be not get much longer to live anyhow but i 'll tell you chap what i 'll do so ye will not have to ask no favor at the end what now thirkle asked buckrow they try to make a preacher of I in my young day and it be no go and they put I in the navy and i make a mess of that but i be good as a navy chaplain at say a prayer and if ye 'll bring I the little bible ye 'll find in my jacket-pocket i 'll say the burial service of the church of england over ye two fine as a bishop would and good enough for anybody with all the frill how 's that for thirkle let he go bucky whine petrak with quiver knee and terror in he face chapter xviii big stake in a big game i would look a fine fish let of he go now after what be pass between we laugh buckrow ye mind what he would do the minute he get he paw free reddy if ye do not shut yer trap i 'll drill ye that be what no arm for I suggest thirkle i bear no arm and both of ye have the bilge on I with all the knife and pistol in yer own hand that be all very fine for ye to say now thirkle but what of when ye get in reach of a gun or a knife what then i 'll bear ye no grudge say thirkle never a word will i say bucky that be do and go and we all have we little quarrel never a hand will i turn against ye bucky and petrak here to witness what i say no grudge ag ` in ' I for what i do demand buckrow doubtfully ye mean ye 'll let this go and never a word ag ` in ' I thirkle never a word we 'll slip all that and turn to at get this gold away what be a little mistake against all this here go to let a bit of a row stand between we and good time i say no give I a chance to get ye all off here with the gold and i will not likely forget it if ye let I go bucky i be not the man to hold a small mistake of judgment against a mate like you what be fight and work with I so long and ye be always ready bucky when there be a hard job ahead nearly two year we have be together mate and it would be a pity if we smash thing now when we have get a ship-load of gold it be time we quit and take we comfort and no more chance of get a rope at the end of it we have about play the game out and we would better not play a good thing too far or we 'll find ourselves catch a crab one of these fine day i say we would stop if we make it safe with the _ kut sing _ and we have and now that we have get plenty ahead with eating and drinking and a good bed the rest of we day let 's square away for home we 'll start fair and square again mate as we do when we first put we head together for this fortune and no grudge and all equal now as the worst of the work be over and the next be to get away with it easy enough if ye let I pilot the job in a month we 'll be in london and ye and reddy with a pub all yer own and living at ease like gentleman all equal from this on thirkle each have he say and one as good as the other nothing without a council and two vote to decide so ye two 'll be yer own master have the two vote against I with my advice for help there be fifty thousand pound for each of we and we 'll separate in london and go we own way if ye like i 'll swear a black oath to that and my word 's good as ye both know do i ever break it to ye do not i always cut the loot as i agree i be thirkle and when i say a thing i mean it now bucky think it over before it be too late will ye go it alone or will ye give I a fair play at the game and come out with yer life and a fair share of the gold it be for you to decide and see ye do not make a mistake no arm for ye split three way and do as we please when we be away clear with the gold ask buckrow that be it bucky that be what i say and what i say and i 'll stick to it swear to it and nothing in yer mind i swear to it and nothing in my mind it be a square enough thing and i never lay to do for ye as ye think it be all a mistake bucky buckrow begin to whisper with petrak again and thirkle hold he hand up and call to they sharply : here cut this rope petrak start for thirkle with a sheath-knife but buckrow pull he back i 'll let he go he say this be my job thirkle continue buckrow approach he prisoner i be atween two mind with ye and one be to slit yer neck as i will not deny but ye be a sharp cuss and i guess ye can do this work better than i can but i want to say to ye now if ever ye turn on I after this ye be a dog i 'll take my chance with ye but ye bear I no love and i know it and ever ye reach for a knife or a gun mind that i do not see ye it be play fair from now on but show a claw and yer do for if i can do it he stoop down and slip the blade of he knife through the bond he have put upon thirkle and then step away from he with the knife hold in guard as if he expect the pirate to leap at he once he have he hand free but thirkle sit still for a few minute rub he wrist and then call for the bottle petrak hand it to he and he sip the brandy and bath he wounded head with it send reddy to a pool of water at the base of the cliff to wet he handkerchief and then bind it around he head it look bad but it do not hurt much bucky he say smile what hurt I more be to have ye turn on I the way ye do but that be all pass and go and we will not mention it again mind ye do not growl buckrow who be still in a angry mood and perhaps think he have make a mistake in give thirkle freedom again oh limber up a bit bucky say thirkle what be the use of we all go to kingdom come over a little fight when we have have so much fight to get this the gold turn all we head no doubt but we can not be fool through it the stuff 's no good here -- the job 's not do yet but i 'll get ye all clear now if ye mind I and keep sober in port shake old mate and let 's be friend again he hold out he hand to buckrow who take it but awkwardly i could see that he fear thirkle even unarmed and know he for he master i be cuss sorry thirkle for what i do but i feel ye want to do for I and i could not stand for that he say with he eye on the ground all square now bucky and never a word ye always do yer work well and never a slip and do not i do the same thirkle do not i stand by ask petrak survey he chief with a expression of surprise that he have be overlook in commendation much as a dog would seek petting you too assent thirkle beam on the little red-headed man never be a better man when there be to be a knife use quick and neat i 'll say that for ye now i want to take a little rest for a few minute and if i be to have a word to say i would suggest that you two get the sack stow in the hole there i want a little confab with mr trenholm here and i 'll give a hand presently if ye think it be fair i 'll rest a bit but we ought to get that stuff snug away and there be no time to be lose buckrow take away the belt and pistol which have be unfasten from I after my capture and he and petrak set to work carry the sack of gold into the cleft in the cliff it look bad for I a while back mr trenholm say thirkle sit beside I and offer a cigar which i take i be not quite sure that i could get myself out of that tangle you have a pretty good argument i comment light the cigar although my head throb so painfully that i know i would not enjoy the smoke i be afraid i will not be able to have any plan to help you get away with the gold and so earn my own life my dear mr trenholm i be sorry you do not go down in the _ kut sing _ really i be for you know i take quite a fancy to you in manila you be of such a unsuspicious nature oh i have my suspicion well enough but they be on the wrong track in fact i could not have do you justice -- my imagination be not equal to it the best i could do for you be to mistake you for a spy -- a inadequate estimate after what i have see and hear of you you flatter I my dear mr trenholm but it be entirely you own fault that you be where you be i try to warn you but you could not expect I to tell you my plan regard the _ kut sing _ i do not want you in she and i do my best to keep you out really remarkable in a way what do you mean that you should happen to be a passenger -- such a insistent passenger -- and as if you know nothing about what be go in the ship really you and trego do well i think trego make rather a mess of it i say if i have be in he boot i would have tell the captain what it be all about why do not you tell he you could have tell he about the gold as well as mr trego indeed then you believe i know about the _ kut sing 's _ cargo i do not believe it my dear mr trenholm i never accept a theory as a fact there be a time when i think you connection with the affair end when you bring the order from saigon but you persistence in pretend to buy a ticket in the _ kut sing _ rather puzzle I for a time and then i be afraid that you suspect I and that i have go too far in try to keep you out of the vessel you be talk enigma now but what surprise I most he resume disregard my remark be that i purchase a ticket in the _ kut sing _ at all i look for a trap there and if the game have not be so big i might have quit at the last minute i be sure i do not know what you be talk about my dear mr trenholm really you attitude offend I i can not see what you expect to gain by pretend you know nothing about the gold in the _ kut sing _ that be absurd you bring the order for it from saigon and help get the thing fix and yet you pretend that it be all a mystery to you when i be willing to be so frank i can not see why you should assume this manner then i know all about the gold from the first do i certainly what do you think mr petrak and i keep so close at you heel for in manila well it do rather puzzle I for a while everywhere i turn you or the little red-headed rascal seem to be near and never seem to remember have see we in saigon in saigon be you in saigon when i be there leave before you do when we know you have the order for the gold from commander kousmitch never meet the gentleman of course not he get the cable-operator to have you deliver the order in manila for he but i hear he and the cable-operator talk it over and that be all i want and leave so you do not see we in saigon i tell petrak you do not but he think you do that be one reason we get so bold in manila but the cable-operator tell I the message do not amount to much and that he would send duplicate by mail anyway of course he do it do not amount to much except to give a code order about ship this gold and you drop it in the bus and i pick it up and you be rather rude to I which prove that you either have no suspicion about I or know it all and want to throw I off my guard i believe you be actually laugh at I the last few hour in manila i could not understand unless you have thing rig to trip I the minute we sail i be look for it at dinner the minute we cast off and what a scrimmage there would have be at that table if you have draw one of those pistol why petrak and buckrow and long jim be in the passage with pistol ready to come in and i would have shoot you first and then trego for i know captain rigg have no arm on he person if i make away with you and trego the next would have be rajah for the lad could have give a nasty cut with that kris and i have to keep a close eye on mr trego 's malacca cane oh you do i never suspect for a minute that you regard mr trego as a dangerous character he never tell you never tell I anything i be introduce to he in a most casual way in the bank and be surprise to find he a passenger in the _ kut sing _ he never tell you about he cane most beautiful rapier you ever see in it always have it by he but he overlook it when he get up from the table in the saloon last evening undoubtedly he be go for a pistol but we have to get he when the time offer and besides he be get ready to tell rigg all about I and my crew there be not a second to lose i meet he as he be come back and hold he for petrak and we do the job quietly it be something to be proud of i remark i never would have give the rev luther meeker credit for it that be what make the character so valuable he grin feel the bandage about he head tenderly i see that he be weaker than he have lead we to believe and that he be suffer from he wound but you puzzle I when they find the body i expect you to denounce I but you foolishly keep in front of I and i be ready to blow you back out if you say a word and we be all ready for the finest kind of a fight although i do not want to precipitate matter so soon really you have I guess for a time and i could not understand you attitude know what you do about I and the gold then i see that you have plan of you own and want it yourself it be you who flatter I now i tell he surprise at he revelation but you do want it although i could not see how you figure to take it away from I or why you do not tell captain rigg what you know but i do not know anything i think you be a spy who mistake I for one and i be let you have you little joke out you do not know about the gold or trego or I he demand i regret exceedingly that i do not if i have i would have block you game at the first opportunity i suspect you be not a missionary but i have never even hear of the devil 's admiral most extraordinary i agree with you i mean that you do not know about the gold when i think you do i must confess that i make a tremendous mistake there really it come near be a failure -- it would have be if captain rigg have not be lead to suspect you i advise he to put you in iron after you be send to you room -- it seem to be the easiest way to get you out of the fight i be really afraid of you mr trenholm you seem to have get over it this seem to be get more of a tangle all the time and a sort of mutual-admiration society i have no objection to keep up the conversation but you pique my curiosity as to how it be all go to come out as i have already remark i can not see any argument that would lead you to let I walk away from here unless i tell you as you tell petrak and buckrow that you 'll hang now tut tut you can not play my game i think you have more originality than that you know too much now and it would be premature to tell the story of the _ kut sing _ for several year i be afraid that i 'll have to write my own memoirs but for posthumous publication of course i be sure i would like to read they you have turn murder into a fine art -- you should have be a contemporary of the borgia do you know mr trenholm i have think of something like that myself i be quite proud of my success i would like if my career could be write down by a good hand at such thing but of course that be impossible for no man ever know the devil 's admiral and live i regret to say that you will be no exception in that respect mr trenholm i be sorry you do not go down in the _ kut sing _ and save I what be bind to be a disagreeable job in that case i would have miss the little drama between you and mr buckrow i rather enjoy it you seem to be a artist at other thing besides slaying man i be glad you like it but bucky be rather hard to handle at time there will be another act or two and i 'll give you a chance to see the climax that be kind of you although you upset dramatic convention and i will find it rather hard i be afraid to be a competent critic besides i might be prejudiced have a personal interest in the outcome that will not matter much he smile my critic be always short-lived bucky there come nearest to get I though if it have not be for petrak i never could have handle he they can not bear the thought of a rope whenever there be a hanging i take they to see it be a man of the cloth i be admit to all sort of place and while i do not travel openly with my man i could mingle with they more or less in the character of a missionary he look up at buckrow who stand over we scowl suspiciously and he hand be close to he pistol what be wrong bucky purr thirkle moisten a cigar between he lip and give buckrow a search glance i do not like that place in there for the gold thirkle it be too wet to suit I the dampness will not do any damage bucky that be the best place on the island to my thinking but of course if you do not like it we 'll consider it the gold will rust in there say buckrow and i know he be in a dangerous mood again gold do not rust bucky call petrak standing in the crevice and grin at thirkle that be the best place on the island say thirkle soothingly this be the ideal place but if you do not like it in there we will not put it in there and that be a end of it bucky but it 'll all rust up into great gob if it be leave any great while -- i do not like so much water drippin ' over the place thirkle gold do not rust bucky call petrak and he laugh immoderately and slap he knee with he hand but what better place be there bucky it be get late now lad and that be the best place for it then i vote to stow it and pipe down with the gabbin ' with the writin ' chap say buckrow savagely it be time we get clear of here and take to the boat by dark thirkle i be not for cruise over this blast island in the dark and i do not fancy ye and the writin ' chap gettin ' so thick all of a sudden if there be to be talk we want to know what it be about and i do not see no great gain in so much gossipin ' that be entirely my idea bucky my vote be that we put it in the crack there and slick up around here so nobody can know what be be afoot but i want a rest and there be some thing i want to say to mr trenholm here that will be of use to we clap on lad and i 'll be there soon that be my vote assent petrak grin at thirkle no argument there bucky then lay on again ye fool growl buckrow turn to the sack once more cuss ye reddy yer goin ' to side with thirkle ag ` in ' I i can see that they pick up a sack and stagger into the caon with it and thirkle grin at I and light he cigar again see that mr trenholm if i have let bucky rule then i would have be as good as dead i have another chap in my crew like that after he see the way i work the game he want to kill I and take command himself while he be make he plan to settle I the police get he for a murder he do not do and i trump up the evidence against he but never appear at the trial when he be condemn i tell he i would get he out all right i have turn the trick before with saw in the binding of bible for some of my man in prison and he have absolute faith in I as all my man have i go away on a little expedition after pearl down mindanao way and get back the day he be to hang i visit he a hour before he be to swing and tell he it be all right and he be to escape at the last minute i walk up to the trap with he and while pray with the prison chaplain keep whisper it be all right and he keep quiet until they have the cap over he head and then he know i have he he try to yell that i be the devil 's admiral -- but it be too late then i feel that i be justified -- he would have kill I the next day but it be a fine joke to my mind mr trenholm be not ye goin ' to quit gammin ' with that chap and give we a hand here demand buckrow be that what ye call all bein ' equal mr thirkle if ye do i do not he come toward we in a threatening manner and thirkle see that he must submit with good grace get up and meet he with a smile by all means bucky we be equal but i do not think ye would begrudge I a little time after what happen how do the gold fit in there wet as a junk we put the first sack in the eye of she but it be no kid 's play and we ought to have help mr thirkle if we get clear away from this island to-night we can not swear there will not be no moon and moon or no we want to be out of the jungle and at the boat by sundown and what be the game with the writin ' chap here i be mind to have he do a bit of this work gold do not rust do it thirkle ask petrak i tell bucky gold do not rust but he do not like the water in there oh dry up growled buckrow what with yer talk we 'll be at this job all night -- i vote -- begin petrak to the devil with ye and yer votin ' say buckrow it be time we get to work all hand and so we will and the writin ' chap 'll turn to and do he bit or i 'll know why if he be not to do he part or we do not make no use of he i say we 'll up and do for he now and have it do with next ye know he 'll make he getaway and then a nice mess we 'll be in we do not intend to let mr trenholm get away say thirkle i be just think lad that there be three of we but count mr trenholm we make four and we can rattle he down so he can lift and carry but not much else then lash he flipper down and put a bight on he leg say buckrow and he bring rope and begin to fashion it into knot there be a minute when i be tempt to jump and run for it but it would have mean certain death for the three of they stand over I two of they load down with pistol and i would have have a poor chance of get away there be a promise of delay in the work to be do and not know what have become of captain rigg there be the bare possibility that he might come upon the pirate ' camp and attack they from ambush when he see that i be a captive if i make the slightest resistance to the hamper rope they put on I with the cunning knot know to seamen i know they would not hesitate to make a end of I so i stand up and allow buckrow to lash my wrist to my knee in such a way that i be bent nearly double but with my hand sufficiently free to grasp a burden and my foot hobble for short step we begin the work of put the sack of gold into the hole in the cliff and i set at the task with a prayer that before it be finish and my life be of no further value to the pirate i might find a opportunity to escape chapter xix one man less in the forecastle mess ye can let he work with ye thirkle say buckrow as ye and the writin ' chap seem to have a lot of chin pair off with he and as the two of ye do not bear arm he can not get he paw on a gun or knife that way you two work ahead of I and petrak and then we can keep a eye on the both of ye it strike I you and the writin ' chap be gettin ' thick -- too blast thick to suit I thirkle if ye want to know mind ye do not come none of yer smart trick now or i will not wait for ye to go explainin ' of what ye mean savvy that tut tut man say thirkle how can you have any doubt about what will happen to mr trenholm i suppose you think i want to take he along with we so he can write this all up for the newspaper i be surprised at you bucky do not you know my way yet that be all right growled buckrow who be in a ill humor we be to work even and ye be not be doin ' yer part thirkle a bargain 's a bargain i would have ye know and i be to see ye keep to yer part of it pipe down -- pipe down bucky say petrak who seem in glee after the brandy he have have it be the drink talkin ' bucky we be all good chap and thirkle 's a no 1 and we get the gold to stow do not come no bo 'n manners to I retort buckrow savagely i be not goin ' to stand for none such from ye red yer sidin ' with thirkle and i know that and i be as good a man as thirkle and i be boss here even or no even i be boss understand that thirkle and ye can have yer vote if ye want but i be boss and i 'll drill the two of ye ye be not goin ' to fight be ye bucky i 'll put all hand under ground -- that be what if ye do not turn to and there be too much gammin ' and gabbin ' here to suit I i would have ye know petrak look at thirkle as if in doubt about buckrow 's sanity and thirkle give he a look that seem to I to be a message and he make a furtive signal which i be not able to interpret steady as she go mate steady as she go purr thirkle this be no time to quarrel we 'll have a gunboat down on we if we do not get away soon and there be a lot to do yet before we leave let bucky alone red then ye and the writin ' chap lay on and move lively snarled buckrow and thirkle have I take hold of a sack behind he and with he lead the way we carry it into the miniature caon the sack be heavy but be bind with rope which serve as handle and be not hard to move until we get into the narrow cleft where i find that my shoulder bump along the wall as i sway from side to side or miss my footing on the damp slippery ground buckrow and petrak follow we in with another sack and when thirkle have go as far as he could he pull we sack forward under he foot and stow it in the angle where the wall join then i have to pass the second sack on to he take it from petrak who be next to I and then we turn in we track and go out again the brush on the top of the cliff overlap the crevice so that it be quite dark a few foot from the entrance the wall be slippery with a thick funguslike moss from which cool water drip that gold will rust in here sure as a nigger 's black grumble buckrow as he feel he

at it while i put bucky under ground petrak and i resume the work of carry the sack into the crevice while thirkle busied himself at digging a grave in the soft sand near the place they have deposit buckrow 's body the little red-headed man begin to whistle a music-hall tune softly but thirkle caution he against make any unnecessary noise i be in a agony from my cramped position and tug at the sack serve to increase my torture the tangle of rope which buckrow have put on my ankle catch in loose stone and chafe the flesh until the blood come and my wrist pull down with tight knot which i have to strain against to keep my balance throb and pained and tingled my arm be numb by the blood in the bind artery petrak keep before I with the sack between we and he bloody knife pull to the front of he belt after he have stow each sack he help I back out or assist I to turn which be always a hard task for I if i let my end of the sack slip out of my finger he be ready for I with knife or

'll give ye what bucky get and ye mind that i be no gent to fool with as ye ought to savvy by this and if ye think i be try something but for all he warning i be ready to risk death if i see the chance to make a fight i hope that thirkle would give he more of the brandy but thirkle keep the bottle to himself when we press into the crevice i wear the rope on my wrist against the stone as much as i could try to cut the bond on the rough point of the wall once i stumble and fall and grope for a splinter of stone but he menace I with he knife and kick I until i get to my foot again i have give up hope of be rescue by captain rigg even if he find the camp i doubt that he would attack until it would be too late for I as he would naturally suppose buckrow and long jim to be near by it be come on toward twilight and there be still seven sack to be carry in thirkle have finish bury buckrow and set to drag the sack close to the entrance of the crevice so we would not have to carry they so far petrak make several attempt to talk with he but thirkle make short answer for when he take the pistol he have drop he mask of affability and assume he old commanding air it 'll be dark before we get back to the boat suggest petrak as we stand over the five sack which be leave mighty dark say thirkle gruffly sit cross-legged count a packet of english banknote that be what ye want aint ' it

petrak against he no harm in what i say thirkle and petrak take up the end of the sack he mistrust of thirkle give I a idea which i put into play as soon as we be well inside the crevice petrak i whisper drop my end of the sack and compelling he to let it down what be up now he whisper he 'll kill you too reddy he be plan it out and if you let he he 'll kill both of we before he quit this

mind be make up reddy he may let we help he get a boat into the water but that be all he 'll murder both of we like dog old thirkle 's all right he say weakly as if he feel the truth of what i say but lack courage to attack thirkle reddy he 'll kill you i go on see that i be on the right track and that fear of death at thirkle 's hand be uppermost in he mind he have catch enough in thirkle 's manner since the death of buckrow to see that he be not go to get a just division of the loot at the very least and know the ruthlessness of he master he have doubt about escape with he life besides i believe he have be tempt by the thought that he might kill thirkle and then have it all to himself he tell long jim to kill you do not you see the way the devil have it plan to get rid of you he plan to kill you all once he have this gold on the island you should never have come back after i shoot long jim why do you come back you know he 'll kill you i want to see where they hide the gold that be what then when i raise you there in the grass it come in my head to grab ye and come in for my share of the gold see long jim be do for he friendly mood encourage I but if i let he ramble on with he own affair i would not be able to convince he that thirkle be plot to slay he so i begin with he again thirkle will kill the both of we you hear what he say about be a gentleman he have be a officer in the navy reddy and he will not want you or any other man to know he be a pirate when he go back to london he would not feel safe if he let you live he care no more for you than he do for buckrow or long jim -- you ought to know that oh thirkle be all right he say in a way that exasperate I he would not look at you twice in london or anywhere else he 'll rid himself of you as soon as he need you no more which will be as soon as the gold be stow and he have a boat in the water now be you chance if you ever have it thirkle be all right he have it plan to kill buckrow then he argue the two of you into let he go can not you see that he be play the game to have it all for himself be you go to be a fool all you life man then ye would do for I after i do for he he say give I a gun and cut I

the rope wait until he have finish with we and the gold be packed and then see what will happen -- you 'll wish you have listen to I pipe down with that he growl and i see the uselessness of try to make the lout see reason i now begin to fear that he would tell thirkle what i have say to he when we go out for another sack petrak look over at thirkle and hesitate as if he want to say something but thirkle be write in a little book with a pistol between he foot well what be it now he demand truculently have see something suspicious in petrak 's manner what be the lay now what have ye get yer hand so close to that gun for take a shot at I if you want -- go on take a shot at old thirkle if ye be that game only a habit o ' mine keepin ' my gun well for ` ard thirkle whimper petrak shiver i have to keep a close eye on the writin ' chap thirkle no offence i hope look lively now lad say thirkle turn amiable again but only to reassure petrak here be the last of it and get it away and we 'll get under way we carry another sack in and i wait until we be at the far end and have dump it before i begin again with petrak i know he natural treachery be near the surface and it need but little urge to bring he to the point when he would turn against thirkle we might as well say good-bye now i say as mournfully as i could you remember i treat you pretty well in manila and i be sorry for you now it do not matter much with I how i end now because thirkle have the drop on I but i be sorry for you -- you ought to have you share of it and thirkle ought to play fair with you but he will not

and I reddy there be no tell what he might do in there if you have gun and knife on ye pass 'em over reddy or he 'll do for we yet petrak give up he weapon joyfully not realize that he be be disarm for the very purpose i have warn he about -- thirkle be get ready to finish he job in earnest now get along and dump the last of it in there and move navy style or we 'll be here at dark no more soldier petrak : and see that ye keep yer jaw batten down mr trenholm or i 'll take a hand in this that ye will not relish and attend to ye in a way ye will not fancy ye 'll play fair with I will not

would but you be too late now oh thirkle 's all right he grumble but he seem worried since he have give up the pistol and he see plainly enough that thirkle 's manner have change in no undecided way since petrak have surrender he weapon all clear say thirkle as we come out he be measure rope and have he jacket on and a bundle roll up and all the camp litter be remove and dead leaf scatter over we track can i have my gun now thirkle i do not like to go down the trail without a gun -- no knowin ' what might happen never would do yet reddy take this knife and cut the line away from mr trenholm 's foot and we 'll fix he so he can navigate back to the boat you take the lead back reddy because you know the way better than i do and i 'll make mr trenholm fast to ye and follow on we 'll need to look sharp to make the beach before dark but i want my gun thirkle fair play 's fair play and i want my gun never mind the gun i say mr trenholm will be right at you back all the way down and we can not take any chance now reddy i 'll settle he when the boat be off and then you will not have anything to worry about cut he foot loose what style of a funeral would suit he ask petrak busy with the cord at my foot we 'll have to select something special for mr trenholm how about the same go-off we give caldish remember caldish want to say he prayer quick and neat it be and no mess if he help with the boat how about a tow out at the end of a painter thirkle he 'll make good shark bait only some skinny that would do for he nicely reddy we 'll let he push the boat well out and when he have she clear pull away and give he plenty of line that be a capital idea reddy and we 'll use it they bind my arm to my side and put the end of the rope round petrak 's waist so that i be about five foot behind he when it be taut in this way we set out for the beach with petrak in the lead and thirkle carry he bundle and smoking a cigar tread on my heel to make I keep close up the sun be not quite down but the jungle be fill with shadow and once the sun get below the horizon night would close down on we with the tropical swiftness that know no twilight and the day would go out like a candle under a snuffer thirkle have be drinking of the brandy and be in a jolly mood and he have give petrak a good swig of it to lighten the little rascal 's foot but i refuse the bottle when it be offer to I for low as my spirit be and rack as my body be i could not come to accept they ghastly hospitality if i let the rope tighten between I and petrak thirkle prod I with the point of a knife and as i be faint with hunger and thirst and utterly worn out i frequently stumble and fall when they both set upon I and beat I to my foot petrak pull I up with the rope while thirkle scourge I with a leather thong we have be on the road about half a hour when i recognize the spot where captain rigg have crawl into the brush to rest and i begin to complain loudly and make as much noise as possible hope that the captain and rajah might still be conceal near by keep close yell petrak as i let the rope tighten and hang back get along or i 'll flay ye alive thunder thirkle which be what i want he to do then do not let those low limb fly back on I i cry as loudly as i dare without exciting they suspicion of my purpose they knock I off my foot and that be why i can not keep close up shut yer jaw say thirkle and i stumble along again wonder what have become of captain rigg and wonder if he have be lure into the jungle by the shot i have exchange with long jim and be lose i keep strain at the cord about I but although i hurt the wound on my wrist until i be weak from pain i could not free myself if nothing better offer i be determine to make a dash at thirkle if he free my hand to work at the boat if i could not surprise he in the dark and get hold of a knife or pistol i could at least give he a fight even if i die in a last attempt to save myself i much prefer to die fighting than at the end of a rope in the water as petrak have suggest i know they would have to find the oar before they could get a boat away and the miss plug might cause they a deal of trouble if they launch the boat without notice they loss i hope that i might find a chance of escape in the darkness if the boat fill with they after they get it into the water finally we come to level ground and i know we be close to the beach for we could hear the roller the brush be thicker in the marsh and we get off the trail but we could see patch of the moonlight on the water ahead and catch the white flash of the wave tumble on the shingle petrak leave the bed of the brook and push he way straight ahead through the dense foliage which shut we off from the beach i fall and make a great racket set up a wail about my leg and swearing that i have break it and beg thirkle to help I he strike at I with he thong and although he miss i scream at the top of my voice as a warn to captain rigg in case he should be lurk about besides i hope my play that i have be badly cripple would give I a better opportunity to escape or to attack they as they would be more careless if they think i be perfectly helpless i 'll give ye something to yell about soon say thirkle just wait a while and i 'll give ye something to make a real fuss about maybe ye think there be a ship near -- maybe there be but it will not do ye much good so let 's not have any more of this bawling i think ye be gamer than that my fine mr trenholm here we be thirkle cry petrak push the wall and bush aside and show we the moonlit sea and the loom of the mainland shoulder up into the star it can not be far to the boat thirkle we go out into the still warm sand the moon lean in its first quarter hang over the top of the island silver the sand and play with the gaunt shadow of the palm-trees distort they into queer shape and make grotesque pattern under we foot the breeze the snore of the wave the sense of freedom after the hot reek jungle refresh I and i almost forget the doom that threaten thirkle stand a minute and scan the channel mutter to himself look all clear sir say petrak all clear reddy push on lad the boat be right ahead here we be sir all snug call petrak and i see the indistinct pile in the shadow of the brush which mark the cache of boat no match reddy mind ye do not make a flash or we 'll have some craft on the prowl along here we can not take any chance cut I loose from this cuss line thirkle we can take a turn on a tree and hold the writin ' chap until we have need for he thirkle cut he free from I and they bind I to a broken palm-stump i plead to be put on the ground complain about my leg and petrak finally wrap the rope about my leg and throw I to the ground more to keep I quiet than to ease my suppose suffer they leave I lay helpless in a thicket of young bamboo shoot with my head and shoulder in the sand i manage to wriggle on my side so that i have view of the boat and what be better i get my tooth into the rope on my hand and begin gnawing it desperately which boat have the store reddy i be twist all around the nighest thirkle the nighest have the store and the other the tackle you go round the other side for the block reddy we better take the spare boat with we and set it adrift after we clear the channel or load it with stone and let it go down after we be clear of the island then we 'll get the wind and slip down the coast to the first native town that be better than wait to be pick up and have to answer question that would not carry by no manila-bound boat for we to land about the time the _ kut sing _ be report overdue right ye be thirkle say petrak stumble about in the dark it be black as a kroo boy in here and presently he begin to drag the block through the dead leaf and bramble ` no need for the tackle sir once we get clear of the sand in my mind we can skid 'em with oar and lighten the stow one -- hey thirkle i be not for leavin ' no mark hereabouts and we can drag some bush over the wake we leave in the sand so -- we 'll see about that when we get clear say thirkle gruffly hold yer lip now thirkle be busy pull the palm-leaf from the boat and clear the litter with which they have cover they cache i could hear he tug at the sail which they have spread over the outer boat the moonlight be get brighter and more star be come out and the jungle be begin to awaken a lizard set up a monotonous croak in the branch overhead and insect and unseen thing begin to stir in the foliage blast this mess of halyard and gear bucky strew alongside -- i hear thirkle draw he breath sharply as he leave the sentence unfinished he draw away from the boat in a quick involuntary movement and i manage to twist my neck so that i could observe he he stand motionless for a minute he figure a queer fretwork of light and shadow from the creeper and palm reddy he call cautiously oh petrak something in he tone -- a suggestion of suspicion that everything be not right -- thrill I petrak do not hear he as he be fumble with the block in the sand and mutter about a jam rope petrak aye say petrak i 'll give ye a hand next minute sir come here command thirkle with a hand

rajah hold she on a even keel we tug at the painter and soon have the water lapping at she bow the stock of provision and water be restow and then we smash the extra boat and take the oar we cover thirkle with sand but rigg say he would carry he back to manila with the gold rajah be in the boat and we be prying it off the shingle and wait for a favor wave when we be startle with a hail from the
