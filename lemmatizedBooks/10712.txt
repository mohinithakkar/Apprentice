show the way i come by it be this when we frigate lay in callao on the coast of peru -- she last harbor in the pacific -- i find myself without a _ grego _ or sailor 's surtout and as toward the end of a three year ' cruise no pea-jacket could be have from the purser 's steward : and be bind for cape horn some sort of a substitute be indispensable i employ myself for several day in manufacture a outlandish garment of my own devise to shelter I from the boisterous weather we be so soon to encounter it be nothing more than a white duck frock or rather shirt : which lay on deck i fold double at the bosom and by then make a continuation of the slit there open it lengthwise -- much as you would cut a leaf in the last new novel the gash be make a metamorphosis take place transcend any relate by ovid for presto the shirt be a coat -- a strange-looking coat to be sure of a quakerish amplitude about the skirt with a infirm tumble-down collar and a clumsy fullness about the wristband and white yea white as a shroud and my shroud it afterward come very near proving as he who read further will find but bless I my friend what sort of a summer jacket be this in which to weather cape horn a very tasty and beautiful white linen garment it may have seem but then people almost universally sport they linen next to they skin very true and that think very early occur to I for no idea have i of scud round cape horn in my shirt for _ that _ would have be almost scud under bare pole indeed so with many odds and end of patch -- old sock old trowser-leg and the like -- i bedarned and bequilt the inside of my jacket till it become all over stiff and padded as king jame 's cotton-stuffed and dagger-proof doublet and no buckram or steel hauberk stand up more stoutly so far very good but pray tell I white-jacket how do you propose keep out the rain and the wet in this quilted _ grego _ of yours you do not call this wad of old patch a mackintosh do you -- you do not pretend to say that worst be water-proof no my dear friend and that be the deuce of it waterproof it be not no more than a sponge indeed with such recklessness have i bequilted my jacket that in a rain-storm i become a universal absorber swab bone-dry the very bulwarks i lean against of a damp day my heartless shipmate even use to stand up against I so powerful be the capillary attraction between this luckless jacket of mine and all drop of moisture i drip like a turkey a roasting and long after the rain storm be over and the sun show he face i still stalk a scotch mist and when it be fair weather with other alas it be foul weather with I _ I _ ah I soaked and heavy what a burden be that jacket to carry about especially when i be send up aloft drag myself up step by step as if i be weigh the anchor small time then to strip and wring it out in a rain when no hang back or delay be permit no no up you go : fat or lean : lambert or edson : never mind how much avoirdupois you might weigh and thus in my own proper person do many shower of rain reascend toward the sky in accordance with the natural law but here be it know that i have be terribly disappoint in carry out my original plan concern this jacket it have be my intention to make it thoroughly impervious by give it a coating of paint but bitter fate ever overtake we unfortunate so much paint have be steal by the sailor in daub they overhaul trowser and tarpaulin that by the time i -- a honest man -- have complete my quilting the paint-pot be ban and put under strict lock and key say old brush the captain of the _ paint-room _ -- look ye white-jacket say he ye can not have any paint such then be my jacket : a well-patched padded and porous one and in a dark night gleam white as the white lady of avenel chapter ii homeward bind all hand up anchor man the capstan high die my lad we be homeward bind homeward bind -- harmonious sound be you _ ever _ homeward bind -- no -- quick take the wing of the morning or the sail of a ship and fly to the uttermost part of the earth there tarry a year or two and then let the gruffest of boatswain he lung all goose-skin shout forth those magical word and you 'll swear the harp of orpheus be not more enchant all be ready boat hoist in stun ' sail gear rove messenger pass capstan-bar in they place accommodation-ladder below and in glorious spirit we sit down to dinner in the ward-room the lieutenant be pass round they oldest port and pledge they friend in the steerage the _ middy _ be busy raise loan to liquidate the demand of they laundress or else -- in the navy phrase -- prepare to pay they creditor _ with a fly fore-topsail _ on the poop the captain be look to windward and in he grand inaccessible cabin the high and mighty commodore sit silent and stately as the statue of jupiter in dodona we be all array in we best and we bravest like strip of blue sky lay the pure blue collar of we frock upon we shoulder and we pump be so springy and playful that we dance up and down as we dine it be on the gun-deck that we dinner be spread all along between the gun and there as we cross-leg sit you would have think a hundred farm-yard and meadow be nigh such a cackling of duck chicken and gander such a lowing of ox and bleating of lambkin pen up here and there along the deck to provide sea repast for the officer more rural than naval be the sound continually remind each mother 's son of the old paternal homestead in the green old clime the old arching elm the hill where we gambol and down by the barley bank of the stream where we bath all hand up anchor when that order be give how we spring to the bar and heave round that capstan every man a goliath every tendon a hawser -- round and round -- round round it spin like a sphere keep time with we foot to the time of the fifer till the cable be straight up and down and the ship with she nose in the water heave and pall unship you bar and make sail it be do : barman nipper-men tierer veerer idler and all scramble up the ladder to the brace and halyard while like monkey in palm-tree the sail-looser run out on those broad bough we yard and down fall the sail like white cloud from the ether -- topsail top-gallant and royal and away we run with the halyard till every sheet be distended once more to the bar heave my hearty heave hard with a jerk and a yerk we break ground and up to we bow come several thousand pound of old iron in the shape of we ponderous anchor where be white-jacket then white-jacket be where he belong it be white-jacket that loose that main-royal so far up aloft there it look like a white albatross ' wing it be white-jacket that be take for a albatross himself as he fly out on the giddy yard-arm chapter iii a glance at the principal division into which a man-of-war 's crew be divide have just designate the place where white-jacket belong it must need be relate how white-jacket come to belong there every one know that in merchantman the seaman be divide into watch -- starboard and larboard -- take they turn at the ship 's duty by night this plan be follow in all men-of-war but in all men-of war besides this division there be other render indispensable from the great number of man and the necessity of precision and discipline not only be particular band assign to the three _ top _ but in get under weigh or any other proceed require all hand particular man of these band be assign to each yard of the top thus when the order be give to loose the main-royal white-jacket fly to obey it and no one but he and not only be particular band station on the three deck of the ship at such time but particular man of those band be also assign to particular duty also in tack ship reefing top-sail or come to every man of a frigate 's five-hundred-strong know he own special place and be infallibly find there he see nothing else attend to nothing else and will stay there till grim death or a epaulette order he away yet there be time when through the negligence of the officer some exception be find to this rule a rather serious circumstance grow out of such a case will be relate in some future chapter be it not for these regulation a man-of-war 's crew would be nothing but a mob more ungovernable strip the canvas in a gale than lord george gordon 's tear down the lofty house of lord mansfield but this be not all besides white-jacket 's office as looser of the main-royal when all hand be call to make sail and besides he special office in tack ship come to anchor etc he permanently belong to the starboard watch one of the two primary grand division of the ship 's company and in this watch he be a maintop-man that be be station in the main-top with a number of other seaman always in readiness to execute any order pertain to the main-mast from above the main-yard for include the main-yard and below it to the deck the main-mast belong to another detachment now the fore main and mizen-top-man of each watch -- starboard and larboard -- be at sea respectively subdivide into quarter watch which regularly relieve each other in the top to which they may belong while collectively they relieve the whole larboard watch of top-men besides these topman who be always make up of active sailor there be sheet-anchor-men -- old veteran all -- whose place be on the forecastle the fore-yard anchor and all the sail on the bowsprit be under they care they be a old weather-beaten set cull from the most experienced seaman on board these be the fellow that sing you _ the bay of biscay oh _ and _ here a sheer hulk lie poor torn bowling _ _ cease rude borea bluster railer _ who when ashore at a eating-house call for a bowl of tar and a biscuit these be the fellow who spin interminable yarn about decatur hull and bainbridge and carry about they person bit of old ironside as catholic do the wood of the true cross these be the fellow that some officer never pretend to damn however much they may anathematize other these be the fellow that it do you soul good to look at -- hearty old member of the old guard grim sea grenadier who in tempest time have lose many a tarpaulin overboard these be the fellow whose society some of the youngster midshipman much affect from whom they learn they best seamanship and to whom they look up as veteran if so be that they have any reverence in they soul which be not the case with all midshipman then there be the _ after-guard _ station on the quarterdeck who under the quarter-master and quarter-gunner attend to the main-sail and spanker and help haul the main-brace and other rope in the stern of the vessel the duty assign to the after-guard 's - man be comparatively light and easy and but little seamanship be expect from they they be compose chiefly of landsman the least robust least hardy and least sailor-like of the crew and be station on the quarter-deck they be generally select with some eye to they personal appearance hence they be mostly slender young fellow of a genteel figure and gentlemanly address not weigh much on a rope but weigh considerably in the estimation of all foreign lady who may chance to visit the ship they lounge away the most part of they time in read novel and romance talk over they lover affair ashore and compare note concern the melancholy and sentimental career which drive they -- poor young gentleman -- into the hard-hearted navy indeed many of they show token of have move in very respectable society they always maintain a tidy exterior and express a abhorrence of the tar-bucket into which they be seldom or never call to dip they digit and plume themselves upon the cut of they trowser and the glossiness of they tarpaulin from the rest of the ship 's company they acquire the name of _ sea-dandy _ and _ silk-sock-gentry _ then there be the _ waister _ always station on the gun-deck these haul aft the fore and main-sheets besides be subject to ignoble duty attend to the drainage and sewerage below hatch these fellow be all jimmy dux -- sorry chap who never put foot in ratlin or venture above the bulwark inveterate _ son of farmer _ with the hayseed yet in they hair they be consign to the congenial superintendence of the chicken-coops pig-pen and potato-locker these be generally place amidship on the gun-deck of a frigate between the fore and main hatch and comprise so extensive a area that it much resemble the market place of a small town the melodious sound thence issue continually draw tear from the eye of the waister remind they of they old paternal pig-pen and potato-patch they be the tag-rag and bob-tail of the crew and he who be good for nothing else be good enough for a _ waister _ three deck down -- spar-deck gun-deck and berth-deck -- and we come to a parcel of troglodyte or _ holder _ who burrow like rabbit in warren among the water-tanks cask and cable like cornwall miner wash off the soot from they skin and they be all pale as ghost unless upon rare occasion they seldom come on deck to sun themselves they may circumnavigate the world fifty time and they see about as much of it as jonah do in the whale 's belly they be a lazy lumpish torpid set and when go ashore after a long cruise come out into the day like terrapin from they cave or bear in the spring from tree-trunk no one ever know the name of these fellow after a three year ' voyage they still remain stranger to you in time of tempest when all hand be call to save ship they issue forth into the gale like the mysterious old man of pari during the massacre of the three day of September : every one marvel who they be and whence they come they disappear as mysteriously and be see no more until another general commotion such be the principal division into which a man-of-war 's crew be divide but the inferior allotment of duty be endless and would require a german commentator to chronicle we say nothing here of boatswain 's mate gunner 's mate carpenter 's mate sail-maker 's mate armorer 's mate master-at-arms ship 's corporal cockswain quarter-master quarter-gunner captain of the forecastle captain of the fore-top captain of the main-top captain of the mizen-top captain of the after-guard captain of the main-hold captain of the fore-hold captain of the head cooper painter tinker commodore 's steward captain 's steward ward-room steward steerage steward commodore 's cook captain 's cook officer ' cook cook of the range mess-cooks hammock-boy messenger boy cot-boys loblolly-boy and numberless other whose function be fix and peculiar it be from this endless subdivision of duty in a man-of-war that upon first enter one a sailor have need of a good memory and the more of a arithmetician he be the better white-jacket for one be a long time rapt in calculation concern the various number allot he by the _ first luff _ otherwise know as the first lieutenant in the first place white-jacket be give the _ number of he mess _ then he _ ship 's number _ or the number to which he must answer when the watch-roll be call then the number of he hammock then the number of the gun to which he be assign besides a variety of other number all of which would have take jedediah buxton himself some time to arrange in battalion previous to add up all these number moreover must be well remembered or woe betide you consider now a sailor altogether unused to the tumult of a man-of-war for the first time step on board and give all these number to recollect already before hear they he head be half stunned with the unaccustomed sound ring in he ear which ear seem to he like belfry full of tocsin on the gun-deck a thousand scythe chariot seem pass he hear the tread of armed marine the clash of cutlass and curse the boatswain 's mate whistle round he like hawk scream in a gale and the strange noise under deck be like volcanic rumbling in a mountain he dodge sudden sound as a raw recruit fall bomb well-nigh useless to he now all previous circumnavigation of this terraqueous globe of no account he arctic antarctic or equinoctial experience he gale off beachy head or he dismasting off hattera he must begin anew he know nothing greek and hebrew could not help he for the language he must learn have neither grammar nor lexicon mark he as he advance along the file of old ocean-warrior mark he debased attitude he deprecating gesture he sawney stare like a scotchman in london he -- _ cry you merry noble seignor _ he be wholly nonplussed and confound and when to crown all the first lieutenant whose business it be to welcome all new-corner and assign they they quarter : when this officer -- none of the most bland or amiable either -- give he number after number to recollect -- 246 -- 139 -- 478 -- 351 -- the poor fellow feel like decamp study then you mathematics and cultivate all you memory oh ye who think of cruise in men-of-war chapter iv jack chase the first night out of port be a clear moonlight one the frigate glide though the water with all she battery it be my quarter watch in the top and there i recline on the best possible term with my top-mate whatever the other seaman might have be these be a noble set of tar and well worthy a introduction to the reader first and foremost be jack chase we noble first captain of the top he be a briton and a true-blue tall and well-knit with a clear open eye a fine broad brow and a abound nut-brown beard no man ever have a better heart or a bolder he be love by the seaman and admire by the officer and even when the captain speak to he it be with a slight air of respect jack be a frank and charming man no one could be better company in forecastle or saloon no man tell such story sing such song or with greater alacrity spring to he duty indeed there be only one thing want about he and that be a finger of he left hand which finger he have lose at the great battle of navarino he have a high conceit of he profession as a seaman and be deeply verse in all thing pertain to a man-of-war be universally regard as a oracle the main-top over which he preside be a sort of oracle of delphus to which many pilgrim ascend to have they perplexity or difference settle there be such a abound air of good sense and good feeling about the man that he who could not love he would thereby pronounce himself a knave i thank my sweet star that kind fortune have place I near he though under he in the frigate and from the outset jack and i be fast friend wherever you may be now roll over the blue billow dear jack take my best love along with you and god bless you wherever you go jack be a gentleman what though he hand be hard so be not he heart too often the case with soft palm he manners be easy and free none of the boisterousness so common to tar and he have a polite courteous way of salute you if it be only to borrow you knife jack have read all the verse of byron and all the romance of scott he talk of rob roy don juan and pelham macbeth and ulyss but above all thing be a ardent admirer of camoen part of the lusiad he could recite in the original where he have obtain he wonderful accomplishment it be not for I he humble subordinate to say enough that those accomplishment be so various the language he could converse in so numerous that he more than furnish a example of that say of charle the fifth -- _ he who speak five language be as good as five man _ but jack he be better than a hundred common mortal jack be a whole phalanx a entire army jack be a thousand strong jack would have do honor to the queen of england 's drawing-room jack must have be a by-blow of some british admiral of the blue a finer specimen of the island race of englishman could not have be pick out of westminster abbey of a coronation day he whole demeanor be in strong contrast to that of one of the captain of the fore-top this man though a good seaman furnish a example of those insufferable briton who while prefer other country to they own as place of residence still overflow with all the pompousness of national and individual vanity combine when i be on board the audacious -- for a long time be almost the invariable exordium to the fore-top captain 's most cursory remark it be often the custom of man-of-war 's - man when they deem anything to be go on wrong aboard ship to refer to _ last cruise _ when of course everything be do _ ship-shape and bristol fashion _ and by refer to the _ audacious _ -- a expressive name by the way -- the fore-top captain mean a ship in the english navy in which he have have the honor of serve so continual be he allusion to this craft with the amiable name that at last the _ audacious _ be vote a bear by he shipmate and one hot afternoon during a calm when the fore-top captain like many other be stand still and yawn on the spar-deck jack chase he own countryman come up to he and point at he open mouth politely inquire whether that be the way they catch _ fly _ in she britannic majesty 's ship the _ audacious _ after that we hear no more of the craft now the top of a frigate be quite spacious and cosy they be rail in behind so as to form a kind of balcony very pleasant of a tropical night from twenty to thirty lounger may agreeably recline there cushion themselves on old sail and jacket we have rare time in that top we account ourselves the best seaman in the ship and from we airy perch literally look down upon the landloper below sneak about the deck among the gun in a large degree we nourish that feeling of _ esprit de corps _ always pervade more or less the various section of a man-of-war 's crew we main-top-men be brother one and all and we loan ourselves to each other with all the freedom in the world nevertheless i have not long be a member of this fraternity of fine fellow ere i discover that jack chase we captain be -- like all prime favorite and oracle among man -- a little bit of a dictator not peremptorily or annoyingly so but amusingly intent on egotistically mend we manners and improve we taste so that we might reflect credit upon we tutor he make we all wear we hat at a particular angle -- instruct we in the tie of we neck-handkerchief and protest against we wear vulgar _ dungeree _ trowser besides give we lesson in seamanship and solemnly conjure we forever to eschew the company of any sailor we suspect of have serve in a whaler against all whaler indeed he cherish the unmitigated detestation of a true man-of-war 's man poor tubb can testify to that tubb be in the after-guard a long lank vineyarder eternally talk of line-tub nantucket sperm oil stove boat and japan nothing could silence he and he comparison be ever invidious now with all he soul jack abominate this tubb he say he be vulgar a upstart -- devil take he he be be in a whaler but like many man who have be where _ you _ have not be or see what _ you _ have not see tubb on account of he whaling experience absolutely affect to look down upon jack even as jack do upon he and this it be that so enraged we noble captain one night with a peculiar meaning in he eye he send I down on deck to invite tubb up aloft for a chat flatter by so marked a honor -- for we be somewhat fastidious and do not extend such invitation to every body -- tubb 's quickly mount the rig look rather abashed at find himself in the August presence of the assemble quarter-watch of main-top-men jack 's courteous manner however very soon relieved he embarrassment but it be no use to be courteous to _ some _ man in this world tubb belong to that category no sooner do the bumpkin feel himself at ease than he launch out as usual into tremendous laudation of whalemen declare that whaleman alone deserve the name of sailor jack stand it some time but when tubb come down upon men-of-war and particularly upon main-top-men he sense of propriety be so outraged that he launch into tubb like a forty-two pounder why you limb of nantucket you train-oil man you sea-tallow strainer you bobber after carrion do _ you _ pretend to vilify a man-of-war why you lean rogue you a man-of-war be to whalemen as a metropolis to shire-town and sequestered hamlet _ here 's _ the place for life and commotion _ here 's _ the place to be gentlemanly and jolly and what do you know you bumpkin before you come on board this _ andrew miller _ what know you of gun-deck or orlop mustering round the capstan beat to quarter and piping to dinner do you ever roll to _ grog _ on board you greasy ballyhoo of blaze do you ever winter at mahon do you ever ' _ lash and carry _ ' why what be even a merchant-seaman 's sorry yarn of voyage to china after tea-caddie and voyage to the west indy after sugar puncheon and voyage to the shetland after seal-skin -- what be even these yarn you tubb you to high life in a man-of-war why you dead-eye i have sail with lord and marquis for captain and the king of the two sicily have pass I as i here stand up at my gun bah you be full of the fore-peak and the forecastle you be only familiar with burton and billy-tackle you ambition never mount above pig-killing which in my poor opinion be the proper phrase for whale topmate have not this tubb here be but a misuser of good oak plank and a vile desecrator of the thrice holy sea turn he ship my hearty into a fat-kettle and the ocean into a whale-pen begone you graceless godless knave pitch he over the top there white-jacket but there be no necessity for my exertion poor tubb astounded at these fulmination be already rapidly descend by the rigging this outburst on the part of my noble friend jack make I shake all over spite of my padded surtout and cause I to offer up devout thanksgiving that in no evil hour have i divulge the fact of have myself serve in a whaler for have previously mark the prevail prejudice of man-of-war 's man to that much-maligned class of mariner i have wisely hold my peace concern stove boat on the coast of japan chapter v jack chase on a spanish quarter-deck here i must frankly tell a story about jack which as touch he honor and integrity i be sure will not work against he in any charitable man 's estimation on this present cruise of the frigate neversink jack have desert and after a certain interval have be capture but with what purpose have he desert to avoid naval discipline to riot in some abandon sea-port for love of some worthless signorita not at all he abandon the frigate from far higher and nobler nay glorious motive though bow to naval discipline afloat yet ashore he be a stickler for the rights of man and the liberty of the world he go to draw a partisan blade in the civil commotion of peru and befriend heart and soul what he deem the cause of the right at the time he disappearance excite the utmost astonishment among the officer who have little suspected he of any such conduct of desert what jack my great man of the main-top go cry the captain i 'll not believe it jack chase cut and run cry a sentimental middy it must have be all for love then the signorita have turn he head jack chase not to be find cry a growling old sheet-anchor-man one of you malicious prophet of past event : i though so i know would it i could have swear it -- just the chap to make sail on the sly i always s ` pect he month pass away and nothing be hear of jack till at last the frigate come to anchor on the coast alongside of a peruvian sloop of war bravely clothe in the peruvian uniform and with a fine mixed martial and naval step a tall striking figure of a long-bearded officer be descry promenade the quarter-deck of the stranger and superintend the salute which be exchange between national vessel on these occasion this fine officer touch he lace hat most courteously to we captain who after return the compliment stare at he rather impolitely through he spy-glass by heaven he cry at last -- it be he -- he can not disguise he walk -- that be the beard i would know he in cochin china -- man the first cutter there lieutenant blink go on board that sloop of war and fetch I yon officer all hand be aghast -- what when a piping-hot peace be between the united state and peru to send a armed body on board a peruvian sloop of war and seize one of its officer in broad daylight -- monstrous infraction of the law of nation what would vattel say but captain claret must be obey so off go the cutter every man arm to the tooth the lieutenant-commanding have secret instruction and the midshipman attend look ominously wise though in truth they could not tell what be come gain the sloop of war the lieutenant be receive with the customary honor but by this time the tall bearded officer have disappear from the quarter-deck the lieutenant now inquire for the peruvian captain and be show into the cabin make know to he that on board he vessel be a person belong to the united state ship neversink and he order be to have that person deliver up instanter the foreign captain curl he mustache in astonishment and indignation he hint something about beat to quarter and chastise this piece of yankee insolence but rest one gloved hand upon the table and play with he sword-knot the lieutenant with a bland firmness repeat he demand at last the whole case be so plainly make out and the person in question be so accurately describe even to a mole on he cheek there remain nothing but immediate compliance so the fine-looking bearded officer who have so courteously doff he chapeau to we captain but disappear upon the arrival of the lieutenant be summon into the cabin before he superior who address he thus : -- don john this gentleman declare that of right you belong to the frigate neversink be it so it be even so don sereno say jack chase proudly folding he gold-laced coat-sleeve across he chest -- and as there be no resist the frigate i comply -- lieutenant blink i be ready adieu don sereno and madre de dios protect you you have be a most gentlemanly friend and captain to I i hope you will yet thrash you beggarly foe with that he turn and enter the cutter be pull back to the frigate and step up to captain claret where that gentleman stand on the quarter-deck you servant my fine don say the captain ironically lift he chapeau but regard jack at the same time with a look of intense displeasure you most devoted and penitent captain of the main-top sir and one who in he very humility of contrition be yet proud to call captain claret he commander say jack make a glorious bow and then tragically fling overboard he peruvian sword reinstate he at once shout captain claret -- and now sir to you duty and discharge that well to the end of the cruise and you will hear no more of you have run away so jack go forward among crowd of admire tar who swear by he nut-brown beard which have amazingly lengthen and spread during he absence they divide he lace hat and coat among they and on they shoulder carry he in triumph along the gun-deck chapter vi the quarter-deck officer warrant officer and berth-deck underling of a man-of-war where they live in the ship how they live they social standing on ship-board and what sort of gentleman they be some account have be give of the various division into which we crew be divide so it may be well to say something of the officer who they be and what be they function we ship be it know be the flag-ship that be we sport a _ broad-pennant _ or _ bougee _ at the main in token that we carry a commodore -- the highest rank of officer recognize in the american navy the bougee be not to be confound with the _ long pennant _ or _ coach-whip _ a taper serpentine streamer worn by all men-of-war owing to certain vague republican scruple about create great officer of the navy america have thus far have no admiral though as she ship of war increase they may become indispensable this will assuredly be the case should she ever have occasion to employ large fleet when she must adopt something like the english plan and introduce three or four grade of flag-officer above a commodore -- admiral vice-admiral and rear-admiral of squadron distinguish by the color of they flag -- red white and blue correspond to the center van and rear these rank respectively with general lieutenant-general and major-general in the army just as commodore take rank with a brigadier-general so that the same prejudice which prevent the american government from create admiral should have preclude the creation of all army officer above a brigadier a american commodore like a english commodore or the french _ chef d'escadre _ be but a senior captain temporarily command a small number of ship detach for any special purpose he have no permanent rank recognize by government above he captaincy though once employ as a commodore usage and courtesy unite in continue the title we commodore be a gallant old man who have see service in he time when a lieutenant he serve in the late war with england and in the gun-boat action on the lake near new orlean just previous to the grand land engagement receive a musket-ball in he shoulder which with the two ball in he eye he carry about with he to this day often when i look at the venerable old warrior double up from the effect of he wound i think what a curious as well as painful sensation it must be to have one 's shoulder a lead-mine though sooth to say so many of we civilised mortal convert we mouth into golconda on account of this wound in he shoulder we commodore have a body-servant 's pay allow he in addition to he regular salary i can not say a great deal personally of the commodore he never seek my company at all never extend any gentlemanly courtesy but though i can not say much of he personally i can mention something of he in he general character as a flag-officer in the first place then i have serious doubt whether for the most part he be not dumb for in my hearing he seldom or never utter a word and not only do he seem dumb himself but he presence possess the strange power of make other people dumb for the time he appearance on the quarter-deck seem to give every officer the lock-jaw another phenomenon about he be the strange manner in which everyone shun he at the first sign of those epaulet of he on the weather side of the poop the officer there congregate invariably shrink over to leeward and leave he alone perhaps he have a evil eye may be he be the wander jew afloat the real reason probably be that like all high functionary he deem it indispensable religiously to sustain he dignity one of the most troublesome thing in the world and one call for the greatest self-denial and the constant watch and many-sided guardedness which this sustain of a commodore 's dignity require plainly enough show that apart from the common dignity of manhood commodore in general possess no real dignity at all true it be expedient for crown head generalissimo lord-high-admiral and commodore to carry themselves straight and beware of the spinal complaint but it be not the less veritable that it be a piece of assumption exceedingly uncomfortable to themselves and ridiculous to a enlighten generation now how many rare good fellow there be among we main-top-man who invite into he cabin over a social bottle or two would have rejoice we old commodore 's heart and cause that ancient wound of he to heal up at once come come commodore do not look so sour old boy step up aloft here into the _ top _ and we 'll spin you a sociable yarn truly i think myself much happier in that white jacket of mine than we old commodore in he dignified epaulet one thing perhaps that more than anything else help to make we commodore so melancholy and forlorn be the fact of he have so little to do for as the frigate have a captain of course so far as _ she _ be concern we commodore be a supernumerary what abundance of leisure he must have have during a three year ' cruise how indefinitely he might have be improve he mind but as everyone know that idleness be the hardest work in the world so we commodore be specially provide with a gentleman to assist he this gentleman be call the _ commodore 's secretary _ he be a remarkably urbane and polished man with a very graceful exterior and look much like a ambassador extraordinary from versaille he mess with the lieutenant in the ward-room where he have a state-room elegantly furnish as the private cabinet of pelham he cot-boy use to entertain the sailor with all manner of story about the silver-keyed flute and flageolet fine oil painting morocco bind volume chinese chess-men gold shirt-button enamel pencil case extraordinary fine french boot with sole no thicker than a sheet of scented note-paper embroidered vest incense-burning sealing-wax alabaster statuette of venus and adoni tortoise-shell snuff-box inlay toilet-case ivory-handled hair-brush and mother-of-pearl comb and a hundred other luxurious appendage scatter about this magnificent secretary 's state-room i be a long time in find out what this secretary 's duty comprise but it seem he write the commodore 's dispatch for washington and also be he general amanuensis nor be this a very light duty at time for some commodore though they do not _ say _ a great deal on board ship yet they have a vast deal to write very often the regimental orderly station at we commodore 's cabin-door would touch he hat to the first lieutenant and with a mysterious air hand he a note i always think these note must contain most important matter of state until one day see a slip of wet tear paper in a scupper-hole i read the following : sir you will give the people pickle to-day with they fresh meat to lieutenant bridewell by command of the commodore adolphus dashman priv sec this be a new revelation for from he almost immutable reserve i have suppose that the commodore never meddle immediately with the concern of the ship but leave all that to the captain but the longer we live the more we learn of commodore turn we now to the second officer in rank almost supreme however in the internal affair of he ship captain claret be a large portly man a harry the eighth afloat bluff and hearty and as kingly in he cabin as harry on he throne for a ship be a bit of terra firma cut off from the main it be a state in itself and the captain be its king it be no limited monarchy where the sturdy common have a right to petition and snarl if they please but almost a despotism like the grand turk 's the captain 's word be law he never speak but in the imperative mood when he stand on he quarter-deck at sea he absolutely command as far as eye can reach only the moon and star be beyond he jurisdiction he be lord and master of the sun it be not twelve o'clock till he say so for when the sailing-master whose duty it be to take the regular observation at noon touch he hat and report twelve o'clock to the officer of the deck that functionary order a midshipman to repair to the captain 's cabin and humbly inform he of the respectful suggestion of the sailing-master twelve o'clock report sir say the middy _ make _ it so reply the captain and the bell be strike eight by the messenger-boy and twelve o'clock it be as in the case of the commodore when the captain visit the deck he subordinate officer generally beat a retreat to the other side and as a general rule would no more think of address he except concern the ship than a lackey would think of hail the czar of russium on he throne and invite he to tea perhaps no mortal man have more reason to feel such a intense sense of he own personal consequence as the captain of a man-of-war at sea next in rank come the first or senior lieutenant the chief executive officer i have no reason to love the particular gentleman who fill that post aboard we frigate for it be he who refuse my petition for as much black paint as would render water-proof that white-jacket of mine all my soaking and drenching lie at he state-room door i hardly think i shall ever forgive he every twinge of the rheumatism which i still occasionally feel be directly referable to he the immortal have a reputation for clemency and _ they _ may pardon he but he must not dun I to be merciful but my personal feeling toward the man shall not prevent I from here do he justice in most thing he be a excellent seaman prompt loud and to the point and as such be well fit for he station the first lieutenancy of a frigate demand a good disciplinarian and every way a energetic man by the captain he be hold responsible for everything by that magnate indeed he be suppose to be omnipresent down in the hold and up aloft at one and the same time he preside at the head of the ward-room officer ' table who be so call from they mess together in a part of the ship thus designate in a frigate it comprise the after part of the berth-deck sometimes it go by the name of the gun-room but oftener be call the ward-room within this ward-room much resemble a long wide corridor in a large hotel numerous door open on both hand to the private apartment of the officer i never have a good interior look at it but once and then the chaplain be seat at the table in the center play chess with the lieutenant of marine it be mid-day but the place be light by lamp besides the first lieutenant the ward-room officer include the junior lieutenant in a frigate six or seven in number the sailing-master purser chaplain surgeon marine officer and midshipman 's schoolmaster or the professor they generally form a very agreeable club of good fellow from they diversity of character admirably calculate to form a agreeable social whole the lieutenant discuss sea-fight and tell anecdote of lord nelson and lady hamilton the marine officer talk of storm fortress and the siege of gibraltar the purser steady this wild conversation by occasional allusion to the rule of three the professor be always charge with a scholarly reflection or a apt line from the classic generally ovid the surgeon 's story of the amputation-table judiciously serve to suggest the mortality of the whole party as man while the good chaplain stand ready at all time to give they pious counsel and consolation of course these gentleman all associate on a footing of perfect social equality next in order come the warrant or forward officer consist of the boatswain gunner carpenter and sailmaker though these worthy sport long coat and wear the anchor-button yet in the estimation of the ward-room officer they be not technically speak rate gentleman the first lieutenant chaplain or surgeon for example would never dream of invite they to dinner in sea parlance they come in at the hawse hole they have hard hand and the carpenter and sail-maker practically understand the duty which they be call upon to superintend they mess by themselves invariably four in number they never have need to play whist with a dummy in this part of the category now come the reefer otherwise middy or midshipman these boy be send to sea for the purpose of make commodore and in order to become commodore many of they deem it indispensable forthwith to commence chewing tobacco drinking brandy and water and swearing at the sailor as they be only place on board a sea-going ship to go to school and learn the duty of a lieutenant and until qualify to act as such have few or no special function to attend to they be little more while midshipman than supernumerary on board hence in a crowded frigate they be so everlastingly cross the path of both man and officer that in the navy it have become a proverb that a useless fellow be _ as much in the way as a reefer _ in a gale of wind when all hand be call and the deck swarm with man the little middy run about distract and have nothing particular to do make it up in vociferous swearing explode all about under foot like torpedo some of they be terrible little boy cock they cup at alarming angle and look fierce as young rooster they be generally great consumer of macassar oil and the balm of columbium they thirst and rage after whisker and sometimes apply they ointment lay themselves out in the sun to promote the fertility of they chin as the only way to learn to command be to learn to obey the usage of a ship of war be such that the midshipman be constantly be order about by the lieutenant though without have assign they they particular destination they be always go somewhere and never arrive in some thing they almost have a harder time of it than the seaman themselves they be messenger and errand-boy to they superior mr pert cry a officer of the deck hail a young gentleman forward mr pert advance touch he hat and remain in a attitude of deferential suspense go and tell the boatswain i want he and with this perilous errand the middy hurry away look proud as a king the middy live by themselves in the steerage where nowadays they dine off a table spread with a cloth they have a castor at dinner they have some other little boy -lrb- select from the ship 's company -rrb- to wait upon they they sometimes drink coffee out of china but for all these they modern refinement in some instance the affair of they club go sadly to rack and ruin the china be break the japan coffee-pot dent like a pewter mug in a ale-house the pronged fork resemble tooth-pick -lrb- for which they be sometimes use -rrb- the table-knife be hack into hand-saw and the cloth go to the sail-maker to be patch indeed they be something like collegiate freshman and sophomore live in the college building especially so far as the noise they make in they quarter be concern the steerage buzz hum and swarm like a hive or like a infant-school of a hot day when the school-mistress fall asleep with a fly on she nose in frigate the ward-room -- the retreat of the lieutenant -- immediately adjoining the steerage be on the same deck with it frequently when the middy wake early of a morning as most youngster do would be kick up they heel in they hammock or run about with double-reefed night-gown play tag among the clew the senior lieutenant would burst among they with a -- young gentleman i be astonished you must stop this sky-larking mr pert what be you do at the table there without you pantaloons to you hammock sir let I see no more of this if you disturb the ward-room again young gentleman you shall hear of it and so say this hoary-headed senior lieutenant would retire to he cot in he state-room like the father of a numerous family after get up in he dressing-gown and slipper to quiet a daybreak tumult in he populous nursery have now descend from commodore to middy we come lastly to a set of nondescript form also a mess by themselves apart from the seaman into this mess the usage of a man-of-war thrust various subordinate -- include the master-at-arms purser 's steward ship 's corporal marine sergeant and ship 's yeomen form the first aristocracy above the sailor the master-at-arms be a sort of high constable and school-master wear citizen 's clothes and know by he official rattan he it be whom all sailor hate he be the universal duty of a universal informer and hunter-up of delinquent on the berth-deck he reign supreme spy out all grease-spot make by the various cook of the seaman 's mess and drive the laggard up the hatch when all hand be call it be indispensable that he should be a very vidocq in vigilance but as it be a heartless so be it a thankless office of dark night most masters-of-arm keep themselves in readiness to dodge forty-two pound ball drop down the hatchway near they the ship 's corporal be this worthy 's deputy and usher the marine sergeant be generally tall fellow with unyielding spine and stiff upper lip and very exclusive in they taste and predilection the ship 's yeoman be a gentleman who have a sort of counting-room in a tar-cellar down in the fore-hold more will be say of he anon except the officer above enumerate there be none who mess apart from the seaman the _ petty officer _ so call that be the boatswain 's gunner 's carpenter 's and sail-maker 's mate the captain of the top of the forecastle and of the after-guard and of the fore and main hold and the quarter-master all mess in common with the crew and in the american navy be only distinguish from the common seaman by they slightly additional pay but in the english navy they wear crown and anchor work on the sleeve of they jacket by way of badge of office in the french navy they be know by strip of worsted worn in the same place like those designate the sergeant and corporal in the army thus it will be see that the dinner-table be the criterion of rank in we man-of-war world the commodore dine alone because he be the only man of he rank in the ship so too with the captain and the ward-room officer warrant officer midshipman the master-at-arms ' mess and the common seaman -- all of they respectively dine together because they be respectively on a footing of equality chapter vii breakfast dinner and supper not only be the dinner-table a criterion of rank on board a man-of-war but also the dinner hour he who dine latest be the greatest man and he who dine earliest be account the least in a flag-ship the commodore generally dine about four or five o'clock the captain about three the lieutenant about two while _ the people _ -lrb- by which phrase the common seaman be specially designate in the nomenclature of the quarter-deck -rrb- sit down to they salt beef exactly at noon thus it will be see that while the two estate of sea-king and sea-lord dine at rather patrician hour -- and thereby in the long run impair they digestive function -- the sea-commoner or _ the people _ keep up they constitution by keep up the good old-fashioned elizabethan franklin-warranted dinner hour of twelve twelve o'clock it be the natural center key-stone and very heart of the day at that hour the sun have arrive at the top of he hill and as he seem to hang poise there a while before come down on the other side it be but reasonable to suppose that he be then stop to dine set a eminent example to all mankind the rest of the day be call _ afternoon _ the very sound of which fine old saxon word convey a feeling of the lee bulwark and a nap a summer sea -- soft breeze creep over it dreamy dolphin glide in the distance _ afternoon _ the word imply that it be a after-piece come after the grand drama of the day something to be take leisurely and lazily but how can this be if you dine at five for after all though paradise lose be a noble poem and we man-of-war 's man no doubt largely partake in the immortality of the immortal yet let we candidly confess it shipmate that upon the whole we dinner be the most momentous attain of these life we lead beneath the moon what be a day without a dinner a dinnerless day such a day have better be a night again : twelve o'clock be the natural hour for we man-of-war 's man to dine because at that hour the very time-pieces we have invent arrive at they terminus they can get no further than twelve when straightway they continue they old round again doubtless adam and eve dine at twelve and the patriarch abraham in the midst of he cattle and old job with he noon mower and reaper in that grand plantation of uz and old noah himself in the ark must have go to dinner at precisely _ eight bell _ -lrb- noon -rrb- with all he float family and farm-yard but though this antediluvian dinner hour be reject by modern commodore and captain it still linger among _ the people _ under they command many sensible thing banish from high life find a asylum among the mob some commodore be very particular in see to it that no man on board the ship dare to dine after he -lrb- the commodore 's -rrb- own dessert be clear away -- not even the captain it be say on good authority that a captain once venture to dine at five when the commodore 's hour be four next day as the story go that captain receive a private note and in consequence of that note dine for the future at half-past three though in respect of the dinner hour on board a man-of-war _ the people _ have no reason to complain yet they have just cause almost for mutiny in the outrageous hour assign for they breakfast and supper eight o'clock for breakfast twelve for dinner four for supper and no meal but these no lunch and no cold snack owe to this arrangement -lrb- and partly to one watch go to they meal before the other at sea -rrb- all the meal of the twenty-four hour be crowd into a space of less than eight sixteen mortal hour elapse between supper and breakfast include to one watch eight hour on deck this be barbarous any physician will tell you so think of it before the commodore have dine you have sup and in high latitudes in summer-time you have take you last meal for the day and five hour or more daylight to spare mr secretary of the navy in the name of _ the people _ you should interpose in this matter many a time have i a maintop-man find myself actually faint of a tempestuous morning watch when all my energy be demand -- owe to this miserable unphilosophical mode of allot the government meal at sea we beg you mr secretary not to be sway in this matter by the honorable board of commodore who will no doubt tell you that eight twelve and four be the proper hour for _ the people _ to take they meal inasmuch as at these hour the watch be relieve for though this arrangement make a neater and cleaner thing of it for the officer and look very nice and superfine on paper yet it be plainly detrimental to health and in time of war be attend with still more serious consequence to the whole nation at large if the necessary research be make it would perhaps be find that in those instance where men-of-war adopt the above-mentioned hour for meal have encounter a enemy at night they have pretty generally be beat that be in those case where the enemy ' meal time be reasonable which be only to be account for by the fact that _ the people _ of the beaten vessel be fight on a empty stomach instead of a full one chapter viii selvagee contrast with mad-jack have glance at the grand division of a man-of-war let we now descend to speciality : and particularly to two of the junior lieutenant lord and nobleman member of that house of peer the gun-room there be several young lieutenant on board but from these two -- represent the extreme of character to be find in they department -- the nature of the other officer of they grade in the neversink must be derive one of these two quarter-deck lord go among the sailor by a name of they own devise -- selvagee of course it be intend to be characteristic and even so it be in frigate and all large ship of war when get under weigh a large rope call a _ messenger _ use to carry the strain of the cable to the capstan so that the anchor may be weigh without the muddy ponderous cable itself go round the capstan as the cable enter the hawse-hole therefore something must be constantly use to keep this travel chain attach to this travel _ messenger _ something that may be rapidly wind round both so as to bind they together the article use be call a _ selvagee _ and what could be better adapt to the purpose it be a slender taper unstranded piece of rope prepare with much solicitude peculiarly flexible and wreathe and serpentine round the cable and messenger like a elegantly-modeled garter-snake round the twisted stalk of a vine indeed _ selvagee _ be the exact type and symbol of a tall genteel limber spiralise exquisite so much for the derivation of the name which the sailor apply to the lieutenant from what sea-alcove from what mermaid 's milliner 's shop hast thou emerge selvagee with that dainty waist and languid cheek what heartless step-dame drive thee forth to waste thy fragrance on the salt sea-air be it _ you _ selvagee that outward-bind off cape horn look at hermit island through a opera-glass be it _ you _ who think of propose to the captain that when the sail be furl in a gale a few drop of lavender should be drop in they bunt so that when the canvas be set again you nostril might not be offend by its musty smell i do not _ say _ it be you selvagee i but deferentially inquire in plain prose selvagee be one of those officer whom the sight of a trim-fitting naval coat have captivate in the day of he youth he fancy that if a _ sea-officer _ dress well and converse genteelly he would abundantly uphold the honor of he flag and immortalise the tailor that make he on that rock many young gentleman split for upon a frigate 's quarter-deck it be not enough to sport a coat fashion by a stultz it be not enough to be well brace with strap and suspenders it be not enough to have sweet reminiscence of laura and matilda it be a right down life of hard wear and tear and the man who be not in a good degree fit to become a common sailor will never make a officer take that to heart all ye naval aspirant thrust you arm up to the elbow in pitch and see how you like it ere you solicit a warrant prepare for white squall live gale and typhoon read account of shipwreck and horrible disaster peruse the narrative of byron and bligh familiarise yourselve with the story of the english frigate alceste and the french frigate medusa though you may go ashore now and then at cadiz and palermo for every day so spend among orange and lady you will have whole month of rain and gale and even thus do selvagee prove it but with all the intrepid effeminacy of you true dandy he still continue he cologne-water bath and sport he lace-bordered handkerchief in the very tooth of a tempest alas selvagee there be no get the lavender out of you but selvagee be no fool theoretically he understand he profession but the mere theory of seamanship form but the thousandth part of what make a seaman you can not save a ship by work out a problem in the cabin the deck be the field of action well aware of he deficiency in some thing selvagee never take the trumpet -- which be the badge of the deck officer for the time -- without a tremulous movement of the lip and a earnest inquire eye to the windward he encourage those old triton the quarter-master to discourse with he concern the likelihood of a squall and often follow they advice as to take in or make sail the smallest favor in that way be thankfully receive sometimes when all the north look unusually lower by many conversational blandishments he would endeavor to prolong he predecessor 's stay on deck after that officer 's watch have expire but in fine steady weather when the captain would emerge from he cabin selvagee might be see pacing the poop with long bold indefatigable stride and cast he eye up aloft with the most ostentatious fidelity but vain these pretence he could not deceive selvagee you know very well that if it come on to blow pretty hard the first lieutenant will be sure to interfere with he paternal authority every man and every boy in the frigate know selvagee that you be no neptune how unenviable he situation he brother officer do not insult he to be sure but sometimes they look be as dagger the sailor do not laugh at he outright but of dark night they jeer when they hearken to that mantuamaker 's voice order _ a strong pull at the main brace _ or _ hand by the halyard _ sometimes by way of be terrific and make the man jump selvagee rap out a oath but the soft bomb stuff with confectioner 's kiss seem to burst like a crushed rose-bud diffuse its odours selvagee selvagee take a main-top-man 's advice and this cruise over never more tempt the sea with this gentleman of cravat and curl iron how strongly contrast the man who be bear in a gale for in some time of tempest -- off cape horn or hattera -- _ mad jack _ must have enter the world -- such thing have be -- not with a silver spoon but with a speaking-trumpet in he mouth wrap up in a caul as in a main-sail -- for a charmed life against shipwreck he bear -- and cry _ luff luff you may -- steady -- port world ho -- here i be _ mad jack be in he saddle on the sea _ that _ be he home he would not care much if another flood come and overflow the dry land for what would it do but float he good ship higher and higher and carry he proud nation 's flag round the globe over the very capital of all hostile state then would mast surmount spire and all mankind like the chinese boatman in canton river live in flotilla and fleet and find they food in the sea mad jack be expressly create and label for a tar five foot nine be he mark in he sock and not weigh over eleven stone before dinner like so many ship 's shroud he muscle and tendon be all set true trim and taut he be brace up fore and aft like a ship on the wind he broad chest be a bulkhead that dam off the gale and he nose be a aquiline that divide it in two like a keel he loud lusty lung be two belfry full of all manner of chime but you only hear he deepest bray in the height of some tempest -- like the great bell of st paul 's which only sound when the king or the devil be dead look at he there where he stand on the poop -- one foot on the rail and one hand on a shroud -- he head throw back and he trumpet like a elephant 's trunk throw up in the air be he go to shoot dead with sound those fellow on the main-topsail-yard mad jack be a bit of a tyrant -- they _ say _ all good officer be -- but the sailor love he all round and would much rather stand fifty watch with he than one with a rose-water sailor but mad jack alas have one fearful fail he drink and so do we all but mad jack _ he _ only brink brandy the vice be inveterate surely like ferdinand count fathom he must have be suckle at a puncheon very often this have habit get he into very serious scrape twice be he put off duty by the commodore and once he come near be break for he frolic so far as he efficiency as a sea-officer be concern on shore at least jack might _ bouse away _ as much as he please but afloat it will not do at all now if he only follow the wise example set by those ship of the desert the camel and while in port drink for the thirst past the thirst present and the thirst to come -- so that he might cross the ocean sober mad jack would get along pretty well still better if he would but eschew brandy altogether and only drink of the limpid white-wine of the rill and the brook chapter ix of the pocket that be in the jacket i must make some further mention of that white jacket of mine and here be it know -- by way of introduction to what be to follow -- that to a common sailor the living on board a man-of-war be like live in a market where you dress on the door-step and sleep in the cellar no privacy can you have hardly one moment 's seclusion it be almost a physical impossibility that you can ever be alone you dine at a vast _ table d'hote _ sleep in common and make you toilet where and when you can there be no call for a mutton chop and a pint of claret by yourself no selecting of chamber for the night no hanging of pantaloons over the back of a chair no ring you bell of a rainy morning to take you coffee in bed it be something like life in a large manufactory the bell strike to dinner and hungry or not you must dine you clothes be stow in a large canvas bag generally paint black which you can get out of the rack only once in the twenty-four hour and then during a time of the utmost confusion among five hundred other bag with five hundred other sailor diving into each in the midst of the twilight of the berth-deck in some measure to obviate this inconvenience many sailor divide they wardrobe between they hammock and they bag stow a few frock and trowser in the former so that they can shift at night if they wish when the hammock be pipe down but they gain very little by this you have no place whatever but you bag or hammock in which to put anything in a man-of-war if you lay anything down and turn you back for a moment ten to one it be go now in sketch the preliminary plan and lay out the foundation of that memorable white jacket of mine i have have a earnest eye to all these inconvenience and re-solved to avoid they i propose that not only should my jacket keep I warm but that it should also be so construct as to contain a shirt or two a pair of trowser and diver knick-knack -- sew utensil book biscuit and the like with this object i have accordingly provide it with a great variety of pocket pantry clothes-press and cupboard the principal apartment two in number be place in the skirt with a wide hospitable entrance from the inside two more of smaller capacity be plant in each breast with folding-door communicate so that in case of emergency to accommodate any bulky article the two pocket in each breast could be throw into one there be also several unseen recess behind the arras insomuch that my jacket like a old castle be full of wind stair and mysterious closet crypt and cabinet and like a confidential writing-desk abound in snug little out-of-the-way lair and hiding-place for the storage of valuable superad to these be four capacious pocket on the outside one pair to slip book into when suddenly startle from my study to the main-royal-yard and the other pair for permanent mitten to thrust my hand into of a cold night-watch this last contrivance be regard as needless by one of my top-mate who show I a pattern for sea-mitten which he say be much better than mine it must be know that sailor even in the bleakest weather only cover they hand when unemployed they never wear mitten aloft since aloft they literally carry they life in they hand and want nothing between they grasp of the hemp and the hemp itself -- therefore it be desirable that whatever thing they cover they hand with should be capable of be slip on and off in a moment nay it be desirable that they should be of such a nature that in a dark night when you be in a great hurry -- say go to the helm -- they may be jump into indiscriminately and not be like a pair of right-and-left kid neither of which will admit any hand but the particular one mean for it my top-mate 's contrivance be this -- he ought to have get out a patent for it -- each of he mitten be provide with two thumb one on each side the convenience of which need no comment but though for clumsy seaman whose finger be all thumb this description of mitten might do very well white-jacket do not so much fancy it for when you hand be once in the bag of the mitten the empty thumb-hole sometimes dangle at you palm confound you idea of where you real thumb might be or else be carefully grasp in the hand be continually suggest the insane notion that you be all the while have hold of some one else 's thumb no i tell my good top-mate to go away with he four thumb i would have nothing to do with they two thumb be enough for any man for some time after complete my jacket and get the furniture and household store in it i think that nothing could exceed it for convenience seldom now do i have occasion to go to my bag and be jostle by the crowd who be make they wardrobe in a heap if i want anything in the way of clothing thread needle or literature the chance be that my invaluable jacket contain it yes : i fairly hug myself and revel in my jacket till alas a long rain put I out of conceit of it i and all my pocket and they contents be soak through and through and my pocket-edition of shakespeare be reduce to a omelet however avail myself of a fine sunny day that follow i empty myself out in the main-top and spread all my goods and chattel to dry but spite of the bright sun that day prove a black one the scoundrel on deck detect I in the act of discharge my saturated cargo they now know that the white jacket be use for a storehouse the consequence be that my goods be well dry and again store away in my pocket the very next night when it be my quarter-watch on deck and not in the top -lrb- where they be all honest man -rrb- i notice a parcel of fellow skulk about after I wherever i go to a man they be pickpocket and bent upon pillage I in vain i keep clap my pocket like a nervous old gentleman in a crowd that same night i find myself minus several valuable article so in the end i masoned up my locker and pantry and save the two use for mitten the white jacket ever after be pocketless chapter x from pocket to pickpocket as the latter part of the precede chapter may seem strange to those landsman who have be habituate to indulge in high-raised romantic notion of the man-of-war 's man 's character it may not be amiss to set down here certain fact on this head which may serve to place the thing in its true light from the wild life they lead and various other cause -lrb- needless to mention -rrb- sailor as a class entertain the most liberal notion concern morality and the decalogue or rather they take they own view of such matter care little for the theological or ethical definition of other concern what may be criminal or wrong they idea be much sway by circumstance they will covertly abstract a thing from one whom they dislike and insist upon it that in such a case stealing be not rob or where the theft involve something funny as in the case of the white jacket they only steal for the sake of the joke but this much be to be observe nevertheless i e that they never spoil the joke by return the steal article it be a good joke for instance and one often perpetrate on board ship to stand talk to a man in a dark night watch and all the while be cut the button from he coat but once off those button never grow on again there be no spontaneous vegetation in button perhaps it be a thing unavoidable but the truth be that among the crew of a man-of-war score of desperado be too often find who stop not at the largest enormity a species of highway robbery be not unknown to they a _ gang _ will be inform that such a fellow have three or four gold piece in the money-bag so-called or purse which many tar wear round they neck tuck out of sight upon this they deliberately lay they plan and in due time proceed to carry they into execution the man they have mark be perhaps stroll along the benighted berth-deck to he mess-chest when of a sudden the foot-pad dash out from they hiding-place throw he down and while two or three gag he and hold he fast another cut the bag from he neck and make away with it follow by he comrade this be more than once do in the neversink at other time hear that a sailor have something valuable secrete in he hammock they will rip it open from underneath while he sleep and reduce the conjecture to a certainty to enumerate all the minor pilfering on board a man-of-war would be endless with some highly commendable exception they rob from one another and rob back again till in the matter of small thing a community of goods seem almost establish and at last as a whole they become relatively honest by nearly every man become the reverse it be in vain that the officer by threat of condign punishment endeavor to instil more virtuous principle into they crew so thick be the mob that not one thief in a thousand be detect chapter xi the pursuit of poetry under difficulty the feeling of insecurity concern one 's possession in the neversink which the thing just narrate begat in the mind of honest man be curiously exemplify in the case of my poor friend lemsford a gentlemanly young member of the after-guard i have very early make the acquaintance of lemsford it be curious how unerringly a man pitch upon a spirit any way akin to he own even in the most miscellaneous mob lemsford be a poet so thoroughly inspire with the divine afflatus that not even all the tar and tumult of a man-of-war could drive it out of he as may readily be imagine the business of write verse be a very different thing on the gun-deck of a frigate from what the gentle and sequestered wordsworth find it at placid rydal mount in westmoreland in a frigate you can not sit down and meander off you sonnet when the full heart prompt but only when more important duty permit : such as brace round the yard or reef top-sail fore and aft nevertheless every fragment of time at he command be religiously devote by lemsford to the nine at the most unseasonable hour you would behold he seat apart in some corner among the gun -- a shot-box before he pen in hand and eye _ in a fine frenzy roll _ what be that ` ere bear nat ` ral about -- he be get a fit haus not he be exclamation often make by the less learn of he shipmate some deem he a conjurer other a lunatic and the know one say that he must be a crazy methodist but well know by experience the truth of the say that _ poetry be its own exceed great reward _ lemsford write on dash off whole epic sonnet ballad and acrostic with a facility which under the circumstance amaze I often he read over he effusion to I and well worth the hearing they be he have wit imagination feeling and humor in abundance and out of the very ridicule with which some person regard he he make rare metrical sport which we two together enjoy by ourselves or share with certain select friend still the taunt and jeer so often level at my friend the poet would now and then rouse he into rage and at such time the haughty scorn he would hurl on he foe be proof positive of he possession of that one attribute irritability almost universally ascribe to the votary of parnassus and the nine my noble captain jack chase rather patronise lemsford and he would stoutly take he part against score of adversary frequently invite he up aloft into he top he would beg he to recite some of he verse to which he would pay the most heedful attention like maecena listen to virgil with a book of aeneid in he hand take the liberty of a well-wisher he would sometimes gently criticise the piece suggest a few immaterial alteration and upon my word noble jack with he native-born good sense taste and humanity be not ill qualify to play the true part of a _ quarterly review _ -- which be to give quarter at last however severe the critique now lemsford 's great care anxiety and endless source of tribulation be the preservation of he manuscript he have a little box about the size of a small dressing-case and secure with a lock in which he keep he papers and stationery this box of course he could not keep in he bag or hammock for in either case he would only be able to get at it once in the twenty-four hour it be necessary to have it accessible at all time so when not use it he be oblige to hide it out of sight where he could and of all place in the world a ship of war above she _ hold _ least abound in secret nook almost every inch be occupy almost every inch be in plain sight and almost every inch be continually be visit and explore add to all this be the deadly hostility of the whole tribe of ship-underling -- master-at-arms ship 's corporal and boatswain 's mate -- both to the poet and he casket they hate he box as if it have be pandora 's cram to the very lid with hurricane and gale they hunt out he hiding-place like pointer and give he no peace night or day still the long twenty-four-pounder on the main-deck offer some promise of a hiding-place to the box and accordingly it be often tuck away behind the carriage among the side tackle its black color blend with the ebon hue of the gun but quoin one of the quarter-gunner have eye like a ferret quoin be a little old man-of-war 's man hardly five foot high with a complexion like a gun-shot wound after it be heal he be indefatigable in attend to he duty which consist in take care of one division of the gun embrace ten of the aforesaid twenty-four-pounder range up against the ship 's side at regular interval they resemble not a little a stud of sable charger in they stall among this iron stud little quoin be continually run in and out curry they down now and then with a old rag or keep the fly off with a brush to quoin the honor and dignity of the united state of america seem indissolubly link with the keep he gun unspotted and glossy he himself be black as a chimney-sweep with continually tend they and rub they down with black paint he would sometimes get outside of the port-hole and peer into they muzzle as a monkey into a bottle or like a dentist he seem intent upon examine they tooth quite as often he would be brushing out they touch-hole with a little wisp of oakum like a chinese barber in canton clean a patient 's ear such be he solicitude that it be a thousand pity he be not able to dwarf himself still more so as to creep in at the touch-hole and examine the whole interior of the tube emerge at last from the muzzle quoin swear by he gun and sleep by they side woe betide the man whom he find lean against they or in any way soil they he seem seize with the crazy fancy that he darling twenty-four-pounder be fragile and might break like glass retort now from this quoin 's vigilance how could my poor friend the poet hope to escape with he box twenty time a week it be pounce upon with a here be that d -- d pillbox again and a loud threat to pitch it overboard the next time without a moment 's warning or benefit of clergy like many poet lemsford be nervous and upon these occasion he tremble like a leaf once with a inconsolable countenance he come to I say that he casket be nowhere to be find he have seek for it in he hiding-place and it be not there i ask he where he have hide it among the gun he reply then depend upon it lemsford that quoin have be the death of it straight to quoin go the poet but quoin know nothing about it for ten mortal day the poet be not to be comfort divide he leisure time between cursing quoin and lament he loss the world be undo he must have think : no such calamity have befall it since the deluge -- my verse be perish but though quoin as it afterward turn out have indeed find the box it so happen that he have not destroy it which no doubt lead lemsford to infer that a superintend providence have interpose to preserve to posterity he invaluable casket it be find at last lie expose near the galley lemsford be not the only literary man on board the neversink there be three or four person who keep journal of the cruise one of these journalist embellish he work -- which be write in a large blank account-book -- with various color illustration of the harbor and bay at which the frigate have touch and also with small crayon sketch of comical incident on board the frigate itself he would frequently read passage of he book to a admiring circle of the more refined sailor between the gun they pronounce the whole performance a miracle of art as the author declare to they that it be all to be print and publish so soon as the vessel reach home they vie with each other in procure interesting item to be incorporate into additional chapter but it have be rumor abroad that this journal be to be ominously entitle _ the cruise of the neversink or a paixhan shot into naval abuse _ and it have also reach the ear of the ward-room that the work contain reflection somewhat derogatory to the dignity of the officer the volume be seize by the master-at-arms arm with a warrant from the captain a few day after a large nail be drive straight through the two cover and clinch on the other side and thus everlastingly seal the book be commit to the deep the ground take by the authority on this occasion be perhaps that the book be obnoxious to a certain clause in the article of war forbid any person in the navy to bring any other person in the navy into contempt which the suppress volume undoubtedly do chapter xii the good or bad temper of man-of-war 's man in a great degree attributable to they particular station and duty aboard ship quoin the quarter-gunner be the representative of a class on board the neversink altogether too remarkable to be leave astern without further notice in the rapid wake of these chapter as have be see quoin be full of unaccountable whimsy he be withal a very cross bitter ill-natured inflammable old man so too be all the member of the gunner 's gang include the two gunner 's mate and all the quarter-gunner every one of they have the same dark brown complexion all they face look like smoked ham they be continually grumble and growl about the battery run in and out among the gun drive the sailor away from they and cursing and swearing as if all they conscience have be powder-singed and make callous by they call indeed they be a most unpleasant set of man especially prime the nasal-voiced gunner 's mate with the hare-lip and cylinder he stuttering coadjutor with the club foot but you will always observe that the gunner 's gang of every man-of-war be invariably ill-tempered ugly featured and quarrelsome once when i visit a english line-of-battle ship the gunner 's gang be fore and aft polish up the battery which accord to the admiral 's fancy have be paint white as snow fidget round the great thirty-two-pounder and make stinging remark at the sailor and each other they remind one of a swarm of black wasp buzz about row of white headstone in a church-yard now there can be little doubt that they be so much among the gun be the very thing that make a gunner 's gang so cross and quarrelsome indeed this be once prove to the satisfaction of we whole company of main-top-men a fine top-mate of ours a most merry and companionable fellow chance to be promote to a quarter-gunner 's berth a few day afterward some of we main-top-men he old comrade go to pay he a visit while he be go he regular round through the division of gun allot to he care but instead of greet we with he usual heartiness and crack he pleasant joke to we amazement he do little else but scowl and at last when we rally he upon he ill-temper he seize a long black rammer from overhead and drive we on deck threaten to report we if we ever dare to be familiar with he again my top-mate think that this remarkable metamorphose be the effect produce upon a weak vain character suddenly elevate from the level of a mere seaman to the dignified position of a _ petty officer _ but though in similar case i have see such effect produce upon some of the crew yet in the present instance i know better than that -- it be solely bring about by he consort with with those villainous irritable ill-tempered cannon more especially from he be subject to the order of those deform blunderbuss priming and cylinder the truth seem to be indeed that all people should be very careful in select they calling and vocation very careful in see to it that they surround themselves by good-humoured pleasant-looking object and agreeable temper-soothing sound many a angelic disposition have have its even edge turn and hack like a saw and many a sweet draught of piety have sour on the heart from people 's choose ill-natured employment and omit to gather round they good-natured landscape gardener be almost always pleasant affable people to con-verse with but beware of quarter-gunner keeper of arsenal and lonely light-house man it would be advisable for any man who from a unlucky choice of a profession which it be too late to change for another should find he temper souring to endeavor to counteract that misfortune by fill he private chamber with amiable pleasurable sight and sound in summer time a aeolian harp can be place in you window at a very trifling expense a conch-shell might stand on you mantel to be take up and hold to the ear that you may be soothe by its continual lulling sound when you feel the blue fit steal over you for sight a gay-painted punch-bowl or dutch tankard -- never mind about fill it -- might be recommend it should be place on a bracket in the pier nor be a old-fashioned silver ladle nor a chase dinner-castor nor a fine portly demijohn nor anything indeed that savor of eating and drinking bad to drive off the spleen but perhaps the best of all be a shelf of merrily-bound book contain comedy farce song and humorous novel you need never open they only have the title in plain sight for this purpose peregrine pickle be a good book so be gil bla so be goldsmith but of all chamber furniture in the world best calculate to cure a have temper and breed a pleasant one be the sight of a lovely wife if you have child however that be teethe the nursery should be a good way up stair at sea it ought to be in the mizzen-top indeed teething child play the very deuce with a husband 's temper i have know three promising young husband completely spoil on they wife ' hand by reason of a teething child whose worrisomeness happen to be aggravate at the time by the summer-complaint with a breaking heart and my handkerchief to my eye i follow those three hapless young husband one after the other to they premature grave gossip scene breed gossip who so chatty as hotel-clerks market woman auctioneer bar-keeper apothecary newspaper-reporter monthly-nurse and all those who live in bustling crowd or be present at scene of chatty interest solitude breed taciturnity _ that _ every body know who so taciturn as author take as a race a forced interior quietude in the midst of great out-ward commotion breed moody people who so moody as railroad-brakemen steam-boat-engineer helmsman and tender of power-loom in cotton factory for all these must hold they peace while employ and let the machinery do the chat they can not even edge in a single syllable now this theory about the wondrous influence of habitual sight and sound upon the human temper be suggest by my experience on board we frigate and al-though i regard the example furnish by we quarter-gunner -- especially he who have once be we top-mate -- as by far the strongest argument in favor of the general theory yet the entire ship abound with illustration of its truth who be more liberal-hearted lofty-minded gayer more jocund elastic adventurous give to fun and frolic than the top-man of the fore main and mizzen mast the reason of they liberal-heartedness be that they be daily call upon to expatiate themselves all over the rig the reason of they lofty-mindedness be that they be high lift above the petty tumult carp care and paltriness of the deck below and i feel persuade in my inmost soul that it be to the fact of my have be a main-top-man and especially my particular post be on the loftiest yard of the frigate the main-royal-yard that i be now enable to give such a free broad off-hand bird 's - eye and more than all impartial account of we man-of-war world withhold nothing invent nothing nor flattering nor scandalise any but mete out to all -- commodore and messenger-boy alike -- they precise description and desert the reason of the mirthfulness of these top-man be that they always look out upon the blue boundless dimpled laughing sunny sea nor do i hold that it militate against this theory that of a stormy day when the face of the ocean be black and overcast that some of they would grow moody and choose to sit apart on the contrary it only prove the thing which i maintain for even on shore there be many people naturally gay and light-hearted who whenever the autumnal wind begin to bluster round the corner and roar along the chimney-stack straight become cross petulant and irritable what be more mellow than fine old ale yet thunder will sour the best nut-brown ever brew the _ holder _ of we frigate the troglodyte who live down in the tarry cellar and cave below the berth-deck be nearly all of they man of gloomy disposition take sour view of thing one of they be a blue-light calvinist whereas the old-sheet-anchor-man who spend they time in the brace sea-air and broad-cast sunshine of the forecastle be free generous-hearted charitable and full of good-will to all hand though some of they to tell the truth prove sad exception but exception only prove the rule the steady-cook on the berth-deck the steady-sweeper and steady-spit-box-musterer in all division of the frigate fore and aft be a narrow-minded set with contract soul imputable no doubt to they grovel duty more especially be this evince in the case of those odious ditcher and night scavenger the ignoble waister the member of the band some ten or twelve in number who have nothing to do but keep they instrument polish and play a lively air now and then to stir the stagnant current in we poor old commodore 's torpid vein be the most gleeful set of fellow you ever see they be portuguese who have be ship at the cape de verd island on the passage out they mess by themselves form a dinner-party not to be exceed ire mirthfulness by a club of young bridegroom three month after marriage completely satisfy with they bargain after test they but what make they now so full of fun what indeed but they merry martial mellow calling who could he a churl and play a flageolet who mean and spiritless bray forth the soul of thousand hero from he brazen trump but still more efficacious perhaps in minister to the light spirit of the band be the console thought that should the ship ever go into action they would be exempt from the peril of battle in ship of war the member of the music as the band be call be generally non-combatant and mostly ship with the express understanding that as soon as the vessel come within long gun-shot of a enemy they shall have the privilege of burrow down in the cable-tier or sea coal-hole which show that they be inglorious but uncommonly sensible fellow look at the baron of the gun-room -- lieutenant purser marine officer sailing-master -- all of they gentleman with stiff upper lip and aristocratic cut nose why be this will any one deny that from they living so long in high military life serve by a crowd of menial steward and cot-boy and always accustom to command right and leave will any one deny i say that by reason of this they very nose have become thin peaked aquiline and aristocratically cartilaginous even old cuticle the surgeon have a roman nose but i never could account how it come to be that we gray head first lieutenant be a little lop-sided that be one of he shoulder disproportionately drop and when i observe that nearly all the first lieutenant i saw in other men-of-war besides many second and third lieutenant be similarly lop-sided i know that there must be some general law which induce the phenomenon and i put myself to study it out as a interesting problem at last i come to the conclusion -- to which i still adhere -- that they so long wear only one epaulet -lrb- for to only one do they rank entitle they -rrb- be the infallible clew to this mystery and when any one reflect upon so well-known a fact that many sea lieutenant grow decrepit from age without attain a captaincy and wear _ two _ epaulet which would strike the balance between they shoulder the above reason assign will not appear unwarrantable chapter xiii a man-of-war hermit in a mob the allusion to the poet lemsford in a previous chapter lead I to speak of we mutual friend nord and william who with lemsford himself jack chase and my comrade of the main-top comprise almost the only person with whom i unreservedly consort while on board the frigate for i have not be long on board ere i find that it would not do to be intimate with everybody a indiscriminate intimacy with all hand lead to sundry annoyance and scrape too often end with a dozen at the gang-way though i be above a year in the frigate there be score of man who to the last remain perfect stranger to I whose very name i do not know and whom i would hardly be able to recognize now should i happen to meet they in the street in the dog-watch at sea during the early part of the evening the main-deck be generally fill with crowd of pedestrian promenade up and down past the gun like people take the air in broadway at such time it be curious to see the man nod to each other 's recognition -lrb- they might not have see each other for a week -rrb- exchange a pleasant word with a friend make a hurry appointment to meet he somewhere aloft on the morrow or pass group after group without deign the slightest salutation indeed i be not at all singular in have but comparatively few acquaintance on board though certainly carry my fastidiousness to a unusual extent my friend nord be a somewhat remarkable character and if mystery include romance he certainly be a very romantic one before seek a introduction to he through lemsford i have often marked he tall spare upright figure stalk like don quixote among the pigmy of the afterguard to which he belong at first i find he exceedingly reserve and taciturn he saturnine brow wear a scowl he be almost repel in he demeanor in a word he seem desirous of hint that he list of man-of war friend be already make up complete and full and there be no room for more but observe that the only man he ever consort with be lemsford i have too much magnanimity by go off in a pique at he coldness to let he lose forever the chance of make so capital a acquaintance as myself besides i see it in he eye that the man have be a reader of good book i would have stake my life on it that he seize the right meaning of montaigne i see that he be a earnest thinker i more than suspect that he have be bolt in the mill of adversity for all these thing my heart yearn toward he i determine to know he at last i succeed it be during a profoundly quiet midnight watch when i perceive he walk alone in the waist while most of the man be doze on the carronade-slide that night we scour all the prairie of read dive into the bosom of author and tear out they heart and that night white-jacket learn more than he have ever do in any single night since the man be a marvel he amaze I as much as coleridge do the trooper among whom he enlist what could have induce such a man to enter a man-of-war all my sapience can not fathom and how he manage to preserve he dignity as he do among such a rabble rout be equally a mystery for he be no sailor as ignorant of a ship indeed as a man from the source of the niger yet the officer respect he and the man be afraid of he this much be observable however that he faithfully discharge whatever special duty devolve upon he and be so fortunate as never to render himself liable to a reprimand doubtless he take the same view of the thing that another of the crew do and have early resolve so to conduct himself as never to run the risk of the scourge and this it must have be -- add to whatever incommunicable grief which might have be he -- that make this nord such a wander recluse even among we man-of-war mob nor could he have long swing he hammock on board ere he must have find that to insure he exemption from that thing which alone affright he he must be content for the most part to turn a man-hater and socially expatriate himself from many thing which might have render he situation more tolerable still more several event that take place must have horrify he at time with the thought that however he might isolate and entomb himself yet for all this the improbability of he be overtake by what he most dreaded never advance to the infallibility of the impossible in my intercourse with nord he never make allusion to he past career -- a subject upon which most high-bred castaway in a man-of-war be very diffuse relate they adventure at the gaming-table the recklessness with which they have run through the amplest fortune in a single season they alms-giving and gratuity to porter and poor relation and above all they youthful indiscretion and the broken-hearted lady they have leave behind no such tale have nord to tell concern the past he be bar and lock up like the specie vault of the bank of england for anything that drop from he none of we could be sure that he have ever exist till now altogether he be a remarkable man my other friend william be a thorough-going yankee from maine who have be both a peddler and a pedagogue in he day he have all manner of story to tell about nice little country frolic and would run over a endless list of he sweetheart he be honest acute witty full of mirth and good humor -- a laugh philosopher he be invaluable as a pill against the spleen and with the view of extend the advantage of he society to the saturnine nord i introduce they to each other but nord cut he dead the very same evening when we sally out from between the gun for a walk on the main-deck chapter xiv a draught in a man-of-war we be not many day out of port when a rumor be set afloat that dreadfully alarm many tar it be this : that owe to some unprecedented oversight in the purser or some equally unprecedented remissness in the naval-storekeeper at callao the frigate 's supply of that delectable beverage call grog be well-nigh expend in the american navy the law allow one gill of spirit per day to every seaman in two portion it be serve out just previous to breakfast and dinner at the roll of the drum the sailor assemble round a large tub or cask fill with liquid and as they name be call off by a midshipman they step up and regale themselves from a little tin measure call a tot no high-liver help himself to tokay off a well-polished sideboard smack he lip with more mighty satisfaction than the sailor do over this _ tot _ to many of they indeed the thought of they daily _ tot _ form a perpetual perspective of ravishing landscape indefinitely recede in the distance it be they great prospect in life take away they grog and life possess no further charm for they it be hardly to be doubt that the control inducement which keep many man in the navy be the unbounded confidence they have in the ability of the united state government to supply they regularly and unfailingly with they daily allowance of this beverage i have know several forlorn individual ship as landsman who have confess to I that have contract a love for ardent spirit which they could not renounce and have by they foolish course be bring into the most abject poverty -- insomuch that they could no longer gratify they thirst ashore -- they incontinently enter the navy regard it as the asylum for all drunkard who might there prolong they life by regular hour and exercise and twice every day quench they thirst by moderate and undeviating dose when i once remonstrate with a old toper of a top-man about this daily dram-drinking when i tell he it be ruin he and advise he to _ stop he grog _ and receive the money for it in addition to he wages as provide by law he turn about on I with a irresistibly waggish look and say give up my grog and why because it be ruin I no no i be a good christian white-jacket and love my enemy too much to drop he acquaintance it may be readily imagine therefore what consternation and dismay pervade the gun-deck at the first announcement of the tiding that the grog be expend the grog go roar a old sheet-anchor-man oh lord what a pain in my stomach cry a main-top-man it be worse than the cholera cry a man of the after-guard i would sooner the water-cask would give out say a captain of the hold be we gander and goose that we can live without grog ask a corporal of marine ay we must now drink with the duck cry a quarter-master not a tot leave groan a waister not a toothful sigh a holder from the bottom of he boot yes the fatal intelligence prove true the drum be no longer hear roll the man to the tub and deep gloom and dejection fall like a cloud the ship be like a great city when some terrible calamity have overtake it the man stand apart in group discuss they woe and mutually condoling no longer of still moonlight night be the song hear from the giddy top and few and far between be the story that be tell it be during this interval so dismal to many that to the amazement of all hand ten man be report by the master-at-arms to be intoxicate they be bring up to the mast and at they appearance the doubt of the most skeptical be dissipate but whence they have obtain they liquor no one could tell it be observe however at the time that the tarry knave all smell of lavender like so many dandy after they examination they be order into the brig a jail-house between two gun on the main-deck where prisoner be keep here they lay for some time stretch out stark and stiff with they arm fold over they breast like so many effigy of the black prince on he monument in canterbury cathedral they first slumber over the marine sentry who stand guard over they have as much as he could do to keep off the crowd who be all eagerness to find out how in such a time of want the prisoner have manage to drink themselves into oblivion in due time they be liberate and the secret simultaneously leak out it seem that a enterprising man of they number who have suffer severely from the common deprivation have all at once be strike by a brilliant idea it have come to he knowledge that the purser 's steward be supply with a large quantity of _ eau-de-cologne _ clandestinely bring out in the ship for the purpose of sell it on he own account to the people of the coast but the supply prove larger than the demand and have no customer on board the frigate but lieutenant selvagee he be now carry home more than a third of he original stock to make a short story of it this functionary be call upon in secret be readily prevail upon to part with a dozen bottle with whose contents the intoxicated party have regale themselves the news spread far and wide among the man be only keep secret from the officer and underling and that night the long crane-necked cologne bottle jingle in out-of-the-way corner and by-place and be empty be send fly out of the port with brown sugar take from the mess-chest and hot water beg from the galley-cook the man make all manner of punch toddy and cocktail let fall therein a small drop of tar like a bit of brown toast by way of impart a flavor of course the thing be manage with the utmost secrecy and as a whole dark night elapse after they orgy the reveller be in a good measure secure from detection and those who indulge too freely have twelve long hour to get sober before daylight obtrude next day fore and aft the whole frigate smell like a lady 's toilet the very tar-buckets be fragrant and from the mouth of many a grim grizzled old quarter-gunner come the most fragrant of breath the amaze lieutenant go about snuff up the gale and for once selvagee have no further need to flourish he perfumed hand-kerchief it be as if we be sail by some odoriferous shore in the vernal season of violet sabaean odour for many a league cheer with grateful smell old ocean smile but alas all this perfume could not be waste for nothing and the master-at-arms and ship 's corporal put this and that together very soon burrow into the secret the purser 's steward be call to account and no more lavender punch and cologne toddy be drink on board the neversink chapter xv a salt-junk club in a man-of-war with a notice to quit it be about the period of the cologne-water excitement that my self-conceit be not a little wounded and my sense of delicacy altogether shock by a polite hint receive from the cook of the mess to which i happen to belong to understand the matter it be needful to enter into preliminary the common seaman in a large frigate be divide into some thirty or forty mess put down on the purser 's book as _ mess _ no 1 _ mess _ no 2 _ mess _ no 3 etc the member of each mess club they ration of provision and breakfast dine and sup together in allotted interval between the gun on the main-deck in undeviating rotation the member of each mess -lrb- except the petty-officer -rrb- take they turn in perform the function of cook and steward and for the time be all the affair of the club be subject to they inspection and control it be the cook 's business also to have a eye to the general interest of he mess to see that when the aggregated allowance of beef bread etc be serve out by one of the master 's mate the mess over which he preside receive its full share without stint or subtraction upon the berth-deck he have a chest in which to keep he pot pan spoon and small store of sugar molasses tea and flour but though entitle a cook strictly speak the head of the mess be no cook at all for the cooking for the crew be all do by a high and mighty functionary officially call the _ ship 's cook _ assist by several deputy in we frigate this personage be a dignified color gentleman whom the man dub _ old coffee _ and he assistant negro also go by the poetical appellation of _ sunshine _ _ rose-water _ and _ may-day _ now the _ ship 's cooking _ require very little science though old coffee often assure we that he have graduate at the new york astor house under the immediate eye of the celebrated coleman and stetson all he have to do be in the first place to keep bright and clean the three huge copper or caldron in which many hundred pound of beef be daily boil to this end rose-water sunshine and may-day every morning spring into they respective apartment strip to the waist and well provide with bit of soap-stone and sand by exercise these in a very vigorous manner they throw themselves into a violent perspiration and put a fine polish upon the interior of the copper sunshine be the bard of the trio and while all three would be busily employ clatter they soap-stone against the metal he would exhilarate they with some remarkable st domingo melody one of which be the following : oh i los ' my shoe in a old canoe johnio come winum so oh i los ' my boot in a pilot-boat johnio come winum so den rub-a-dub de copper oh oh copper rub-a-dub-a-oh when i listen to these jolly african thus make gleeful they toil by they cheer song i could not help murmur against that immemorial rule of men-of-war which forbid the sailor to sing out as in merchant-vessel when pull rope or occupy at any other ship 's duty you only music at such time be the shrill pipe of the boatswain 's mate which be almost worse than no music at all and if the boatswain 's mate be not by you must pull the rope like convict in profound silence or else endeavor to impart unity to the exertion of all hand by singing out mechanically _ one _ _ two _ _ three _ and then pull all together now when sunshine rose-water and may-day have so polish the ship 's copper that a white kid glove might be draw along the inside and show no stain they leap out of they hole and the water be pour in for the coffee and the coffee be boil and decant off in bucketful the cook of the mess march up with they salt beef for dinner string upon string and tally with label all of which be plunge together into the self-same copper and there boil when upon the beef be fish out with a huge pitch-fork the water for the evening 's tea be pour in which consequently possess a flavor not unlike that of shank-soup from this it will be see that so far as cooking be concern a _ cook of the mess _ have very little to do merely carry he provision to and from the grand democratic cookery still in some thing he office involve many annoyance twice a week butter and cheese be serve out -- so much to each man -- and the mess-cook have the sole charge of these delicacy the great difficulty consist in so cater for the mess touch these luxury as to satisfy all some guzzler be for devour the butter at a meal and finish off with the cheese the same day other contend for save it up against _ banyan day _ when there be nothing but beef and bread and other again be for take a very small bit of butter and cheese by way of dessert to each and every meal through the week all this give rise to endless dispute debate and altercation sometimes with he mess-cloth -- a square of paint canvas -- set out on deck between the gun garnish with pot and pan and _ kid _ you see the mess-cook seat on a matchtub at its head he trowser leg roll up and arm bare preside over the convivial party now man you can not have any butter to-day i be save it up for to-morrow you do not know the value of butter man you jim take you hoof off the cloth devil take I if some of you chap have not no more manners than so many swine quick man quick bear a hand and ' _ scoff _ ' -lrb- eat -rrb- away -- i have get my to-morrow 's _ duff _ to make yet and some of you fellow keep _ scoff _ as if i have nothing to do but sit still here on this here tub here and look on there there man you have all have enough : so sail away out of this and let I clear up the wreck in this strain would one of the periodical cook of mess no 15 talk to we he be a tall resolute fellow who have once be a brakeman on a railroad and he keep we all pretty straight from he fiat there be no appeal but it be not thus when the turn come to other among we then it be _ look out for squall _ the business of dining become a bear and digestion be seriously impaired by the unamiable discourse we have over we _ salt horse _ i sometimes think that the junk of lean pork -- which be boil in they own bristle and look gaunt and grim like pickled chin of half-famished unwashed cossack -- have something to do with create the bristle bitterness at time prevail in we mess the man tear off the tough hide from they pork as if they be indian scalp christian some curse the cook for a rogue who keep from we we butter and cheese in order to make away with it himself in a underhand manner sell it at a premium to other mess and thus accumulate a princely fortune at we expense other anthematise he for he slovenliness cast hypercritical glance into they pot and pan and scrape they with they knife then he would be rail at for he miserable duff and other shortcoming preparation mark all this from the beginning i white-jacket be sorely trouble with the idea that in the course of time my own turn would come round to undergo the same objurgation how to escape i know not however when the dreaded period arrive i receive the key of office -lrb- the key of the mess-chest -rrb- with a resigned temper and offer up a devout ejaculation for fortitude under the trial i resolve please heaven to approve myself a unexceptionable caterer and the most impartial of steward the first day there be _ duff _ to make -- a business which devolve upon the mess-cook though the boil of it pertain to old coffee and he deputy i make up my mind to lay myself out on that _ duff _ to center all my energy upon it to put the very soul of art into it and achieve a unrivalled _ duff _ -- a _ duff _ that should put out of conceit all other _ duff _ and for ever make my administration memorable from the proper functionary the flour be obtain and the raisin the beef-fat or _ slush _ from old coffee and the requisite supply of water from the scuttle-butt i then go among the various cook to compare they receipt for make duff : and have well weigh they all and gather from each a choice item to make a original receipt of my own with due deliberation and solemnity i proceed to business place the component part in a tin pan i knead they together for a hour entirely reckless as to pulmonary consideration touch the ruinous expenditure of breath and have decant the semi-liquid dough into a canvas-bag secure the muzzle tie on the tally and deliver it to rose-water who drop the precious bag into the copper along with a score or two of other eight bell have strike the boatswain and he mate have pipe the hand to dinner my mess-cloth be set out and my messmate be assemble knife in hand all ready to precipitate themselves upon the devoted _ duff _ : wait at the grand cookery till my turn come i receive the bag of pudding and gallant it into the mess proceed to loosen the string it be a anxious i may say a fearful moment my hand tremble every eye be upon I my reputation and credit be at stake slowly i undress the _ duff _ dandle it upon my knee much as a nurse do a baby about bed-time the excitement increase as i curl down the bag from the pudding it become intense when at last i plumped it into the pan hold up to receive it by a eager hand bim it fall like a man shoot down in a riot distraction it be harder than a sinner 's heart yea tough as the cock that crow on the morn that peter tell a lie gentleman of the mess for heaven 's sake permit I one word i have do my duty by that duff -- i have -- but they beat down my excuse with a storm of crimination one present propose that the fatal pudding should be tie round my neck like a mill-stone and myself push overboard no use no use i have fail ever after that duff lay heavy at my stomach and my heart after this i grow desperate despise popularity return scorn for scorn till at length my week expire and in the duff-bag i transfer the key of office to the next man on the roll somehow there have never be a very cordial feeling between this mess and I all along they have nourish a prejudice against my white jacket they must have harbor the silly fancy that in it i give myself air and wear it in order to look consequential perhaps as a cloak to cover pilfering of tit-bit from the mess but to out with the plain truth they themselves be not a very irreproachable set consider the sequel i be come to this avowal may be deem sheer malice but for all that i can not avoid speak my mind after my week of office the mess gradually change they behavior to I they cut I to the heart they become cold and reserved seldom or never address I at meal-time without invidious allusion to my _ duff _ and also to my jacket and its drip in wet weather upon the mess-cloth however i have no idea that anything serious on they part be brewing but alas so it turn out we be assemble at supper one evening when i notice certain wink and silent hint tip to the cook who preside he be a little oily fellow who have once keep a oyster-cellar ashore he bear I a grudge look down on the mess-cloth he observe that some fellow never know when they room be better than they company this be a maxim of indiscriminate application of course i silently assent to it as any other reasonable man would have do but this remark be follow up by another to the effect that not only do some fellow never know when they room be better than they company but they persist in stay when they company be not want and by so do disturbed the serenity of society at large but this also be a general observation that could not be gainsay a long and ominous pause ensue during which i perceive every eye upon I and my white jacket while the cook go on to enlarge upon the disagreeableness of a perpetually damp garment in the mess especially when that garment be white this be come nearer home yes they be go to black-ball I but i resolve to sit it out a little longer never dream that my moralist would proceed to extremity while all hand be present but bethink he that by go this roundabout way he would never get at he object he go off on another tack apprise I in substance that he be instruct by the whole mess then and there assemble to give I warn to seek out another club as they do not longer fancy the society either of myself or my jacket i be shock such a want of tact and delicacy common propriety suggest that a point-blank intimation of that nature should be convey in a private interview or still better by note i immediately rise tuck my jacket about I bow and depart and now to do myself justice i must add that the next day i be receive with open arm by a glorious set of fellow -- mess no 1 -- numbering among the rest my noble captain jack chase this mess be principally compose of the headmost man of the gun-deck and out of a pardonable self-conceit they call themselves the _ forty-two-pounder club _ meaning that they be one and all fellow of large intellectual and corporeal calibre they mess-cloth be well located on they starboard hand be mess no 2 embrace sundry rare joker and high liver who wax gay and epicurean over they salt fare and be know as the _ society for the destruction of beef and pork _ on the larboard hand be mess no 31 make up entirely of fore-top-man a dash blaze-away set of man-of-war 's - man who call themselves the _ cape horn snorter and neversink invincible _ opposite be one of the marine mess muster the aristocracy of the marine corps -- the two corporal the drummer and fifer and some six or eight rather gentlemanly private native-born american who have serve in the seminole campaign of florida and they now enliven they salt fare with story of wild ambush in the everglade and one of they relate a surprising tale of he hand-to-hand encounter with osceolum the indian chief whom he fight one morning from daybreak till breakfast time this slash private also boast that he could take a chip from between you tooth at twenty pace he offer to bet any amount on it and as he could get no one to hold the chip he boast remain for ever good besides many other attraction which the _ forty-two-pounder club _ furnish it have this one special advantage that owe to there be so many _ petty officer _ in it all the member of the mess be exempt from do duty as cook and steward a fellow call _ a steady-cook _ attend to that business during the entire cruise he be a long lank pallid varlet go by the name of shank in very warm weather this shank would sit at the foot of the mess-cloth fanning himself with the front flap of he frock or shirt which he inelegantly wear over he trousers jack chase the president of the club frequently remonstrate against this breach of good manners but the _ steady-cook _ have somehow contract the habit and it prove incurable for a time jack chase out of a polite nervousness touch myself as a newly-elected member of the club would frequently endeavor to excuse to I the vulgarity of shank one day he wind up he remark by the philosophic reflection -- but white-jacket my dear fellow what can you expect of he we real misfortune be that we noble club should be oblige to dine with its cook there be several of these _ steady-cook _ on board man of no mark or consideration whatever in the ship lose to all noble prompting sigh for no world to conquer and perfectly contented with mix they _ duff 's _ and spread they mess-cloth and muster they pot and pan together three time every day for a three year ' cruise they be very seldom to be see on the spar-deck but keep below out of sight chapter xvi general training in a man-of-war to a quiet contemplative character averse to uproar undue exercise of he bodily member and all kind of useless confusion nothing can be more distressing than a proceeding in all men-of-war call _ general quarter _ and well may it be so call since it amount to a general drawing and quartering of all the party concern as the specific object for which a man-of-war be build and put into commission be to fight and fire off cannon it be of course deem indispensable that the crew should be duly instruct in the art and mystery involve hence these general quarter which be a mustering of all hand to they station at the gun on the several deck and a sort of sham-fight with a imaginary foe the summons be give by the ship 's drummer who strike a peculiar beat -- short broken rolling shuffling -- like the sound make by the march into battle of iron-heeled grenadier it be a regular tune with a fine song compose to it the word of the chorus be most artistically arrange may give some idea of the air : heart of oak be we ship jolly tar be we man we always be ready steady boy steady to fight and to conquer again and again in warm weather this pastime at the gun be exceedingly unpleasant to say the least and throw a quiet man into a violent passion and perspiration for one i ever abominate it i have a heart like julius caesar and upon occasion would fight like caius marcius coriolanus if my beloved and for ever glorious country should be ever in jeopardy from invader let congress put I on a war-horse in the van-guard and _ then _ see how i will acquit myself but to toil and sweat in a fictitious encounter to squander the precious breath of my precious body in a ridiculous fight of sham and pretension to hurry about the deck pretend to carry the kill and wound below to be tell that i must consider the ship blow up in order to exercise myself in presence of mind and prepare for a real explosion all this i despise as beneath a true tar and man of valor these be my sentiment at the time and these remain my sentiment still but as while on board the frigate my liberty of thought do not extend to liberty of expression i be oblige to keep these sentiment to myself though indeed i have some thought of address a letter marked _ private and confidential _ to he honor the commodore on the subject my station at the battery be at one of the thirty-two-pound carronade on the starboard side of the quarter-deck -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- -lrb- footnote-1 -rrb- for the benefit of a quaker reader here and there a word or two in explanation of a carronade may not be amiss the carronade be a gun comparatively short and light for its calibre a carronade throw a thirty-two-pound shot weigh considerably less than a long-gun only throw a twenty-four-pound shot it further differ from a long-gun in work with a joint and bolt underneath instead of the short arm or _ trunnion _ at the side its _ carriage _ likewise be quite different from that of a long-gun have a sort of slide apparatus something like a extension dining-table the goose on it however be a tough one and villainously stuff with most indigestible dumpling point-blank the range of a carronade do not exceed one hundred and fifty yard much less than the range of a long-gun when of large calibre however it throw within that limit paixhan shoot all manner of shell and combustible with great effect be a very destructive engine at close quarter this piece be now very generally find mount in the battery of the english and american navy the quarter-deck armament of most modern frigate wholly consist of carronade the name be derive from the village of carron in scotland at whose celebrated foundery this iron attilum be first cast -- i do not fancy this station at all for it be well know on shipboard that in time of action the quarter-deck be one of the most dangerous post of a man-of-war the reason be that the officer of the highest rank be there station and the enemy have a ungentlemanly way of target-shooting at they button if we should chance to engage a ship then who could tell but some bungle small-arm marks-man in the enemy 's top might put a bullet through _ I _ instead of the commodore if they hit _ he _ no doubt he would not feel it much for he be use to that sort of thing and indeed have a bullet in he already whereas _ i _ be altogether unaccustomed to have blue pill play round my head in such a indiscriminate way besides ours be a flag-ship and every one know what a peculiarly dangerous predicament the quarter-deck of nelson 's flag-ship be in at the battle of trafalgar how the lofty top of the enemy be full of soldier pepper away at the english admiral and he officer many a poor sailor at the gun of that quarter-deck must have receive a bullet intend for some wearer of a epaulet by candidly confess my feeling on this subject i do by no means invalidate my claim to be hold a man of prodigious valor i merely state my invincible repugnance to be shoot for somebody else if i be shoot be it with the express understanding in the shooter that i be the identical person intend so to be serve that thracian who with he compliment send a arrow into the king of macedon superscribed _ for philip 's right eye _ set a fine example to all warrior the hurry hasty indiscriminate reckless abandon manner in which both sailor and soldier nowadays fight be really painful to any serious-minded methodical old gentleman especially if he chance to have systematize he mind as a accountant there be little or no skill and bravery about it two party arm with lead and old iron envelop themselves in a cloud of smoke and pitch they lead and old iron about in all direction if you happen to be in the way you be hit possibly kill if not you escape in sea-action if by good or bad luck as the case may be a round shot fire at random through the smoke happen to send overboard you fore-mast another to unship you rudder there you lie cripple pretty much at the mercy of you foe : who accordingly pronounce himself victor though that honor properly belong to the law of gravitation operating on the enemy 's ball in the smoke instead of toss this old lead and iron into the air therefore it would be much better amicably to toss up a copper and let head win the carronade at which i be station be know as gun no 5 on the first lieutenant 's quarter-bill among we gun 's crew however it be know as _ black bet _ this name be bestow by the captain of the gun -- a fine negro -- in honor of he sweetheart a color lady of philadelphium of black bet i be rammer-and-sponger and ram and sponge i do like a good fellow i have no doubt that have i and my gun be at the battle of the nile we would mutually have immortalise ourselves the ramming-pole would have be hang up in westminster abbey and i ennoble by the king besides receive the illustrious honor of a autograph letter from he majesty through the perfumed right hand of he private secretary but it be terrible work to help run in and out of the porthole that amazing mass of metal especially as the thing must be clone in a trice then at the summons of a horrid rasping rattle sway by the captain in person we be make to rush from we gun seize pike and pistol and repel a imaginary army of boarder who by a fiction of the officer be suppose to be assail all side of the ship at once after cut and slash at they a while we jump back to we gun and again go to jerk we elbow meantime a loud cry be hear of fire fire fire in the fore-top and a regular engine work by a set of bowery-boy tar be forthwith set to play stream of water aloft and now it be fire fire fire on the main-deck and the entire ship be in as great a commotion as if a whole city ward be in a blaze be we officer of the navy utterly unacquainted with the law of good health do they not know that this violent exercise take place just after a hearty dinner as it generally do be eminently calculate to breed the dyspepsia there be no satisfaction in dine the flavor of every mouthful be destroy by the thought that the next moment the cannonading drum might be beat to quarter such a sea-martinet be we captain that sometimes we be rouse from we hammock at night when a scene would ensue that it be not in the power of pen and ink to describe five hundred man spring to they foot dress themselves take up they bedding and run to the netting and stow it then he to they station -- each man jostle he neighbor -- some alow some aloft some this way some that and in less than five minute the frigate be ready for action and still as the grave almost every man precisely where he would be be a enemy actually about to be engage the gunner like a cornwall miner in a cave be burrow down in the magazine under the ward-room which be light by battle-lantern place behind glazed glass bull 's - eye insert in the bulkhead the powder-monkey or boy who fetch and carry cartridge be scamper to and fro among the gun and the _ first and second loader _ stand ready to receive they supplies these _ powder-monkey _ as they be call enact a curious part in time of action the entrance to the magazine on the berth-deck where they procure they food for the gun be guard by a woollen screen and a gunner 's mate standing behind it thrust out the cartridge through a small arm-hole in this screen the enemy 's shot -lrb- perhaps red hot -rrb- be fly in all direction and to protect they cartridge the powder-monkeys hurriedly wrap they up in they jacket and with all haste scramble up the ladder to they respective gun like eating-house waiter hurry along with hot cake for breakfast at _ general quarter _ the shot-box be uncovered show the grape-shot -- aptly so call for they precisely resemble bunch of the fruit though to receive a bunch of iron grape in the abdomen would be but a sorry dessert and also show the canister-shot -- old iron of various sort pack in a tin case like a tea-caddy imagine some midnight craft sail down on she enemy thus twenty-four pounder level match light and each captain of he gun at he post but if verily go into action then would the neversink have make still further preparation for however alike in some thing there be always a vast difference -- if you sound they -- between a reality and a sham not to speak of the pale sternness of the man at they gun at such a juncture and the choke thought at they heart the ship itself would here and there present a far different appearance something like that of a extensive mansion prepare for a grand entertainment when folding-door be withdraw chamber convert into drawing-room and every inch of available space throw into one continuous whole for previous to a action every bulk-head in a man-of-war be knock down great gun be run out of the commodore 's parlor window nothing separate the ward-room officer ' quarter from those of the man but a en-sign use for a curtain the sailor ' mess-chest be tumble down into the hold and the hospital cot -- of which all men-of-war carry a large supply -- be drag forth from the sail-room and pile near at hand to receive the wound amputation-table be range in the _ cock-pit _ or in the _ tier _ whereon to carve the body of the maim the yard be sling in chain fire-screen distribute here and there : hillock of cannon-ball pile between the gun shot-plug suspend within easy reach from the beam and solid mass of wad big as dutch cheese brace to the cheek of the gun-carriage no small difference also would be visible in the wardrobe of both officer and man the officer generally fight as dandy dance namely in silk stocking inasmuch as in case of be wound in the leg the silk-hose can be more easily draw off by the surgeon cotton stick and work into the wound a economical captain while take care to case he leg in silk might yet see fit to save he best suit and fight in he old clothes for besides that a old garment might much better be cut to piece than a new one it must be a mighty disagreeable thing to die in a stiff tight-breasted coat not yet work easy under the arm-pit at such time a man should feel free unencumbered and perfectly at he ease in point of strap and suspenders no ill-will concern he tailor should intrude upon he thought of eternity seneca understand this when he choose to die naked in a bath and man-of-war 's man understand it also for most of they in battle strip to the waist-band wear nothing but a pair of duck trowser and a handkerchief round they head a captain combine a heedful patriotism with economy would probably bend he old topsail before go into battle instead of expose he best canvas to be riddled to piece for it be generally the case that the enemy 's shot fly high unless allowance be make for it in point the tube at long-gun distance the slightest roll of the ship at the time of firing would send a shot mean for the hull high over the top-gallant yard but besides these difference between a sham-fight at _ general quarter _ and a real cannonade the aspect of the ship at the beating of the retreat would in the latter case be very dissimilar to the neatness and uniformity in the former _ then _ we bulwark might look like the wall of the house in west broadway in new york after be break into and burn out by the negro mob we stout mast and yard might be lie about deck like tree bough after a tornado in a piece of woodland we dangling rope cut and sunder in all direction would be bleed tar at every yard and strew with jagged splinter from we wounded plank the gun-deck might resemble a carpenter 's shop _ then _ when all be over and all hand would be pipe to take down the hammock from the expose netting -lrb- where they play the part of the cotton bale at new orlean -rrb- we might find bit of broken shot iron bolt and bullet in we blanket and while smear with blood like butcher the surgeon and he mate would be amputate arm and leg on the berth-deck a underling of the carpenter 's gang would be new-legging and arm the broken chair and table in the commodore 's cabin while the rest of he _ squad _ would be _ splicing _ and _ fishing _ the shatter mast and yard the scupper-hole have discharge the last rivulet of blood the deck would be wash down and the galley-cook would be go fore and aft sprinkle they with hot vinegar to take out the shambles ' smell from the plank which unless some such means be employ often create a highly offensive effluvium for week after a fight _ then _ upon muster the man and call the quarter-bill by the light of a battle-lantern many a wounded seaman with he arm in a sling would answer for some poor shipmate who could never more make answer for himself : tom brown kill sir jack jewel kill sir joe hardy kill sir and opposite all these poor fellow ' name down would go on the quarter-bill the bloody mark of red ink -- a murderer 's fluid fitly use on these occasion chapter xvii away second

of the main-mast at one end and front at the other by the palace of the commodore 's cabin or rather a man-of-war be a lofty walled and garrisoned town like quebec where the thoroughfare and mostly rampart and peaceable citizen meet armed sentry at every corner or it be like the lodging-house in pari turn upside down the first floor or deck be rent by a lord the second by a select club of gentleman the third by crowd of artisan and the fourth by a whole rabble of common people for even thus be it in a frigate where the commander have a whole cabin to himself and the spar-deck the lieutenant they ward-room underneath and the mass of sailor swing they hammock under all and with its long row of port-hole casement each reveal the muzzle of a cannon a man-of-war resemble a three-story house in a suspicion part of the town with a basement of indefinite depth and ugly-looking fellow gaze out at the window chapter xix the jacket aloft again must i call attention to my white jacket which about this time come near be the death of I i be of a meditative humor and at sea use often to mount aloft at night and seat myself on one of the upper yard tuck my jacket about I and give loose to reflection in some ship in which i have do this the sailor use to fancy that i must be study astronomy -- which indeed to some extent be the case -- and that my object in mount aloft be to get a nearer view of the star suppose I of course to be short-sighted a very silly conceit of theirs some may say but not so silly after all for surely the advantage of get nearer a object by two hundred foot be not to be underrated then to study the star upon the wide boundless sea be divine as it be to the chaldean magus who observe they revolution from the plain and it be a very fine feeling and one that fuse we into the universe of thing and mate we a part of the all to think that wherever we ocean-wanderer reeve we have still the same glorious old star to keep we company that they still shine onward and on forever beautiful and bright and lure we by every ray to die and be glorified with they ay ay we sailor sail not in vain we expatriate ourselves to nationalise with the universe and in all we voyage round the world we be still accompany by those old circumnavigator the star who be shipmate and fellow-sailor of ours -- sailing in heaven 's blue as we on the azure main let genteel generation scoff at we hardened hand and finger-nail tip with tar -- do they ever clasp truer palm than ours let they feel of we sturdy heart beat like sledge-hammer in those hot smithy we bosom with they amber-headed cane let they feel of we generous pulse and swear that they go off like thirty-two-pounder oh give I again the rover 's life -- the joy the thrill the whirl let I feel thee again old sea let I leap into thy saddle once more i be sick of these terra firma toil and care sick of the dust and reek of town let I hear the clatter of hailstone on iceberg and not the dull tramp of these plodder plod they dull way from they cradle to they grave let I snuff thee up sea-breeze and whinny in thy spray forbid it sea-gods intercede for I with neptune o sweet amphitrite that no dull clod may fall on my coffin be mine the tomb that swallow up pharaoh and all he host let I lie down with drake where he sleep in the sea but when white-jacket speak of the rover 's life he mean not life in a man-of-war which with its martial formality and thousand vice stab to the heart the soul of all free-and-easy honorable rover i have say that i be wont to mount up aloft and muse and thus be it with I the night follow the loss of the cooper ere my watch in the top have expire high up on the main-royal-yard i recline the white jacket fold around I like sir john moore in he frosted cloak eight bell have strike and my watchmate have hie to they hammock and the other watch have go to they station and the _ top _ below I be full of stranger and still one hundred foot above even _ they _ i lay entrance now doze now dream now think of thing past and anon of the life to come well-timed be the latter thought for the life to come be much nearer overtake I than i then could imagine perhaps i be half conscious at last of a tremulous voice hail the main-royal-yard from the _ top _ but if so the consciousness glide away from I and leave I in lethe but when like lightning the yard drop under I and instinctively i clung with both hand to the _ tie _ then i come to myself with a rush and feel something like a choke hand at my throat for a instant i think the gulf stream in my head be whirling I away to eternity but the next moment i find myself stand the yard have descend to the _ cup _ and shake myself in my jacket i feel that i be unharmed and alive who have do this who have make this attempt on my life think i as i run down the rigging here it come -- lord lord here it come see see it be white as a hammock who be come i shout spring down into the top who be white as a hammock bless my soul bill it be only white-jacket -- that infernal white-jacket again it seem they have spy a move white spot there aloft and sailor-like have take I for the ghost of the cooper and after hail I and bidding I descend to test my corporeality and get no answer they have lower the halyard in affright in a rage i tear off the jacket and throw it on the deck jacket cry i you must change you complexion you must hie to the dyer and be dye that i may live i have but one poor life white-jacket and that life i can not spare i can not consent to die for _ you _ but be dye you must for I you can dye many time without injury but i can not die without irreparable loss and run the eternal risk so in the morning jacket in hand i repair to the first lieutenant and related the narrow escape i have have during the night i enlarged upon the general peril i run in be take for a ghost and earnestly besought he to relax he command for once and give I a order on brush the captain of the paint-room for some black paint that my jacket might be paint of that color just look at it sir i add hold it lip do you ever see anything whiter consider how it shine of a night like a bit of the milky way a little paint sir you can not refuse the ship have no paint to spare he say you must get along without it sir every rain give I a soak cape horn be at hand -- six brushes-full would make it waterproof and no longer would i be in peril of my life can not help it sir depart i fear it will not be well with I in the end for if my own sin be to be forgive only as i forgive that hard-hearted and unimpressible first lieutenant then pardon there be none for I what when but one dab of paint would make a man of a ghost and it mackintosh of a herring-net -- to refuse it i be full i can say no more chapter xx how they sleep in a man-of-war no more of my luckless jacket for a while let I speak of my hammock and the tribulation i endure therefrom give I plenty of room to swing it in let I swing it between two date-tree on a arabian plain or extend it diagonally from moorish pillar to pillar in the open marble court of the lion in granada 's alhambra : let I swing it on a high bluff of the mississippus -- one swing in the pure ether for every swing over the green grass or let I oscillate in it beneath the cool dome of st peter 's or drop I in it as in a balloon from the zenith with the whole firmament to rock and expatiate in and i would not exchange my coarse canvas hammock for the grand state-bed like a stately coach-and-four in which they tuck in a king when he pass a night at blenheim castle when you have the requisite room you always have spreader in you hammock that be two horizontal stick one at each end which serve to keep the side apart and create a wide vacancy between wherein you can turn over and over -- lay on this side or that on you back if you please stretch out you leg in short take you ease in you hammock for of all inn you bed be the best but when with five hundred other hammock yours be crowd and jam on all side on a frigate berth-deck the third from above when _ spreader _ be prohibit by a express edict from the captain 's cabin and every man about you be jealously watchful of the rights and privilege of he own proper hammock as settle by law and usage _ then _ you hammock be you bastile and canvas jug into which or out of which it be very hard to get and where sleep be but a mockery and a name eighteen inch a man be all they allow you eighteen inch in width in _ that _ you must swing dreadful they give you more swing than that at the gallows during warm night in the tropics you hammock be as a stew-pan where you stew and stew till you can almost hear yourself hiss vain be all stratagem to widen you accommodation let they catch you insinuate you boot or other article in the head of you hammock by way of a spreader near and far the whole rank and file of the row to which you belong feel the encroachment in a instant and be clamorous till the guilty one be find out and he pallet bring back to its bearing in platoon and squadron they all lie on a level they hammock _ clew _ cross and recross in all direction so as to present one vast field-bed midway between the ceiling and the floor which be about five foot asunder one extremely warm night during a calm when it be so hot that only a skeleton could keep cool -lrb- from the free current of air through its bone -rrb- after be drench in my own perspiration i manage to wedge myself out of my hammock and with what little strength i have leave lowered myself gently to the deck let I see now think i whether my ingenuity can not devise some method whereby i can have room to breathe and sleep at the same time i have it i will lower my hammock underneath all these other and then -- upon that separate and independent level at least -- i shall have the whole berth-deck to myself accordingly i lower away my pallet to the desire point -- about three inch from the floor -- and crawl into it again but alas this arrangement make such a sweeping semi-circle of my hammock that while my head and foot be at par the small of my back be settle down indefinitely i feel as if some gigantic archer have hold of I for a bow but there be another plan leave i triced up my hammock with all my strength so as to bring it wholly _ above _ the tier of pallet around I this do by a last effort i hoist myself into it but alas it be much worse than before my luckless hammock be stiff and straight as a board and there i be -- lay out in it with my nose against the ceiling like a dead man 's against the lid of he coffin so at last i be fain to return to my old level and moralise upon the folly in all arbitrary government of strive to get either _ below _ or _ above _ those whom legislation have place upon a equality with yourself speak of hammock recall a circumstance that happen one night in the neversink it be three or four time repeat with various but not fatal result the watch below be fast asleep on the berth-deck where perfect silence be reign when a sudden shock and a groan rouse up all hand and the hem of a pair of white trowser vanish up one of the ladder at the fore-hatchway we run toward the groan and find a man lie on the deck one end of he hammock have give way pitch he head close to three twenty-four pound cannon shot which must have be purposely place in that position when it be discover that this man have long be suspect of be a _ informer _ among the crew little surprise and less pleasure be evince at he narrow escape chapter xxi one reason why man-of-war 's man be generally short-lived i can not quit this matter of the hammock without make mention of a grievance among the sailor that ought to be redress in a man-of-war at sea the sailor have _ watch and watch _ that be through every twenty-four hour they be on and off duty every four hour now the hammock be pipe down from the netting -lrb- the open space for stow they run round the top of the bulwark -rrb- a little after sunset and pipe up again when the forenoon watch be call at eight o'clock in the morning so that during the daytime they be inaccessible as pallet this would be all well enough do the sailor have a complete night 's rest but every other night at sea one watch have only four hour in they hammock indeed deduct the time allow for the other watch to turn out for yourself to arrange you hammock get into it and fairly get asleep it maybe say that every other night you have but three hour ' sleep in you hammock have then be on deck for twice four hour at eight o'clock in the morning you _ watch-below _ come round and you be not liable to duty until noon under like circumstance a merchant seaman go to he _ bunk _ and have the benefit of a good long sleep but in a man-of-war you can do no such thing you hammock be very neatly stow in the netting and there it must remain till nightfall but perhaps there be a corner for you somewhere along the battery on the gun-deck where you may enjoy a snug nap but as no one be allow to recline on the larboard side of the gun-deck -lrb- which be reserve as a corridor for the officer when they go forward to they smoking-room at the _ bridle-port _ -rrb- the starboard side only be leave to the seaman but most of this side also be occupy by the carpenter sail-maker barber and cooper in short so few be the corner where you can snatch a nap during daytime in a frigate that not one in ten of the watch who have be on deck eight hour can get a wink of sleep till the follow night repeatedly after by good fortune secure a corner i have be rouse from it by some functionary commission to keep it clear off cape horn what before have be very uncomfortable become a serious hardship drench through and through by the spray of the sea at night i have sometimes sleep standing on the spar-deck -- and shudder as i sleep -- for the want of sufficient sleep in my hammock during three day of the stormiest weather we be give the privilege of the _ berth-deck _ -lrb- at other time strictly interdict -rrb- where we be permit to spread we jacket and take a nap in the morning after the eight hour ' night exposure but this privilege be but a beggarly one indeed not to speak of we jacket -- use for blanket -- be soak wet the spray come down the hatchway keep the plank of the berth-deck itself constantly wet whereas have we be permit we hammock we might have swing dry over all this deluge but we endeavor to make ourselves as warm and comfortable as possible chiefly by close stow so as to generate a little steam in the absence of any fire-side warmth you have see perhaps the way in which they box up subject intend to illustrate the winter lecture of a professor of surgery just so we lay heel and point face to back dove-tailed into each other at every ham and knee the wet of we jacket thus densely pack would soon begin to distill but it be like pour hot water on you to keep you from freezing it be like be pack between the soaked sheet in a water-cure establishment such a posture could not be preserve for any considerable period without shift side for side three or four time during the four hour i would be startle from a wet doze by the hoarse cry of a fellow who do the duty of a corporal at the after-end of my file _ sleeper ahoy stand by to slew round _ and with a double shuffle we all roll in concert and find ourselves face the taffrail instead of the bowsprit but however you turn you nose be sure to stick to one or other of the steam back on you two flank there be some little relief in the change of odour consequent upon this but what be the reason that after battle out eight stormy hour on deck at night man-of-war 's - man be not allow the poor boon of a dry four hour ' nap during the day follow what be the reason the commodore captain and first lieutenant chaplain purser and score of other have _ all night in _ just as if they be stay at a hotel on shore and the junior lieutenant not only have they cot to go to at any time : but as only one of they be require to head the watch and there be so many of they among whom to divide that duty they be only on deck four hour to twelve hour below in some ease the proportion be still greater whereas with _ the people _ it be four hour in and four hour off continually what be the reason then that the common seaman should fare so hard in this matter it would seem but a simple thing to let they get down they hammock during the day for a nap but no such a proceeding would mar the uniformity of daily event in a man-of-war it seem indispensable to the picturesque effect of the spar-deck that the hammock should invariably remain stow in the netting between sunrise and sundown but the chief reason be this -- a reason which have sanction many a abuse in this world -- _ precedent be against it _ such a thing as sailor sleep in they hammock in the daytime after be eight hour expose to a night-storm be hardly ever hear of in the navy though to the immortal honor of some captain be it say the fact be upon navy record that off cape horn they _ have _ vouchsafe the morning hammock to they crew heaven bless such tender-hearted officer and may they and they descendant -- ashore or afloat -- have sweet and pleasant slumber while they live and a undreaming siesta when they die it be concern such thing as the subject of this chapter that special enactment of congress be demand health and comfort -- so far as duly attainable under the circumstance -- should be legally guarantee to the man-of-war 's - man and not leave to the discretion or caprice of they commander chapter xxii wash-day and house-cleaning in a man-of-war besides the other tribulation connect with you hammock you must keep it snow-white and clean who have not observe the long row of spotless hammock expose in a frigate 's netting where through the day they outside at least be keep air hence it come that there be regular morning appoint for the scrubbing of hammock and such morning be call _ scrub-hammock-mornings _ and desperate be the scrub that ensue before daylight the operation begin all hand be call and at it they go every deck be spread with hammock fore and aft and lucky be you if you can get sufficient superfice to spread you own hammock in down on they knee be five hundred man scrub away with brush and broom jostle and crowd and quarrel about use each other 's suds when all they purser 's soap go to create one indiscriminate yeast sometimes you discover that in the dark you have be all the while scrub you next neighbor 's hammock instead of you own but it be too late to begin over again for now the word be pass for every man to advance with he hammock that it may be tie to a net-like frame-work of clothes-line and hoist aloft to dry that do without delay you get together you frock and trowser and on the already flood deck embark in the laundry business you have no special bucket or basin to yourself -- the ship be one vast wash-tub where all hand wash and rinse out and rinse out and wash till at last the word be pass again to make fast you clothes that they also may be elevated to dry then on all three deck the operation of holy-stoning begin so call from the queer name bestow upon the principal instrument employ these be ponderous flat stone with long rope at each end by which the stone be slidden about to and fro over the wet and sanded deck a most wearisome dog-like galley-slave employment for the byway and corner about the mast and gun smaller stone be use call _ prayer-books _ inasmuch as the devout operator have to down with they on he knee finally a grand flooding take place and the deck be remorselessly thrash with dry swab after which a extraordinary implement -- a sort of leathern hoe call a_squilgee _ -- be use to scrape and squeeze the last dribbling of water from the plank concern this squilgee i think something of draw up a memoir and read it before the academy of art and science it be a most curious affair by the time all these operation be conclude it be _ eight bell 's _ and all hand be pipe to breakfast upon the damp and every-way disagreeable deck now against this invariable daily flooding of the three deck of a frigate as a man-of-war 's - man white-jacket most earnestly protest in sunless weather it keep the sailor ' quarter perpetually damp so much so that you can scarce sit down without run the risk of get the lumbago one rheumatic old sheet-anchor-man among we be drive to the extremity of sew a piece of tar canvas on the seat of he trowser let those neat and tidy officer who so love to see a ship keep spick and span clean who institute vigorous search after the man who chance to drop the crumb of a biscuit on deck when the ship be roll in a sea-way let all such swing they hammock with the sailor and they would soon get sick of this daily damp of the deck be a ship a wooden platter that be to be scrub out every morning before breakfast even if the thermometer be at zero and every sailor go barefoot through the flood with the chilblain and all the while the ship carry a doctor well aware of boerhaave 's great maxim _ keep the foot dry _ he have plenty of pill to give you when you be down with a fever the consequence of these thing but enter no protest at the outset -- as it be he duty to do -- against the cause that induce the fever during the pleasant night watch the promenading officer mount on they high-heeled boot pass dry-shod like the israelite over the deck but by daybreak the roar tide set back and the poor sailor be almost overwhelm in it like the egyptian in the red sea oh the chill cold and ague that be catch no snug stove grate or fireplace to go to no you only way to keep warm be to keep in a blaze passion and anathematise the custom that every morning make a wash-house of a man-of-war look at it say you go on board a line-of-battle-ship : you see everything scrupulously neat you see all the deck clear and unobstructed as the sidewalk of wall street of a Sunday morning you see no trace of a sailor 's dormitory you marvel by what magic all this be bring about and well you may for consider that in this unobstructed fabric nearly one thousand mortal man have to sleep eat wash dress cook and perform all the ordinary function of humanity the same number of man ashore would expand themselves into a township be it credible then that this extraordinary neatness and especially this _ unobstructedness _ of a man-of-war can be bring about except by the most rigorous edict and a very serious sacrifice with respect to the sailor of the domestic comfort of life to be sure sailor themselves do not often complain of these thing they be use to they but man can become use even to the hardest usage and it be because he be use to it that sometimes he do not complain of it of all men-of-war the american ship be the most excessively neat and have the greatest reputation for it and of all men-of-war the general discipline of the american ship be the most arbitrary in the english navy the man liberally mess on table which between meal be trice up out of the way the american sailor mess on deck and pick up they broken biscuit or _ midshipman 's nut _ like fowl in a barn-yard but if this unobstructedness in a american fighting-ship be at all hazard so desirable why not imitate the turk in the turkish navy they have no mess-chest the sailor roll they mess thing up in a rug and thrust they under a gun nor do they have any hammock they sleep anywhere about the deck in they _ grego _ indeed come to look at it what more do a man-of-war 's - man absolutely require to live in than he own skin that be room enough and room enough to turn in if he but know how to shift he spine end for end like a ramrod without disturb he next neighbor among all man-of-war 's - man it be a maxim that over-neat vessel be tartar to the crew : and perhaps it may be safely lay down that when you see such a ship some sort of tyranny be not very far off in the neversink as in other national ship the business of _ holy-stoning _ the deck be often prolong by way of punishment to the man particularly of a raw cold morning this be one of the punishment which a lieutenant of the watch may easily inflict upon the crew without infringe the statute which place the power of punishment solely in the hand of the captain the abhorrence which man-of-war 's - man have for this protracted _ holy-stoning _ in cold comfortless weather -- with they bare foot expose to the splashing inundation -- be show in a strange story rife among they curiously tincture with they proverbial superstition the first lieutenant of a english sloop of war a severe disciplinarian be uncommonly particular concern the whiteness of the quarter-deck one bitter winter morning at sea when the crew have wash that part of the vessel as usual and put away they holy-stone this officer come on deck and after inspect it order the _ holy-stone _ and _ prayer-book _ up again once more slip off the shoe from they frosted foot and roll up they trowser the crew kneel down to they task and in that suppliant posture silently invoke a curse upon they tyrant pray as he go below that he might never more come out of the ward-room alive the prayer seem answer : for shortly after be visit with a paralytic stroke at he breakfast-table the first lieutenant next morning be carry out of the ward-room foot foremost dead as they drop he over the side -- so go the story -- the marine sentry at the gangway turn he back upon the corpse to the credit of the humane and sensible portion of the roll of american navy-captain be it add that _ they _ be not so particular in keep the deck spotless at all time and in all weather nor do they torment the man with scrape bright-wood and polish ring-bolt but give all such gingerbread-work a hearty coat of black paint which look more warlike be a better preservative and exempt the sailor from a perpetual annoyance chapter xxiii theatricals in a man-of-war the neversink have summer out she last christmas on the equator she be now destine to winter out the fourth of July not very far from the frigid latitudes of cape horn it be sometimes the custom in the american navy to celebrate this national holiday by double the allowance of spirit to the man that be if the ship happen to be lie in harbor the effect of this patriotic plan may be easily imagine : the whole ship be convert into a dram-shop and the intoxicated sailor reel about on all three deck singing howl and fight this be the time that owe to the relax discipline of the ship old and almost forget quarrel be revive under the stimulus of drink and fencing themselves up between the gun -- so as to be sure of a clear space with at least three wall -- the combatant two and two fight out they hate crib and cabine like soldier duel in a sentry-box in a word scene ensue which would not for a single instant be tolerate by the officer upon any other occasion this be the time that the most venerable of quarter-gunner and quarter-master together with the smallest apprentice boy and man never know to have be previously intoxicate during the cruise -- this be the time that they all roll together in the same muddy trough of drunkenness in emulation of the potentate of the middle age some captain augment the din by authorise a grand jail-delivery of all the prisoner who on that auspicious fourth of the month may happen to be confine in the ship 's prison -- _ the brig _ but from scene like these the neversink be happily deliver besides that she be now approach a most perilous part of the ocean -- which would have make it madness to intoxicate the sailor -- she complete destitution of _ grog _ even for ordinary consumption be a obstacle altogether insuperable even have the captain feel disposed to indulge he man-of-war 's - man by the most copious libation for several day previous to the advent of the holiday frequent conference be hold on the gun-deck touch the melancholy prospects before the ship too bad -- too bad cry a top-man think of it shipmate -- a

sheet-anchor-man you will generally observe that of all american you foreign-born citizen be the most patriotic -- especially toward the fourth of July but how could captain claret the father of he crew behold the grief of he ocean child with indifference he could not three day before the anniversary -- it still continue very pleasant weather for these latitudes -- it be publicly announce that free permission be give to the sailor to get up any sort of theatricals they desire wherewith to honor the fourth now some week prior to the neversink 's sailing from home -- nearly three year before the time here speak of -- some of the seaman have club together and make up a considerable purse for the purpose of purchase a theatrical outfit have in view to diversify the monotony of lie in foreign harbor for week together by a occasional display on the board -- though if ever there w-as a continual theater in the world play by night and by day and without interval between the act a man-of-war be that theater and she plank be the _ board _ indeed the sailor who originate this scheme have serve in other american frigate where the privilege of have theatricals be allow to the crew what be they chagrin then when upon make a application to the captain in a peruvian harbor for permission to present the much-admired drama of _ the ruffian boy _ under the captain 's personal patronage that dignitary assure they that there be already enough _ ruffian boy _ on board without conjure up any more from the green-room the theatrical outfit therefore be stow down in the bottom of the sailor ' bag who little anticipate _ then _ that it would ever be drag out while captain claret have the sway but immediately upon the announcement that the embargo be remove vigorous preparation be at once commence to celebrate the fourth with unwonted spirit the half-deck be set apart for the theater and the signal-quarter-master be command to loan he flag to decorate it in the most patriotic style as the stage-struck portion of the crew have frequently during the cruise rehearse portion of various play to while away the tedium of the night-watch they need no long time now to

dawn clear and fair the breeze be steady the air brace cold and one and all the sailor anticipate a gleeful afternoon and thus be falsify the prophecy of certain old growler averse to theatricals who

go on -- stop holler -- hurrah be now hear on all side till at last see no end to the enthusiasm of he ardent admirer matchless jack step forward and with he lip move in pantomime plunge into the thick of the part silence soon follow but be fifty time break by uncontrollable burst of applause at length when that heart-thrilling scene come on where percy royal-mast rescue fifteen oppressed sailor from the watch-house in the tooth of a posse of constable the audience leap to they foot overturn the capstan bar and to a man hurl they hat on the stage in a delirium of delight ah jack that be a ten-stroke indeed the commotion be now terrific all discipline seem go for ever the lieutenant run in among the man the captain dart from he cabin and the commodore nervously question the armed sentry at he door as to what the deuce _ the people _ be about in the midst of all this the trumpet of the officer-of-the-deck command the top-gallant sail to be take in be almost completely drown a black squall be come down on the weather-bow and the boat-swain 's mate bellow themselves hoarse at the main-hatchway there be no know what would have ensue have not the bass drum suddenly be hear call all hand to quarter a summons not to be withstand the sailor prick they ear at it as horse at the sound of a crack whip and confusedly stumble up the ladder to they station the next moment all be silent but the wind howl like a thousand devil in the cordage stand by to reef all three top-sail -- settle away the halyard -- haul out -- so : make fast -- aloft top-men and reef away thus in storm and tempest terminate that day 's theatricals but the sailor never recover from the disappointment of not have the _ true yankee sailor _ sing by the irish captain of the head and here white-jacket must moralize a bit the unwonted spectacle of the row of gun-room officer mingle with the people in applaud a mere seaman like jack chase fill I at the time with the most pleasurable emotion it be a sweet thing think i to see these officer confess a human brotherhood with we after all a sweet thing to mark they cordial appreciation of the manly merit of my matchless jack ah they be noble fellow all round and i do not know but i have wrong they sometimes in my thought nor be it without similar pleasurable feeling that i witness the temporary rupture of the ship 's stern discipline consequent upon the tumult of the theatricals i think to myself this now be as it should be it be good to shake off now and then this iron yoke round we neck and after have once permit we sailor to be a little noisy in a harmless way -- somewhat merrily turbulent -- the officer can not with any good grace be so excessively stern and unyielding as before i begin to think a man-of-war a man-of-peace-and-good-will after all but alas disappointment come next morning the same old scene be enact at the gang-way and behold the row of uncompromising-looking-officers there assemble with the captain to witness punishment -- the same officer who have be so cheerfully dispose over night -- a old sailor touch my shoulder and say see white-jacket all round they have _ ship they quarter-deck face again _ but this be the way i afterward learn that this be a old man-of-war 's - man 's phrase expressive of the facility with which a sea-officer fall back upon all the severity of he dignity after a temporary suspension of it chapter xxiv introductory to cape horn and now through drizzle fog and vapor and under damp double-reefed top-sail we wet-decked frigate draw nearer and nearer to

on the quarter and still cape horn be cape horn cape horn it be that take the conceit out of fresh-water sailor and steep in a still salter brine the saltest woe betide the tyro the fool-hardy heaven preserve you mediterranean captain who with a cargo of orange have hitherto make merry run across the atlantic without so much as furl a t ' - gallant-sail oftentimes off cape horn receive a lesson which he carry to the grave though the grave -- as be too often the case -- follow so hard on the lesson that no benefit come from the experience other stranger who draw nigh to this patagonium termination of we continent with they soul full of its shipwreck and disaster -- top-sails cautiously reef and everything guardedly snug -- these stranger at first unexpectedly encounter a tolerably smooth sea rashly conclude that the cape after all be but a bugbear they have be impose upon by fable and foundering and sinking hereabouts be all cock-and-bull story out reef my hearty fore and aft set t ' - gallant-sail stand by to give she the fore-top-mast stun ' - sail but captain rash those sail of yours be much safer in the sail-maker 's loft for now while the heedless craft be bound over the billow a black cloud rise out of the sea the sun drop down from the sky a horrible mist far and wide spread over the water hand by the halyard let go clew up too late for ere the rope ' end can be the east off from the pin the tornado be blow down to the bottom of they throat the mast be willow the sail ribbon the cordage wool the whole ship be brew into the yeast of the gale a now if when the first green sea break over he captain rash be not sweep overboard he have he hand full be sure in all probability he three mast have go by the board and ravel into list he sail be float in the air or perhaps the ship _ broach to _ or be _ bring by the lee _ in either ease heaven help the sailor they wife and they little one and heaven help the underwriter familiarity with danger make a brave man braver but less daring thus with seaman : he who go the oftenest round cape horn go the most circumspectly a veteran mariner be never deceive by the treacherous breeze which sometimes waft he pleasantly toward the latitude of the cape no sooner do he come within a certain distance of it -- previously fix in he own mind -- than all hand be turn to set the ship in storm-trim and never mind how light the breeze down come he t ' - gallant-yard he bend he strongest storm-sail and lash every-thing on deck securely the ship be then ready for the worst and if in reel round the headland she receive a broadside it generally go well with she if ill all hand go to the bottom with quiet conscience among sea-captain there be some who seem to regard the genius of the cape as a wilful capricious jade that must be court and coax into complaisance first they come along under easy sail do not steer boldly for the headland but tack this way and that -- sidle up to it now they woo the jezebel with a t ' - gallant-studding-sail anon they deprecate she wrath with double-reefed-topsail when at length she unappeasable fury be fairly arouse and all round the dismantle ship the storm howl and howl for day together they still persevere in they effort first they try unconditional submission furl every rag and _ heaving to _ : lay like a log for the tempest to toss wheresoever it please this fail they set a _ spencer _ or _ try-sail _ and shift on the other tack equally vain the gale sing as hoarsely as before at last the wind come round fair they drop the fore-sail square the yard and scud before it they implacable foe chase they with tornado as if to show she insensibility to the last other ship without encounter these terrible gale spend week after week endeavor to turn this boisterous world-corner against a continual head-wind tack hither and thither in the language of sailor they _ polish _ the cape by beat about its edge so long le mair and schouten two dutchman be the first navigator who weather cape bear previous to this passage have be make to the pacific by the strait of magellan nor indeed at that period be it know to a certainty that there be any other route or that the land now call terra del fuego be a island a few league southward from terra del fuego be a cluster of small island the diego between which and the former island be the strait of le mair so call in honor of they discoverer who first sail through they into the pacific le mair and schouten in they small clumsy vessel encounter a series of tremendous gale the prelude to the long train of similar hardship which most of they follower have experience it be a significant fact that schouten 's vessel the _ horne _ which give its name to the cape be almost lose in weather it the next navigator round the cape be sir franci drake who on raleigh 's expedition behold for the first time from the isthmus of darien the goodlie south sea like a true-born englishman vow please god to sail a english ship thereon which the gallant sailor do to the sore discomfiture of the spaniard on the coast of chili and peru but perhaps the greatest hardship on record in make this celebrated passage be those experience by lord anson 's squadron in 1736 three remarkable and most interesting narrative record they disaster and suffering the first jointly write by the carpenter and gunner of the wager the second by young byron a midshipman in the same ship the third by the chaplain of the centurion white-jacket have they all and they be fine reading of a boisterous march night with the casement rattle in you ear and the chimney-stack blow down upon the pavement bubble with rain-drop but if you want the best idea of cape horn get my friend dana 's unmatchable two year before the mast but you can read and so you must have read it he chapter describe cape horn must have be write with a icicle at the present day the horror of the cape have somewhat abate this be owe to a grow

in that vicinity yet about the loin it be shorter than ballet-dancer 's skirt so that while my chest be in the temperate zone close adjoining the torrid my hapless thigh be in nova zemblum hardly a

be cold as _ blue flujin _ where sailor say fire freeze and now come up with the latitude of the cape we stand southward to give it a wide berth and while so do be becalm ay becalm off cape horn which be worse far worse than be becalm on the line here we lay forty-eight hour during which the cold be intense i wonder at the liquid sea which refuse to freeze in such a temperature the clear cold sky overhead look like a steel-blue cymbal that might ring could you smite it we breath come and go like puff ' of smoke from pipe-bowl at first there be a long gauky swell that oblige we to furl most of the sail and even send down t ' - gallant-yard for fear of pitch they overboard out of sight of land at this extremity of both the inhabitable and uninhabitable world we peopled frigate echo with the voice of man the bleating of lamb the cackling of fowl the grunting of pig seem like noah 's old ark itself becalm at the climax of the deluge there be nothing to be do but patiently to await the

artery himself indeed this state of affair have not last quite twenty-four hour when the extreme frigidity of the air unite to we increase tendency to inactivity would very soon have render some of we subject for the surgeon and he mate have not a humane proceeding of the captain suddenly impel we to vigorous exercise and here be it say that the appearance of the boat-swain with he silver whistle to he mouth at the main hatchway of the gun-deck be always regard by the crew with the utmost curiosity for this betoken that some general order be about to be promulgate through the ship what now be the question that run on from man to man a short preliminary whistle be then give by old yarn as they call he which whistle serve to collect round he from they various station he four mate then yarn or pipe as leader of the orchestra begin a peculiar call in which he assistant join this over the order whatever it may be be loudly sing out and prolonged till the remotest corner echo again the

: _ d'ye hear there for and aft all hand skylark _ this mandate nowadays never use except upon very rare occasion produce the same effect upon the man that exhilarating gas would have do or a extra allowance of grog for a time the wonted discipline of the ship be break through and perfect license allow it be a babel here a bedlam there and a pandemonium everywhere the theatricals be nothing compare with it then the faint-hearted and timorous crawl to they hiding-place and the lusty and bold shout forth they glee gang of man in all sort of outlandish habiliment wild as those wear at some crazy carnival rush to and fro seize upon whomsoever they please -- warrant-officer and dangerous pugilist except -- pull and haul the luckless tar about till fairly bait into a genial warmth some be

exchange the din frighten the sea-fowl that fly by with accelerated wing it be worth mention that several casualty occur of which however i will relate but one while the sky-larking be at its height one of the fore-top-man -- a ugly-tempered devil of a portuguese look on -- swear that he would be the death of any man who lay violent hand upon he inviolable person this threat be overhear a band of desperado come up from behind trip he up in a instant and in the twinkling of a eye the portuguese be straddle a oar bear aloft by a uproarious multitude who rush he along the deck at a railroad gallop the living mass of arm all round and beneath he be so dense that every time he incline one side he be instantly push upright but only to fall over again to receive another push from the contrary direction presently disengage he hand from those who hold they the enraged seaman draw from he bosom a iron belaying-pin and recklessly lay about he to right and leave most of he persecutor flee but some eight or ten still stand they ground and while bear he aloft endeavor to wrest the weapon from he hand in this attempt one man be strike on the head and drop insensible he be take up for

this occurrence put a end to the skylark further head-breaking be strictly prohibit in due time the portuguese pay the penalty of he rashness at the gangway while once again the officer _ ship they quarter-deck face _ chapter xxvi the pitch of the cape ere the calm have yet leave we a sail have be discern from the fore-top-mast-head at a great distance probably three league or more at first it be a mere speck altogether out of sight from the deck by the force of attraction or something else equally inscrutable two ship in a calm and equally affect by the current will always approximate more or less though there be not a breath of wind it be not a great while before the strange sail be descry from we bulwark gradually it draw still nearer what be she and whence there be no object which so excite interest and conjecture and at the same time baffle both as a sail see as a mere speck on these remote sea off cape horn a breeze a breeze for lo the stranger be now perceptibly near the frigate the officer 's spy-glass pronounce she a full-rigged ship with all sail set and come right down to we though in we own vicinity the calm still reign she be bring the wind with she hurrah ay there it be behold how mincingly it creep over the sea just ruffle and crisp it we top-men be at once send aloft to loose the sail and presently they faintly begin to distend as yet we hardly have steerage-way toward sunset the stranger bear down before the wind a complete pyramid of canvas never before i venture to say be cape horn so audaciously insult stun ' - sail alow and aloft royal moon-sail and everything else she glide under we stern within hail distance and the signal-quarter-master run up we ensign to the gaff ship ahoy cry the lieutenant of the watch through he trumpet halloa bawl a old fellow in a green jacket clap-ping one hand to he mouth while he hold on with the other to the mizzen-shroud what ship be that the sultan indiaman from new york and bind to callao and canton sixty day out all well what frigate 's that the united state ship neversink homeward bind hurrah hurrah hurrah yell we enthusiastic countryman transport with patriotism by this time the sultan have sweep past but the lieutenant of the watch could not withhold a parting admonition d'ye hear you would better take in some of you flying-kite there look out for cape horn but the friendly advice be lose in the now increase wind with a suddenness by no means unusual in these latitudes the light breeze soon become a succession of sharp squall and we sail-proud braggadacio of a india-man be observe to let everything go by the run he t ' - gallant stun ' - sail and flying-jib take quick leave of the spar the flying-jib be sweep into the air roll together for a few minute and toss about in the squall like a foot-ball but the wind play no such prank with the more prudently manage canvas of the neversink though before many hour it be stir time with we about midnight when the starboard watch to which i belong be below the boatswain 's whistle be hear follow by the shrill cry of _ all hand take in sail _ jump man and save ship spring from we hammock we find the frigate lean over to it so steeply that it be with difficulty we could climb the ladder lead to the upper deck here the scene be awful the vessel seem to be sail on she side the main-deck gun have several day previous be run in and house and the port-hole close but the lee carronade on the quarter-deck and forecastle be plunge through the sea which undulate over they in milk-white billow of foam with every lurch to leeward the yard-arm-end seem to dip in the sea while forward the spray dash over the bow in cataract and drench the man who be on the fore-yard by this time the deck be alive with the whole strength of the ship 's company five hundred man officer and all mostly clinging to the weather bulwark the occasional phosphorescence of the yeasting sea cast a glare upon they uplifted face as a night fire in a populous city light up the panic-stricken crowd in a sudden gale or when a large quantity of sail be suddenly to be furl it be the custom for the first lieutenant to take the trumpet from whoever happen then to be officer of the deck but mad jack have the trumpet that watch nor do the first lieutenant now seek to wrest it from he hand every eye be upon he as if we have choose he from among we all to decide this battle with the element by single combat with the spirit of the cape for mad jack be the saving genius of the ship and so prove himself that night i owe this right hand that be this moment fly over my sheet and all my present be to mad jack the ship 's bow be now but batter ramming and thunder over and upon the head sea and with a horrible wallow sound we whole hull be roll in the trough of the foam the gale come athwart the deck and every sail seem burst with its wild breath all the quarter-master and several of the forecastle-man be swarm round the double-wheel on the quarter-deck some jump up and down with they hand upon the spoke for the whole helm and galvanise keel be fiercely feverish with the life impart to they by the tempest hard _ up _ the helm shout captain claret burst from he cabin like a ghost in he night-dress damn you rage mad jack to the quarter-master hard down -- hard _ down _ i say and be damned to you contrary order but mad jack 's be obey he object be to throw the ship into the wind so as the better to admit of close-reef the top-sail but though the halyard be let go it be impossible to clew down the yard owe to the enormous horizontal strain on the canvas it now blow a hurricane the spray fly over the ship in flood the gigantic mast seem about to snap under the world-wide strain of the three entire top-sail clew down clew down shout mad jack husky with excitement and in a frenzy beat he trumpet against one of the shroud but owe to the slant of the ship the thing could not be do it be obvious that before many minute something must go -- either sail rigging or stick perhaps the hull itself and all hand presently a voice from the top exclaim that there be a rent in the main-top-sail and instantly we hear a re-port like two or three musket discharge together the vast sail be rent up and clown like the vail of the temple this save the main-mast for the yard be now clew down with comparative ease and the top-men lay out to stow the shattered canvas soon the two remain top-sail be also clew down and close reef above all the roar of the tempest and the shout of the crew be hear the dismal toll of the ship 's bell -- almost as large as that of a village church -- which the violent rolling of the ship be occasion imagination can not conceive the horror of such a sound in a night-tempest at sea stop that ghost roar mad jack away one of you and wrench off the clapper but no sooner be this ghost gag than a still more appalling sound be hear the roll to and fro of the heavy shot which on the gun-deck have break loose from the gun-rack and convert that part of the ship into a immense bowling-alley some hand be send down to secure they but it be as much as they life be worth several be maim and the midshipman who be order to see the duty perform report it impossible until the storm abate the most terrific job of all be to furl the main-sail which at the commencement of the squall have be clew up coax and quiet as much as possible with the bunt-line and slab-line mad jack wait some time for a lull ere he give a order so perilous to be execute for to furl this enormous sail in such a gale require at least fifty man on the yard whose weight superad to that of the ponderous stick itself still further jeopardise they life but there be no prospect of a cessation of the gale and the order be at last give at this time a hurricane of slanting sleet and hail be descend upon we the rigging be coat with a thin glare of ice form within the hour aloft main-yard-men and all you main-top-men and furl the main-sail cry mad jack i dash down my hat slip out of my quilted jacket in a instant kick the shoe from my foot and with a crowd of other spring for the rigging above the bulwark -lrb- which in a frigate be so high as to afford much protection to those on deck -rrb- the gale be horrible the sheer force of the wind flatten we to the rigging as we ascend and every hand seem congeal to the icy shroud by which we hold up -- up my brave hearty shout mad jack and up we get some way or other all of we and grope we way out on the yard-arm hold on every mother 's son cry a old quarter-gunner at my side he be bawl at the top of he compass but in the gale he seem to be whisper and i only hear he from he be right to windward of I but he hint be unnecessary i dig my nail into the _ jack-stay _ and swear that nothing but death should part I and they until i be able to turn round and look to windward as yet this be impossible i could scarcely hear the man to leeward at my elbow the wind seem to snatch the word from he mouth and fly away with they to the south pole all this while the sail itself be fly about sometimes catch over we head and threaten to tear we from the yard in spite of all we hug for about three quarter of a hour we thus hang suspend right over the rampant billow which curl they very crest under the foot of some four or five of we cling to the lee-yard-arm as if to float we from we place presently the word pass along the yard from wind-ward that we be order to come down and leave the sail to blow since it could not be furl a midshipman it seem have be send up by the officer of the deck to give the order as no trumpet could be hear where we be those on the weather yard-arm manage to crawl upon the spar and scramble down the rigging but with we upon the extreme leeward side this feat be out of the question it be literary like climb a precipice to get to wind-ward in order to reach the shroud : besides the entire yard be now encase in ice and we hand and foot be so numb that we dare not trust we life to they nevertheless by assist each other we contrived to throw ourselves prostrate along the yard and embrace it with we arm and leg in this position the stun ' - sail-boom greatly assist in secure we hold strange as it may appear i do not suppose that at this moment the slightest sensation of fear be feel by one man on that yard we cling to it with might and main but this be instinct the truth be that in circumstance like these the sense of fear be annihilate in the unutterable sight that fill all the eye and the sound that fill all the ear you become identify with the tempest you insignificance be lose in the riot of the stormy universe around below we we noble frigate seem thrice its real length -- a vast black wedge oppose its widest end to the combined fury of the sea and wind at length the first fury of the gale begin to abate and we at once fall to pound we hand as a preliminary operation to go to work for a gang of man have now ascend to help secure what be leave of the sail we somehow pack it away at last and come down about noon the next day the gale so moderate that we shake two reef out of the top-sails set new course and stand due east with the wind astern thus all the fine weather we encounter after first weigh anchor on the pleasant spanish coast be but the prelude to this one terrific night more especially that treacherous calm immediately precede it but how could we reach we long-promised home without encounter cape horn by what possibility avoid it and though some ship have weather it without these peril yet by far the greater part must encounter they lucky it be that it come about midway in the homeward-bound passage so that the sailor have time to prepare for it and time to recover from it after it be astern but sailor or landsman there be some sort of a cape horn for all boy beware of it prepare for it in time gray-beard thank god it be pass and ye lucky liver to whom by some rare fatality you cape horn be placid as lake leman flatter not yourselve that good luck be judgment and discretion for all the yolk in you egg you might have founder and go down have the spirit of the cape say the word chapter xxvii some thought grow out of mad jack 's countermand he superior 's order in time of peril like the needle to the loadstone obedience irrespective of rank generally fly to he who be best fit to command the truth of this seem evince in the case of mad jack during the gale and especially at that perilous moment when he countermand the captain 's order at the helm but every seaman know at the time that the captain 's order be a unwise one in the extreme perhaps worse than unwise these two order give by the captain and he lieutenant exactly contrast they character by put the helm _ hard up _ the captain be for _ scud _ that be for fly away from the gale whereas mad jack be for run the ship into its tooth it be needless to say that in almost all case of similar hard squall and gale the latter step though attend with more appalling appearance be in reality the safer of the two and the most generally adopt scud make you a slave to the blast which drive you headlong before it but _ run up into the wind 's eye _ enable you in a degree to hold it at bay scudding expose to the gale you stern the weakest part of you hull the contrary course present to it you bow you strongest part as with ship so with man he who turn he back to he foe give he a advantage whereas we ribbed chest like the ribbed bow of a frigate be as bulkhead to dam off a onset that night off the pitch of the cape captain claret be hurry forth from he disguise and at a manhood-testing conjuncture appear in he true color a thing which every man in the ship have long suspect that night be prove true hitherto in go about the ship and cast he glance among the man the peculiarly lustreless repose of the captain 's eye -- he slow even unnecessarily methodical step and the forced firmness of he whole demeanor -- though to a casual observer expressive of the consciousness of command and a desire to strike subjection among the crew -- all this to some mind have only be deem indication of the fact that captain claret while carefully shun positive excess continually keep himself in a uncertain equilibrio between soberness and its reverse which equilibrio might be destroy by the first sharp vicissitude of event and though this be only a surmise nevertheless as have some knowledge of brandy and mankind white-jacket will venture to state that have captain claret be a out-and-out temperance man he would never have give that most imprudent order to _ hard up _ the helm he would either have hold he peace and stay in he cabin like he gracious majesty the commodore or else have anticipate mad jack 's order and thunder forth hard down the helm to show how little real sway at time have the severest restrictive law and how spontaneous be the instinct of discretion in some mind it must here be add that though mad jack under a hot impulse have countermand a order of he superior officer before he very face yet that severe article of war to which he thus render himself obnoxious be never enforce against he nor so far as any of the crew ever know do the captain even venture to reprimand he for he temerity it have be say that mad jack himself be a lover of strong drink so he be but here we only see the virtue of be place in a station constantly demand a cool head and steady nerve and the misfortune of fill a post that do _ not _ at all time demand these quality so exact and methodical in most thing be the discipline of the frigate that to a certain extent captain claret be exempt from personal interposition in many of its current event and thereby perhaps be he lull into security under the entice lee of he decanter but as for mad jack he must stand he regular watch and pace the quarter-deck at night and keep a sharp eye to windward hence at sea mad jack try to make a point of keep sober though in very fine weather he be sometimes betray into a glass too many but with cape horn before he he take the temperance pledge outright till that perilous promontory should be far astern the lead incident of the gale irresistibly invite the question be there incompetent officer in the american navy -- that be incompetent to the due performance of whatever duty may devolve upon they but in that gallant marine which during the late war gain so much of what be call _ glory _ can there possibly be to-day incompetent officer as in the camp ashore so on the quarter-deck at sea -- the trumpet of one victory drown the muffle drum of a thousand defeat and in degree this hold true of those event of war which be neuter in they character neither make renown nor disgrace besides as a long array of cipher lead by but one solitary numeral swell by mere force of aggregation into a immense arithmetical sum even so in some brilliant action do a crowd of officer each inefficient in himself aggregate renown when band together and lead by a numeral nelson or a wellington and the renown of such hero by outlive themselves descend as a heritage to they subordinate survivor one large brain and one large heart have virtue sufficient to magnetise a whole fleet or a army and if all the man who since the beginning of the world have mainly contribute to the warlike success or reverse of nation be now muster together we should be amaze to behold but a handful of hero for there be no heroism in merely run in and out a gun at a port-hole envelop in smoke or vapor or in firing off musket in platoon at the word of command this kind of merely manual valor be often bear of trepidation at the heart there may be man individually craven who unite may display even temerity yet it would be false to deny that in some in-stance the lowest private have acquit themselves with even more gallantry than they commodore true heroism be not in the hand but in the heart and the head but be there incompetent officer in the gallant american navy for a american the question be of no grateful cast white jacket must again evade it by refer to a historical fact in the history of a kindred marine which from its long standing and magnitude furnish many more example of all kind than we own and this be the only reason why it be ever refer to in this narrative i thank god i be free from all national invidiousness it be indirectly on record in the book of the english admiralty that in the year 1808 -- after the death of lord nelson -- when lord collingwood command on the mediterranean station and he broken health induce he to solicit a furlough that out of a list of upward of one hundred admiral not a single officer be find who be deem qualify to relieve the applicant with credit to the country this fact collingwood seal with he life for hopeless of be recall he shortly after die wear out at he post now if this be the case in so renown a marine as england 's what must be infer with respect to we own but herein no special disgrace be involve for the truth be that to be a accomplished and skillful naval generalissimo need natural capability of a uncommon order still more it may safely be assert that worthily to command even a frigate require a degree of natural heroism talent judgment and integrity that be deny to mediocrity yet these qualification be not only required but demand and no one have a right to be a naval captain unless he possess they regard lieutenant there be not a few selvagee and paper jack in the american navy many commodore know that they have seldom take a line-of-battle ship to sea without feel more or less nervousness when some of the lieutenant have the deck at night accord to the last navy register -lrb- 1849 -rrb- there be now 68 captain in the american navy collectively draw about $ 300000 annually from the public treasury also 297 commander draw about $ 200000 and 377 lieutenant draw about half a million and 451 midshipman -lrb- include passed-midshipman -rrb- also draw nearly half a million consider the known fact that some of these officer be seldom or never send to sea owing to the navy department be well aware of they inefficiency that other be detail for pen-and-ink work at observatory and solver of logarithm in the coast survey while the really meritorious officer who be accomplish practical seaman be know to be send from ship to ship with but small interval of a furlough consider all this it be not too much to say that no small portion of the million and a half of money above mention be annually pay to national pensioner in disguise who live on the navy without serve it nothing like this can be even insinuate against the _ forward officer _ -- boatswain gunner etc nor against the _ petty officer _ -- captain of the top etc nor against the able seaman in the navy for if any of _ these _ be find want they be forthwith disrated or discharge true all experience teach that whenever there be a great national establishment employ large number of official the public must be reconcile to support many incompetent man for such be the favouritism and nepotism always prevail in the purlieus of these establishment that some incompetent person be always admit to the exclusion of many of the worthy nevertheless in a country like ours boasting of the political equality of all social condition it be a great reproach that such a thing as a common seaman rise to the rank of a commission officer in we navy be nowadays almost unheard-of yet in former time when officer have so rise to rank they have generally prove of signal usefulness in the service and sometimes have reflect solid honor upon the country instance in point might be mention be it not well to have we institution of a piece any american landsman may hope to become president of the union -- commodore of we squadron of state and every american sailor should be place in such a position that he might freely aspire to command a squadron of frigate chapter xxviii edge away right before the wind ay blow blow ye breeze so long as ye stay fair and we be homeward bind what care the jolly crew it be worth mention here that in nineteen case out of twenty a passage from the pacific round the cape be almost sure to be much shorter and attend with less hardship than a passage undertake from the atlantic the reason be that the gale be mostly from the westward also the current but after all go before the wind in a frigate in such a tempest have its annoyance and drawback as well as many other blessing the disproportionate weight of metal upon the spar and gun deck induce a violent rolling unknown to merchant ship we roll and roll on we way like the world in its orbit shipping green sea on both side until the old frigate dip and go into it like a diving-bell the hatchway of some armed vessel be but poorly secure in bad weather this be peculiarly the ease with those of the neversink they be merely spread over with a old tarpaulin crack and rent in every direction in fair weather the ship 's company mess on the gun-deck but as this be now flood almost continually we be oblige to take we meal upon the berth-deck the next one below one day the mess of the starboard-watch be seat here at dinner form little group twelve or fifteen man in each recline about the beef-kid and they pot and pan when all of a sudden the ship be seize with such a paroxysm of roll that in a single instant everything on the berth-deck -- pot kid sailor piece of beef bread-bag clothes-bag and barge -- be toss indiscriminately from side to side it be impossible to stay one 's self there be nothing but the bare deck to cling to which be slippery with the contents of the kid and heave under we as if there be a volcano in the frigate 's hold while we be yet slide in uproarious crowd -- all seat -- the window of the deck open and flood of brine descend simultaneously with a violent lee-roll the shower be hail by the reckless tar with a hurricane of yell although for a instant i really imagine we be about be swamp in the sea such volume of water come cascade down a day or two after we have make sufficient east to stand to the northward which we do with the wind astern thus fairly turn the corner without abate we rate of progress though we have see no land since leave callao cape horn be say to be somewhere to the west of we and though there be no positive evidence of the fact the weather encounter might be account pretty good presumptive proof the land near cape horn however be well worth see especially staten land upon one occasion the ship in which i then happen to be sail draw near this place from the northward with a fair free wind blow steadily through a bright translucent clay whose air be almost musical with the clear glittering cold on we starboard beam like a pile of glacier in switzerland lay this staten land gleam in snow-white barrenness and solitude unnumbered white albatross be skim the sea near by and cloud of smaller white wing fall through the air like snow-flakes high towering in they own turbaned snow the far-inland pinnacle loom up like the border of some other world flash wall and crystal battlements like the diamond watch-tower along heaven 's furthest frontier after leave the latitude of the cape we have several storm of snow one night a considerable quantity lay upon the deck and some of the sailor enjoy the juvenile diversion of snow-balling woe unto the middy who that night go forward of the boom such a target for snow-ball the thrower could never be know by some curious sleight in hurl the missile they seem to be throw on board by some hoydenish sea-nymph outside the frigate at daybreak midshipman pert go below to the surgeon with a alarming wound gallantly receive in discharge he perilous duty on the forecastle the officer of the deck have send he on a errand to tell the boatswain that he be want in the captain 's cabin while in the very act of perform the exploit of deliver the message mr pert be strike on the nose with a snow-ball of wondrous compactness upon be inform of the disaster the rogue express the liveliest sympathy pert be no favorite after one of these storm it be a curious sight to see the man relieve the uppermost deck of its load of snow it become the duty of the captain of each gun to keep he own station clean accordingly with a old broom or squilgee he proceed to business often quarrel with he next-door neighbor about they scrape they snow on he premise it be like broadway in winter the morning after a storm when rival shop-boy be at work clean the sidewalk now and then by way of variety we have a fall of hailstone so big that sometimes we find ourselves dodge they the commodore have a polynesian servant on board whose service he have engage at the society island unlike he countryman wooloo be of a sedate earnest and philosophic temperament have never be outside of the tropics before he find many phenomenon off cape horn which absorb he attention and set he like other philosopher to feign theory correspond to the marvel he behold at the first snow when he see the deck cover all over with a white powder as it be he expand he eye into stewpan but upon examine the strange substance he decide that this must be a species of super-fine flower such as be compound into he master 's _ duff _ and other dainty in vain do a experienced natural philosopher belong to the fore-top maintain before he face that in this hypothesis wooloo be mistaken wooloo 's opinion remain unchanged for some time as for the hailstone they transport he he go about with a bucket make collection and receive contribution for the purpose of carry they home to he sweetheart for glass bead but have put he bucket away and return to it again and find nothing but a little water he accuse the by-stander of steal he precious stone this suggest another story concern he the first time he be give a piece of duff to eat he be observe to pick out very carefully every raisin and throw it away with a gesture indicative of the highest disgust it turn out that he have take the raisin for bug in we man-of-war this semi-savage wander about the gun-deck in he barbaric robe seem a be from some other sphere he taste be we abomination : ours he we creed he reject : he we we think he a loon : he fancy we fool have the case be reverse have we be polynesian and he a american we mutual opinion of each other would still have remain the same a fact prove that neither be wrong but both right chapter xxix the night-watch though leave the cape behind we the severe cold still continue and one of its worst consequence be the almost incurable drowsiness induce thereby during the long night-watch all along the deck huddle between the gun stretch out on the carronade slide and in every accessible nook and corner you would see the sailor wrap in they monkey jacket in a state of half-conscious torpidity lie still and freezing alive without the power to rise and shake themselves up -- up you lazy dog we good-natured third lieutenant a virginian would cry rap they with he speak trumpet get up and stir about but in vain they would rise for a instant and as soon as he back be turn down they would drop as if shoot through the heart often i have lie thus when the fact that if i lay much longer i would actually freeze to death would come over I with such overpowering force as to break the icy spell and start to my foot i would endeavor to go through the combined manual and pedal exercise to restore the circulation the first fling of my benumbed arm generally strike I in the face instead of smite my chest its true destination but in these case one 's muscle have they own way in exercise my other extremity i be oblige to hold on to something and leap with both foot for my limb seem as destitute of joint as a pair of canvas pants spread to dry and frozen stiff when a order be give to haul the brace -- which require the strength of the entire watch some two hundred man -- a spectator would have suppose that all hand have receive a stroke of the palsy rouse from they state of enchantment they come halt and limp across the deck fall against each other and for a few moment almost unable to handle the rope the slightest exertion seem intolerable and frequently a body of eighty or a hundred man summon to brace the main-yard would hang over the rope for several minute wait for some active fellow to pick it up and put it into they hand even then it be some time before they be able to do anything they make all the motion usual in haul a rope but it be a long time before the yard budge a inch it be to no purpose that the officer swear at they or send the midshipman among they to find out who those _ horse-marine _ and _ soger _ be the sailor be so envelop in monkey jacket that in the dark night there be no tell one from the other here _ you _ sir cry little mr pert eagerly catch hold of the skirt of a old sea-dog and try to turn he round so as to peer under he tarpaulin who be _ you _ sir what be you name find out milk-and-water be the impertinent rejoinder blast you you old rascal i 'll have you lick for that tell I he name some of you turn round to the bystander gammon cry a voice at a distance hang I but i know _ you _ sir and here be at you and so say mr pert drop the impenetrable unknown and make into the crowd after the bodiless voice but the attempt to find a owner for that voice be quite as idle as the effort to discover the contents of the monkey jacket and here sorrowful mention must be make of something which during this state of affair most sorely afflict I most monkey jacket be of a dark hue mine as i have fifty time repeat and say again be white and thus in those long dark night when it be my quarter-watch on deck and not in the top and other go skulk and soger about the deck secure from detection -- they identity undiscoverable -- my own hapless jacket for ever proclaim the name of its wearer it give I many a hard job which otherwise i should have escape when a officer want a man for any particular duty -- run aloft say to communicate some slight order to the captain of the top -- how easy in that mob of incognito to individualise _ that white jacket _ and dispatch he on the errand then it would never do for I to hang back when the rope be be pull indeed upon all these occasion such alacrity and cheerfulness be i oblige to display that i be frequently hold up as a illustrious example of activity which the rest be call upon to emulate pull -- pull you lazy lubber look at white-jacket there pull like he oh how i execrated my luckless garment how often i scour the deck with it to give it a tawny hue how often i supplicate the inexorable brush captain of the paint-room for just one brushful of he invaluable pigment frequently i meditate give it a toss overboard but i have not the resolution jacketless at sea jacketless so near cape horn the thought be unendurable and at least my garment be a jacket in name if not in utility at length i essayed a swap here bob say i assume all possible suavity and accost a mess-mate with a sort of diplomatic assumption of superiority suppose i be ready to part with this ` grego ' of mine and take yours in exchange -- what would you give I to boot give you to _ boot _ he exclaim with horror i would not take you infernal jacket for a gift how i hail every snow-squall for then -- blessing on they -- many of the man become _ white-jacket _ along with myself and powdered with the flake we all look like miller we have six lieutenant all of whom with the exception of the first lieutenant by turn head the watch three of these officer include mad jack be strict disciplinarian and never permit we to lay down on deck during the night and to tell the truth though it cause much growl it be far better for we health to be thus keep on we foot so promenade be all the vogue for some of we however it be like pacing in a dungeon for as we have to keep at we station -- some at the halyard some at the brace and elsewhere -- and be not allow to stroll about indefinitely and fairly take the measure of the ship 's entire keel we be fain to confine ourselves to the space of a very few foot but the worse of this be soon over the suddenness of the change in the temperature consequent on leave cape horn and steering to the northward with a ten-knot breeze be a noteworthy thing to-day you be assail by a blast that seem to have edge itself on iceberg but in a little more than a week you jacket may be superfluous one word more about cape horn and we have do with it year hence when a ship-canal shall have penetrate the isthmus of darien and the traveller be take he seat in the ear at cape cod for astorium it will be hold a thing almost incredible that for so long a period vessel bind to the nor ' - west coast from new york should by go round cape horn have lengthen they voyage some thousand of mile in those unenlightened day -lrb- i quote in advance the language of some future philosopher -rrb- entire year be frequently consume in make the voyage to and from the spice island the present fashionable watering-place of the beau-monde of oregon such must be we national progress why sir that boy of yours will one of these day be send you grandson to the salubrious city of jeddo to spend he summer vacation chapter xxx a peep through a port-hole at the subterranean part of a man-of-war while now run rapidly away from the bitter coast of patagonium battle with the night-watch -- still cold -- as best we may come under the lee of my white-jacket reader while i tell of the less painful sight to be see in a frigate a hint have already be convey concern the subterranean depths of the neversink 's hold but there be no time here to speak of the _ spirit-room _ a cellar down in the after-hold where the sailor 's grog be keep nor of the _ cabletier _ where the great hawser and chain be pile as you see they at a large ship-chandler 's on shore nor of the grocer 's vault where tierce of sugar molasses vinegar rice and flour be snugly stow nor of the _ sail-room _ full as a sail-maker 's loft ashore -- pile up with great top-sail and top-gallant-sail all ready-folded in they place like so many white vest in a gentleman 's wardrobe nor of the copper and copper-fastened _ magazine _ closely pack with keg of powder great-gun and small-arm cartridge nor of the immense _ shot-locker _ or subterranean arsenal full as a bushel of apple with twenty-four-pound ball nor of the _ bread-room _ a large apartment tin all round within to keep out the mouse where the hard biscuit destine for the consumption of five hundred man on a long voyage be stow away by the cubic yard nor of the vast iron tank for fresh water in the hold like the reservoir lake at fairmount in philadelphium nor of the _ paint-room _ where the keg of white-lead and cask of linseed oil and all sort of pot and brush be keep nor of the _ armoror 's smithy _ where the ship 's forge and anvil may be hear ring at time i say i have no time to speak of these thing and many more place of note but there be one very extensive warehouse among the rest that need special mention -- _ the ship 's yeoman 's storeroom _ in the neversink it be down in the ship 's basement beneath the berth-deck and you go to it by way of the _ fore-passage _ a very dim devious corridor indeed enter -- say at noonday -- you find yourself in a gloomy apartment light by a solitary lamp on one side be shelf fill with ball of _ marline ratlin-stuf seizing-stuff spun-yarn _ and numerous twine of assorted size in another direction you see large case contain heap of article remind one of a shoemaker 's furnishing-store -- wooden _ serving-mallet fid toggle _ and _ heaver : _ iron _ pricker _ and _ marling-spike _ in a third quarter you see a sort of hardware shop -- shelf pile with all manner of hook bolt nail screw and _ thimble _ and in still another direction you see a block-maker 's store heap up with lignum-vitae sheeve and wheel through low arch in the bulkhead beyond you peep in upon distant vault and catacomb obscurely light in the far end and show immense coil of new rope and other bulky article stow in tier all savor of tar but by far the most curious department of these mysterious store-room be the armoury where the spike cutlass pistol and belt form the arm of the boarder in time of action be hang against the wall and suspend in thick row from the beam overhead here too be to be see score of colt 's patent revolver which though furnish with but one tube multiply the fatal bullet as the naval cat-o ' - nine-tail with a cannibal cruelty in one blow nine time multiply a culprit 's lash so that when a sailor be order one dozen lash the sentence should read one hundred and eight all these arm be keep in the brightest order wear a fine polish and may truly be say to _ reflect _ credit on the yeoman and he mate among the lower grade of officer in a man-of-war that of yeoman be not the least important he responsibility be denote by he pay while the _ petty officer _ quarter-gunner captain of the top and other receive but fifteen and eighteen dollar a month -- but little more than a mere able seaman -- the yeoman in a american line-of-battle ship receive forty dollar and in a frigate thirty-five dollar per month he be accountable for all the article under he charge and on no account must deliver a yard of twine or a ten-penny nail to the boatswain or carpenter unless show a write requisition and order from the senior lieutenant the yeoman be to be find burrow in he underground store-room all the day long in readiness to serve licensed customer but in the counter behind which he usually stand there be no place for a till to drop the shilling in which take away not a little from the most agreeable part of a storekeeper 's duty nor among the musty old account-book in he desk where he register all expenditure of he stuff be there any cash or check book the yeoman of the neversink be a somewhat odd specimen of a troglodyte he be a little old man round-shoulder bald-headed with great goggle-eye look through portentous round spectacles which he call he _ barnacle _ he be imbue with a wonderful zeal for the naval service and seem to think that in keep he pistol and cutlass free from rust he preserve the national honor untarnished after _ general quarter _ it be amusing to watch he anxious air as the various _ petty officer _ restore to he the arm use at the martial exercise of the crew as successive bundle would be deposit on he counter he would count over the pistol and cutlass like a old housekeeper tell over she silver fork and spoon in a pantry before retire for the night and often with a sort of dark lantern in he hand he might be see poke into he furthest vault and cellar and count over he great coil of rope as if they be all jolly puncheon of old port and madeira by reason of he incessant watchfulness and unaccountable bachelor oddity it be very difficult for he to retain in he employment the various sailor who from time to time be billet with he to do the duty of subaltern in particular he be always desirous of have at least one steady faultless young man of a literary taste to keep a eye to he account-book and swab out the armoury every morning it be a odious business this to be immure all day in such a bottomless hole among tarry old rope and villainous gun and pistol it be with peculiar dread that i one day notice the goggle-eye of _ old revolver _ as they call he fasten upon I with a fatal glance of good-will and approbation he have somehow hear of my be a very learn person who could both read and write with extraordinary facility and moreover that i be a rather reserve youth who keep he modest unassuming merit in the background but though from the keen sense of my situation as a man-of-war 's - man all this about my keep myself in the _ back _ ground be true enough yet i have no idea of hide my diffident merit _ under _ ground i become alarm at the old yeoman 's goggling glance lest he should drag I down into tarry perdition in he hideous store-room but this fate be providentially avert owe to mysterious cause which i never could fathom chapter xxxi the gunner under hatch among such a crowd of marked character as be to be meet with on board we frigate many of whom move in mysterious circle beneath the lowermost deck and at long interval flit into sight like apparition and disappear again for whole week together there be some who inordinately excite my curiosity and whose name calling and precise abode i industriously seek out in order to learn something satisfactory concern they while engage in these inquiry often fruitless or but partially gratified i could not but regret that there be no public print directory for the neversink such as they have in large town contain a alphabetic list of all the crew and where they might be find also in lose myself in some remote dark corner of the bowels of the frigate in the vicinity of the various store-room shop and warehouse i much lament that no enterprising tar have yet think of compile a _ hand-book of the neversink _ so that the tourist might have a reliable guide indeed there be several part of the ship under hatch shroud in mystery and completely inaccessible to the sailor wondrous old door bar and bolt in dingy bulkhead must have open into region full of interest to a successful explorer they look like the gloomy entrance to family vault of bury dead and when i chance to see some unknown functionary insert he key and enter these inexplicable apartment with a battle-lantern as if on solemn official business i almost quake to dive in with he and satisfy myself whether these vault indeed contain the moulder relic of by-gone old commodore and post-captain but the habitation of the living commodore and captain -- they spacious and curtained cabin -- be themselves almost as seal volume and i pass they in hopeless wonderment like a peasant before a prince 's palace night and day armed sentry guard they sacred portal cutlass in hand and have i dare to cross they path i would infallibly have be cut down as if in battle thus though for a period of more than a year i be a inmate of this float box of live-oak yet there be numberless thing in it that to the last remain wrap in obscurity or concern which i could only lose myself in vague speculation i be as a roman jew of the middle age confine to the jew ' quarter of the town and forbid to stray beyond my limit or i be as a modern traveller in the same famous city force to quit it at last without gain ingress to the most mysterious haunt -- the innermost shrine of the pope and the dungeon and cell of the inquisition but among all the person and thing on board that puzzle I and fill I most with strange emotion of doubt misgiving and mystery be the gunner -- a short square grim man he hair and beard grizzled and singed as if with gunpowder he skin be of a flecky brown like the stain barrel of a fowling-piece and he hollow eye burn in he head like blue-light he it be who have access to many of those mysterious vault i have speak of often he might be see grope he way into they follow by he subaltern the old quarter-gunner as if intent upon lay a train of powder to blow up the ship i remember guy fawke and the parliament-house and make earnest inquiry whether this gunner be a roman catholic i feel relieved when inform that he be not a little circumstance which one of he _ mate _ once tell I heighten the gloomy interest with which i regard he chief he tell I that at periodical interval he master the gunner accompany by he phalanx enter into the great magazine under the gun-room of which he have sole custody and keep the key nearly as big as the key of the bastile and provide with lantern something like sir humphrey davy 's safety-lamp for coal mine proceed to turn end for end all the keg of powder and package of cartridge store in this innermost explosive vault line throughout with sheet of copper in the vestibule of the magazine against the panelling be several peg for slipper and before penetrate further than that vestibule every man of the gunner 's gang silently remove he shoe for fear that the nail in they heel might possibly create a spark by strike against the coppered floor within then with slippered foot and with hushed whisper they steal into the heart of the place this turning of the powder be to preserve its inflammability and surely it be a business full of direful interest to be bury so deep below the sun handle whole barrel of powder any one of which touch by the smallest spark be powerful enough to blow up a whole street of warehouse the gunner go by the name of _ old combustible _ though i think this a undignified name for so momentous a personage who have all we life in he hand while we lay in callao we receive from shore several barrel of powder so soon as the _ launch _ come alongside with they order be give to extinguish all light and all fire in the ship and the master-at-arms and he corporal inspect every deck to see that this order be obey a very prudent precaution no doubt but not observe at all in the turkish navy the turkish sailor will sit on they gun-carriage tranquilly smoke while keg of powder be be roll under they ignite pipe-bowl this show the great comfort there be in the doctrine of these fatalist and how such a doctrine in some thing at least relieve man from nervous anxiety but we all be fatalist at bottom nor need we so much marvel at the heroism of that army officer who challenge he personal foe to bestride a barrel of powder with he -- the match to be place between they -- and be blow up in good company for it be pretty certain that the whole earth itself be a vast hogshead full of inflammable material and which we be always bestride at the same time that all good christian believe that at any minute the last day may come and the terrible combustion of the entire planet ensue as if impress with a befitting sense of the awfulness of he call we gunner always wear a fix expression of solemnity which be heighten by he grizzled hair and beard but what impart such a sinister look to he and what work so upon my imagination concern this man be a frightful scar cross he left cheek and forehead he have be almost mortally wound they say with a sabre-cut during a frigate engagement in the last war with britain he be the most methodical exact and punctual of all the forward officer among he other duty it pertain to he while in harbor to see that at a certain hour in the evening one of the great gun be discharge from the forecastle a ceremony only observe in a flag-ship and always at the precise moment you might behold he blow he match then apply it and with that booming thunder in he ear and the smell of the powder in he hair he retire to he hammock for the night what dream he must have have the same precision be observe when order to fire a gun to _ bring to _ some ship at sea for true to they name and preserve its applicability even in time of peace all men-of-war be great bully on the high sea they domineer over the poor merchantman and with a hissing hot ball send bowling across the ocean compel they to stop they headway at pleasure it be enough to make you a man of method for life to see the gunner superintend he subaltern when prepare the main-deck battery for a great national salute while lie in harbor intelligence reach we of the lamentable casualty that befall certain high officer of state include the act secretary of the navy himself some other member of the president 's cabinet a commodore and other all engage in experiment upon a new-fangled engine of war at the same time with the receipt of this sad news order arrive to fire minute-gun for the deceased head of the naval department upon this occasion the gunner be more than usually ceremonious in see that the long twenty-fours be thoroughly load and ram down and then accurately mark with chalk so as to be discharge in undeviating rotation first from the larboard side and then from the starboard but as my ear hum and all my bone dance in I with the reverberate din and my eye and nostril be almost suffocate with the smoke and when i see this grim old gunner firing away so solemnly i think it a strange mode of honor a man 's memory who have himself be slaughter by a cannon only the smoke that after rolling in at the port-hole rapidly drift away to leeward and be lose to view seem truly emblematical touch the personage thus honor since that great non-combatant the bible assure we that we life be but a vapor that quickly passeth away chapter xxxii a dish of dunderfunk in men-of-war the space on the uppermost deck round about the main-mast be the police-office court-house and yard of execution where all charge be lodge cause try and punishment administer in frigate phrase to be _ bring up to the mast _ be equivalent to be present before the grand-jury to see whether a true bill will be find against you from the merciless inquisitorial _

hold formal communication with the captain and officer if any one have be rob if any one have be evilly entreat if any one 's character have be defame if any one have a request to present if any one have aught important for the executive of the ship to know -- straight to the main-mast he repair and stand there -- generally with he hat off -- wait the pleasure of the officer of the deck to advance and communicate with he often the most ludicrous scene occur and the most comical complaint be make one clear cold morning while we be yet run away from the cape a raw bone crack-pate down easter belong to the waist make he appearance at the mast dolefully exhibit a blacken tin pan bear a few crusty trace of some sort of a sea-pie which have be cook in it well sir what now say the lieutenant of the deck advance they steal it sir all my nice _ dunderfunk _ sir they do sir whine the down easter ruefully hold up he pan steal you _ dunderfunk _ what be that _ dunderfunk _ sir _ dunderfunk _ a cruel nice dish as ever man put into he speak out sir what be the matter my _ dunderfunk _ sir -- as elegant a dish of _ dunderfunk _ as you ever see sir -- they steal it sir go forward you rascal cry the lieutenant in a towering rage or else stop you whining tell I what be the matter why sir they ` ere two fellow dob and hodnose steal my _ dunderfunk _ once more sir i ask what that _ dundledunk _ be speak as cruel a nice -- be off sir sheer and mutter something about _ non compo menti _ the lieutenant stalk away while the down easter beat a melancholy retreat hold up he pan like a tambourine and make dolorous music on it as he go where be you go with that tear in you eye like a travel rat cry a top-man oh he be go home to down east say another so far eastward you know _ shippy _ that they have to pry up the sun with a handspike to make this anecdote plainer be it say that at sea the monotonous round of salt beef and pork at the mess of the sailor -- where but very few of the variety of the season be to be find -- induce they to adopt many contrivance in order to diversify they meal hence the various sea-roll make dish and mediterranean pie well know by man-of-war 's - man -- _ scouse lob-scouse soft-tack soft-tommy skillagalee burgoo dough-boy lob-dominion dog 's - body _ and lastly and least known _ dunderfunk _ all of which come under the general denomination of _ manavalin _ _ dunderfunk _ be make of hard biscuit hash and pound mixed with beef fat molasses and water and baked brown in a pan and to those who be beyond all reach of shore delicacy this _ dunderfunk _ in the feeling language of the down easter be certainly _ a cruel nice dish _ now the only way that a sailor after prepare he _ dunderfunk _ could get it cook on board the neversink be by slily go to _ old coffee _ the ship 's cook and bribe he to put it into he oven and as some such dish or other be well know to be all the time in the oven a set of unprincipled gourmand be constantly on the look-out for the chance of steal they generally two or three league together and while one engage _ old coffee _ in some interesting conversation touch he wife and family at home another snatch the first thing he can lay hand on in the oven and rapidly pass it to the third man who at he earliest leisure disappear with it in this manner have the down easter lose he precious pie and afterward find the empty pan knock about the forecastle chapter xxxiii a flogging if you begin the day with a laugh you may nevertheless end it with a sob and a sigh among the many who be exceedingly divert with the scene between the down easter and the lieutenant none laugh more heartily than john peter mark and antone -- four sailor of the starboard-watch the same evening these four find themselves prisoner in the brig with a sentry standing over they they be charge with violate a well-known law of the ship -- have be engage in one of those tangled general fight sometimes occur among sailor they have nothing to anticipate but a flogging at the captain 's pleasure toward evening of the next day they be startle by the dread summons of the boatswain and he mate at the principal hatchway -- a summons that ever send a shudder through every manly heart in a frigate : _ all hand witness punishment ahoy _ the hoarseness of the cry its unrelenting prolongation its be catch up at different point and send through the lowermost depths of the ship all this produce a most dismal effect upon every heart not callouse by long habituation to it however much you may desire to absent yourself from the scene that ensue yet behold it you must or at least stand near it you must for the regulation enjoin the attendance of the entire ship 's company from the corpulent captain himself to the smallest boy who strike the bell _ all hand witness punishment ahoy _ to the sensitive seaman that summons sound like a doom he know that the same law which impel it -- the same law by which the culprit of the day must suffer that by that very law he also be liable at any time to be judge and condemn and the inevitableness of he own presence at the scene the strong arm that drag he in view of the scourge and hold he there till all be over force upon he loathing eye and soul the suffering and groan of man who have familiarly consort with he eat with he battle out watch with he -- man of he own type and badge -- all this convey a terrible hint of the omnipotent authority under which he live indeed to such a man the naval summons to witness punishment carry a thrill somewhat akin to what we may impute to the quick and the dead when they shall hear the last trump that be to bid they all arise in they rank and behold the final penalty inflict upon the sinner of we race but it must not be imagine that to all man-of-war 's - man this summons convey such poignant emotion but it be hard to decide whether one should be glad or sad that this be not the case whether it be grateful to know that so much pain be avoid or whether it be far sadder to think that either from constitutional hard-heartedness or the multiply searing of habit hundred of man-of-war 's - man have be make proof against the sense of degradation pity and shame as if in sympathy with the scene to be enact the sun which the day previous have merrily flash upon the tin pan of the disconsolate down easter be now set over the dreary water veil itself in vapor the wind blow hoarsely in the cordage the sea break heavily against the bow and the frigate stagger under whole top-sail strain as in agony on she way _ all hand witness punishment ahoy _ at the summons the crew crowd round the main-mast multitude eager to obtain a good place on the boom to overlook the scene many laughing and chat other canvass the case of the culprit some maintain sad anxious countenance or carry a suppress indignation in they eye a few purposely keep behind to avoid look on in short among five hundred man there be every possible shade of character all the officer -- midshipman include -- stand together in a group on the starboard side of the main-mast the first lieutenant in advance and the surgeon whose special duty it be to be present at such time stand close by he side presently the captain come forward from he cabin and stand in the center of this solemn group with a small paper in he hand that paper be the daily report of offence regularly lay upon he table every morning or evening like the day 's journal place by a bachelor 's napkin at breakfast master-at-arms bring up the prisoner he say a few moment elapse during which the captain now clothe in he most dreadful attribute fix he eye severely upon the crew when suddenly a lane form through the crowd of seaman and the prisoner advance -- the master-at-arms rattan in hand on one side and a armed marine on the other -- and take up they station at the mast you john you peter you mark you antone say the captain be yesterday find fight on the gun-deck have you anything to say mark and antone two steady middle-aged man whom i have often admire for they sobriety reply that they do not strike the first blow that they have submit to much before they have yield to they passion but as they acknowledge that they have at last defend themselves they excuse be overrule john -- a brutal bully who it seem be the real author of the disturbance -- be about enter into a long extenuation when he be cut short by be make to confess irrespective of circumstance that he have be in the fray peter a handsome lad about nineteen year old belong to the mizzen-top look pale and tremulous he be a great favorite in he part of the ship and especially in he own mess principally compose of lad of he own age that morning two of he young mess-mate have go to he bag take out he best clothes and obtain the permission of the marine sentry at the brig have hand they to he to be put on against be summon to the mast this be do to propitiate the captain as most captain love to see a tidy sailor but it would not do to all he supplication the captain turn a deaf ear peter declare that he have be strike twice before he have return a blow no matter say the captain you strike at last instead of report the case to a officer i allow no man to fight on board here but myself i do the fight now man he add you all admit the charge you know the penalty strip quarter-master be the grating rig the grating be square frame of bar wood-work sometimes place over the hatchway one of these square be now lay on the deck close to the ship 's bulwark and while the remain preparation be be make the master-at-arms assist the prisoner in remove they jacket and shirt this do they shirt be loosely throw over they shoulder at a sign from the captain john with a shameless leer advance and stand passively upon the grate while the bare-headed old quarter-master with gray hair streaming in the wind bind he foot to the cross-bar and stretch out he arm over he head secure they to the hammock-netting above he then retreat a little space standing silent meanwhile the boatswain stand solemnly on the other side with a green bag in he hand from which take four instrument of punishment he give one to each of he mate for a fresh cat apply by a fresh hand be the ceremonious privilege accord to every man-of-war culprit at another sign from the captain the master-at-arms step up remove the shirt from the prisoner at this juncture a wave break against the ship 's side and clash the spray over he expose back but though the air be pierce cold and the water drench he john stand still without a shudder the captain 's finger be now lift and the first boatswain 's - mate advance comb out the nine tail of he _ cat _ with he hand and then sweep they round he neck bring they with the whole force of he body upon the mark again and again and again and at every blow higher and higher rise the long purple bar on the prisoner 's back but he only bow over he head and stand still meantime some of the crew whisper among themselves in applause of they ship-mate 's nerve but the greater part be breathlessly silent as the keen scourge hiss through the wintry air and fall with a cut wiry sound upon the mark one dozen lash be apply the man be take down and go among the crew with a smile say d -- n I it be nothing when you be use to it who want to fight the next be antone the portuguese at every blow he surge from side to side pour out a torrent of involuntary blasphemy never before have he be hear to curse when cut down he go among the man swearing to have the life of the captain of course this be unheard by the officer mark the third prisoner only cringe and cough under he punishment he have some pulmonary complaint he be off duty for several day after the flogging but this be partly to be imputed to he extreme mental misery it be he first scourging and he feel the insult more than the injury he become silent and sullen for the rest of the cruise the fourth and last be peter the mizzen-top lad he have often boast that he have never be degrade at the gangway the day before he cheek have wear its usual red but now no ghost be whiter as he be be secure to the grating and the shuddering and creeping of he dazzlingly white back be reveal he turn round he head imploringly but he weep entreaty and vow of contrition be of no avail i would not forgive god almighty cry the captain the fourth boatswain 's - mate advance and at the first blow the boy shout _ my god oh my god _ writhe and leap so as to displace the grating and scatter the nine tail of the scourge all over he person at the next blow he howl leap and rage in unendurable torture what be you stop for boatswain 's - mate cry the captain lay on and the whole dozen be apply i do not care what happen to I now weep peter go among the crew with blood-shot eye as he put on he shirt i have be flog once and they may do it again if they will let they look for I now pipe down cry the captain and the crew slowly disperse let we have the charity to believe they -- as we do -- when some captain in the navy say that the thing of all other most repulsive to they in the routine of what they consider they duty be the administration of corporal punishment upon the crew for surely not to feel scarify to the quick at these scene would argue a man but a beast you see a human be strip like a slave scourge worse than a hound and for what for thing not essentially criminal but only make so by arbitrary law chapter xxxiv some of the evil effect of flog there be incidental consideration touch this matter of flogging which exaggerate the evil into a great enormity many illustration might be give but let we be content with a few one of the argument advance by officer of the navy in favor of corporal punishment be this : it can be inflict in a moment it consume no valuable time and when the prisoner 's shirt be put on _ that _ be the last of it whereas if another punishment be substitute it would probably occasion a great waste of time and trouble besides thereby beget in the sailor a undue idea of he importance absurd or worse than absurd as it may appear all this be true and if you start from the same premise with these officer you must admit that they advance a irresistible argument but in accordance with this principle captain in the navy to a certain extent inflict the scourge -- which be ever at hand -- for nearly all degree of transgression in offence not cognisable by a court-martial little if any discrimination be show it be of a piece with the penal law that prevail in england some sixty year ago when one hundred and sixty different offence be declare by the statute-book to be capital and the servant-maid who but pilfer a watch be hung beside the murderer of a family it be one of the most common punishment for very trivial offence in the navy to stop a seaman 's _ grog _ for a day or a week and as most seaman so cling to they _ grog _ the loss of it be generally deem by they a very serious penalty you will sometimes hear they say i would rather have my wind _ stop _ than _ my grog _ but there be some sober seaman that would much rather draw the money for it instead of the grog itself as provide by law but they be too often deter from this by the thought of receive a scourging for some inconsiderable offence as a substitute for the stop of they spirit this be a most serious obstacle to the cause of temperance in the navy but in many case even the reluctant drawing of he grog can not exempt a prudent seaman from ignominy for besides the formal administer of the _ cat _ at the gangway for petty offence he be liable to the colt or rope 's - end a bit of _ ratlin-stuff _ indiscriminately apply -- without strip the victim -- at any time and in any part of the ship at the merest wink from the captain by a express order of that officer most boatswain 's mate carry the colt coil in they hat in readiness to be administer at a minute 's warning upon any offender this be the custom in the neversink and until so recent a period as the administration of president polk when the historian bancroft secretary of the navy officially interpose it be a almost universal thing for the officer of the watch at they own discretion to inflict chastisement upon a sailor and this too in the face of the ordinance restrict the power of flog solely to captain and court martial nor be it a thing unknown for a lieutenant in a sudden outburst of passion perhaps inflamed by brandy or smart under the sense of be dislike or hate by the seaman to order a whole watch of two hundred and fifty man at dead of night to undergo the indignity of the colt it be believe that even at the present day there be instance of commander still violate the law by delegate the power of the colt to subordinate at all event it be certain that almost to a man the lieutenant in the navy bitterly rail against the officiousness of bancroft in so materially abridge they usurped function by snatch the colt from they hand at the time they predict that this rash and most ill-judged interference of the secretary would end in the break up of all discipline in the navy but it have not so prove these officer _ now _ predict that if the cat be abolish the same unfulfilled prediction would be verify concern the license with which many captain violate the express law lay down by congress for the government of the navy a glaring instance may be quote for upward of forty year there have be on the american statute-book a law prohibit a captain from inflict on he own authority more than twelve lash at one time if more be to be give the sentence must be pass by a court-martial yet for nearly half a century this law have be frequently and with almost perfect impunity set at naught : though of late through the exertion of bancroft and other it have be much better observe than formerly indeed at the present day it be generally respect still while the neversink be lie in a south american port on the cruise now write of the seaman belong to another american frigate inform we that they captain sometimes inflict upon he own authority eighteen and twenty lash it be worth while to state that this frigate be vastly admire by the shore lady for she wonderfully neat appearance one of she forecastle-men tell I that he have use up three jack-knife -lrb- charge to he on the book of the purser -rrb- in scrape the belaying-pin and the combing of the hatchway it be singular that while the lieutenant of the watch in american men-of-war so long usurp the power of inflict corporal punishment with the _ colt _ few or no similar abuse be know in the english navy and though the captain of a english armed ship be authorise to inflict at he own discretion _ more _ than a dozen lash -lrb- i think three dozen -rrb- yet it be to be doubt whether upon the whole there be as much flogging at present in the english navy as in the american the chivalric virginian john randolph of roanoke declare in he place in congress that on board of the american man-of-war that carry he out ambassador to russia he have witness more flogging than have take place on he own plantation of five hundred african slave in ten year certain it be from what i have personally see that the english officer as a general thing seem to be less dislike by they crew than the american officer by theirs the reason probably be that many of they from they station in life have be more accustomed to social command hence quarter-deck authority sit more naturally on they a coarse vulgar man who happen to rise to high naval rank by the exhibition of talent not incompatible with vulgarity invariably prove a tyrant to he crew it be a thing that american man-of-war 's - man have often observe that the lieutenant from the southern state the descendant of the old virginian be much less severe and much more gentle and gentlemanly in command than the northern officer as a class accord to the present law and usage of the navy a seaman for the most trivial allege offence of which he may be entirely innocent must without a trial undergo a penalty the trace whereof he carry to the grave for to a man-of-war 's - man 's experienced eye the mark of a naval scourging with the _ cat _ be through life discernible and with these mark on he back this image of he creator must rise at the last day yet so untouchable be true dignity that there be case wherein to be flog at the gangway be no dishonor though to abase and hurl down the last pride of some sailor who have pique he be some-time the secret motive with some malicious officer in procure he to be condemn to the lash but this feeling of the innate dignity remain untouched though outwardly the body be scar for the whole term of the natural life be one of the hushed thing bury among the holiest privacy of the soul a thing between a man 's god and himself and for ever undiscernible by we fellow-man who account _ that _ a degradation which seem so to the corporal eye but what torment must that seaman undergo who while he back bleed at the gangway bleed agonize drop of shame from he soul be we not justified in immeasurably denounce this thing join hand with I then and in the name of that be in whose image the flog sailor be make let we demand of legislator by what right they dare profane what god himself account sacred be it lawful for you to scourge a man that be a roman ask the intrepid apostle well know as a roman citizen that it be not and now eighteen hundred year after be it lawful for you my countryman to scourge a man that be a american to scourge he round the world in you frigate it be to no purpose that you apologetically appeal to the general depravity of the man-of-war 's - man depravity in the oppressed be no apology for the oppressor but rather a additional stigma to he as be in a large degree the effect and not the cause and justification of oppression chapter xxxv flogging not lawful it be next to idle at the present day merely to denounce a iniquity be ours then a different task if there be any three thing oppose to the genius of the american constitution they be these : irresponsibility in a judge unlimited discretionary authority in a executive and the union of a irresponsible judge and a unlimited executive in one person yet by virtue of a enactment of congress all the commodore in the american navy be obnoxious to these three charge so far as concern the punishment of the sailor for alleged misdemeanor not particularly set forth in the article of war here be the enactment in question xxxii _ of the article of war _ -- all crime commit by person belong to the navy which be not specify in the foregoing article shall be punish accord to the law and custom in such case at sea this be the article that above all other put the scourge into the hand of the captain call he to no account for its exercise and furnish he with a ample warrant for infliction of cruelty upon the common sailor hardly credible to landsmen by this article the captain be make a legislator as well as a judge and a executive so far as it go it absolutely leave to he discretion to decide what thing shall be consider crime and what shall be the penalty whether a accuse person have be guilty of action by he declare to be crime and how when and where the penalty shall be inflict in the american navy there be a everlasting suspension of the habeas corpus upon the bare allegation of misconduct there be no law to restrain the captain from imprison a seaman and keep he confine at he pleasure while i be in the neversink the captain of a american sloop of war from undoubted motive of personal pique keep a seaman confine in the brig for upward of a month certainly the necessity of navy warrant a code for they government more stringent than the law that govern the land but that code should conform to the spirit of the political institution of the country that ordain it it should not convert into slave some of the citizen of a nation of free-men such objection can not be urge against the law of the russian navy -lrb- not essentially different from we own -rrb- because the law of that navy create the absolute one-man power in the captain and vesting in he the authority to scourge conform in spirit to the territorial law of russium which be rule by a autocrat and whose court inflict the _ knout _ upon the subject of the land but with we it be different we institution claim to be base upon broad principle of political liberty and equality whereas it would hardly affect one iota the condition on shipboard of a american man-of-war 's - man be he transfer to the russian navy and make a subject of the czar as a sailor he share none of we civil immunity the law of we soil in no respect accompany the national float timber grow thereon and to which he cling as he home for he we revolution be in vain to he we declaration of independence be a lie it be not sufficiently bear in mind perhaps that though the naval code come under the head of the martial law yet in time of peace and in the thousand question arise between man and man on board ship this code to a certain extent may not improperly be deem municipal with its crew of 800 or 1000 man a three-decker be a city on the sea but in most of these matter between man and man the captain instead of be a magistrate dispense what the law promulgate be a absolute ruler make and unmake law as he please it will be see that the xxth of the article of war provide that if any person in the navy negligently perform the duty assign he he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge but if the offender be a private -lrb- common sailor -rrb- he may at the discretion of the captain be put in iron or flog it be needless to say that in case where a officer commit a trivial violation of this law a court-martial be seldom or never call to sit upon he trial but in the sailor 's case he be at once condemn to the lash thus one set of sea-citizen be exempt from a law that be hang in terror over other what would landsmen think be the state of new york to pass a law against some offence affix a fine as a penalty and then add to that law a section restrict its penal operation to mechanic and day laborer exempt all gentleman with a income of one thousand dollar yet thus in the spirit of its practical operation even thus stand a good part of the naval law wherein naval flogging be involve but a law should be universal and include in its possible penal operation the very judge himself who give decision upon it nay the very judge who expound it have sir william blackstone violate the law of england he would have be bring before the bar over which he have preside and would there have be try with the counsel for the crown reading to he perhaps from a copy of he own _ commentary _ and should he have be find guilty he would have suffer like the meanest subject accord to law how be it in a american frigate let one example suffice by the article of war and especially by article i a american captain may and frequently do inflict a severe and degrading punishment upon a sailor while he himself be for ever remove from the possibility of undergo the like disgrace and in all probability from undergo any punishment whatever even if guilty of the same thing -- contention with he equal for instance -- for which he punish another yet both sailor and captain be american citizen now in the language of blackstone again there be a law coeval with mankind dictate by god himself superior in obligation to any other and no human law be of any validity if contrary to this that law be the law of nature among the three great principle of which justinian include that to every man should be render he due but we have see that the law involve flogging in the navy do _ not _ render to every man he due since in some case they indirectly exclude the officer from any punishment whatever and in all case protect they from the scourge which be inflict upon the sailor therefore accord to blackstone and justinian those law have no binding force and every american man-of-war 's - man would be morally justified in resist the scourge to the uttermost and in so resist would be religiously justified in what would be judicially style the act of mutiny itself if then these scourge law be for any reason necessary make they bind upon all who of right come under they sway and let we see a honest commodore duly authorise by congress condemn to the lash a transgress captain by the side of a transgress sailor and if the commodore himself prove a transgressor let we see one of he brother commodore take up the lash against _ he _ even as the boatswain 's mate the navy executioner be often call upon to scourge each other or will you say that a navy officer be a man but that a american-born citizen whose grandsire may have ennoble he by pour out he blood at bunker hill -- will you say that by enter the service of he country as a common seaman and standing ready to fight she foe he thereby lose he manhood at the very time he most assert it will you say that by so do he degrade himself to the liability of the scourge but if he tarry ashore in time of danger he be safe from that indignity all we link state all four continent of mankind unite in denounce such a thought we plant the question then on the topmost argument of all irrespective of incidental consideration we assert that flogging in the navy be oppose to the essential dignity of man which no legislator have a right to violate that it be oppressive and glaringly unequal in its operation that it be utterly repugnant to the spirit of we democratic institution indeed that it involve a linger trait of the worst time of a barbarous feudal aristocracy in a word we denounce it as religiously morally and immutably _ wrong _ no matter then what may be the consequence of its abolition no matter if we have to dismantle we fleet and we unprotected commerce should fall a prey to the spoiler the awful admonition of justice and humanity demand that abolition without procrastination in a voice that be not to be mistaken demand that abolition today it be not a dollar-and-cent question of expediency it be a matter of _ right and wrong _ and if any man can lay he hand on he heart and solemnly say that this scourging be right let that man but once feel the lash on he own back and in he agony you will hear the apostate call the seventh heaven to witness that it be _ wrong _ and in the name of immortal manhood would to god that every man who uphold this thing be scourge at the gangway till he recant chapter xxxvi flogging not necessary but white-jacket be ready to come down from the lofty mast-head of a eternal principle and fight you -- commodore and captain of the navy -- on you own quarter-deck with you own weapon at you own pace exempt yourselve from the lash you take bible oath to it that it be indispensable for other you swear that without the lash no armed ship can be keep in suitable discipline be it prove to you officer and stamp upon you forehead that herein you be utterly wrong send they to collingwood say lord nelson and _ he _ will bring they to order this be the language of that renowned admiral when he officer report to he certain seaman of the fleet as wholly ungovernable send they to collingwood and who be collingwood that after these navy rebel have be imprison and scourge without be bring to order collingwood could convert they to docility who admiral collinngwood be as a historical hero history herself will tell you nor in whatever triumphal hall they may be hang will the capture flag of trafalgar fail to rustle at the mention of that name but what collingwood be as a disciplinarian on board the ship he command perhaps need to be say he be a officer then who hold in abhorrence all corporal punishment who though see more active service than any sea-officer of he time yet for year together govern he man without inflict the lash but these seaman of he must have be most exemplary saint to have prove docile under so lenient a sway be they saint answer ye jail and alms-house throughout the length and breadth of great britain which in collingwood 's time be sweep clean of the last linger villain and pauper to man he majesty 's fleet still more _ that _ be a period when the uttermost resource of england be tax to the quick when the mast of she multiply fleet almost transplant she forest all stand to the sea when british press-gang not only board foreign ship on the high sea and board foreign pier-head but board they own merchantman at the mouth of the thame and board the very fire-sides along its bank when englishman be knock down and drag into the navy like cattle into the slaughter-house with every mortal provocation to a mad desperation against the service that thus run they unwilling head into the muzzle of the enemy 's cannon _ this _ be the time and _ these _ the man that collingwood govern without the lash i know it have be say that lord collingwood begin by inflict severe punishment and afterward rule he sailor by the mere memory of a by-gone terror which he could at pleasure revive and that he sailor know this and hence they good behavior under a lenient sway but grant the quote assertion to be true how come it that many american captain who after inflict as severe punishment as ever collingwood could have authorize -- how come it that _ they _ also have not be able to maintain good order without subsequent flogging after once show to the crew with what terrible attribute they be invest but it be notorious and a thing that i myself in several instance _ know _ to have be the case that in the american navy where corporal punishment have be most severe it have also be most frequent but it be incredible that with such crew as lord collingwood 's -- compose in part of the most desperate character the raking of the jail -- it be incredible that such a set of man could have be govern by the mere _ memory _ of the lash some other influence must have be bring to bear mainly no doubt the influence work by a powerful brain and a determine intrepid spirit over a miscellaneous rabble it be well know that lord nelson himself in point of policy be averse to flogging and that too when he have witness the mutinous effect of government abuse in the navy -- unknown in we time -- and which to the terror of all england develop themselves at the great mutiny of the nore : a outbreak that for several week jeopardise the very existence of the british navy but we may press this thing nearly two century further back for it be a matter of historical doubt whether in robert blake 's time cromwell 's great admiral such a thing as flogging be know at the gangway of he victorious fleet and as in this matter we can not go further back than to blake so we can not advance further than to we own time which show commodore stockton during the recent war with mexico govern the american squadron in the pacific without employ the scourge but if of three famous english admiral one have abhor flog another almost govern he ship without it and to the third it may be suppose to have be unknown while a american commander have within the present year almost be enable to sustain the good discipline of a entire squadron in time of war without have a instrument of scourge on board what inevitable inference must be draw and how disastrous to the mental character of all advocate of navy flogging who may happen to be navy officer themselves it can not have escape the discernment of any observer of mankind that in the presence of its conventional inferior conscious imbecility in power often seek to carry off that imbecility by assumption of lordly severity the amount of flog on board a american man-of-war be in many case in exact proportion to the professional and intellectual incapacity of she officer to command thus in these case the law that authorise flogging do but put a scourge into the hand of a fool in most calamitous instance this have be show it be a matter of record that some english ship of war have fall a prey to the enemy through the insubordination of the crew induce by the witless cruelty of they officer officer so arm by the law that they could inflict that cruelty without restraint nor have there be want instance where the seaman have run away with they ship as in the case of the hermione and dana and forever rid themselves of the outrageous infliction of they officer by sacrifice they life to they fury event like these arouse the attention of the british public at the time but it be a tender theme the public agitation of which the government be anxious to suppress nevertheless whenever the thing be privately discuss these terrific mutiny together with the then prevail insubordination of the man in the navy be almost universally attribute to the exasperating system of flogging and the necessity for flog be generally believe to be directly referable to the impressment of such crowd of dissatisfied man and in high quarter it be hold that if by any mode the english fleet could be man without resource to coercive measure then the necessity of flog would cease if we abolish either impressment or flog the abolition of the other will follow as a matter of course this be the language of the _ edinburgh review _ at a still later period 1824 if then the necessity of flogging in the british armed marine be solely attribute to the impressment of the seaman what faintest shadow of reason be there for the continuance of this barbarity in the american service which be wholly free from the reproach of impressment it be true that during a long period of non-impressment and even down to the present day flogging have be and still be the law of the english navy but in thing of this kind england should be nothing to we except a example to be shun nor should wise legislator wholly govern themselves by precedent and conclude that since scourging have so long prevail some virtue must reside in it not so the world have arrive at a period which render it the part of wisdom to pay homage to the prospective precedent of the future in preference to those of the past the past be dead and have no resurrection but the future be endowed with such a life that it live to we even in anticipation the past be in many thing the foe of mankind the future be in all thing we friend in the past be no hope the future be both hope and fruition the past be the text-book of tyrant the future the bible of

forward not linger in the rear and impede they march with lumber baggage-wagon of old precedent _ this _ be the past but in many thing we american be drive to a rejection of the maxim of the past see

have they long _ grog fast _ break at last and that too by what seem a almost miraculous intervention it be a curious circumstance that without know the contents of the hogshead they yet seem certain that the stave encompass the thing they long for sail be now shorten we headway be stop and a cutter be lower with order to tow the fleet of stranger alongside the man spring to they oar with a will and soon five goodly puncheon lay wallow in the sea just under the main-chain we get overboard the sling and hoist they out of the water it be a sight that bacchus and he bacchanal would have gloat over each puncheon be of a deep-green color so cover with minute barnacle and shell-fish and streaming with sea-weed that it need long search to find out they bung-hole they look like venerable old _ loggerhead-turtle _ how long they have be toss about and make voyage for the benefit of the flavor of they contents no one could tell in try to raft they ashore or on board of some merchant-ship they must have drift off to sea this we infer from the rope that length-wise unite they and which from one point of view make they resemble a long sea-serpent they be _ strike _ into the gun-deck where the eager crowd be keep off by sentry the cooper be call with he tool bung up and bilge free he cry in a ecstasy flourish he driver and hammer upon clear away the barnacle and moss a flat sort of shell-fish be find closely adhering like a california-shell right over one of the bung doubtless this shell-fish have there take up he quarter and throw he own body into the breach in order the better to preserve the precious contents of the cask the by-stander be breathless when at last this puncheon be cant over and a tin-pot hold to the orifice what be to come forth salt-water or wine but a rich purple tide soon settle the question and the lieutenant assign to taste it with a loud and satisfactory smack of he lip pronounce it port oporto cry mad jack and no mistake but to the surprise grief and consternation of the sailor a order now come from the quarter-deck to strike the stranger down into the main-hold this proceeding occasion all sort of censorious observation upon the captain who of course have authorise it it must be relate here that on the passage out from home the neversink have touch at madeira and there as be often the case with men-of-war the commodore and captain have lay in a goodly stock of wine for they own private table and the benefit of they foreign visitor and although the commodore be a small spare man who evidently empty but few glass yet captain claret be a portly gentleman with a crimson face whose father have fight at the battle of the brandywine and whose brother have command the well-known frigate name in honor of that engagement and he whole appearance evince that captain claret himself have fight many brandywine battle ashore in honor of he sire 's memory and command in many bloodless brandywine action at sea it be therefore with some savor of provocation that the sailor hold forth on the ungenerous conduct of captain claret in step in between they and providence as it be which by this lucky windfall they hold seem bent upon relieve they necessity while captain claret himself with a inexhaustible cellar empty he madeira decanter at he leisure but next day all hand be electrify by the old familiar sound -- so long hushed -- of the drum roll to grog after that the port be serve out twice a day till all be expend chapter xxxviii the chaplain and chapel in a man-of-war the next day be Sunday a fact set down in the almanac spite of merchant seaman 's maxim that _ there be no sunday of sounding _ _ no sunday off sounding _ indeed no sunday on shipboard you may as well say there should be no sunday in church for be not a ship model after a church have it not three spire -- three steeple yea and on the gun-deck a bell and a belfry and do not that bell merrily peal every Sunday morning to summon the crew to devotions at any rate there be sunday on board this particular frigate of ours and a clergyman also he be a slender middle-aged man of a amiable deportment and irreproachable conversation but i must say that he sermon be but ill calculate to benefit the crew he have drink at the mystic fountain of plato he head have be turn by the german and this i will say that white-jacket himself see he with coleridge 's biographium literarium in he hand fancy now this transcendental divine standing behind a gun-carriage on the main-deck and address five hundred salt-sea sinner upon the psychological phenomenon of the soul and the ontological necessity of every sailor 's save it at all hazard he enlarged upon the folly of the ancient philosopher learnedly allude to the phiedon of plato expose the folly of simplicius 's commentary on aristotle 's de coelo by array against that clever pagan author the admire tract of tertullian -- _ de prascriptionibus haereticorum _ -- and conclude by a sanscrit invocation he be particularly hard upon the gnostic and marcionite of the second century of the christian era but he never in the remotest manner attack the everyday vice of the nineteenth century as eminently illustrate in we man-of-war world concern drunkenness fight flogging and oppression -- thing expressly or impliedly prohibit by christianity -- he never say aught but the most mighty commodore and captain sit before he and in general if in a monarchy the state form the audience of the church little evangelical piety will be preach hence the harmless non-committal abstrusity of we chaplain be not to be wonder at he be no massillon to thunder forth he ecclesiastical rhetoric even when a loui le grand be enthrone among he congregation nor do the chaplain who preach on the quarter-deck of lord nelson ever allude to the guilty felix nor to delilah nor practically reason of righteousness temperance and judgment to come when that renowned admiral sit sword-belted before they during these Sunday discourse the officer always sit in a circle round the chaplain and with a business-like air steadily preserve the utmost propriety in particular we old commodore himself make a point of look intensely edified and not a sailor on board but believe that the commodore be the greatest man present must alone comprehend the mystic sentence that fall from we parson 's lip of all the noble lord in the ward-room this lord-spiritual with the exception of the purser be in the highest favor with the commodore who frequently converse with he in a close and confidential manner nor upon reflection be this to be marvel at see how efficacious in all despotic government it be for the throne and altar to go hand-in-hand the accommodation of we chapel be very poor we have nothing to sit on but the great gun-rammer and capstan-bar place horizontally upon shot-box these seat be exceedingly uncomfortable wear out we trowser and we temper and no doubt impede the con-version of many valuable soul to say the truth man-of-war 's - man in general make but poor auditor upon these occasion and adopt every possible means to elude they often the boatswain 's - mate be oblige to drive the man to service violently swearing upon these occasion as upon every other go to prayer d -- n you to prayer you rascal -- to prayer in this clerical invitation captain claret would frequently unite at this jack chase would sometimes make merry come boy do not hang back he would say come let we go hear the parson talk about he lord high admiral plato and commodore socrate but in one instance grave exception be take to this summons a remarkably serious but bigoted seaman a sheet-anchor-man -- whose private devotions may hereafter be allude to -- once touch he hat to the captain and respectfully say sir i be a baptist the chaplain be a episcopalian he form of worship be not mine i do not believe with he and it be against my conscience to be under he ministry may i be allow sir _ not _ to attend service on the half-deck you will be allow sir say the captain haughtily to obey the law of the ship if you absent yourself from prayer on Sunday morning you know the penalty accord to the article of war the captain be perfectly right but if any law require a american to attend divine service against he will be a law respect the establishment of religion then the article of war be in this one particular oppose to the american constitution which expressly say congress shall make no law respect the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof but this be only one of several thing in which the article of war be repugnant to that instrument they will be glance at in another part of the narrative the motive which prompt the introduction of chaplain into the navy can not but be warmly respond to by every christian but it do not follow that because chaplain be to be find in man-of-war that under the present system they achieve much good or that under any other they ever will how can it be expect that the religion of peace should flourish in a oaken castle of war how can it be expect that the clergyman whose pulpit be a forty-two-pounder should convert sinner to a faith that enjoin they to turn the right cheek when the left be smitten how be it to be expect that when accord to the xlii of the article of war as they now stand unrepealed on the statute-book a bounty shall be pay -lrb- to the officer and crew -rrb- by the united state government of $ 20 for each person on board any ship of a enemy which shall be sink or destroy by any united state ship and when by a subsequent section -lrb- vii -rrb- it be provide among other apportioning that the chaplain shall receive two twentieth of this price pay for sink and destroy ship full of human being i how be it to be expect that a clergyman thus provide for should prove efficacious in enlarge upon the criminality of juda who for thirty piece of silver betray he master although by the regulation of the navy each seaman 's mess on board the neversink be furnish with a bible these bible be seldom or never to be see except on Sunday morning when usage demand that they shall be exhibit by the cook of the mess when the master-at-arms go he round on the berth-deck at such time they usually surmount a highly-polished tin-pot place on the lid of the chest yet for all this the christianity of man-of-war 's man and they disposition to contribute to pious enterprise be often rely upon several time subscription papers be circulate among the crew of the neversink while in harbor under the direct patronage of the chaplain one be for the purpose of build a seaman 's chapel in china another to pay the salary of a tract-distributor in greece a third to raise a fund for the benefit of a african colonization society where the captain himself be a moral man he make a far better chaplain for he crew than any clergyman can be this be sometimes illustrate in the case of sloop of war and armed brig which be not allow a regular chaplain i have know one crew who be warmly attach to a naval commander worthy of they love who have muster even with alacrity to the call to prayer and when they captain would read the church of england service to they would present a congregation not to be surpass for earnestness and devotion by any scottish kirk it seem like family devotions where the head of the house be foremost in confess himself before he maker but we own heart be we best prayer-room and the chaplain who can most help we be ourselves chapter xxxix the frigate in harbor -- the boat -- grand state reception of the commodore in good time we be up with the parallel of rio de janeiro and stand in for the land the mist soon clear and high aloft the famed sugar loaf pinnacle be see we bowsprit point for it straight as a die as we glide on toward we anchorage the band of the various man-of-war in harbor salute we with national air and gallantly lower they ensign nothing can exceed the courteous etiquette of these ship of all nation in greet they brethren of all man you accomplish duellist be generally the most polite we lay in rio some week lazily take in store and otherwise prepare for the passage home but though rio be one of the most magnificent bay in the world though the city itself contain many striking object and though much might be say of the sugar loaf and signal hill height and the little islet of lucium and the fortify ihlum do cobra or isle of the snake -lrb- though the only anaconda and adder now find in the arsenal there be great gun and pistol -rrb- and lord wood 's nose -- a lofty eminence say by seaman to resemble he lordship 's conch-shell and the pray do flamingo -- a noble tract of beach so call from its have be the resort in olden time of those gorgeous bird and the charming bay of botofogo which spite of its name be fragrant as the neighbouring larangiero or valley of the orange and the green glorium hill surmount by the belfry of the queenly church of nossa senora de glorium and the iron-gray benedictine convent near by and the fine drive and promenade passeo publico and the massive arch-over-arch aqueduct arcos de carico and the emperor 's palace and the empress 's garden and the fine church de candelarium and the gilded throne on wheel draw by eight silken silver-belled mule in which of pleasant evening he imperial majesty be drive out of town to he moorish villa of st christova -- ay though much might be say of all this yet must i forbear if i may and adhere to my one proper object _ the world in a man-of-war _ behold now the neversink under a new aspect with all she battery she be tranquilly lie in harbor surround by english french dutch portuguese and brazilian seventy-fours moor in the deep-green water close under the lee of that oblong castellated mass of rock ilha dos cobras which with its port-hole and lofty flag-staff look like another man-of-war fast anchor in the way but what be a insular fortress indeed but a embattled land-slide into the sea from the world gibraltar and quebec and what a main-land fortress but a few deck of a line-of-battle ship transplant ashore they be all one -- all as king david man-of-war from they youth ay behold now the neversink at she anchor in many respects present a different appearance from what she present at sea nor be the routine of life on board the same at sea there be more to employ the sailor and less temptation to violation of the law whereas in port unless some particular service engage they they lead the laziest of life beset by all the allurement of the shore though perhaps that shore they may never touch unless you happen to belong to one of the numerous boat which in a man-of-war in harbor be continually ply to and from the land you be mostly throw upon you own resource to while away the time whole day frequently pass without you be individually call upon to lift a finger for though in the merchant-service they make a point of keep the man always busy about something or other yet to employ five hundred sailor when there be nothing definite to be do wholly surpass the ingenuity of any first lieutenant in the navy as mention have just be make of the numerous boat employ in harbor something more may as well be put down concern they we frigate carry a very large boat -- as big as a small sloop -- call a _ launch _ which be generally use for get off wood water and other bulky article besides this she carry four boat of a arithmetical progression in point of size -- the largest be know as the first cutter the next largest the second cutter then the third and fourth cutter she also carry a commodore 's barge a captain 's gig and a dingy a small yawl with a crew of apprentice boy all these boat except the dingy have they regular crew who be subordinate to they cockswain -- _ petty officer _ receive pay in addition to they seaman 's wages the _ launch _ be man by the old triton of the fore-castle who be no way particular about they dress while the other boat -- commission for genteeler duty -- be row by young follow mostly who have a dandy eye to they personal appearance above all the officer see to it that the commodore 's barge and the captain 's gig be man by gentlemanly youth who may do credit to they country and form agreeable object for the eye of the commodore or captain to repose upon as he tranquilly sit in the stern when pull ashore by he barge-man or gig-men as the case may be some sailor be very fond of belong to the boat and deem it a great honor to be a _ commodore 's barge-man _ but other perceive no particular distinction in that office do not court it so much on the second day after arrive at rio one of the gig-man fall sick and to my no small concern i find myself temporarily appoint to he place come white-jacket rig yourself in white -- that be the gig 's uniform to-day you be a gig-man my boy -- give ye joy this be the first announcement of the fact that i hear but soon after it be officially ratify i be about to seek the first lieutenant and plead the scantiness of my wardrobe which wholly disqualify I to fill so distinguish a station when i hear the bugler call away the gig and without more ado i slip into a clean frock which a messmate doff for my benefit and soon after find myself pull off he high mightiness the captain to a english seventy-four as we be bound along the cockswain suddenly cry oar at the word every oar be suspend in the air while we commodore 's barge float by bear that dignitary himself at the sight captain claret remove he chapeau and salute profoundly we boat lie motionless on the water but the barge never stop and the commodore make but a slight return to the obsequious salute he have receive we then resume rowing and presently i hear oar again but from another boat the second cutter which turn out to be carry a lieutenant ashore if be now captain claret 's turn to be honor the cutter lay still and the lieutenant off hat while the captain only nod and we keep on we way this naval etiquette be very much like the etiquette at the grand porte of constantinople where after wash the sublime sultan 's foot the grand vizier avenge himself on a emir who do the same office for he when we arrive aboard the english seventy-four the captain be receive with the usual honor and the gig 's crew be conduct below and hospitably regale with some spirit serve out by order of the officer of the deck soon after the english crew go to quarter and as they stand up at they gun all along the main-deck a row of beef-fed briton stalwart-looking fellow i be strike with the contrast they afford to similar sight on board of the neversink for on board of we we _ quarter _ show a array of rather slender lean-checked chap but then i make no doubt that in a sea-tussle these lantern-jawed varlet would have approve themselves as slender damascus blade nimble and flexible whereas these briton would have be perhaps as sturdy broadsword yet every one remember that story of saladin and richard try they respective blade how gallant richard cleave a anvil in twain or something quite as ponderous and saladin elegantly sever a cushion so that the two monarch be even -- each excel in he way -- though unfortunately for my simile in a patriotic point of view richard whip saladin 's army in the end there happen to be a lord on board of this ship -- the younger son of a earl they tell I he be a fine-looking fellow i chance to stand by when he put a question to a irish captain of a gum upon the seaman 's inadvertently say sir to he he lordship look dagger at the slight and the sailor touch he hat a thousand time say pardon you honor i mean to say _ my lord _ sir i be much pleased with a old white-headed musician who stand at the main hatchway with he enormous bass drum full before he and thump it sturdily to the tune of god save the king though small mercy do he have on he drum-head two little boy be clash cymbal and another be blow a fife with he cheek puff out like the plumpest of he country 's plum-pudding when we return from this trip there again take place that ceremonious reception of we captain on board the vessel he command which always have strike I as exceedingly divert in the first place while in port one of the quarter-master be always station on the poop with a spy-glass to look out for all boat approach and report the same to the officer of the deck also who it be that may be come in they so that preparation may be make accordingly as soon then as the gig touch the side a mighty shrill piping be hear as if some boy be celebrate the fourth of July with penny whistle this proceed from a boatswain 's mate who stand at the gangway be thus honor the captain 's return after he long and perilous absence the captain then slowly mount the ladder and gravely march through a lane of _ side-boy _ so call -- all in they best bib and tucker and who stand make sly face behind he back -- be receive by all the lieutenant in a body they hat in they hand and make a prodigious scrape and bow as if they have just graduate at a french dancing-school meanwhile preserve a erect inflexible and ram-rod carriage and slightly touch he chapeau the captain make he ceremonious way to the cabin disappear behind the scene like the pasteboard ghost in hamlet but these ceremony be nothing to those in homage of the commodore 's arrival even should he depart and arrive twenty time a day upon such occasion the whole marine guard except the sentry on duty be marshal on the quarter-deck present arm as the commodore pass they while they commanding officer give the military salute with he sword as if make masonic sign meanwhile the boatswain himself -- not a _ boatswain 's mate _ -- be keep up a persevere whistle with he silver pipe for the commodore be never greet with the rude whistle of a boatswain 's subaltern _ that _ would be positively insulting all the lieutenant and midshipman besides the captain himself be draw up in a phalanx and off hat together and the _ side-boy _ whose number be now increase to ten or twelve make a impose display at the gangway while the whole brass band elevated upon the poop strike up see the conquer hero come at least this be the tune that we captain always hint by a gesture to the captain of the band whenever the commodore arrive from shore it convey a complimentary appreciation on the captain 's part of the commodore 's heroism during the late war to return to the gig as i do not relish the idea of be a sort of body-servant to captain claret -- since he gig-man be often call upon to scrub he cabin floor and perform other duty for he -- i make it my particular business to get rid of my appointment in he boat as soon as possible and the next day after receive it succeed in procure a substitute who be glad of the chance to fill the position i so much undervalue and thus with we counterlike and dislike most of we man-of-war 's - man harmoniously dove-tail into each other and by we very point of opposition unite in a clever whole like the part of a chinese puzzle but as in a chinese puzzle many piece be hard to place so there be some unfortunate fellow who can never slip into they proper angle and thus the whole puzzle become a puzzle indeed which be the precise condition of the greatest puzzle in the world -- this man-of-war world itself chapter xl some of the ceremony in a man-of-war unnecessary and injurious the ceremonial of a man-of-war some of which have be describe in the precede chapter may merit a reflection or two the general usage of the american navy be found upon the usage that prevail in the navy of monarchical england more than a century ago nor have they be materially altered since and while both england and america have become greatly liberalise in the interval while shore pomp in high place have come to be regard by the more intelligent mass of man as belong to the absurd ridiculous and mock-heroic while that most truly August of all the majesty of earth the president of the united state may be see enter he residence with he umbrella under he arm and no brass band or military guard at he heel and unostentatiously take he seat by the side of the meanest citizen in a public conveyance while this be the case there still linger in american men-of-war all the stilted etiquette and childish parade of the old-fashioned spanish court of madrid indeed so far as the thing that meet the eye be concern a american commodore be by far a greater man than the president of twenty million of freeman but we plain people ashore might very willingly be content to leave these commodore in the unmolested possession of they gilded penny whistle rattle and gewgaw since they seem to take so much pleasure in they be it not that all this be attend by consequence to they subordinate in the last degree to be deplore while hardly any one will question that a naval officer should be surround by circumstance calculate to impart a requisite dignity to he position it be not the less certain that by the excessive pomp he at present maintain there be naturally and unavoidably generate a feeling of servility and debasement in the heart of most of the seaman who continually behold a fellow-mortal flourish over they head like the archangel michael with a thousand wing and as in degree this same pomp be observe toward they inferior by all the grade of commission officer even down to a midshipman the evil be proportionately multiply it would not at all diminish a proper respect for the officer and subordination to they authority among the seaman be all this idle parade -- only minister to the arrogance of the officer without at all benefit the state -- completely do away but to do so we voter and lawgiver ourselves must be no respecter of person that say about _ levelling upward and not downward _ may seem very fine to those who can not see its self-involved absurdity but the truth be that to gain the true level in some thing we _ must _ cut downward for how can you make every sailor a commodore or how raise the valley without fill they up with the superfluous top of the hill some discreet but democratic legislation in this matter be much to be desire and by bring down naval officer in these thing at least without affect they legitimate dignity and authority we shall correspondingly elevate the common sailor without relax the subordination in which he should by all means be retain chapter xli a man-of-war library nowhere do time pass more heavily than with most men-of-war 's - man on board they craft in harbor one of my principal antidote against _ ennui _ in rio be read there be a public library on board pay for by government and intrust to the custody of one of the marine corporal a little dried-up man of a somewhat literary turn he have once be a clerk in a post-office ashore and have be long accustom to hand over letter when call for he be now just the man to hand over book he keep they in a large cask on the berth-deck and when seek a particular volume have to capsize it like a barrel of potato this make he very cross and irritable as most all librarian be who have the selection of these book i do not know but some of they must have be select by we chaplain who so prance on coleridge 's _ high german horse _ mason good 's book of nature -- a very good book to be sure but not precisely adapt to tarry taste -- be one of these volume and machiavel 's art of war -- which be very dry fighting and a folio of tillotson 's sermon -- the best of reading for divine indeed but with little relish for a main-top-man and locke 's essay -- incomparable essay everybody know but miserable reading at sea and plutarch 's life -- super-excellent biography which pit greek against roman in beautiful style but then in a sailor 's estimation not to be mention with the _ life of the admiral _ and blair 's lecture university edition -- a fine treatise on rhetoric but have nothing to say about nautical phrase such as _ splicing the main-brace _ _ pass a gammon _ _ puddinge the dolphin _ and _ make a carrick-bend _ besides numerous invaluable but unreadable tome that might have be purchase cheap at the auction of some college-professor 's library but i find ample entertainment in a few choice old author whom i stumble upon in various part of the ship among the inferior officer one be _ morgan 's history of algier _ a famous old quarto abound in picturesque narrative of corsair captive dungeon and sea-fight and make mention of a cruel old dey who toward the latter part of he life be so fill with remorse for he cruelty and crime that he could not stay in bed after four o'clock in the morning but have to rise in great trepidation and walk off he bad feeling till breakfast time and another venerable octavo contain a certificate from sir christopher wren to its authenticity entitle _ knox 's captivity in ceylon 1681 _ -- abound in story about the devil who be superstitiously suppose to tyrannise over that unfortunate land : to mollify he the priest offer up buttermilk red cock and sausage and the devil run roar about in the wood frightening traveller out of they wit insomuch that the islander bitterly lament to knox that they country be full of devil and consequently there be no hope for they eventual well-being knox swear that he himself hear the devil roar though he do not see he horn it be a terrible noise he say like the baying of a hungry mastiff then there be walpole 's letter -- very witty pert and polite -- and some odd volume of play each of which be a precious casket of jewel of good thing shame the trash nowadays pass off for drama contain the jew of malta old fortunatus the city madam volpone the alchymist and other glorious old drama of the age of marlow and jonson and that literary damon and pythia the magnificent mellow old beaumont and fletcher who have send the long shadow of they reputation side by side with shakspeare 's far down the endless vale of posterity and may that shadow never be less but as for st shakspeare may he never be more lest the commentator arise and settle upon he sacred text like unto locust devour it clean up leave never a dot over a i i diversify this reading of mine by borrow moore 's _ love of the angel _ from rose-water who recommend it as _ de charmingest of volume _ and a negro song-book contain _ sittin ' on a rail _ _ gumbo squash _ and _ jim along josey _ from broadbit a sheet-anchor-man the sad taste of this old tar in admire such vulgar stuff be much denounce by rose-water whose own predilection be of a more elegant nature as evince by he exalted opinion of the literary merit of the _ love of the angel _ i be by no mean the only reader of book on board the neversink several other sailor be diligent reader though they study do not lie in the way of belles-lettres they favorite author be such as you may find at the book-stall around fulton market they be slightly physiological in they nature my book experience on board of the frigate prove a example of a fact which every book-lover must have experience before I namely that though public library have a impose air and doubtless contain invaluable volume yet somehow the book that prove most agreeable grateful and companionable be those we pick up by chance here and there those which seem put into we hand by providence those which pretend to little but abound in much chapter xlii killing time in a man-of-war in harbor reading be by no mean the only method adopt by my shipmate in while away the long tedious hour in harbor in truth many of they could not have read have they want to ever so much in early youth they primer have be sadly neglect still they have other pursuit some be expert at the needle and employ they time in make elaborate shirt stitch picturesque eagle and anchor and all the star of the federated state in the collar thereof so that when they at last complete and put on these shirt they may be say to have hoist the american color other excel in _ tattoo _ or _ prick _ as it be call in a man-of-war of these pricker two have long be celebrate in they way as consummate master of the art each have a small box full of tool and color matter and they charge so high for they service that at the end of the cruise they be suppose to have clear upward of four hundred dollar they would _ prick _ you to order a palm-tree or a anchor a crucifix a lady a lion a eagle or anything else you might want the roman catholic sailor on board have at least the crucifix prick on they arm and for this reason : if they chance to die in a catholic land they would be sure of a decent burial in consecrated ground as the priest would be sure to observe the symbol of mother church on they person they would not fare as protestant sailor die in callao who be shove under the sand of st lorenzo a solitary volcanic island in the harbor overrun with rep-tile they heretical body not be permit to repose in the more genial loam of lima and many sailor not catholic be anxious to have the crucifix paint on they owe to a curious superstition of theirs they affirm -- some of they -- that if you have that mark tattoo upon all four limb you might fall overboard among seven hundred and seventy-five thousand white shark all dinnerless and not one of they would so much as dare to smell at you little finger we have one fore-top-man on board who during the entire cruise be have a endless cable _ prick _ round and round he waist so that when he frock be off he look like a capstan with a hawser coil round about it this fore-top-man pay eighteen penny per link for the cable besides be on the smart the whole cruise suffer the effect of he repeated puncturing so he pay very dear for he cable one other mode of pass time while in port be clean and polish you _ bright-work _ for it must be know that in men-of-war every sailor have some brass or steel of one kind or other to keep in high order -- like housemaid whose business it be to keep well-polished the knob on the front door railing and the parlour-grate except the ring-bolts eye-bolt and belaying-pin scatter about the deck this bright-work as it be call be principally about the gun embrace the _ monkey-tail _ of the carronade the screw _ pricker _ little iron and other thing the portion that fall to my own share i keep in superior order quite equal in polish to roger 's best cutlery i receive the most extravagant encomium from the officer one of whom offer to match I against any brazier or brass-polisher in she british majesty 's navy indeed i devoted myself to the work body and soul and think no pain too painful and no labor too laborious to achieve the highest attainable polish possible for we poor lose son of adam to reach upon one occasion even when woollen rag be scarce and no burned-brick be to be have from the ship 's yeoman i sacrifice the corner of my woollen shirt and use some dentrifice i have as substitute for the rag and burned-brick the dentrifice operate delightfully and make the threading of my carronade screw shine and grin again like a set of false tooth in a eager heiress-hunter 's mouth still another mode of pass time be array yourself in you best _ tog _ and promenade up and down the gun-deck admire the shore scenery from the port-hole which in a amphitheatrical bay like rio -- belt about by the most varied and charming scenery of hill dale moss meadow court castle tower grove vine vineyard aqueduct palace square island fort -- be very much like lounge round a circular cosmorama and ever and anon lazily peep through the glass here and there oh there be something worth live for even in we man-of-war world and one glimpse of a bower of grape though a cable 's length off be almost satisfaction for dine off a shank-bone salt down this promenade be chiefly patronise by the marine and particularly by colbrook a remarkably handsome and very gentlemanly corporal among they he be a complete lady 's man with fine black eye bright red cheek glossy jet whisker and a refined organization of the whole man he use to array himself in he regimental and saunter about like a officer of the coldstream guard stroll down to he club in st jame 's every time he pass I he would heave a sentimental sigh and hum to himself _ the girl i leave behind I _ this fine corporal afterward become a representative in the legislature of the state of new jersey for i see he name return about a year after my return home but after all there be not much room while in port for promenade at least on the gun-deck for the whole larboard side be keep clear for the benefit of the officer who appreciate the advantage of have a clear stroll fore and aft and they well know that the sailor have much better be crowd together on the other side than that the set of they own coat-tail should be impair by brushing against they tarry trowser one other way of kill time while in port be play checkers that be when it be permit for it be not every navy captain who will allow such a scandalous proceeding but as for captain claret though he _ do _ like he glass of madeira uncommonly well and be a undoubted descendant from the hero of the battle of the brandywine and though he sometimes show a suspiciously flushed face when superintend in person the flogging of a sailor for get intoxicate against he particular order yet i will say for captain claret that upon the whole he be rather indulgent to he crew so long as they be perfectly docile he allow they to play checkers as much as they please more than once i have know he when go forward to the forecastle pick he way carefully among score of canvas checker-cloth spread upon the deck so as not to tread upon the man -- the checker-man and man-of-war 's - man include but in a certain sense they be both one for as the sailor use they checker-man so at quarter they officer use these man-of-war 's man but captain claret 's leniency in permit checkers on board he ship might have arise from the follow little circumstance confidentially communicate to I soon after the ship have sail from home checkers be prohibit whereupon the sailor be exasperate against the captain and one night when he be walk round the forecastle bim come a iron belaying-pin past he ear and while he be dodge that bim come another from the other side so that it be a very dark night and nobody to be see and it be impossible to find out the trespasser he think it best to get back into he cabin as soon as possible some time after -- just as if the belaying-pin have nothing to do with it -- it be indirectly rumor that the checker-board might be bring out again which -- as a philosophical shipmate observe -- show that captain claret be a man of a ready understanding and could understand a hint as well as any other man even when convey by several pound of iron some of the sailor be very precise about they checker-cloth and even go so far that they would not let you play with they unless you first wash you hand especially if so be you have just come from tar down the rig another way of beguile the tedious hour be to get a cosy seat somewhere and fall into as snug a little reverie as you can or if a seat be not to be have -- which be frequently the case -- then get a tolerably comfortable _ stand-up _ against the bulwark and begin to think about home and bread and butter -- always inseparably connect to a wanderer -- which will very soon bring delicious tear into you eye for every one know what a luxury be grief when you can get a private closet to enjoy it in and no paul pry intrude several of my shore friend indeed when suddenly overwhelm by some disaster always make a point of fly to the first oyster-cellar and shut themselves up in a box with nothing but a plate of stewed oyster some cracker the castor and a decanter of old port still another way of kill time in harbor be to lean over the bulwark and speculate upon where under the sun you be go to be that day next year which be a subject full of interest to every living soul so much so that there be a particular day of a particular month of the year which from my earliest recollection i have always keep the run of so that i can even now tell just where i be on that identical day of every year past since i be twelve year old and when i be all alone to run over this almanac in my mind be almost as entertaining as to read you own diary and far more interesting than to peruse a table of logarithm on a rainy afternoon i always keep the anniversary of that day with lamb and pea and a pint of sherry for it come in spring but when it come round in the neversink i could get neither lamb pea nor sherry but perhaps the best way to drive the hour before you four-in-hand be to select a soft plank on the gun-deck and go to sleep a fine specific which seldom fail unless to be sure you have be sleep all the twenty-four hour beforehand whenever employ in kill time in harbor i have lift myself up on my elbow and look around I and see so many of my shipmate all employ at the same common business all under lock and key all hopeless prisoner like myself all under martial law all dieting on salt beef and biscuit all in one uniform all yawn gaping and stretch in concert it be then that i use to feel a certain love and affection for they ground doubtless on a fellow-feeling and though in a previous part of this narrative i have mention that i use to hold myself somewhat aloof from the mass of seaman on board the neversink and though this be true and my real acquaintance be comparatively few and my intimate still fewer yet to tell the truth it be quite impossible to live so long with five hundred of you fellow-being even if not of the best family in the land and with moral that would not be spoil by further cultivation it be quite impossible i say to live with five hundred of you fellow-being be they who they may without feel a common sympathy with they at the time and ever after cherish some sort of interest in they welfare the truth of this be curiously corroborate by a rather equivocal acquaintance of mine who among the man go by the name of _ shaking _ he belong to the fore-hold whence of a dark night he would sometimes emerge to chat with the sailor on deck i never like the man 's look i protest it be a mere accident that give I the honor of he acquaintance and generally i do my best to avoid he when he would come skulk like a jail-bird out of he den into the liberal open air of the sky nevertheless the anecdote this _ holder _ tell I be well worth preserve more especially the extraordinary frankness evince in he narrate such a thing to a comparative stranger the substance of he story be as follow : shaking it seem have once be a convict in the new york state 's prison at sing sing where he have be for year confine for a crime which he give I he solemn word of honor he be wholly innocent of he tell I that after he term have expire and he go out into the world again he never could stumble upon any of he old sing sing associate without drop into a public house and talk over old time and when fortune would go hard with he and he feel out of sort and incense at matter and thing in general he tell I that at such time he almost wish he be back again in sing sing where he be relieve from all anxiety about what he should eat and drink and be support like the president of the united state and prince albert at the public charge he use to have such a snug little cell he say all to himself and never feel afraid of house-breaker for the wall be uncommonly thick and he door be securely bolt for he and a watchman be all the time walk up and down in the passage while he himself be fast asleep and dream to this in substance the _ holder _ add that he narrate this anecdote because he think it applicable to a man-of-war which he scandalously assert to be a sort of state prison afloat concern the curious disposition to fraternise and be sociable which this shaking mention as characteristic of the convict liberate from he old homestead at sing sing it may well be ask whether it may not prove to be some feeling somehow akin to the reminiscent impulse which influence they that shall hereafter fraternally reunite all we mortal when we shall have exchange this state 's prison man-of-war world of ours for another and a better from the foregoing account of the great difficulty we have in kill time while in port it must not be infer that on board of the neversink in rio there be literally no work to be do at long interval the _ launch _ would come alongside with water-cask to be empty into iron tank in the hold in this way nearly fifty thousand gallon as chronicle in the book of the master 's mate be decant into the ship 's bowels -- a ninety day 's allowance with this huge lake ontario in we the mighty neversink might be say to resemble the unite continent of the eastern hemisphere -- float in a vast ocean herself and have a mediterranean float in she chapter xliii smuggling in a man-of-war it be in a good degree owe to the idleness just describe that while lie in harbor the man-of-war 's - man be expose to the most temptation and get into he saddest scrape for though he vessel be anchor a mile from the shore and she side be patrol by sentry night and day yet these thing can not entirely prevent the seduction of the land from reach he the prime agent in work he calamity in port be he old arch-enemy the ever-devilish god of grog immure as the man-of-war 's - man be serve out he weary three year in a sort of sea-newgate from which he can not escape either by the roof or burrow underground he too often fly to the bottle to seek relief from the intolerable ennui of nothing to do and nowhere to go he ordinary government allowance of spirit one gill per diem be not enough to give a sufficient to he listless sens he pronounce he grog basely _ water _ he scout at it as _ thinner than muslin _ he crave a more vigorous _ nip at the cable _ a more sturdy _ swig at the halyard _ and if opium be to be have many would steep themselves a thousand fathom down in the densest fume of that oblivious drug tell he that the delirium tremen and the mania-a-potu lie in ambush for drunkard he will say to you let they bear down upon I then before the wind anything that smack of life be better than to feel davy jone 's chest-lid on you nose he be reckless as a avalanche and though he fall destroy himself and other yet a ruinous commotion be better than be freeze fast in unendurable solitude no wonder then that he go all length to procure the thing he crave no wonder that he pay the most exorbitant price break through all law and brave the ignominious lash itself rather than be deprive of he stimulus now concern no one thing in a man-of-war be the regulation more severe than respect the smuggling of grog and be find intoxicate for either offence there be but one penalty invariably enforce and that be the degradation of the gangway all conceivable precaution be take by most frigate-executive to guard against the secret admission of spirit into the vessel in the first place no shore-boat whatever be allow to approach a man-of-war in a foreign harbor without permission from the officer of the deck even the _ bum-boat _ the small craft license by the officer to bring off fruit for the sailor to be buy out of they own money -- these be invariably inspect before permit to hold intercourse with the ship 's company and not only this but every one of the numerous ship 's boat -- keep almost continually ply to and from the shore -- be similarly inspect sometimes each boat twenty time in the day this inspection be thus perform : the boat be descry by the quarter-master from the poop she be report to the deck officer who thereupon summons the master-at-arms the ship 's chief of police this functionary now station himself at the gangway and as the boat 's crew one by one come up the side he personally overhaul they make they take off they hat and then place both hand upon they head draw he palm slowly down to they foot carefully feel all unusual protuberance if nothing suspicious be feel the man be let pass and so on till the whole boat 's crew average about sixteen man be examine the chief of police then descend into the boat and walk from stem to stern eye it all over and poke he long rattan into every nook and cranny this operation conclude and nothing find he mount the ladder touch he hat to the deck-officer and report the boat _ clean _ whereupon she be haul out to the boom thus it will be see that not a man of the ship 's company ever enter the vessel from shore without it be render next to impossible apparently that he should have succeed in smuggling anything those individual who be permit to board the ship without undergo this ordeal be only person whom it would be preposterous to search -- such as the commodore himself the captain lieutenant etc and gentleman and lady come as visitor for anything to be clandestinely thrust through the lower port-hole at night be render very difficult from the watchfulness of the quarter-master in hail all boat that approach long before they draw alongside and the vigilance of the sentry post on platform overhang the water whose order be to fire into a strange boat which after be warn to withdraw should still persist in draw nigh moreover thirty-two-pound shot be sling to rope and suspend over the bow to drop a hole into and sink any small craft which spite of all precaution by strategy should succeed in get under the bow with liquor by night indeed the whole power of martial law be enlist in this matter and every one of the numerous officer of the ship besides he general zeal in enforce the regulation acid to that a personal feeling since the sobriety of the man abridge he own care and anxiety how then it will be ask in the face of a argus-eyed police and in defiance even of bayonet and bullet do man-of-war 's - man contrive to smuggle they spirit not to enlarge upon minor stratagem -- every few day detect and render naught -lrb- such as roll up in a handkerchief a long slender skin of grog like a sausage and in that manner ascend to the deck out of a boat just from shore or openly bring on board cocoa-nut and melon procure from a knavish bum-boat fill with spirit instead of milk or water -rrb- -- we will only mention here two or three other mode come under my own observation while in rio a fore-top-man belong to the second cutter pay down the money and make a arrangement with a person encounter at the palace-landing ashore to the following effect of a certain moonless night he be to bring off three gallon of spirit _ in skin _ and moor they to the frigate 's anchor-buoy -- some distance from the vessel -- attach something heavy to sink they out of sight in the middle watch of the night the fore-top-man slip out of he hammock and by creep along in the shadow elude the vigilance of the master-at-arms and he mate gain a port-hole and softly lower himself into the water almost without create a ripple -- the sentry march to and fro on they overhang platform above he he be a expert swimmer and paddle along under the surface every now and then rise a little and lie motionless on he back to breathe -- little but he nose expose the buoy gain he cut the skin adrift tie they round he body and in the same adroit manner make good he return this feat be very seldom attempt for it need the utmost caution address and dexterity and no one but a super-expert burglar and faultless leander of a swimmer could achieve it from the greater privilege which they enjoy the _ forward officer _ that be the gunner boatswain etc have much greater opportunity for successful smuggling than the common seaman come alongside one night in a cutter yarn we boatswain in some inexplicable way contrived to slip several skin of brandy through the air-port of he own state-room the feat however must have be perceive by one of the boat 's crew who immediately on gain the deck spring down the ladder steal into the boatswain 's room and make away with the prize not three minute before the rightful owner enter to claim it though from certain circumstance the thief be know to the aggrieved party yet the latter could say nothing since he himself have infringe the law but the next day in the capacity of captain of the ship 's executioner yarn have the satisfaction -lrb- it be so to he -rrb- of stand over the robber at the gangway for be find intoxicate with the very liquor the boatswain himself have smuggle the man have be condemn to a flogging this recall another instance still more illustrative of the knotted trebly intertwisted villainy accumulate at a sort of compound interest in a man-of-war the cockswain of the commodore 's barge take he crew apart one by one and cautiously sound they as to they fidelity -- not to the united state of america but to himself three individual whom he deem doubtful -- that be faithful to the united state of america -- he procure to be discharge from the barge and man of he own selection be substitute for he be always a influential character this cockswain of the commodore 's barge previous to this however he have see to it well that no temperance man -- that be sailor who do not draw they government ration of grog but take the money for it -- he have see to it that none of these _ balker _ be number among he crew have now prove he man he divulge he plan to the assemble body a solemn oath of secrecy be obtain and he wait the first fit opportunity to carry into execution he nefarious design at last it come one afternoon the barge carry the commodore across the bay to a fine water-side settlement of nobleman 's seat call praya grande the commodore be visit a portuguese marquis and the pair linger long over they dinner in a arbor in the garden meanwhile the cockswain have liberty to roam about where he please he search out a place where some choice _ red-eye _ -lrb- brandy -rrb- be to be have purchase six large bottle and conceal they among the tree under the pretence of fill the boat-keg with water which be always keep in the barge to refresh the crew he now carry it off into the grove knock out the head put the bottle inside rehead the keg fill it with water carry it down to the boat and audaciously restore it to its conspicuous position in the middle with its bung-hole up when the commodore come down to the beach and they pull off for the ship the cockswain in a loud voice command the nearest man to take that bung out of the keg -- that precious water will spoil arrive alongside the frigate the boat 's crew be overhaul as usual at the gangway and nothing be find on they be pass the master-at-arms now descend into the barge and finding nothing suspicious report it _ clean _ have put he finger into the open bung of the keg and taste that the water be pure the barge be order out to the boom and deep night be wait for ere the cockswain essay to snatch the bottle from the keg but unfortunately for the success of this masterly smuggler one of he crew be a weak-pated fellow who have drink somewhat freely ashore go about the gun-deck throw out profound tipsy hint concern some unutterable proceeding on the ship 's anvil a know old sheet-anchor-man a unprincipled fellow put this that and the other together ferret out the mystery and straightway resolve to reap the goodly harvest which the cockswain have sow he seek he out take he to one side and address he thus : cockswain you have be smuggling off some _ red-eye _ which at this moment be in you barge at the boom now cockswain i have station two of my mess-mate at the port-hole on that side of the ship and if they report to I that you or any of you bargeman offer to enter that barge before morning i will immediately report you as a smuggler to the officer of the deck the cockswain be astounded for to be report to the deck-officer as a smuggler would inevitably procure he a sound flogging and be the disgraceful _ break _ of he as a petty officer receive four dollar a month beyond he pay as a able seaman he attempt to bribe the other to secrecy by promising half the profit of the enterprise but the sheet-anchor-man 's integrity be like a rock he be no mercenary to be buy up for a song the cockswain therefore be force to swear that neither himself nor any of he crew shall enter the barge before morning this do the sheet-anchor-man go to he confidant and arrange he plan in a word he succeed in introduce the six brandy bottle into the ship five of which he sell at eight dollar a bottle and then with the sixth between two gun he secretly regale himself and confederate while the helpless cockswain stifle he rage bitterly eye they from afar thus though they say that there be honor among thief there be little among man-of-war smuggler chapter xliv a knave in office in a man-of-war the last smuggling story now about to be related also occur while we lay in rio it be the more particularly present since it furnish the most curious evidence of the almost incredible corruption pervade nearly all rank in some men-of-war for some day the number of intoxicated sailor collar and bring up to the mast by the master-at-arms to be report to the deck-officer -- previous to a flogging at the gangway -- have in the last degree excite the surprise and vexation of the captain and senior officer so strict be the captain 's regulation concern the suppression of grog-smuggling and so particular have he be in charge the matter upon all the lieutenant and every understrapper official in the frigate that he be wholly at a loss how so large a quantity of spirit could have be spirit into the ship in the face of all these check guard and precaution still additional step be adopt to detect the smuggler and bland the master-at-arms together with he corporal be publicly harangue at the mast by the captain in person and charge to exert they best power in suppress the traffic crowd be present at the time and see the master-at-arms touch he cap in obsequious homage as he solemnly assure the captain that he would still continue to do he best as indeed he say he have always do he conclude with a pious ejaculation expressive of he personal abhorrence of smuggling and drunkenness and he fixed resolution so help he heaven to spend he last wink in sit up by night to spy out all deed of darkness i do not doubt you master-at-arms return the captain now go to you duty this master-at-arms be a favorite of the captain 's the next morning before breakfast when the market-boat come off -lrb- that be one of the ship 's boat regularly depute to bring off the daily fresh provision for the officer -rrb- -- when this boat come off the master-at-arms as usual after carefully examine both she and she crew report they to the deck-officer to be free from suspicion the provision be then hoist out and among they come a good-sized wooden box address to mr -- purser of the united state ship neversink of course any private matter of this sort destine for a gentleman of the ward-room be sacred from examination and the master-at-arms command one of he corporal to carry it down into the purser 's state-room but recent occurrence have sharpen the vigilance of the deck-officer to a unwonted degree and see the box go down the hatchway he demand what that be and whom it be for all right sir say the master-at-arms touch he cap store for the purser sir let it remain on deck say the lieutenant mr montgomery call a midshipman ask the purser whether there be any box come off for he this morning ay ay sir say the middy touch he cap presently he return say that the purser be ashore very good then mr montgomery have that box put into the ` brig ' with strict order to the sentry not to suffer any one to touch it have i not better take it down into my mess sir till the purser come off say the master-at-arms deferentially i have give my order sir say the lieutenant turn away when the purser come on board it turn out that he know nothing at all about the box he have never so much as hear of it in he life so it be again bring up before the deck-officer who immediately summon the master-at-arms break open that box certainly sir say the master-at-arms and wrenching off the cover twenty-five brown jug like a litter of twenty-five brown pig be find snugly nestle in a bed of straw the smuggler be at work sir say the master-at-arms look up uncork and taste it say the officer the master-at-arms do so and smack he lip after a puzzle fashion be a little doubtful whether it be american whisky or holland gin but he say he be not use to liquor brandy i know it by the smell say the officer return the box to the brig ay ay sir say the master-at-arms redouble he activity the affair be at once report to the captain who incense at the audacity of the thing adopt every plan to detect the guilty party inquiry be make ashore but by whom the box have be bring down to the market-boat there be no finding out here the matter rest for a time some day after one of the boy of the mizzen-top be flog for drunkenness and while suspend in agony at the grating be make to reveal from whom he have procure he spirit the man be call and turn out to be a old superannuated marine one scrigg who do the cooking for the marine-sergeant and master-at-arms ' mess this marine be one of the most villainous-looking fellow in the ship with a squint pick-lock gray eye and hang-dog gallows gait how such a most unmartial vagabond have insinuate himself into the honorable marine corps be a perfect mystery he have always be note for he personal uncleanliness and among all hand fore and aft have the reputation of be a notorious old miser who deny himself the few comfort and many of the common necessaries of a man-of-war life see no escape scrigg fall on he knee before the captain and confess the charge of the boy observe the fellow to be in a agony of fear at the sight of the boat-swain 's mate and they lash and all the striking parade of public punishment the captain must have think this a good opportunity for completely pump he of all he secret this terrify marine be at length force to reveal he have be for some time a accomplice in a complicated system of underhand villainy the head of which be no less a personage than the indefatigable chief of police the master-at-arms himself it appear that this official have he confidential agent ashore who supply he with spirit and in various box package and bundle -- address to the purser and other -- bring they down to the frigate 's boat at the landing ordinarily the appearance of these thing for the purser and other ward-room gentleman occasion no surprise for almost every day some bundle or other be come off for they especially for the purser and as the master-at-arms be always present on these occasion it be a easy matter for he to hurry the smuggled liquor out of sight and under pretence of carry the box or bundle down to the purser 's room hide it away upon he own premise the miserly marine scrigg with the pick-lock eye be the man who clandestinely sell the spirit to the sailor thus completely keep the master-at-arms in the background the liquor sell at the most exorbitant price at one time reach twelve dollar the bottle in cash and thirty dollar a bottle in order upon the purser to be honor upon the frigate 's arrival home it may seem incredible that such price should have be give by the sailor but when some man-of-war 's - man crave liquor and it be hard to procure they would almost barter ten year of they life-time for but one solitary _ tot _ if they could the sailor who become intoxicate with the liquor thus smuggle on board by the master-at-arms be in almost numberless instance officially seize by that functionary and scourge at the gangway in a previous place it have be show how conspicuous a part the master-at-arms enact at this scene the ample profit of this iniquitous business be divide between all the party concern in it scrigg the marine come in for one third he cook 's mess-chest be bring on deck four canvas bag of silver be find in it amount to a sum something short of as many hundred dollar the guilty party be scourge double-ironed and for several week be confine in the brig under a sentry all but the master-at-arms who be merely cashiered and imprison for a time with bracelet at he wrist upon be liberate he be turn adrift among the ship 's company and by way of disgrace he still more be thrust into the _ waist _ the most inglorious division of the ship upon go to dinner one day i find he soberly seat at my own mess and at first i could not but feel some very serious scruple about dine with he nevertheless he be a man to study and digest so upon a little reflection i be not displeased at he presence it amaze I however that he have worm himself into the mess since so many of the other mess have decline the honor until at last i ascertain that he have induce a mess-mate of ours a distant relation of he to prevail upon the cook to admit he now it would not have answer for hardly any other mess in the ship to have receive this man among they for it would have tear a huge rent in they reputation but we mess a no 1 -- the forty-two-pounder club -- be compose of so fine a set of fellow so many captain of top and quarter-master -- man of undeniable mark on board ship -- of long-established standing and consideration on the gun-deck that with impunity we could do so many equivocal thing utterly inadmissible for mess of inferior pretension besides though we all abhor the monster of sin itself yet from we social superiority highly rarified education in we lofty top and large and liberal sweep of the aggregate of thing we be in a good degree free from those useless personal prejudice and galling hatred against conspicuous _ sinner _ not _ sin _ -- which so widely prevail among man of warped understanding and unchristian and uncharitable heart no the superstition and dogma concern sin have not lay they withering maxim upon we heart we perceive how that evil be but good disguised and a knave a saint in he way how that in other planet perhaps what we deem wrong may there be deem right even as some substance without undergo any mutation in themselves utterly change they color accord to the light throw upon they we perceive that the anticipated millennium must have begin upon the morning the first word be create and that take all in all we man-of-war world itself be as eligible a round-sterned craft as any to be find in the milky way and we fancy that though some of we of the gun-deck be at time condemn to suffering and blight and all manner of tribulation and anguish yet no doubt it be only we misapprehension of these thing that make we take they for woeful pain instead of the most agreeable pleasure i have dream of a sphere say pinzellum where to break a man on the wheel be hold the most exquisite of delight you can confer upon he where for one gentleman in any way to vanquish another be account a everlasting dishonor where to tumble one into a pit after death and then throw cold clod upon he upturned face be a species of contumely only inflict upon the most notorious criminal but whatever we mess-mate think in whatever circumstance we find ourselves we never forget that we frigate have as it be be homeward-bound such at least be we reverie at time though sorely jar now and then by event that take we philosophy aback for after all philosophy -- that be the best wisdom that have ever in any way be reveal to we man-of-war world -- be but a slough and a mire with a few tuft of good footing here and there but there be one man in the mess who would have naught to do with we philosophy -- a churlish ill-tempered unphilosophical superstitious old bear of a quarter-gunner a believer in tophet for which he be accordingly prepare himself priming be he name but methink i have speak of he before besides this bland the master-at-arms be no vulgar dirty knave in he -- to modify burke 's phrase -- vice _ seem _ but only seem to lose half its seeming evil by lose all its apparent grossness he be a neat and gentlemanly villain and break he biscuit with a dainty hand there be a fine polish about he whole person and a pliant insinuate style in he conversation that be socially quite irresistible save my noble captain jack chase he prove himself the most entertaining i have almost say the most companionable man in the mess nothing but he mouth that be somewhat small moorish-arched and wickedly delicate and he snaky black eye that at time shine like a dark-lantern in a jeweller-shop at midnight betoken the accomplished scoundrel within but in he conversation there be no trace of evil nothing equivocal he studiously shun a indelicacy never swear and chiefly abound in pass pun and witticism vary with humorous contrast between ship and shore life and many agreeable and racy anecdote very tastefully narrate in short -- in a merely psychological point of view at least -- he be a charming blackleg ashore such a man might have be a irreproachable mercantile swindler circulate in polite society but he be still more than this indeed i claim for this master-at-arms a lofty and honorable niche in the newgate calendar of history he intrepidity coolness and wonderful self-possession in calmly resign himself to a fate that thrust he from a office in which he have tyrannise over five hundred mortal many of whom hate and loathe he pass all belief he intrepidity i say in now fearlessly glide among they like a disarm swordfish among ferocious white-shark this surely bespoke no ordinary man while in office even he life have often be secretly attempt by the seaman whom he have bring to the gangway of dark night they have drop shoot down the hatchway destine to damage he pepper-box as they phrase it they have make rope with a hangman 's noose at the end and try to _ lasso _ he in dark corner and now he be adrift among they under notorious circumstance of superlative villainy at last drag to light and yet he blandly smile politely offer he cigar-holder to a perfect stranger and laugh and chat to right and leave as if springy buoyant and elastic with a angelic conscience and sure of kind friend wherever he go both in this life and the life to come while he be lie iron in the brig gang of the man be sometimes overhear whisper about the terrible reception they would give he when he should be set at large nevertheless when liberate they seem confound by he erect and cordial assurance he gentlemanly sociability and fearless companionableness from be a implacable policeman vigilant cruel and remorseless in he office however polish in he phrase he be now become a disinterested saunter man of leisure wink at all impropriety and ready to laugh and make merry with any one still at first the man give he a wide berth and return scowl for he smile but who can forever resist the very devil himself when he come in the guise of a gentleman free fine and frank though goethe 's pious margaret hate the devil in he horn and harpooner 's tail yet she smile and nod to the engaging fiend in the persuasive_winning _ oily wholly harmless mephistophele but however it be i for one regard this master-at-arms with mixed feeling of detestation pity admiration and something op-posed to enmity i could not but abominate he when i thought of he conduct but i pity the continual gnawing which under all he deftly-donned disguise i see lie at the bottom of he soul i admire he heroism in sustain himself so well under such reverse and when i think how arbitrary the _ article of war _ be in define a man-of-war villain how much undetected guilt might be sheltered by the aristocratic awning of we quarter-deck how many florid purser ornament of the ward-room have be legally protect in defraud _ the people _ i could not but say to myself well after all though this man be a most wicked one indeed yet be he even more luckless than depraved besides a study observation of bland convinced I that he be a organic and irreclaimable scoundrel who do wicked deed as the cattle browse the herbage because wicked deed seem the legitimate operation of he whole infernal organization phrenologically he be without a soul be it to be wonder at that the devil be irreligious what then think i who be to blame in this matter for one i will not take the day of judgment upon I by authoritatively pronounce upon the essential criminality of any man-of-war 's - man and christianity have teach I that at the last day man-of-war 's - man will not be judge by the _ article of war _ nor by the _ unite state statute at large _ but by immutable law ineffably beyond the comprehension of the honorable board of commodore and navy commissioner but though i will stand by even a man-of-war thief and defend he from be seize up at the gangway if i can -- remember that my savior once hang between two thief promise one life-eternal -- yet i would not after the plain conviction of a villain again let he entirely loose to prey upon honest seaman fore and aft all three deck but this do captain claret and though the thing may not perhaps be credit nevertheless here it shall be record after the master-at-arms have be adrift among the ship 's company for several week and we be within a few day ' sail of home he be summon to the mast and publicly reinstate in he office as the ship 's chief of police perhaps captain claret have read the memoirs of vidocq and believe in the old say _ set a rogue to catch a rogue _ or perhaps he be a man of very tender feeling highly susceptible to the soft emotion of gratitude and could not bear to leave in disgrace a person who out of the generosity of he heart have about a year previous present he with a rare snuff-box fabricate from a sperm-whale 's tooth with a curious silver hinge and cunningly work in the shape of a whale also a splendid gold-mounted cane of a costly brazilian wood with a gold plate bear the captain 's name and rank in the service the place and time of he birth and with a vacancy underneath -- no doubt providentially leave for he heir to record he decease certain it be that some month previous to the master-at-arms ' disgrace he have present these article to the captain with he best love and compliment and the captain have receive they and seldom go ashore without the cane and never take snuff but out of that box with some captain a sense of propriety might have induce they to return these present when the generous donor have prove himself unworthy of have they retain but it be not captain claret who would inflict such a cut wound upon any officer 's sensibility though long-established naval custom have habituate he to scourge _ the people _ upon a emergency now have captain claret deem himself constitutionally bind to decline all present from he subordinate the sense of gratitude would not have operate to the prejudice of justice and as some of the subordinate of a man-of-war captain be apt to invoke he good wish and mollify he conscience by make he friendly gift it would perhaps _ have _ be a excellent thing for he to adopt the plan pursue by the president of the united state when he receive a present of lion and arabian charger from the sultan of muscat be forbid by he sovereign lord and master the imperial people to accept of any gift from foreign power the president send they to a auctioneer and the proceeds be deposit in the treasury in the same manner when captain claret receive he snuff-box and cane he might have accept they very kindly and then sell they off to the highest bidder perhaps to the donor himself who in that case would never have tempt he again upon he return home bland be pay off for he full term not deduct the period of he suspension he again enter the service in he old capacity as no further allusion will be make to this affair it may as well be state now that for the very brief period elapse between he restoration and be pay off in port by the purser the master-at-arms conduct himself with infinite discretion artfully steer between any relaxation of discipline -- which would have awaken the displeasure of the officer -- and any unwise severity -- which would have revive in tenfold force all the old grudge of the seaman under he command never do he show so much talent and tact as when vibrate in this he most delicate predicament and plenty of cause be there for the exercise of he cunningest ability for upon the discharge of we man-of-war 's - man at home should he _ then _ be hold by they as a enemy as free and independent citizen they would waylay he in the public street and take purple vengeance for all he iniquity past present and possible in the future more than once a master-at-arms ashore have be seize by night by a exasperated crew and serve as origen serve himself or as he enemy serve abelard but though under extreme provocation _ the people _ of a man-of-war have be guilty of the maddest vengeance yet at other time they be very placable and milky-hearted even to those who may have outrageously abused they many thing in point might be related but i forbear this account of the master-at-arms can not better be conclude than by denominate he in the vivid language of the captain of the fore-top as _ the two end and middle of the thrice-laid strand of a bloody rascal _ which be intend for a terse well-knit and all-comprehensive assertion without omission or reservation it be also assert that have tophet itself be rake with a fine-tooth comb such another ineffable villain could not by any possibility have be catch chapter xlv publishing poetry in a man-of-war a day or two after we arrival in rio a rather amusing incident occur to a particular acquaintance of mine young lemsford the gun-deck bard the great gun of a armed ship have block of wood call _ tompion _ paint black insert in they muzzle to keep out the spray of the sea these tompion slip in and out very handily like cover to butter firkin by advice of a friend lemsford alarm for the fate of he box of poetry have latterly make use of a particular gun on the main-deck in the tube of which he thrust he manuscript by simply crawl partly out of the porthole remove the tompion insert he papers tightly roll and make all snug again breakfast over he and i be recline in the main-top -- where by permission of my noble master jack chase i have invite he -- when of a sudden we hear a cannonade it be we own ship ah say a top-man return the shore salute they give we yesterday o lord cry lemsford my _ song of the siren _ and he run down the rig to the battery but just as he touch the gun-deck gun no 20 -- he literary strong-box -- go off with a terrific report well my after-guard virgil say jack chase

what they call the public be a monster like the idol we see in owhyhee with the head of a jackass the body of a baboon and the tail of a scorpion i do not like that say jack when i be ashore i myself be part of the public you pardon jack you be not you be then a part of the people just as you be aboard the frigate here the public be one thing jack and the people another you be right say jack right as this leg virgil you be a trump you be a jewel my boy the public and the people ay ay my lad let we hate the one and cleave to the other chapter xlvi the commodore on the poop and one of the people under the hand of the surgeon a day or two after the publication of lemsford 's song of the siren a sad accident befall a mess-mate of mine one of the captain of the mizzen-top he be a fine little scot who from the premature loss of the hair on the top of he head always go by the name of _ baldy _ this baldness be no doubt in great part attributable to the same cause that early thin the lock of most man-of-war 's - man -- namely the hard unyielding and ponderous man-of-war and navy-regulation tarpaulin hat which when new be stiff enough to sit upon and indeed in lieu of he thumb sometimes serve the common sailor for a bench now there be nothing upon which the commodore of a squadron more pride himself than upon the celerity with which he man can handle the sail and go through with all the evolution pertain thereto this be especially manifest in harbor when other vessel of he squadron be near and perhaps the armed ship of rival nation upon these occasion surround by he post-captain sa-trap -- each of whom in he own floating island be king -- the commodore domineer over all -- emperor of the whole oaken archipelago yea magisterial and magnificent as the sultan of the isle of sooloo but even as so potent a emperor and caesar to boot as the great don of germany charle the fifth be use to divert himself in he dotage by watch the gyration of the spring and cog of a long row of clock even so do a elderly commodore while away he leisure in harbor by what be call _ exercise gun _ and also _ exercise yard and sail _ cause the various spar of all the ship under he command to be brace top and cock bill in concert while the commodore himself sit something like king canute on a arm-chest on the poop of he flag-ship but far more regal than any descendant of charlemagne more haughty than any mogul of the east and almost mysterious and voiceless in he authority as the great spirit of the five nation the commodore deign not to verbalise he command they be impart by signal and as for old charle the fifth again the gay-pranked color suit of card be invent to while away he dotage even so doubtless must these pretty little signal of blue and red spotted _ bunt _ have be devise to cheer the old age of all commodore by the commodore 's side stand the signal-midshipman with a sea-green bag swing on he shoulder -lrb- as a sportsman bear he game-bag -rrb- the signal-book in one hand and the signal spy-glass in the other as this signal-book contain the masonic sign and token of the navy and would there-fore be invaluable to a enemy its binding be always border with lead so as to insure its sinking in case the ship should be capture not the only book this that might appropriately be bind in lead though there be many where the author and not the bookbinder furnish the metal as white-jacket understand it these signal consist of variously-coloured flag each standing for a certain number say there be ten flag represent the cardinal number -- the red flag no 1 the blue flag no 2 the green flag no 3 and so forth then by mount the blue flag over the red that would stand for no 21 : if the green flag be set underneath it would then stand for 213 how easy then by endless transposition to multiply the various number that may be exhibit at the mizzen-peak even by only three or four of these flag to each number a particular meaning be apply no 100 for instance may mean _ beat to quarter _ no 150 _ all hand to grog _ no 2000 _ strike top-gallant-yard _ no 2110 _ see anything to windward _ no 2800 _ no _ and as every man-of-war be furnish with a signal-book where all these thing be set down in order therefore though two american frigate -- almost perfect stranger to each other -- come from the opposite pole yet at a distance of more than a mile they could carry on a very liberal conversation in the air when several man-of-war of one nation lie at anchor in one port form a wide circle round they lord and master the flag-ship it be a very interesting sight to see they all obey the commodore 's order who meanwhile never open he lip thus be it with we in rio and hereby hang the story of my poor messmate bally one morning in obedience to a signal from we flag-ship the various vessel belong to the american squadron then in harbor simultaneously loosen they sail to dry in the evening the signal be set to furl they upon such occasion great rivalry exist between the first lieutenant of the different ship they vie with each other who shall first have he sail stow on the yard and this rivalry be share between all the officer of each vessel who be respectively place over the different top-men so that the main-mast be all eagerness to vanquish the fore-mast and the mizzen-mast to vanquish they both stimulate by the shout of they officer the sailor throughout the squadron exert themselves to the utmost aloft topmen lay out furl cry the first lieutenant of the neversink at the word the man spring into the rigging and on all three mast be soon climb about the yard in reckless haste to execute they order now in furl top-sail or course the point of honor and the hardest work be in the _ bunt _ or middle of the yard this post belong to the first captain of the top what be you ` bout there mizzen-top-men roar the first lieutenant through he trumpet d -- n you you be clumsy as russian bear do not you see the main -- top-men be nearly off the yard bear a hand bear a hand or i 'll stop you grog all round you baldy be you go to sleep there in the bunt while this be be say poor baldy -- he hat off he face streaming with perspiration -- be frantically exert himself pile up the ponderous fold of canvas in the middle of the yard ever and anon glancing at victorious jack chase hard at work at the main-top-sail-yard before he at last the sail be well pile up baldy jump with both foot into the _ bunt _ hold on with one hand to the chain _ tie _ and in that manner be violently tread down the canvas to pack it close d -- n you baldy why do not you move you crawl caterpillar roar the first lieutenant baldy bring he whole weight to bear on the rebellious sail and in he frenzied heedlessness let go he hold on the _ tie _ you baldy be you afraid of fall cry the first lieutenant at that moment with all he force baldy jump down upon the sail the _ bunt gasket _ part and a dark form drop through the air lighting upon the _ top-rim _ it roll off and the next instant with a horrid crash of all he bone baldy come like a thunderbolt upon the deck aboard of most large men-of-war there be a stout oaken platform about four foot square on each side of the quarter-deck you ascend to it by three or four step on top it be rail in at the side with horizontal brass bar it be call _ the horse block _ and there the officer of the deck usually stand in give he order at sea it be one of these horse block now unoccupied that break poor baldy 's fall he fall lengthwise across the brass bar bend they into elbow and crush the whole oaken platform step and all right down to the deck in a thousand splinter he be pick up for dead and carry below to the surgeon he bone seem like those of a man break on the wheel and no one think he would survive the night but with the surgeon 's skillful treatment he soon promise recovery surgeon cuticle devote all he science to this case a curious frame-work of wood be make for the maimed man and place in this with all he limb stretch out baldy lay flat on the floor of the sick-bay for many week upon we arrival home he be able to hobble ashore on crutch but from a hale hearty man with bronzed cheek he be become a mere dislocated skeleton white as foam but ere this perhaps he broken bone be heal and whole in the last repose of the man-of-war 's - man not many day after baldy 's accident in furl sail -- in this same frenzied manner under the stimulus of a shout officer -- a seaman fall from the main-royal-yard of a english line-of-battle ship near we and bury he ankle-bone in the deck leave two indentation there as if scoop out by a carpenter 's gouge the royal-yard form a cross with the mast and fall from that lofty cross in a line-of-battle ship be almost like fall from the cross of st paul 's almost like fall as lucifer from the well-spring of morning down to the phlegethon of night in some case a man hurl thus from a yard have fall upon he own shipmate in the top and drag they down with he to the same destruction with himself hardly ever will you hear of a man-of-war return home after a cruise without the loss of some of she crew from aloft whereas similar accident in the merchant service -- consider the much greater number of man employ in it -- be comparatively few why mince the matter the death of most of these man-of-war 's - man lie at the door of the soul of those officer who while safely stand on deck themselves scruple not to sacrifice a immortal man or two in order to show off the excel discipline of the ship and thus do _ the people _ of the gun-deck suffer that the commodore on the poop may be glorified chapter xlvii a auction in a man-of-war some allusion have be make to the weariness experience by the man-of-war 's - man while lie at anchor but there be scene now and then that serve to relieve it chief among these be the purser 's auction take place while in harbor some week or perhaps month after a sailor die in a armed vessel he bag of clothes be in this manner sell and the proceeds transfer to the account of he heir or executor one of these auction come off in rio shortly after the sad accident of baldy it be a dreamy quiet afternoon and the crew be listlessly lie ` around when suddenly the boatswain 's whistle be hear follow by the announcement d'ye hear there fore and aft purser 's auction on the spar-deck at the sound the sailor spring to they foot and muster round the main-mast presently up come the purser 's steward marshalling before he three or four of he subordinate carry several clothes ' bag which be deposit at the base of the mast we purser 's steward be a rather gentlemanly man in he way like many young american of he class he have at various time assume the most opposite function for a livelihood turn from one to the other with all the facility of a light-hearted clever adventurer he have be a clerk in a steamer on the mississippus river a auctioneer in ohio a stock actor at the olympic theater in new york and now he be purser 's steward in the navy in the course of this deversified career he natural wit and waggery have be highly spiced and every way improve and he have acquire the last and most difficult art of the joker the art of lengthen he own face while widen those of he hearer preserve the utmost solemnity while set they all in a roar he be quite a favorite with the sailor which in a good degree be owe to he humor but likewise to he off-hand irresistible romantic theatrical manner of address they with a dignified air he now mount the pedestal of the main-top-sail sheet-bitt impose silence by a theatrical wave of he hand meantime he subordinate be rummage the bag and assort they contents before he now my noble hearty he begin we will open this auction by offer to you impartial competition a very superior pair of old boot and so say he dangle aloft one clumsy cowhide cylinder almost as large as a fire bucket as a specimen of the complete pair what shall i have now my noble tar for this superior pair of sea-boot where 's t ` other boot cry a suspicious-eyed waister i remember they ` ere boot they be old bob 's the quarter-gunner 's

soothingly what be it one dollar one dollar then -- one dollar go at one dollar go go -- go just see how it vibrate -- swing the boot to and fro -- this superior pair of sea-boots vibrate at one dollar would not pay for the nail in they heel go go -- go and down go the boot ah what a sacrifice what a sacrifice he sigh tearfully eye the solitary fire-bucket and then glance round the company for sympathy a sacrifice indeed exclaim jack chase who stand by purser 's steward you be mark antony over the body of julius cesar so i be so i be say the auctioneer without move a muscle and look he exclaim suddenly seize the boot and exhibit it on high look my noble tar if you have tear prepare to shed they now you all do know this boot i remember the first time ever old bob put it on 'twa on a winter evening off cape horn between the starboard carronade -- that day he precious grog be stop look in this place a mouse have nibble through see what a rent some envious rat have make through this

the waist well my sweet and pleasant friend i will have they weigh out to you when the auction be over in like manner all the contents of the bag be dispose of embrace old frock trowser and jacket the various sum for which they go be charge to the bidder on the book of the purser have be present at this auction though not a purchaser and see with what facility the most dismantle old garment go off through the magical cleverness of the accomplished auctioneer the thought occur to I that if ever i calmly and positively decide to dispose of my famous white jacket this would be the very way to do it i turn the matter over in my mind a long time the weather in rio be genial and warm and that i would ever again need such a thing as a heavy quilted jacket -- and such a jacket as the white one too -- seem almost impossible yet i remember the american coast and that it would probably be autumn when we should arrive there yes i thought of all that to be sure nevertheless the ungovernable whim seize I to sacrifice my jacket and recklessly abide the consequence besides be it not a horrible jacket to how many annoyance have it subject I how many scrape have it drag I into nay have it not once jeopardise my very existence and i have a dreadful presentiment that if i persist in retain it it would do so again enough i will sell it i muttered and so muttering i thrust my hand further down in my waistband and walk the main-top in the stern concentration of a inflexible purpose next day hearing that another auction be shortly to take place i repair to the office of the purser 's steward with whom i be upon rather friendly term after vaguely and delicately hint at the object of my visit i come roundly to the point and ask he whether he could slip my jacket into one of the bag of clothes next to be sell and so dispose of it by public auction he kindly acquiesce and the thing be do in due time all hand be again summon round the main-mast the purser 's steward mount he post and the ceremony begin meantime i linger out of sight but still within hearing on the gun-deck below gaze up un-perceived at the scene as it be now so long ago i will here frankly make confession that i have privately retain the service of a friend -- william the yankee pedagogue and peddler -- whose business it would be to linger near the scene of the auction and if the bid on the jacket loiter to start it roundly himself and if the bidding then become brisk he be continually to strike in with the most pertinacious and infatuated bid and so exasperate competition into the maddest and most extravagant overture a variety of other article have be put up the white jacket be slowly produce and hold high aloft between the auctioneer 's thumb and fore-finger be submit to the inspection of the discriminate public here it behoove I once again to describe my jacket for as a portrait take at one period of life will not answer for a later stage much more this jacket of mine undergo so many change need to be paint again and again in order truly to present its actual appearance at any given period a premature old age have now settle upon it all over it bear melancholy sear of the masoned-up pocket that have once trench it in various direction some part of it be slightly mildew from dampness on one side several of the button be go and other be break or crack while alas my many mad endeavor to rub it black on the deck have now impart to the whole garment a exceedingly untidy appearance such as it be with all its fault the auctioneer display it you venerable sheet-anchor-man and you gallant fore-top-man and you my fine waister what do you say now for this superior old jacket button and sleeve lining and skirt it must this day be sell without reservation how much for it my gallant tar of columbium say the word and how much my eye exclaim a fore-top-man do not that ` ere bunch of old swab belong to jack chase 's pet be not that _ the white jacket _ _ the white jacket _ cry fifty voice in response _ the white jacket _ the cry run fore and aft the ship like a slogan completely overwhelming the solitary voice of my private friend william while all hand gaze at it with strain eye wonder how it come among the bag of deceased mariner ay noble tar say the auctioneer you may well stare at it you will not find another jacket like this on either side of cape horn i assure you why just look at it how much now _ give _ I a bid -- but do not be rash be prudent be prudent man remember you purser 's account and do not be betray into extravagant bid purser 's steward cry grummet one of the quarter-gunner slowly shift he quid from one cheek to the other like a ballast-stone i will not bid on that ` ere bunch of old swab unless you put up ten pound of soap with it do not mind that old fellow say the auctioneer how much for the jacket my noble tar jacket cry a dandy _ bone polisher _ of the gun-room the sail-maker be the tailor then how many fathom of canvas in it purser 's steward how much for this _ jacket _ reiterate the auctioneer emphatically _ jacket _ do you call it cry a captain of the hold why not call it a white-washed man-of-war schooner look at the port-hole to let in the air of cold night a reg ` lar herring-net chime in grummet give I the _ fever nagur _ to look at it echo a mizzen-top-man silence cry the auctioneer start it now -- start it boy anything you please my fine fellow it _ must _ be sell come what ought i to have on it now why purser 's steward cry a waister you ought to have new sleeve a new lining and a new body on it afore you try to shove it off on a greenhorn what be you ` busin ' that ` ere garment for cry a old sheet-anchor-man do not you see it be a ` uniform muster jacket ' -- three button on one side and none on t ` other silence again cry the auctioneer how much my sea-fencible for this superior old jacket well say grummet i 'll take it for cleaning-rag at one cent oh come give we a bid say something colombian well then say grummet all at once burst into genuine indignation if you want we to say something then heave that bunch of old swab overboard _ say i _ and show we something worth look at no one will give I a bid then very good here shove it aside let 's have something else there while this scene be go forward and my white jacket be thus be abused how my heart swell within I thrice be i on the point of rush out of my hiding-place and bear it off from derision but i linger still flattering myself that all would be well and the jacket find a purchaser at last but no alas there be no get rid of it except by roll a forty-two-pound shot in it and commit it to the deep but though in my desperation i have once contemplated something of that sort yet i have now become unaccountably averse to it from certain involuntary superstitious consideration if i sink my jacket think i it will be sure to spread itself into a bed at the bottom of the sea upon which i shall sooner or later recline a dead man so unable to conjure it into the possession of another and withhold from bury it out of sight for ever my jacket stick to I like the fatal shirt on nessus chapter xlviii purser purser 's steward and postmaster in a man-of-war as the purser 's steward so conspicuously figure at the unsuccessful auction of my jacket it remind I of how important a personage that official be on board of all men-of-war he be the right-hand man and confidential deputy and clerk of the purser who intrust to he all he account with the crew while in most case he himself snug and comfortable in he state-room glance over a file of newspaper instead of overhaul he ledger of all the non-combatant of a man-of-war the purser perhaps stand foremost in importance though he be but a member of the gun-room mess yet usage seem to assign he a conventional station somewhat above that of he equal in navy rank -- the chaplain surgeon and professor moreover he be frequently to be see in close conversation with the commodore who in the neversink be more than once know to be slightly jocular with we purser upon several occasion also he be call into the commodore 's cabin and remain closeted there for several minute together nor do i remember that there ever happen a cabinet meeting of the ward-room baron the lieutenant in the commodore 's cabin but the purser make one of the party doubtless the important fact of the purser have under he charge all the financial affair of a man-of-war impart to he the great importance he enjoy indeed we find in every government -- monarchy and republic alike -- that the personage at the head of the finances invariably occupy a commanding position thus in point of station the secretary of the treasury of the united state be deem superior to the other head of department also in england the real office hold by the great premier himself be -- as every one know -- that of first lord of the treasury now under this high functionary of state the official know as the purser 's steward be head clerk of the frigate 's fiscal affair upon the berth-deck he have a regular counting-room full of ledger journal and day-book he desk be as much litter with papers as any pearl street merchant 's and much time be devote to he account for hour together you would see he through the window of he subterranean office write by the light of he perpetual lamp _ ex-officio _ the purser 's steward of most ship be a sort of postmaster and he office the post-office when the letter-bag for the squadron -- almost as large as those of the united state mail -- arrive on board the neversink it be the purser 's steward that sit at he little window on the berth-deck and hand you you letter or paper -- if any there be to you address some disappointed applicant among the sailor would offer to buy the epistle of they more fortunate shipmate while yet the seal be unbroken -- maintain that the sole and confidential reading of a fond long domestic letter from any man 's home be far better than no letter at all in the vicinity of the office of the purser 's steward be the principal store-room of the purser where large quantity of goods of every description be to be find on board of those ship where goods be permit to be serve out to the crew for the purpose of sell they ashore to raise money more business be transact at the office of a purser 's steward in one _ liberty-day _ morning than all the dry goods shop in a considerable village would transact in a week once a month with undeviating regularity this official have he hand more than usually full for once a month certain print bill call mess-bill be circulate among the crew and whatever you may want from the purser -- be it tobacco soap duck dungaree needle thread knife belt calico ribbon pipe paper pen hat ink shoe sock or whatever it may be -- down it go on the mess-bill which be the next day return to the office of the steward the slop as they be call be serve out to the man and charge to they account lucky be it for man-of-war 's - man that the outrageous imposition to which but a very few year ago they be subject from the abuse in this department of the service and the unscrupulous cupidity of many of the purser -- lucky be it for they that _ now _ these thing be in a great degree do away the purser instead of be at liberty to make almost what they please from the sale of they wares be now pay by regular stipend lay down by law under the explode system the profit of some of these officer be almost incredible in one cruise up the mediterranean the purser of a american line-of-battle ship be on good authority say to have clear the sum of $ 50000 upon that he quit the service and retire into the country shortly after he three daughter -- not very lovely -- married extremely well the idea that sailor entertain of purser be express in a rather inelegant but expressive saying of theirs : the purser be a conjurer he can make a dead man chew tobacco -- insinuate that the account of a dead man be sometimes subject to post-mortem charge among sailor also purser commonly go by the name of _ nip-cheese _ no wonder that on board of the old frigate java upon she return from a cruise extend over a period of more than four year one thousand dollar pay off eighty of she crew though the aggregate wages of the eighty for the voyage must have amount to about sixty thousand dollar even under the present system the purser of a line-of-battle ship for instance be far better pay than any other officer short of captain or commodore while the lieutenant commonly receive but eighteen hundred dollar the surgeon of the fleet but fifteen hundred the chaplain twelve hundred the purser of a line-of-battle ship receive thirty-five hundred dollar in consider he salary however he responsibility be not to be over-looked they be by no means insignificant there be purser in the navy whom the sailor exempt from the insinuation above mention nor as a class be they so obnoxious to they now as formerly for one the florid old purser of the neversink -- never come into disciplinary contact with the seaman and be withal a jovial and apparently good-hearted gentleman -- be something of a favorite with many of the crew chapter xlix rumor of a war and how they be receive by the population of the neversink while lie in the harbor of callao in peru certain rumor have come to we touch a war with england grow out of the long-vexed northeastern boundary question in rio these rumor be increase and the probability of hostility induce we commodore to authorize proceedings that closely bring home to every man on board the neversink he liability at any time to be kill at he gun among other thing a number of man be detail to pass up the rusty cannon-ball from the shot-locker in the hold and scrape they clean for service the commodore be a very neat gentleman and would not fire a dirty shot into he foe it be a interesting occasion for a tranquil observer nor be it altogether neglect not to recite the precise remark make by the seaman while pitch the shoot up the hatchway from hand to hand like schoolboy play ball ashore it will be enough to say that from the general drift of they discourse -- jocular as it be -- it be manifest that almost to a man they abhor the idea of go into action and why should they desire a war would they wages be raise not a cent the prize-money though ought to have be a inducement but of all the reward of virtue prize-money be the most uncertain and this the man-of-war 's - man know what then have he to expect from war what but harder work and harder usage than in peace a wooden leg or arm mortal wound and death enough however that by far the majority of the common sailor of the neversink be plainly concern at the prospect of war and be plainly averse to it but with the officer of the quarter-deck it be just the reverse none of they to be sure in my hearing at least verbally express they gratification but it be unavoidably betray by the increase cheerfulness of they demeanor toward each other they frequent fraternal conference and they unwonted animation for several clay in issue they order the voice of mad jack -- always a belfry to hear -- now resound like that famous bell of england great tom of oxford as for selvagee he wear he sword with a jaunty air and he servant daily polish the blade but why this contrast between the forecastle and the quarter-deck between the man-of-war 's - man and he officer because though war would equally jeopardize the life of both yet while it hold out to the sailor no promise of promotion and what be call _ glory _ these thing fire the breast of he officer it be no pleasing task nor a thankful one to dive into the soul of some man but there be occasion when to bring up the mud from the bottom reveal to we on what sounding we be on what coast we adjoin how be these officer to gain glory how but by a distinguished slaughtering of they fellow-men how be they to be promote how but over the bury head of kill comrade and mess-mate this hostile contrast between the feeling with which the common seaman and the officer of the neversink look forward to this more than possible war be one of many instance that might be quote to show the antagonism of they interest the incurable antagonism in which they dwell but can man whose interest be diverse ever hope to live together in a harmony uncoerced can the brotherhood of the race of mankind ever hope to prevail in a man-of-war where one man 's bane be almost another 's blessing by abolish the scourge shall we do away tyranny _ that _ tyranny which must ever prevail where of two essentially antagonistic class in perpetual contact one be immeasurably the stronger surely it seem all but impossible and as the very object of a man-of-war as its name imply be to fight the very battle so naturally averse to the seaman so long as a man-of-war exist it must ever remain a picture of much that be tyrannical and repel in human nature be a establishment much more extensive than the american navy the english armed marine furnish a yet more striking example of this thing especially as the existence of war produce so vast a augmentation of she naval force compare with what it be in time of peace it be well know what joy the news of bonaparte 's sudden return from elba create among crowd of british naval officer who have previously be expect to be send ashore on half-pay thus when all the world wail these officer find occasion for thanksgiving i urge it not against they as man -- they feeling belong to they profession have they not be naval officer they have not be rejoicer in the midst of despair when shall the time come how much longer will god postpone it when the cloud which at time gather over the horizon of nation shall not be hail by any class of humanity and invoke to burst as a bomb standing navy as well as stand army serve to keep alive the spirit of war even in the meek heart of peace in its very ember and smouldering they nourish that fatal fire and half-pay officer as the priest of mar yet guard the temple though no god be

of the top -- incomparable jack chase -- the deliberate opinion be form and rock-founded that we ship 's company must have at least one day 's _ liberty _ to go ashore ere we weigh anchor for home here it must be mention that concern anything of this kind no sailor in a man-of-war ever presume to be a agitator unless he be of a rank superior to a mere able-seaman and no one short of a petty officer -- that be a captain of the top a quarter-gunner or boatswain 's mate -- ever dream of be a spokesman to the supreme authority of the vessel in solicit any kind of favor for himself and shipmate after canvass the matter thoroughly with several old quarter-master and other dignified sea-fencible jack hat in hand make he appearance one fine evening at the mast and wait till captain claret draw nigh bow and address he in he own off-hand polished and poetical style in he intercourse with the quarter-deck he always presume upon he be such a universal favorite sir this rio be a charming harbor and we poor mariner -- you trusty sea-warrior valiant captain who with _ you _ at they head would board the rock of gibraltar itself and carry it by storm -- we poor fellow valiant captain have gaze round upon this ravishing landscape till we can gaze no more will captain claret vouchsafe one day 's liberty and so assure himself of eternal felicity since in we flow cup he will be ever after freshly remember as jack thus round off with a snatch from shakspeare he salute the captain with a gallant flourish of he tarpaulin and then bring the rim to he mouth with he head bow and he body throw into a fine negligent attitude stand a picture of eloquent but passive appeal he seem to say magnanimous captain claret we fine fellow and heart of oak throw ourselves upon you unparalleled goodness and what do you want to go ashore for ask the captain evasively and try to conceal he admiration of jack by affect some haughtiness ah sir sigh jack why do the thirsty camel of the desert desire to lap the water of the fountain and roll in the green grass of the oasis be we not but just from the ocean sahara and be not this rio a verdant spot noble captain surely you will not keep we always tethered at anchor when a little more cable would admit of we crop the herbage and it be a weary thing captain claret to be imprison month after month on the gun-deck without so much as smell a citron ah captain claret what sing sweet waller : ` but who can always on the billow lie the watery wilderness yield no supply ' compare with such a prisoner noble captain ` happy thrice happy who in battle slay press would in atride ' cause the trojan pain ' pope 's version sir not the original greek and so say jack once more bring he hat-rim to he mouth and slightly bend forward stand mute at this juncture the most serene commodore himself happen to emerge from the after-gangway he gilded button epaulet and the gold lace on he chapeau glittering in the flooding sunset attract by the scene between captain claret and so well-known and admire a commoner as jack chase he approach and assume for the moment a air of pleasant condescension -- never show to he noble baron the officer of the ward-room -- he say with a smile well jack you and you shipmate be after some favor i suppose -- a day 's liberty be it not whether it be the horizontal setting sun streaming along the deck that blind jack or whether it be in sun-worshipping homage of the mighty commodore there be no tell but just at this juncture noble jack be stand reverentially hold he hat to he brow like a man with weak eye valiant commodore say he at last this audience be indeed a honor undeserved i almost sink beneath it yes valiant commodore you sagacious mind have truly divine we object liberty sir liberty be indeed we humble prayer i trust you honorable wound receive in glorious battle valiant comodore pain you less today than common ah cunning jack cry the commodore by no means blind to the bold sortie of he flattery but not at all displeased with it in more respects than one we commodore 's wound be he weak side i think we must give they liberty he add turn to captain claret who thereupon wave jack further off fall into confidential discourse with he superior well jack we will see about it at last cry the commodore advance i think we must let you go to you duty captain of the main-top say the captain rather stiffly he wish to neutralise somewhat the effect of the commodore 's condescension besides he have much rather the commodore have be in he cabin he presence for the time affect he own supremacy in he ship but jack be nowise cast down by the captain 's coldness he feel safe enough so he proceed to offer he acknowledgment ` kind gentleman ' he sigh you pain be register where every day i turn the leaf to read ' -- macbeth valiant commodore and captain -- what the thane say to the noble lord ross and angus and long and lingeringly bow to the two noble officer jack back away from they presence still shade he eye with the broad rim of he hat jack chase for ever cry he shipmate as he carry the grateful news of liberty to they on the forecastle who can talk to commodore like we matchless jack chapter lii something concern midshipman it be the next morning after matchless jack 's interview with the commodore and captain that a little incident occur soon forget by the crew at large but long remember by the few seaman who be in the habit of closely scrutinise every-day proceedings upon the face of it it be but a common event -- at least in a man-of-war -- the flogging of a man at the gangway but the under-current of circumstance in the case be of a nature that magnify this particular flogging into a matter of no small importance the story itself can not here be relate it would not well bear recital : enough that the person flog be a middle-aged man of the waist -- a forlorn broken-down miserable object truly one of those wretched landsman sometimes drive into the navy by they unfitness for all thing else even as other be drive into the workhouse he be flog at the complaint of a midshipman and hereby hang the drift of the thing for though this waister be so ignoble a mortal yet he be scourge on this one occasion indirectly proceed from the mere wanton spite and unscrupulousness of the midshipman in question -- a youth who be apt to indulge at time in undignified familiarity with some of the man who sooner or later almost always suffer from he capricious preference but the lead principle that be involve in this affair be far too mischievous to be lightly dismiss in most case it would seem to be a cardinal principle with a navy captain that he subordinate be disintegrate part of himself detach from the main body on special service and that the order of the minutest midshipman must be as deferentially obey by the seaman as if proceed from the commodore on the poop this principle be once emphasise in a remarkable manner by the valiant and handsome sir peter parker upon whose death on a national arson expedition on the shore of chesapeake bay in 1812 or 1813 lord byron write he well-known stanza by the god of war say sir peter to he sailor i 'll make you touch you hat to a midshipman 's coat if it be only hang on a broomstick to dry that the king in the eye of the law can do no wrong be the well-known fiction of despotic state but it have remain for the navy of constitutional monarchy and republic to magnify this fiction by indirectly extend it to all the quarter-deck subordinate of a armed ship 's chief magistrate and though judicially unrecognised and unacknowledged by the officer themselves yet this be the principle that pervade the fleet this be the principle that be every hour act upon and to sustain which thousand of seaman have be flog at the gangway however childish ignorant stupid or idiotic a midshipman if he but order a sailor to perform even the most absurd action that man be not only bind to render instant and unanswer obedience but he would refuse at he peril and if have obey he should then complain to the captain and the captain in he own mind should be thoroughly convince of the impropriety perhaps of the illegality of the order yet in nine case out of ten he would not publicly reprimand the midshipman nor by the slightest token admit before the complainant that in this particular thing the midshipman have do otherwise than perfectly right upon a midshipman 's complain of a seaman to lord collingwood when captain of a line-of-battle ship he order the man for punishment and in the interval call the midshipman aside say to he in all probability now the fault be yours -- you know therefore when the man be bring to the mast you have better ask for he pardon accordingly upon the lad 's public intercession collingwood turn to the culprit say this young gentleman have plead so humanely for you that in hope you feel a due gratitude to he for he benevolence i will for this time overlook you offence this story be relate by the editor of the admiral 's correspondence to show the admiral 's kindheartedness now collingood be in reality one of the most just humane and benevolent admiral that ever hoist a flag for a sea-officer collingwood be a man in a million but if a man like he sway by old usage could thus violate the commonest principle of justice -- with however good motive at bottom -- what must be expect from other captain not so eminently gifted with noble trait as collingwood and if the corps of american midshipman be mostly replenish from the nursery the counter and the lap of unrestrained indulgence at home : and if most of they at least by they impotency as officer in all important function at sea by they boyish and overweening conceit of they gold lace by they overbearing manner toward the seaman and by they peculiar aptitude to construe the merest triviality of manner into set affront against they dignity if by all this they sometimes contract the ill-will of the seaman and if in a thousand way the seaman can not but betray it -- how easy for any of these midshipman who may happen to be unrestrained by moral principle to resort to spiteful practice in procure vengeance upon the offender in many instance to the extremity of the lash since as we have see the tacit principle in the navy seem to be that in he ordinary intercourse with the sailor a midshipman can do nothing obnoxious to the public censure of he superior you fellow i 'll get you _ lick _ before long be often hear from a midshipman to a sailor who in some way not open to the judicial action of the captain have chance to offend he at time you will see one of these lad not five foot high gaze up with inflamed eye at some venerable six-footer of a forecastle man cursing and insulting he by every epithet deem most scandalous and unendurable among man yet that man 's indignant tongue be treble-knotted by the law that suspend death itself over he head should he passion discharge the slightest blow at the boy-worm that spit at he foot but since what human nature be and what it must for ever continue to be be well enough understand for most practical purpose it need no special example to prove that where the merest boy indiscriminately snatch from the human family be give such authority over mature man the result must be proportionable in monstrousness to the custom that authorise this worse than cruel absurdity nor be it unworthy of remark that while the noblest-minded and most heroic sea-officer -- man of the topmost stature include lord nelson himself -- have regard flogging in the navy with the deepest concern and not without weighty scruple touch its general necessity still one who have see much of midshipman can truly say that he have see but few midshipman who be not enthusiastic advocate and admirer of scourge it would almost seem that they themselves have so recently escape the posterior discipline of the nursery and the infant school be impatient to recover from those smart reminiscence by mince the back of full-grown american freeman it should not to be omit here that the midshipman in the english navy be not permit to be quite so imperious as in the american ship they be divide into three -lrb- i think -rrb- probationary class of volunteer instead of be at once advance to a warrant nor will you fail to remark when you see a english cutter officer by one of those volunteer that the boy do not so strut and slap he dirk-hilt with a bobadil air and anticipatingly feel of the place where he warlike whisker be go to be and sputter out oath so at the man as be too often the case with the little boy wear best-bower anchor on they lapel in the american navy yet it must be confess that at time you see midshipman who be noble little fellow and not at all dislike by the crew besides three gallant youth one black-eyed little lad in particular in the neversink be such a one from he diminutiveness he go by the name of _ boat plug _ among the seaman without be exactly familiar with they he have yet become a general favorite by reason of he kindness of manner and never cursing they it be amusing to hear some of the older triton invoke blessing upon the youngster when he kind tone fall on they weather-beaten ear ah good luck to you sir touch they hat to the little man you have a soul to be save sir there be a wonderful deal of meaning involve in the latter sentence _ you have a soul to be save _ be the phrase which a man-of-war 's - man peculiarly apply to a humane and kind-hearted officer it also imply that the majority of quarter-deck officer be regard by they in such a light that they deny to they the possession of soul ah but these plebeian sometimes have a sublime vengeance upon patrician imagine a outcast old sailor seriously cherish the purely speculative conceit that some bully in epaulet who order he to and fro like a slave be of a organization immeasurably inferior to himself must at last perish with the brute while he go to he immortality in heaven but from what have be say in this chapter it must not be infer that a midshipman lead a lord 's life in a man-of-war far from it he lord it over those below he while lord over himself by he superior it be as if with one hand a school-boy snap he finger at a dog and at the same time receive upon the other the discipline of the usher 's ferule and though by the american article of war a navy captain can not of he own authority legally punish a midshipman otherwise than by suspension from duty -lrb- the same as with respect to the ward-room officer -rrb- yet this be one of those sea-statute which the captain to a certain extent observe or disregard at he pleasure many instance might be relate of the petty mortification and official insult inflict by some captain upon they midshipman far more severe in one sense than the old-fashioned punishment of send they to the mast-head though not so arbitrary as send they before the mast to do duty with the common sailor -- a custom in former time pursue by captain in the english navy captain claret himself have no special fondness for midshipman a tall overgrown young midshipman about sixteen year old have fall under he displeasure he interrupt the humble apology he be make by say not a word sir i 'll not hear a word mount the net sir and stand there till you be order to come down the midshipman obey and in full sight of the entire ship 's company captain claret promenade to and fro below he lofty perch read he a most aggravating lecture upon he alleged misconduct to a lad of sensibility such treatment must have be almost as stinging as the lash itself would have be it be to be remember that wherever these chapter treat of midshipman the officer know as passed-midshipman be not at all refer to in the american navy these officer form a class of young man who have see sufficient service at sea as midshipman to pass a examination before a board of commodore be promote to the rank of passed-midshipmen introductory to that of lieutenant they be suppose to be qualify to do duty as lieutenant and in some case temporarily serve as such the difference between a passed-midshipman and a midshipman may be also infer from they respective rate of pay the former upon sea-service receive $ 750 a year the latter $ 400 there be no passed-midshipman in the neversink chapter liii seafaring person peculiarly subject to be under the weather -- the effect of this upon a man-of-war captain it have be say that some midshipman in certain case be guilty of spiteful practice against the man-of-war 's - man but as these midshipman be presume to have receive the liberal and lofty breeding of gentleman it would seem all but incredible that any of they corps could descend to the paltriness of cherish personal malice against so conventionally degrade a be as a sailor so indeed it would seem but when all the circumstance be consider it will not appear extraordinary that some of they should thus cast discredit upon the warrant they wear title and rank and wealth and education can not unmake human nature the same in cabin-boy and commodore its only difference lie in the different mode of development at sea a frigate house and home five hundred mortal in a space so contract that they can hardly so much as move but they touch cut off from all those outward pass thing which ashore employ the eye tongue and thought of landsman the inmate of a frigate be throw upon themselves and each other and all they pondering be introspective a morbidness of mind be often the consequence especially upon long voyage accompany by foul weather calm or head-winds nor do this exempt from its evil influence any rank on board indeed high station only minister to it the more since the higher the rank in a man-of-war the less companionship it be a odious unthankful repugnant thing to dwell upon a subject like this nevertheless be it say that through these jaundiced influence even the captain of a frigate be in some case indirectly induce to the infliction of corporal punishment upon a seaman never sail under a navy captain whom you suspect of be dyspeptic or constitutionally prone to hypochondria the manifestation of these thing be sometimes remarkable in the earlier part of the cruise while make a long tedious run from mazatlan to callao on the main baffle by light head wind and frequent intermit calm when all hand be heartily weary by the torrid monotonous sea a good-natured fore-top-man by the name of candy -- quite a character in he way -- standing in the waist among a crowd of seaman touch I and say d'ye see the old man there white-jacket walk the poop well do not he look as if he want to flog someone look at he once but to I at least no such indication be visible in the deportment of the captain though he thrash the arm-chest with the slack of the spanker-out-haul look a little suspicious but any one might have be do that to pass away a calm depend on it say the top-man he must somehow have think i be make sport of _ he _ a while ago when i be only take off old priming the gunner 's mate just look at he once white-jacket while i make believe coil this here rope if there ar not a dozen in that ` ere captain 's top-light my name be _ horse-marine _ if i could only touch my tile to he now and take my bible oath on it that i be only take off priming and not _ he _ he would not have such hard thought of I but that can not be do he would think i mean to insult he well it can not be help i suppose i must look out for a baker 's dozen afore long i have a incredulous laugh at this but two day afterward when we be hoist the main-top-mast stun ' - sail and the lieutenant of the watch be reprimand the crowd of seaman at the halyard for they laziness -- for the sail be but just crawl up to its place owe to the languor of the man induce by the heat -- the captain who have be impatiently walk the deck suddenly stop short and dart he eye among the seaman suddenly fix they cry out you candy and be damned to you you do not pull a ounce you blackguard stand up to that gun sir i 'll teach you to be grin over a rope that way without lend you pound of beef to it boatswain 's mate where 's you _ colt _ give that man a dozen remove he hat the boatswain 's mate look into the crown aghast the coil rope usually worn there be not to be find but the next instant it slide from the top of he head to the deck pick it up and straighten it out he advance toward the sailor sir say candy touching and retouch he cap to the captain i be pull sir as much as the rest sir i be indeed sir stand up to that gun cry the captain boatswain 's mate do you duty three stripe be give when the captain raise he finger you -- -lrb- 3 -rrb- do you dare stand up to be flog with you hat on take it off sir instantly -- -lrb- footnote-3 -rrb- the phrase here use i have never see either write or print and should not like to be the first person to introduce it to the public -- candy drop it on deck now go on boatswain 's mate and the sailor receive he dozen with he hand to he back he come up to I where i stand among the by-stander say o lord o lord that boatswain 's mate too have a spite agin I he always think it be _ I _ that set afloat that yarn about he wife in norfolk o lord just run you hand under my shirt will you white-jacket there do not he have a spite agin I to raise such bar as they and my shirt all cut to piece too -- ar not it white-jacket damn I but these colting put the tin in the purser 's pocket o lord my back feel as if there be a red-hot gridiron lash to it but i tell you so -- a widow 's curse on he say i -- he think i mean _ he _ and not priming chapter liv the people be give liberty whenever in interval of mild benevolence or yield to mere politic dictate king and commodore relax the yoke of servitude they should see to it well that the concession seem not too sudden or unqualified for in the commoner 's estimation that might argue feebleness or fear hence it be perhaps that though noble jack have carry the day captive in he audience at the mast yet more than thirty-six hour elapse ere anything official be hear of the liberty he shipmate so earnestly covet some of the people begin to growl and grumble it be turn out all gammon jack say one blast the commodore cry another he bamboozle you jack lay on you oar a while answer jack and we shall see we have strike for liberty and liberty we 'll have i be you tribune boy i be you rienzus the commodore must keep he word next day about breakfast-time a mighty whistling and piping be hear at the main-hatchway and presently the boatswain 's voice be hear : d'ye hear there fore and aft all you starboard-quarter watch get ready to go ashore on liberty in a paroxysm of delight a young mizzen-top-man standing by at the time whip the tarpaulin from he head and smash it like a pancake on the deck liberty he shout leap down into the berth-deck after he bag at the appoint hour the quarter-watch muster round the capstan at which stand we old first lord of the treasury and pay-master-general the purser with several goodly buck-skin bag of dollar pile up on the capstan he help we all round to half a handful or so and then the boat be man and like so many esterhazy we be pull ashore by we shipmate all they life lord may live in listless state but give the commoner a holiday and they outlord the commodore himself the ship 's company be divide into four section or quarter-watch only one of which be on shore at a time the rest remain to garrison the frigate -- the term of liberty for each be twenty-four hour with jack chase and a few other discreet and gentlemanly top-men i go ashore on the first day with the first quarter-watch we own little party have a charming time we see many fine sight fall in -- as all sailor must -- with dash adventure but though not a few good chapter might be write on this head i must again forbear for in this book i have nothing to do with the shore further than to glance at it now and then from the water my man-of-war world alone must supply I with the staple of my matter i have take a oath to keep afloat to the last letter of my narrative have they all be as punctual as jack chase 's party the whole quarter-watch of liberty-man have be safe on board the frigate at the expiration of the twenty-four hour but this be not the case and during the entire day succeed the midshipman and other be engage in ferret they out of they hiding-place on shore and bring they off in scatter detachment to the ship they come in all imaginable stage of intoxication some with blacken eye and broken head some still more severely injure have be stab in fray with the portuguese soldier other unharmed be immediately drop on the gun-deck between the gun where they lay snore for the rest of the day as a considerable degree of license be invariably permit to man-of-war 's - man just off liberty and as man-of-war 's - man well know this to be the case they occasionally avail themselves of the privilege to talk very frankly to the officer when they first cross the gangway take care meanwhile to reel about very industriously so that there shall be no doubt about they be seriously intoxicated and altogether _ non compo _ for the time and though but few of they have cause to feign intoxication yet some individual may be suspect of enact a study part upon these occasion indeed -- judge by certain symptom -- even when really inebriate some of the sailor must have previously determine upon they conduct just as some person who before take the exhilarating gas secretly make up they mind to perform certain mad feat while under its influence which feat consequently come to pass precisely as if the actor be not accountable for they for several day while the other quarter-watch be give liberty the neversink present a sad scene she be more like a madhouse than a frigate the gun-deck resound with frantic fight shout and song all visitor from shore be keep at a cable 's length these scene however be nothing to those which have repeatedly be enact in american men-of-war upon other station but the custom of introduce woman on board in harbor be now pretty much discontinue both in the english and american navy unless a ship command by some dissolute captain happen to lie in some far away outlandish port in the pacific or indian ocean the british line-of-battle ship royal george which in 1782 sink at she anchor at spithead carry down three hundred english woman among the one thousand soul that be drown on that memorable morning when at last after all the mad tumult and contention of liberty the reaction come we frigate present a very different scene the man look jaded and wan lethargic and lazy and many a old mariner with hand upon abdomen call upon the flag-staff to witness that there be more _ hot copper _ in the neversink than those in the ship 's galley such be the lamentable effect of suddenly and completely release _ the people _ of a man-of-war from arbitrary discipline it show that to such liberty at first must be administer in small and moderate quantity increase with the patient 's capacity to make good use of it of course while we lay in rio we officer frequently go ashore for pleasure and as a general thing conduct themselves with propriety but it be a sad thing to say that as for lieutenant mad jack he enjoy himself so delightfully for three consecutive day in the town that upon return to the ship he send he card to the surgeon with he compliment beg he to drop into he state-room the first time he happen to pass that way in the ward-room but one of we surgeon 's mate a young medico of fine family but slender fortune must have create by far the strongest impression among the hidalgo of rio he have read don quixote and instead of cure he of he quixotism as it ought to have do it only make he still more quixotic indeed there be some nature concern whose moral malady the grand maxim of mr similium similibus curantur hahneman do not hold true since with they _ like cure _ not _ like _ but only aggravate _ like _ though on the other hand so incurable be the moral malady of such person that the antagonist maxim _ contrarium contrarii curantar _ often prove equally false of a warm tropical day this surgeon 's mate must need go ashore in he blue cloth boat-cloak wear it with a gallant spanish toss over he cavalier shoulder by noon he perspire very freely but then he cloak attract all eye and that be huge satisfaction nevertheless he be knock-kneed and spavined of one leg sorely impair the effect of this hidalgo cloak which by-the-way be some-what rusty in front where he chin rub against it and a good deal bedraggle all over from he have use it as a counterpane off cape horn as for the midshipman there be no know what they mamma would have say to they conduct in rio three of they drink a good deal too much and when they come on board the captain order they to be sew up in they hammock to cut short they obstreperous caper till sober this show how unwise it be to allow child yet in they teens to wander so far from home it more especially illustrate the folly of give they long holiday in a foreign land

despise you mother 's leading-string but they be the _ man-rope _ my lad by which many youngster have steady the giddiness of youth and save themselves from lamentable fall and middy know this that as infant be too early put on they foot grow up bandy-legged and curtail of they fair proportion even so my dear middy do it morally prove with some of you who prematurely be send off to sea these admonition be solely address to the more diminutive class of midshipman -- those under five foot high and under seven stone in weight truly the record of the steerage of man-of-war be full of most melancholy example of early dissipation disease disgrace and death answer ye shades of fine boy who in the soil of all clime the round world over far away sleep from you home mother of man if you heart have be cast down when you boy have fall in the way of temptation ashore how much more burst you grief do you know that those boy be far from you arm cabine and crib in by all manner of iniquity

might treat himself to as many _ liberty day _ as he please yet throughout we stay in rio he conduct himself with the utmost discretion but he be a old old man physically a very small man he spine be as a unloaded musket-barrel -- not only attenuate but destitute of a solitary cartridge and he rib be as the rib of a weasel besides he be commodore of the fleet supreme lord of the common in blue it beseem he therefore to erect himself into a ensample of virtue and show the gun-deck what virtue be but alas when virtue sit high aloft on a frigate 's poop when virtue be crown in the cabin a commodore when virtue rule by compulsion and domineer over vice as a slave then virtue though she mandate be outwardly observe bear little interior sway to be efficacious virtue must come down from aloft even as we bless redeemer come down to redeem we whole man-of-war world to that end mix with its sailor and sinner as equal chapter lv midshipman enter the navy early the allusion in the precede chapter to the early age at which some of the midshipman enter the navy suggest some thought relative to more important consideration a very general modern impression seem to be that in order to learn the profession of a sea-officer a boy can hardly be send to sea too early to a certain extent this may be a mistake other profession involve a knowledge of technicality and thing restricted to one particular field of action be frequently master by man who begin after the age of twenty-one or even at a later period of life it be only about the middle of the seventeenth century that the british military and naval service be keep distinct previous to that epoch the king 's officer command indifferently either by sea or by land robert blake perhaps one of the most accomplished and certainly one of the most successful admiral that ever hoist a flag be more than half a century old -lrb- fifty-one year -rrb- before he enter the naval service or have aught to do professionally with a ship he be of a studious turn and after leave oxford reside quietly on he estate a country gentleman till he forty-second year soon after which he become connect with the parliamentary army the historian clarendon say of he he be the first man that make it manifest that the science -lrb- seamanship -rrb- might be attain in less time than be imagine and doubtless it be to he shore sympathy that the well-known humanity and kindness which blake evince in he intercourse with the sailor be in a large degree to be imputed midshipman send into the navy at a very early age be expose to the passive reception of all the prejudice of the quarter-deck in favor of ancient usage however useless or pernicious those prejudice grow up with they and solidify with they very bone as they rise in rank they naturally carry they up whence the inveterate repugnance of many commodore and captain to the slightest innovation in the service however salutary they may appear to landsmen it be hardly to be doubt that in matter connect with the general welfare of the navy government have pay rather too much deference to the opinion of the officer of the navy consider they as man almost bear to the service and therefore far better qualify to judge concern any and all question touch it than people on shore but in a nation under a liberal constitution it must ever be unwise to make too distinct and peculiar the profession of either branch of its military man true in a country like ours nothing be at present to be apprehend of they gain political rule but not a little be to be apprehend concern they perpetuate or create abuse among they subordinate unless civilian have full cognisance of they administrative affair and account themselves competent to the complete overlook and order they we do wrong when we in any way contribute to the prevail mystification that have be throw about the internal affair of the national sea-service hitherto those affair have be regard even by some high state functionary as thing beyond they insight -- altogether too technical and mysterious to be fully comprehend by landsman and this it be that have perpetuate in the navy many evil that otherwise would have be abolish in the general amelioration of other thing the army be sometimes remodel but the navy go down from generation to generation almost untouched and unquestioned as if its code be infallible and itself a piece of perfection that no statesman could improve when a secretary of the navy venture to innovate upon its established custom you hear some of the navy officer say what do this landsman know about we affair do he ever head a watch he do not know starboard from larboard girt-line from back-stay while we deferentially and cheerfully leave to navy officer the sole conduct of make and shorten sail tack ship and perform other nautical maneuver as may seem to they best let we beware of abandon to they discretion those general municipal regulation touch the well-being of the great body of man before the mast let we beware of be too much influence by they opinion in matter where it be but natural to suppose that they long-established prejudice be enlist chapter lvi a

scatter over the deck some of the officer now assume the part of cicerone to show the distinguished stranger the bowels of the frigate concern which several of they show a good deal of intelligent curiosity a guard of honor detach from the marine corps accompany they and they make the circuit of the berth-deck where at a judicious distance the emperor peep down into the cable-tier a very subterranean vault the captain of the main-hold who there preside make a polite bow in the twilight and respectfully express a desire for he royal majesty to step down and honor he with a call but with he handkerchief to he imperial nose he majesty decline the party then commence the ascent to the spar-deck which from so great a depth in a frigate be something like get up to the top of bunker hill monument from the basement while a crowd of people be gather about the forward part of the boom a sudden cry be hear from below a lieutenant come run forward to learn the cause when a old sheet-anchor-man standing by after touch he hat hitch up he waistband and reply i do not know sir but i be think as how one o ' they ` ere king have be tumblin ' down the hatchway and something like this it turn out in ascend one of the narrow ladder lead from the berth-deck to the gun-deck the most noble marquis of silva in the act of elevate the imperial coat-tail so as to protect they from rub

have escape without serious harm but from the marked coolness of he royal master when the marquis draw near to apologise for he awkwardness it be plain that he be condemn to languish for a time under the royal displeasure shortly after the imperial party withdraw under another grand national salute chapter lviii a quarter-deck officer before the mast as we be somewhat short-handed while we lay in rio we receive a small draft of man from a united state sloop of war whose three year ' term of service would expire about the time of we arrival in america under guard of a armed lieutenant and four midshipman they come on board in the afternoon they be immediately muster in the starboard gangway that mr bridewell we first lieutenant might take down they name and assign they they station they stand in a mute and solemn row the officer advance with he memorandum-book and pencil my casual friend shaking the holder happen to be by at the time touch my arm he say white-jacket this here remind I of sing-sing when a draft of fellow in darby come on from the state prison at auburn for a change of scene like you know after take down four or five name mr bridewell accost the next man a rather good-looking person but from he haggard cheek and sunken eye he seem to have be in the sad habit all he life of sit up rather late at night and though all sailor do certainly keep late hour enough -- stand watch at midnight -- yet there be no small difference between keep late hour at sea and keep late hour ashore what be you name ask the officer of this rather rakish-looking recruit mandeville sir say the man courteously touch he cap you must remember I sir he add in a low confidential tone strangely dash with servility we sail together once in the old macedonian sir i wear a epaulet then we have the same state-room you know sir i be you old chum mandeville sir and he again touch he cap i remember a _ officer _ by that name say the first lieutenant emphatically and i know _ you _ fellow but i know you henceforth for a common sailor i can show no favouritism here if you ever violate the ship 's rule you shall be flog like any other seaman i place you in the fore-top go forward to you duty it seem this mandeville have enter the navy when very young and have rise to be a lieutenant as he say but brandy have be he bane one night when he have the deck of a line-of-battle ship in the mediterranean he be seize with a fit of mania-a-potu and be out of he sens for the time go below and turn into he berth leave the deck without a commanding officer for this unpardonable offence he be break have no fortune and no other profession than the sea upon he disgrace he enter the merchant-service as a chief mate but he love of strong drink still pursue he he be again cashier at sea and degrade before the mast by the captain after this in a state of intoxication he re-enter the navy at pensacolum as a common sailor but all these lesson so biting-bitter to learn could not cure he of he sin he have hardly be a week on board the neversink when he be find intoxicate with smuggle spirit they lash he to the grating and ignominiously scourge he under the eye of he old friend and comrade the first lieutenant this take place while we lay in port which remind I of the circumstance that when punishment be about to be inflict in harbor all stranger be order ashore and the sentry at the side have it in strict charge to waive off all boat draw near chapter lix a man-of-war button divide two brother the conduct of mandeville in claim the acquaintance of the first lieutenant under such disreputable circumstance be strongly contrast by the behavior of another person on board place for a time in a somewhat similar situation among the genteel youth of the after-guard be a lad of about sixteen a very handsome young fellow with starry eye curly hair of a golden color and a bright sunshiny complexion : he must have be the son of some goldsmith he be one of the few sailor -- not in the main-top -- whom i use to single out for occasional conversation after several friendly interview he become quite frank and communicate certain portion of he history there be some charm in the sea which induce most person to be very communicative concern themselves we have lie in rio but a day when i observe that this lad -- whom i shall here call frank -- wear a unwonted expression of sadness mix with apprehension i question he as to the cause but he choose to conceal it not three day after he abruptly accost I on the gun-deck where i happen to be take a promenade i can not keep it to myself any more he say i must have a confidant or i shall go mad what be the matter say i in alarm matter enough -- look at this and he hand I a tear half sheet of a old new york _ herald _ put he finger upon a particular word in a particular paragraph it be the announcement of the sailing from the brooklyn navy-yard of a united state store ship with provision for the squadron in rio it be upon a particular name in the list of officer and midshipman that frank 's finger be place that be my own brother say he he must have get a reefer 's warrant since i leave home now white-jacket what be to be do i have calculate that the store ship may be expect here every day my brother will then see I -- he a officer and i a miserable sailor that any moment may be flog at the gangway before he very eye heaven white-jacket what shall i do would you run do you think there be any chance to desert i will not see he by heaven with this sailor 's frock on and he with the anchor button why frank say i i do not really see sufficient cause for this fit you be in you brother be a of officer -- very good and you be nothing but a sailor -- but that be no disgrace if he come on board here go up to he and take he by the hand believe I he will be glad enough to see you frank start from he desponding attitude and fix he eye full upon mine with clasped hand exclaim white-jacket i have be from home nearly three year in that time i have never hear one word from my family and though god know how i love they yet i swear to you that though my brother can tell I whether my sister be still alive yet rather than accost he in this _ lined-frock _ i would go ten century without hear one syllable from home amaze at he earnestness and hardly able to account for it altogether i stand silent a moment then say why frank this midshipman be you own brother you say now do you really think that you own flesh and blood be go to give himself air over you simply because he sport large brass button on he coat never believe it if he do he can be no brother and ought to be hang -- that be all do not say that again say frank resentfully my brother be a noble-hearted fellow i love he as i do myself you do not understand I white-jacket do not you see that when my brother arrive he must consort more or less with we chuckle-headed reefer on board here there be that namby-pamby miss nancy of a white-face stribble who the other day when mad jack 's back be turn order I to hand he the spy-glass as if he be a commodore do you suppose now i want my brother to see I a lackey abroad here by heaven it be enough to drive one distract what be to be do he cry fiercely much more pass between we but all my philosophy be in vain and at last frank depart he head hang down in despondency for several day after whenever the quarter-master report a sail enter the harbor frank be foremost in the rig to observe it at length one afternoon a vessel drawing near be report to be the long-expected store ship i look round for frank on the spar-deck but he be nowhere to be see he must have be below gaze out of a port-hole the vessel be hail from we poop and come to anchor within a biscuit 's toss of we battery that evening i hear that frank have ineffectually endeavor to get remove from he place as a oarsman in the first-cutter -- a boat which from its size be generally employ with the launch in carry ship-store when i think that the very next day perhaps this boat would be ply between the store ship and we frigate i be at no loss to account for frank 's attempt to get rid of he oar and feel heartily grieve at they failure next morning the bugler call away the first-cutter 's crew and frank enter the boat with he hat slouch over he eye upon he return i be all eagerness to learn what have happen and as the communication of he feeling be a grateful relief he pour he whole story into my ear it seem that with he comrade he mount the store ship 's side and hurry forward to the forecastle then turn anxiously toward the quarter-deck he spy two midshipman lean against the bulwark converse one be the officer of he boat -- be the other he brother no he be too tall -- too large thank heaven it be not he and perhaps he brother have not sail from home after all there might have be some mistake but suddenly the strange midshipman laugh aloud and that laugh frank have hear a thousand time before it be a free hearty laugh -- a brother 's laugh but it carry a pang to the heart of poor frank he be now order down to the main-deck to assist in remove the store the boat be load he be order into she when look toward the gangway he perceive the two midshipman lounge upon each side of it so that no one could pass they without brushing they person but again pull he hat over he eye frank dart between they gain he oar how my heart thump he say when i actually feel he so near I but i would not look at he -- no i would have die first to frank 's great relief the store ship at last move further up the bay and it fortunately happen that he see no more of he brother while in rio and while there he never in any way make himself know to he chapter lx a man-of-war 's - man shoot at there be a seaman belong to the fore-top -- a mess-mate though not a top-mate of mine and no favorite of the captain 's -- who for certain venial transgression have be prohibit from go ashore on liberty when the ship 's company go enraged at the deprivation -- for he have not touch earth in upward of a year -- he some night after lowered himself overboard with the view of gain a canoe attach by a robe to a dutch galiot some cable ' - length distant in this canoe he propose paddle himself ashore not be a very expert swimmer the commotion he make in the water attract the ear of the sentry on that side of the ship who turn about in he walk perceive the faint white spot where the fugitive be swim in the frigate 's shadow he hail it but no reply give the word or i fire not a word be hear the next instant there be a red flash and before it have completely cease illuminate the night the white spot be change into crimson some of the officer return from a party at the beach of the flamingo happen to be draw near the ship in one of she cutter they see the flash and the bound body it reveal in a moment the topman be drag into the boat a handkerchief be use for a tourniquet and the wound fugitive be soon on board the frigate when the surgeon be call the necessary attention be render now it appear that at the moment the sentry fire the top-man -- in order to elude discovery by manifest the completest quietude -- be float on the water straight and horizontal as if repose on a bed as he be not far from the ship at the time and the sentry be considerably elevated above he -- pacing he platform on a level with the upper part of the hammock-netting -- the ball strike with great force with a downward obliquity enter the right thigh just above the knee and penetrate some inch glance upward along the bone bury itself somewhere so that it could not be feel by outward manipulation there be no dusky discoloration to mark its internal track as in the case when a partly-spent ball -- obliquely hit -- after enter the skin course on just beneath the surface without penetrate further nor be there any mark on the opposite part of the thigh to denote its place as when a ball force itself straight through a limb and lodge perhaps close to the skin on the other side nothing be visible but a small ragged puncture bluish about the edge as if the rough point of a tenpenny nail have be force into the flesh and withdraw it seem almost impossible that through so small a aperture a musket-bullet could have penetrate the extreme misery and general prostration of the man cause by the great effusion of blood -- though strange to say at first he say he feel no pain from the wound itself -- induce the surgeon very reluctantly to forego a immediate search for the ball to extract it as that would have involve the dilating of the wound by the knife a operation which at that juncture would have be almost certainly attend with fatal result a day or two therefore be permit to pass while simple dressing be apply the surgeon of the other american ship of war in harbor occasionally visit the neversink to examine the patient and incidentally to listen to the exposition of we own surgeon

and not voluntarily seek some sin grow out of the heartless necessity of the predestination of thing some sin under which the sinner sink in sinless woe but no pang of pain not the slightest touch of concern ever cross the bosom of cuticle when he look on this cast it be immovably fix to a bracket against the partition of he state-room so that it be the first object that greet he eye when he open they from he nightly sleep nor be it to hide the face that upon retire he always hang he navy cap upon the upward curling extremity of the horn for that obscure it but little the surgeon 's cot-boy the lad who make up he swing bed and take care of he room often tell we of the horror he sometimes feel when he would find himself alone in in master 's retreat at time he be seize with the idea that cuticle be a preternatural being and once enter he room in the middle watch of the night he start at find it envelop in a thick bluish vapor and stifle with the odour of brimstone upon hear a low groan from the smoke with a wild cry he dart from the place and rouse the occupant of the neighbouring state-room it be find that the vapor proceed from smoulder bunch of lucifer match which have become ignite through the carelessness of the surgeon cuticle almost dead be drag from the suffocating atmosphere and it be several day ere he completely recover from its effect this accident take place immediately over the powder magazine but as cuticle during he sickness pay dearly enough for transgress the law prohibit combustible in the gun-room the captain contented himself with privately remonstrate with he well know the enthusiasm of the surgeon for all specimen of morbid anatomy some of the ward-room officer use to play upon he credulity though in every case cuticle be not long in discover they deception once when they have some sago pudding for dinner and cuticle chance to be ashore they make up a neat parcel of this bluish-white firm jelly-like preparation and place it in a tin box carefully seal with wax they deposit it on the gun-room table with a note purport to come from a eminent physician in rio connect with the grand national museum on the praca d' acclamacao beg leave to present the scientific senhor cuticle -- with the donor 's compliment -- a uncommonly fine specimen of a cancer descend to the ward-room cuticle spy the note and no sooner read it than clutch the case he open it and exclaim beautiful splendid i have never see a finer specimen of this most interesting disease what have you there surgeon cuticle say a lieutenant advance why sir look at it do you ever see anything more exquisite very exquisite indeed let I have a bit of it will you cuticle let you have a bit of it shriek the surgeon start back let you have one of my limb i would not mar so large a specimen for a hundred dollar but what can you want of it you be not make collection i be fond of the article say the lieutenant it be a fine cold relish to bacon or ham you know i be in new zealand last cruise cuticle and get into sad dissipation there among the cannibal come let 's have a bit if it be only a mouthful why you infernal feejee shout cuticle eye the other with a confound expression you do not really mean to eat a piece of this cancer hand it to I and see whether i will not be the reply in god 's name take it cry the surgeon put the case into he hand and then stand with he own uplifted steward cry the lieutenant the castor -- quick i always use plenty of pepper with this dish surgeon it be oystery ah this be really delicious he add smack he lip over a mouthful try it now surgeon and you 'll never keep such a fine dish as this lie uneaten on you hand as a mere scientific curiosity cuticle 's whole countenance change and slowly walk up to the table he put he nose close to the tin case then touch its contents with he finger and taste it enough button up he coat in all the trembling of a old man 's rage he burst from the ward-room and call for a boat be not see again for twenty-four hour but though like all other mortal cuticle be subject at time to these fit of passion -- at least under outrageous provocation -- nothing could exceed he coolness when actually employ in he imminent vocation surround by moan and shriek by feature distort with anguish inflict by himself he yet maintain a countenance almost supernaturally calm and unless the intense interest of the operation flush he wan face with a momentary tinge of professional enthusiasm he toil away untouched by the keenest misery come under a fleet-surgeon 's eye indeed long habituation to the dissecting-room and the amputation-table have make he seemingly impervious to the ordinary emotion of humanity yet you could not say that cuticle be essentially a cruel-hearted man he apparent heartlessness must have be of a purely scientific origin it be not to be imagine even that cuticle would have harm a fly unless he could procure a microscope powerful enough to assist he in experiment on the minute vitals of the creature but notwithstanding he marvellous indifference to the suffering of he patient and spite even of he enthusiasm in he vocation -- not cool by frost old age itself -- cuticle on some occasion would effect a certain disrelish of he profession and declaim against the necessity that force a man of he humanity to perform a surgical operation especially be it apt to be thus with he when the case be one of more than ordinary interest in discuss it previous to set about it he would veil he eagerness under a aspect of great circumspection curiously mar however by continual sally of unsuppressible impatience but the knife once in he hand the compassionless surgeon himself undisguised stand before you such be cadwallader cuticle we surgeon of the fleet chapter lxii a consultation of man-of-war surgeon it seem customary for the surgeon of the fleet when any important operation in he department be on the anvil and there be nothing to absorb professional attention from it to invite he brother surgeon if at hand at the time to a ceremonious consultation upon it and this in courtesy he brother surgeon expect in pursuance of this custom then the surgeon of the neighbouring american ship of war be request to visit the neversink in a body to advise concern the case of the top-man whose situation have now become critical they assemble on the half-deck and be soon join by they respect senior cuticle in a body they bow as he approach and accost he with deferential regard gentleman say cuticle unostentatiously seat himself on a camp-stool handed he by he cot-boy we have here a extremely interesting case you have all see the patient i believe at first i have hope that i should have be able to cut down to the ball and remove it but the state of the patient forbid since then the inflammation and sloughing of the part have be attend with a copious suppuration great loss of substance extreme debility and emaciation from this i be convince that the ball have shatter and deaden the bone and now lie impact in the medullary canal in fact there can be no doubt that the wound be incurable and that amputation be the only resource but gentleman i find myself place in a very delicate predicament i assure you i feel no professional anxiety to perform the operation i desire you advice and if you will now again visit the patient with I we can then return here and decide what be best to be do once more let I say that i feel no personal anxiety whatever to use the knife the assemble surgeon listen to this address with the most serious attention and in accordance with they superior 's desire now descend to the sick-bay where the patient be languish the examination conclude they return to the half-deck and the consultation be renew gentleman begin cuticle again seat himself you have now just inspect the limb you have see that there be no resource but amputation and now gentleman what do you say surgeon bandage of the mohawk will you express you opinion the wound be a very serious one say bandage -- a corpulent man with a high german forehead -- shake he head solemnly can anything save he but amputation demand cuticle he constitutional debility be extreme observe bandage but i have see more dangerous case surgeon wedge of the malay say cuticle in a pet be please to give _ you _ opinion and let it be definitive i entreat : this be say with a severe glance toward bandage if i think begin wedge a very spare tall man elevate himself still higher on he toe that the ball have shatter and divide the whole _ femur _ include the _ greater _ and _ lesser trochanter _ the _ linear aspera _ the _ digital fossa _ and the _ intertrochanteric _ i should certainly be in favor of amputation but that sir permit I to observe be not my opinion surgeon sawyer of the buccaneer say cuticle drawing in he thin lower lip with vexation and turn to a round-faced florid frank sensible-looking man whose uniform coat very handsomely fit he and be adorn with a unusual quantity of gold lace surgeon sawyer of the buccaneer let we now hear _ you _ opinion if you please be not amputation the only resource sir excuse I say sawyer i be decidedly oppose to it for if hitherto the patient have not be strong enough to undergo the extraction of the ball i do not see how he can be expect to endure a far more severe operation as there be no immediate danger of mortification and you say the ball can not be reach without make large incision i should support he i think for the present with tonic and gentle antiphlogistic locally apply on no account would i proceed to amputation until further symptom be exhibit surgeon patella of the algerine say cuticle in a ill-suppressed passion abruptly turn round on the person address will _ you _ have the kindness to say whether _ you _ do not think that amputation be the only resource now patella be the youngest of the company a modest man fill with a profound reverence for the science of cuticle and desirous of gain he good opinion yet not wish to commit himself altogether by a decide reply though like surgeon sawyer in he own mind he might have be clearly against the operation what you have remark mr surgeon of the fleet say patella respectfully hem concern the dangerous condition of the limb seem obvious enough amputation would certainly be a cure to the wound but then as notwithstanding he present debility the patient seem to have a strong constitution he might rally as it be and by you scientific treatment mr surgeon of the fleet -- bow -- be entirely make whole without risk a amputation still it be a very critical case and amputation may be indispensable and if it be to be perform there ought to be no delay whatever that be my view of the case mr surgeon of the fleet surgeon patella then gentleman say cuticle turn round triumphantly be clearly of opinion that amputation should be immediately perform for my own part -- individually i mean and without respect to the patient -- i be sorry to have it so decide but this settle the question gentleman -- in my own mind however it be settle before at ten o'clock to-morrow morning the operation will be perform i shall be happy to see you all on the occasion and also you junior -lrb- allude to the absent _ assistant surgeon _ -rrb- good-morning gentleman at ten o'clock remember and cuticle retreat to the ward-room chapter lxiii the operation next morning at the appoint hour the surgeon arrive in a body they be accompany by they junior young man range in age from nineteen year to thirty like the senior surgeon these young gentleman be array in they blue navy uniform display a profusion of bright button and several broad bar of gold lace about the wristband as in honor of the occasion they have put on they best coat they look exceedingly brilliant the whole party immediately descend to the half-deck where preparation have be make for the operation a large garrison-ensign be stretch across the ship by the main-mast so as completely to screen the space behind this space include the whole extent aft to the bulk-head of the commodore 's cabin at the door of which the marine-orderly pace in plain sight cutlass in hand upon two gun-carriage drag amidship the death-board -lrb- use for burial at sea -rrb- be horizontally place cover with a old royal-stun ' - sail upon this occasion to do duty as a amputation-table it be widen by a additional plank two match-tub near by place one upon another at either end support another plank distinct from the table whereon be exhibit a array of saw and knife of various and peculiar shape and size also a sort of steel something like the dinner-table implement together with long needle crooked at the end for take up the artery and large darning-needle thread and bee 's - wax for sew up a wound at the end nearest the larger table be a tin basin of water surround by small sponge place at mathematical interval from the long horizontal pole of a great-gun rammer -- fix in its usual place overhead -- hang a number of towel with we mark in the corner all these arrangement have be make by the surgeon 's steward a person whose important function in a man-of-war will in a future chapter be enter upon at large upon the present occasion he be bustling about adjust and readjust the knife needle and carver like a over-conscientious butler fidget over a dinner-table just before the convivialist enter but by far the most striking object to be see behind the ensign be a human skeleton whose every joint articulate with wire by a rivet at the apex of the skull it hang dangle from a hammock-hook fix in a beam above why this object be here will presently be see but why it be place immediately at the foot of the amputation-table only surgeon cuticle can tell while the final preparation be be make cuticle stand converse with the assemble surgeon and assistant surgeon he invite guest gentleman say he take up one of the glitter knife and artistically draw the steel across it gentleman though these scene be very unpleasant and in some mood i may say repulsive to I -- yet how much better for we patient to have the contusion and laceration of he present wound -- with all its dangerous symptom -- convert into a clean incision free from these objection and occasion so much less subsequent anxiety to himself and the surgeon yes he add tenderly feel the edge of he knife amputation be we only resource be it not so surgeon patella turn toward that gentleman as if rely upon some sort of a assent however clog with condition certainly say patella amputation be you only resource mr surgeon of the fleet that be i mean if you be fully persuade of its necessity the other surgeon say nothing maintain a somewhat reserved air as if conscious that they have no positive authority in the case whatever might be they own private opinion but they seem willing to behold and if call upon to assist at the operation since it could not now be avert the young man they assistant look very eager and cast frequent glance of awe upon so distinguish a practitioner as the venerable cuticle they say he can drop a leg in one minute and ten seconds from the moment the knife touch it whisper one of they to another we shall see be the reply and the speaker clap he hand to he fob to see if he watch would be forthcoming when want be you all ready here demand cuticle now advance to he steward have not those fellow get through yet point to three man of the carpenter 's gang who be place bit of wood under the gun-carriage support the central table they be just through sir respectfully answer the steward touch he hand to he forehead as if there be a cap-front there bring up the patient then say cuticle young gentleman he add turn to the row of assistant surgeon see you here remind I of the class of student once under my instruction at the philadelphium college of physician and surgeon ah those be happy day he sigh apply the extreme corner of he handkerchief to he glass-eye excuse a old man 's emotion young gentleman but when i think of the numerous rare case that then come under my treatment i can not but give way to my feeling the town the city the metropolis young gentleman be the place for you student at least in these dull time of peace when the army and navy furnish no inducement for a youth ambitious of rise in we honorable profession take a old man 's advice and if the war now threaten between the state and mexico should break out exchange you navy commission for commission in the army from have no military marine herself mexico have always be backward in furnish subject for the amputation-table of foreign navy the cause of science have languish in she hand the army young gentleman be you best school depend upon it you will hardly believe it surgeon bandage turn to that gentleman but this be my first important case of surgery in a nearly three year ' cruise i have be almost wholly confine in this ship to doctor 's practice prescribe for fever and flux true the other day a man fall from the mizzen-top-sail-yard but that be merely a aggravate case of dislocation and bone splintered and broken no one sir could have make a amputation of it without severely contuse he conscience and mine -- i may say it gentleman without ostentation be -- peculiarly susceptible and so say the knife and carver touchingly drop to he side and he stand for a moment fix in a tender reverie but a commotion be hear beyond the curtain he start and briskly cross and recross the knife and carver exclaim alus here come we patient surgeon this side of the table if you please young gentleman a little further off i beg steward take off my coat -- so my neckerchief now i must be perfectly unencumbered surgeon patella or i can do nothing whatever these article be remove he snatch off he wig place it on the gun-deck capstan then take out he set of false tooth and place it by the side of the wig and lastly put he forefinger to the inner angle of he blind eye spirit out the glass optic with professional dexterity and deposit that also next to the wig and false tooth thus divest of nearly all inorganic appurtenance what be leave of the surgeon slightly shake itself to see whether anything more could be spare to advantage carpenter 's mate he now cry will you never get through with that job almost through sir -- just through they reply stare round in search of the strange unearthly voice that address they for the absence of he tooth have not at all improve the conversational tone of the surgeon of the fleet with natural curiosity these man have purposely be linger to see all they could but now have no further excuse they snatch up they hammer and chisel and -- like the stage-builder decamp from a public meeting at the eleventh hour after just complete the rostrum in time for the first speaker -- the carpenter 's gang withdraw the broad ensign now lift reveal a glimpse of the crowd of man-of-war 's - man outside and the patient bear in the arm of two of he mess-mate enter the place he be much emaciated weak as a infant and every limb visibly tremble or rather jar like the head of a man with the palsy as if a organic and involuntary apprehension of death have seize the wounded leg its nervous motion be so violent that one of the mess-mate be oblige to keep he hand upon it the top-man be immediately stretch upon the table the attendant steadying he limb when slowly open he eye he glance about at the glitter knife and saw the towel and sponge the armed sentry at the commodore 's cabin-door the row of eager-eyed student the meager death 's - head of a cuticle now with he shirt sleeve roll up upon he withered arm and knife in hand and finally he eye settle in horror upon the skeleton slowly vibrate and jingle before he with the slow slight roll of the frigate in the water i would advise perfect repose of you every limb my man say cuticle address he the precision of a operation be often impaired by the inconsiderate restlessness of the patient but if you consider my good fellow he add in a patronising and almost sympathetic tone and slightly press he hand on the limb if you consider how much better it be to live with three limb than to die with four and especially if you but know to what torment both sailor and soldier be subject before the time of celsus owe to the lamentable ignorance of surgery then prevail you would certainly thank god from the bottom of you heart that _ you _ operation have be postpone to the period of this enlighten age bless with a bell a brodie and a lally my man before celsus 's time such be the general ignorance of we noble science that in order to prevent the excessive effusion of blood it be deem indispensable to operate with a red-hot knife -- make a professional movement toward the thigh -- and pour scalding oil upon the part -- elevate he elbow as if with a tea-pot in he hand -- still further to sear they after amputation have be perform he be faint say one of he mess-mate quick some water the steward immediately hurry to the top-man with the basin cuticle take the top-man by the wrist and feeling it a while observe do not be alarm man address the two mess-mate he 'll recover presently this faint very generally take place and he stand for a moment tranquilly eye the patient now the surgeon of the fleet and the top-man present a spectacle which to a reflect mind be better than a church-yard sermon on the mortality of man here be a sailor who four day previous have stand erect -- a pillar of life -- with a arm like a royal-mast and a thigh like a windlass but the slightest conceivable finger-touch of a bit of crooked trigger have eventuate in stretch he out more helpless than a hour-old babe with a blast thigh utterly drain of its brawn and who be it that now stand over he like a superior being and as if clothe himself with the attribute of immortality indifferently discourse of carve up he broken flesh and thus piece out he abbreviated day who be it that in capacity of surgeon seem enact the part of a regenerator of life the withered shrunken one-eyed toothless hairless cuticle with a trunk half dead -- a _ memento morus _ to behold and while in those soul-sinking and panic-striking premonition of speedy death which almost invariably accompany a severe gun-shot wound even with the most intrepid spirit while thus droop and die this once robust top-man 's eye be now wane in he head like a lapland moon be eclipse in cloud -- cuticle who for year have still live in he withered tabernacle of a body -- cuticle no doubt sharing in the common self-delusion of old age -- cuticle must have feel he hold of life as secure as the grim hug of a grizzly bear verily life be more awful than death and let no man though he live heart beat in he like a cannon -- let he not hug he life to himself for in the predestinate necessity of thing that bound life of he be not a whit more secure than the life of a man on he death-bed to-day we inhale the air with expand lung and life run through we like a thousand nile but to-morrow we may collapse in death and all we vein be dry as the brook kedron in a drought and now young gentleman say cuticle turn to the assistant surgeon while the patient be come to permit I to describe to you the highly-interesting operation i be about to perform mr surgeon of the fleet say surgeon bandage if you be about to lecture permit I to present you with you tooth they will make you discourse more readily understand and so say bandage with a bow place the two semicircle of ivory into cuticle 's hand thank you surgeon bandage say cuticle and slip the ivory into its place in the first place now young gentleman let I direct you attention to the excellent preparation before you i have have it unpacked from its case and set up here from my state-room where it occupy the spare berth and all this for you express benefit young gentleman this skeleton i procured in person from the hunterian department of the royal college of surgeon in london it be a masterpiece of art but we have no time to examine it now delicacy forbid that i should amplify at a juncture like this -- cast a almost benignant glance toward the patient now begin to open he eye but let I point out to you upon this thigh-bone -- disengage it from the skeleton with a gentle twist -- the precise place where i propose to perform the operation _ here _ young gentleman _ here _ be the place you perceive it be very near the point of articulation with the trunk yes interpose surgeon wedge rise on he toe yes young gentleman the point of articulation with the _ acetabulum _ of the _ os innominatum _ where 's you bell on bone dick whisper one of the assistant to the student next he wedge have be spend the whole morning over it get out the hard name surgeon wedge say cuticle look round severely we will dispense with you commentary if you please at present now young gentleman you can not but perceive that the point of operation be so near the trunk and the vitals it become a unusually beautiful one demand a steady hand and a true eye and after all the patient may die under my hand quick steward water water he be faint again cry the two mess-mate do not be alarm for you comrade man say cuticle turn round i tell you it be not a uncommon thing for the patient to betray some emotion upon these occasion -- most usually manifest by swoon it be quite natural it should be so but we must not delay the operation steward that knife -- no the next one -- there that be it he be come to i think -- feel the top-man 's wrist be you all ready sir this last observation be address to one of the never-sink 's assistant surgeon a tall lank cadaverous young man array in a sort of shroud of white canvas pin about he throat and completely envelop he person he be seat on a match-tub -- the skeleton swinging near he head -- at the foot of the table in readiness to grasp the limb as when a plank be be sever by a carpenter and he apprentice the sponge steward say cuticle for the last time take out he tooth and draw up he shirt sleeve still further then take the patient by the wrist stand by now you mess-mate keep hold of he arm pin he down steward put you hand on the artery i shall commence as soon as he pulse begin to -- _ now now _ let fall the wrist feel the thigh carefully and bow over it a instant he draw the fatal knife unerringly across the flesh as it first touch the part the row of surgeon simultaneously drop they eye to the watch in they hand while the patient lay with eye horribly distended in a kind of wake trance not a breath be hear but as the quiver flesh part in a long linger gash a spring of blood well up between the living wall of the wound and two thick stream in opposite direction course down the thigh the sponge be instantly dip in the purple pool every face present be pinch to a point with suspense the limb writhe the man shriek he mess-mate pinion he while round and round the leg go the unpitying cut the saw say cuticle instantly it be in he hand full of the operation he be about to apply it when look up and turn to the assistant surgeon he say would any of you young gentleman like to apply the saw a splendid subject several volunteer when select one cuticle surrender the instrument to he say do not be hurry now be steady while the rest of the assistant look upon they comrade with glance of envy he go rather timidly to work and cuticle who be earnestly regard he suddenly snatch the saw from he hand away butcher you disgrace the profession look at _ I _ for a few moment the thrilling rasp sound be hear and then the top-man seem part in twain at the hip as the leg slowly slide into the arm of the pale gaunt man in the shroud who at once make away with it and tuck it out of sight under one of the gun surgeon sawyer now say cuticle courteously turn to the surgeon of the mohawk would you like to take up the artery they be quite at you service sir do sawyer be prevail upon say surgeon bandage sawyer comply and while with some modesty he be conduct the operation cuticle turn to the row of assistant say young gentleman we will now proceed with we illustration hand I that bone steward and take the thigh-bone in he still bloody hand and hold it conspicuously before he auditor the surgeon of the fleet begin : young gentleman you will perceive that precisely at this spot -- _ here _ -- to which i previously direct you attention -- at the corresponding spot precisely -- the operation have be perform about here young gentleman here -- lift he hand some inch from the bone -- about _ here _ the great artery be but you notice that i do not use the tourniquet i never do the forefinger of my steward be far better than a tourniquet be so much more manageable and leave the smaller vein uncompressed but i have be tell young gentleman that a certain seignior seignioronus a surgeon of seville have recently invent a admirable substitute for the clumsy old-fashioned tourniquet as i understand it it be something like a pair of _ caliper _ work with a small archimede screw -- a very clever invention accord to all account for the padded point at the end of the arch -- arch he forefinger and thumb -- can be so work as to approximate in such a way as to -- but you do not attend to I young gentleman he add all at once start be more interested in the active proceedings of surgeon sawyer who be now thread a needle to sew up the overlap of the stump the young gentleman have not scruple to turn away they attention altogether from the lecturer a few moment more and the top-man in a swoon be remove below into the sick-bay as the curtain settle again after the patient have disappear cuticle still hold the thigh-bone of the skeleton in he ensanguined hand proceed with he remark upon it and have conclude they add now young gentleman not the least interesting consequence of this operation will be the finding of the ball which in case of non-amputation might have long elude the most careful search that ball young gentleman must have take a most circuitous route nor in case where the direction be oblique be this at all unusual indeed the learn henner give we a most remarkable -- i have almost say a incredible -- case of a soldier 's neck where the bullet enter at the part call adam 's apple -- yes say surgeon wedge elevate himself the _ pomum adamus _ enter the point call _ adam 's apple _ continue cuticle severely emphasise the last two word run completely round the neck and emerge at the same hole it have enter shoot the next man in the rank it be afterward extract say renner from the second man and piece of the other 's skin be find adhering to it but example of foreign substance be receive into the body with a ball young gentleman be frequently observe be attach to a united state ship at the time i happen to be near the spot of the battle of ayacucho in peru the day after the action i saw in the barracks of the wound a trooper who have be severely injure in the brain go crazy and with he own holster-pistol commit suicide in the hospital the ball drive inward a portion of he woollen night-cap -- in the form of a _ cul-de-sac _ doubtless say the undaunted wedge for once surgeon wedge you use the only term that can be employ and let I avail myself of this opportunity to say to you young gentleman that a man of true science -- expand he shallow chest a little -- use but few hard word and those only when none other will answer he purpose whereas the smatterer in science -- slightly glance toward wedge -- think that by mouth hard word he prove that he understand hard thing let this sink deep in you mind young gentleman and surgeon wedge -- with a stiff bow -- permit I to submit the reflection to yourself well young gentleman the bullet be afterward extract by pull upon the external part of the _ cul-de-sac _ -- a simple but exceedingly beautiful operation there be a fine example somewhat similar related in guthrie but of course you must have meet with it in so well-known a work as he treatise upon gun-shot wound when upward of twenty year ago i be with lord cochrane then admiral of the fleet of this very country -- point shoreward out of a port-hole -- a sailor of the vessel to which i be attach during the blockade of bahium have he leg -- but by this time the fidget have completely take possession of he auditor especially of the senior surgeon and turn upon they abruptly he add but i will not detain you longer gentleman -- turn round upon all the surgeon -- you dinner must be wait you on board you respective ship but surgeon sawyer perhaps you may desire to wash you hand before you go there be the basin sir you will find a clean towel on the rammer for myself i seldom use they -- take out he handkerchief i must leave you now gentleman -- bow to-morrow at ten the limb will be upon the table and i shall be happy to see you all upon the occasion who be there turn to the curtain which then rustle please sir say the steward enter the patient be dead the body also gentleman at ten precisely say cuticle once more turn round upon he guest i predict that the operation might prove fatal he be very much run down good-morning and cuticle depart he do not surely mean to touch the body exclaim surgeon sawyer with much excitement oh no say patella that be only he way he mean doubtless that it may be inspect previous to be take ashore for burial the assemblage of gold-laced surgeon now ascend to the quarter-deck the second cutter be call away by the bugler and one by one they be drop aboard of they respective ship the following evening the mess-mate of the top-man row he remains ashore and bury they in the ever-vernal protestant cemetery hard by the beach of the flamingo in plain sight from the bay chapter lxiv man-of-war trophy when the second cutter pull about among the ship drop the surgeon aboard the american man-of-war here and there -- as a pilot-boat distribute she pilot at the mouth of the harbor -- she pass several foreign frigate two of which a englishman and a frenchman have excite not a little remark on board the neversink these vessel often loose they sail and exercise yard simultaneously with ourselves as if desirous of compare the respective efficiency of the crew when we be nearly ready for sea the english frigate weigh she anchor make all sail with the sea-breeze and begin show off she pace by glide about among all the man-of-war in harbor and particularly by run down under the neversink 's stern every time she draw near we compliment she by lower we ensign a little and invariably she courteously return the salute she be invite we to a sailing-match and it be rumor that when we should leave the bay we captain would have no objection to gratify she for be it know the neversink be account the fleetest keel craft sailing under the american long-pennant perhaps this be the reason why the stranger challenge we it may have be that a portion of we crew be the more anxious to race with this frigate from a little circumstance which a few of they deem rather galling not many cable ' - length distant from we commodore 's cabin lay the frigate president with the red cross of st george fly from she peak as its name import this fine craft be a american bear but have be capture during the last war with britain she now sail the salt sea as a trophy think of it my gallant countryman one and all down the sea-coast and along the endless bank of the ohio and columbium -- think of the twinge we sea-patriot must have feel to behold the live-oak of the florida and the pine of green maine build into the oaken wall of old england but to some of the sailor there be a counterbalance thought as grateful as the other be galling and that be that somewhere sail under the star and stripe be the frigate macedonian a british-born craft which have once sport the battle-banner of britain it have ever be the custom to spend almost any amount of money in repair a capture vessel in order that she may long survive to commemorate the heroism of the conqueror thus in the english navy there be many monsieur of seventy-fours win from the gaul but we american can show but few similar trophy though no doubt we would much like to be able so to do but i never have behold any of thee float trophy without be remind of a scene once witness in a pioneer village on the western bank of the mississippus not far from this village where the stump of aboriginal tree yet stand in the market-place some year ago live a portion of the remnant tribe of the sioux indian who frequently visit the white settlement to purchase trinket and cloth one florid crimson evening in July when the red-hot sun be go down in a blaze and i be lean against a corner in my huntsman 's frock lo there come stalk out of

thing to topple down six foot perpendicular of immortal manhood though that lofty living tower need perhaps thirty good grow summer to bring it to maturity poor savage and you account it so glorious do you to mutilate and destroy what god himself be more than a quarter of a century in building and yet fellow-christians what be the american frigate macedonian or the english frigate president but

christianise christendom chapter lxv a man-of-war race we lay in rio so long -- for what reason the commodore only know -- that a say go abroad among the impatient sailor that we frigate would at last ground on the beef-bones daily throw overboard by the cook but at last good tiding come all hand up anchor ahoy and bright and early in the morning up come we old iron as the sun rise in the east the land-breeze at rio -- by which alone vessel may emerge from the bay -- be ever languid and faint it come from garden of citron and clove spice with all the spice of the tropic of capricorn and like that old exquisite mohammed who so much loved to snuff perfume and essence and use to lounge out of the conservatory of khadija he wife to give battle to the robust son of koriesh even so this rio land-breeze come jade with sweet-smelling savor to wrestle with the wild tartar breeze of the sea slowly we drop and drop down the bay glide like a stately swan through the outlet and be gradually roll by the smooth slide billow broad out upon the deep straight in we wake come the tall main-mast of the english fighting-frigate terminate like a steepled cathedral in the bannered cross of the religion of peace and straight after _ she _ come the rainbow banner of france sport god 's token that no more would he make war on the earth both englishman and frenchman be resolve upon a race and we yankee swear by we top-sail and royal to sink they blaze banner that night among the southern constellation we should daily be extinguish behind we in we run to the north ay say mad jack st george 's banner shall be as the _ southern cross _ out of sight league down the horizon while we gallant star my brave boy shall burn all alone in the north like the great bear at the pole come on rainbow and cross but the wind be long languid and faint not yet recover from its night 's dissipation ashore and noon advance with the sugar-loaf pinnacle in sight now it be not with ship as with horse for though if a horse walk well and fast it generally furnish good token that he be not bad at a gallop yet the ship that in a light breeze be outstrip may sweep the stake so soon as a t ` gallant breeze enable she to strike into a canter thus fare it with we first the englishman glide ahead and bluffly pass on then the frenchman politely bid we adieu while the old neversink linger behind railing at the effeminate breeze at one time all three frigate be irregularly abreast form a diagonal line and so near be all three that the stately officer on the poop stiffly salute by touch they cap though refrain from any further civility at this juncture it be a noble sight to behold those fine frigate with drip breast-hook all rearing and nodding in concert and to look through they tall spar and wilderness of rig that seem like inextricably-entangled gigantic cobweb against the sky toward sundown the ocean paw its white hoof to the spur of its helter-skelter rider a strong blast from the eastward and give three cheer from deck yard and top we crowd all sail on st george and st deni but it be harder to overtake than outstrip night fall upon we still in the rear -- still where the little boat be which at the eleventh hour accord to a rabbinical tradition push after the ark of old noah it be a misty cloudy night and though at first we look-out keep the chase in dim sight yet at last so thick become the atmosphere that no sign of a strange spar be to be see but the worst of it be that when last discern the frenchman be broad on we weather-bow and the englishman gallantly lead he van the breeze blow fresher and fresher but with even we main-royal set we dash along through a cream-coloured ocean of illuminated foam white-jacket be then in the top and it be glorious to look down and see we black hull but the white sea with its broad bow like a ram we must beat they with such a breeze dear jack say i to we noble captain of the top but the same breeze blow for john bull remember reply jack who be a briton perhaps favor the englishman more than the neversink but how we boom through the billow cry jack gaze over the top-rail then fling forth he arm recite ` aslope and glide on the leeward side the bound vessel cut the roar tide ' camoen white-jacket camoen do you ever read he the lusiad i mean it be the man-of-war epic of the world my lad give I gama for a

grave -- he be drown in the mediterranean you know near leghorn -- and not burn he body as they do as if he have be a bloody turk but many people think he so white-jacket because he do not go to mass and because he write queen mab trelawney be by at the burning and he be a ocean-rover too ay and byron help put a piece of a keel on the fire for it be make of bit of a wreck they say one wreck

captain i have that here white-jacket -- touch he forehead -- which under happier sky -- perhaps in you solitary star there peep down from those cloud -- might have make a homer of I but fate be fate white-jacket and we homer who happen to be captain of top must write we ode in we heart and publish they in we head but look the captain 's on the poop it be now midnight but all the officer be on deck jib-boom there cry the lieutenant of the watch go forward and hail the headmost look-out d'ye see anything of those fellow now see nothing sir see nothing sir say the lieutenant approach the captain and touch he cap call all hand roar the captain this keel sha 'n' t be beat while i stride it all hand be call and the hammock stow in the netting for the rest of the night so that no one could lie between blanket now in order to explain the means adopt by the captain to insure we the race it need to be say of the neversink that for some year after be launch she be account one of the slowest vessel in the american navy but it chance upon a time that be on a cruise in the mediterranean she happen to sail out of port mahon in what be then suppose to be very bad trim for the sea she bow be root in the water and she stern kick up its heel in the air but wonderful to tell it be soon discover that in this comical posture she sail like a shooting-star she outstrip every vessel on the station thenceforward all she captain on all cruise _ trim she by the head _ and the neversink gain the name of a clipper to return all hand be call they be now make use of by captain claret as make-weight to trim the ship scientifically to she most approved bearing some be send forward on the spar-deck with twenty-four-pound shot in they hand and be judiciously scatter about here and there with strict order not to budge a inch from they station for fear of mar the captain 's plan other be distribute along the gun and berth-deck with similar order and to crown all several carronade gun be unshipped from they carriage and swing in they breeching from the beam of the main-deck so as to impart a sort of vibratory briskness and oscillate buoyancy to the frigate and thus we five hundred make-weight stand out that whole night some of we expose to a drenching rain in order that the neversink might not be beat but the comfort and consolation of all make-weight be as dust in the balance in the estimation of the ruler of we man-of-war world the long anxious night at last come to a end and with the first peep of day the look-out on the jib-boom be hail but nothing be in sight at last it be broad day yet still not a bow be to be see in we rear nor a stern in we van where be they cry the captain out of sight astern to be sure sir say the officer of the deck out of sight _ ahead _ to be sure sir mutter jack chase in the top precisely thus stand the question : whether we beat they or whether they beat we no mortal can tell to this hour since we never see they again but for one white-jacket will lay he two hand on the bow chaser of the neversink and take he ship 's oath that we yankee carry the day chapter lxvi fun in a man-of-war after the race -lrb- we man-of-war derby -rrb- we have many day fine weather during which we continue run before the trade toward the north exhilarate by the thought of be homeward-bound many of the seaman become joyous and the discipline of the ship if anything become a little relax many pastime serve to while away the _ dog-watch _ in particular these _ dog-watch _ -lrb- embrace two hour in the early part of the evening -rrb- form the only authorised play-time for the crew of most ship at sea among other diversion at present license by authority in the neversink be those of single-stick spar hammer-and-anvil and head-bumping all these be under the direct patronage of the captain otherwise -- see the consequence they sometimes lead to -- they would undoubtedly have be strictly prohibit it be a curious coincidence that when a navy captain do not happen to be a admirer of the _ fistiana _ he crew seldom amuse themselves in that way _ single-stick _ as every one know be a delightful pastime which consist in two man stand a few foot apart and rap each other over the head with long pole there be a good deal of fun in it so long as you be not hit but a hit -- in the judgment of discreet person -- spoil the sport completely when this pastime be practice by connoisseur ashore they wear heavy wire helmet to break the force of the blow but the only helmet of we tar be those with which nature have furnish they they play with great gun-rammer _ spar _ consist in play single-stick with bone pole instead of wooden one two man stand apart and pommel each other with they fist -lrb- a hard bunch of knuckle permanently attach to the arm and make globular or extend into a palm at the pleasure of the proprietor -rrb- till one of they find himself sufficiently thrash cry _ enough _ _ hammer-and-anvil _ be thus practice by amateur : patient no 1 get on all-fours and stay so while patient no 2 be take up by he arm and leg and he base be swing against the base of patient no 1 till patient no 1 with the force of the final blow be send fly along the deck _ head-bumping _ as patronise by captain claret consist in two negro -lrb- whites will not answer -rrb- but at each other like ram this pastime be a especial favorite with the captain in the dog-watches rose-water and may-day be repeatedly summon into the lee waist to tilt at each other for the benefit of the captain 's health may-day be a full-blooded _ bull-negro _ so the sailor call he with a skull like a iron tea-kettle wherefore may-day much fancy the sport but rose-water he be a slender and rather handsome mulatto and abhor the pastime nevertheless the captain must be obey so at the word poor rose-water be fain to put himself in a posture of defense else may-day would incontinently have bump he out of a port-hole into the sea i use to pity poor rose-water from the bottom of my heart but my pity be almost arouse into indignation at a sad sequel to one of these gladiatorial scene it seem that lift up by the unaffected though verbally unexpressed applause of the captain may-day have begin to despise rose-water as a poltroon -- a fellow all brain and no skull whereas he himself be a great warrior all skull and no brain accordingly after they have be bump one evening to the captain 's content may-day confidentially tell rose-water that he consider he a _ nigger _ which among some black be hold a great term of reproach fire at the insult rose-water give may-day to understand that he utterly err for he mother a black slave have be one of the mistress of a virginia planter belong to one of the oldest family in that state another insulting remark follow this innocent disclosure retort follow retort in a word at last they come together in mortal combat the master-at-arms catch they in the act and bring they up to the mast the captain advance please sir say poor rose-water it all come of dat ` ar bump may-day here aggrawate I ` bout it master-at-arms say the captain do you see they fight ay sir say the master-at-arms touch he cap rig the grating say the captain i 'll teach you two man that though i now and then permit you to _ play _ i will have no _ fight _ do you duty boatswain 's mate and the negro be flog justice command that the fact of the captain 's not show any leniency to may-day -- a decide favorite of he at least while in the ring -- should not be pass over he flog both culprit in the most impartial manner as in the matter of the scene at the gangway shortly after the cape horn theatricals when my attention have be direct to the fact that the officer have _ ship they quarter-deck face _ -- upon that occasion i say it be see with what facility a sea-officer assume he wonted severity of demeanor after a casual relaxation of it this be especially the case with captain claret upon the present occasion for any landsman to have behold he in the lee waist of a pleasant dog-watch with a genial good-humoured countenance observe the gladiator in the ring and now and then indulge in a playful remark -- that landsman would have deem captain claret the indulgent father of he crew perhaps permit the excess of he kind-heartedness to encroach upon the appropriate dignity of he station he would have deem captain claret a fine illustration of those two well-known poetical comparison between a sea-captain and a father and between a sea-captain and the master of apprentice institute by those eminent maritime jurist the noble lord tenterden and stowell but surely if there be anything hateful it be this _ shipping of the quarter-deck face _ after wear a merry and good-natured one how can they have the heart methink if but once i smile upon a man -- never mind how much beneath I -- i could not bring myself to condemn he to the shocking misery of the lash oh officer all round the world if this quarter-deck face you wear at all then never unship it for another to be merely sport for a moment of all insult the temporary condescension of a master to a slave be the most outrageous and galling that potentate who most condescend mark he well for that potentate if occasion come will prove you uttermost tyrant chapter lxvii white-jacket arraign at the mast when with five hundred other i make one of the compel spectator at the scourging of poor rose-water i little think what fate have ordain for myself the next day poor mulatto thought i one of a oppressed race they degrade you like a hound thank god i be a white yet i have see whites also scourge for black or white all my shipmate be liable to that still there be something in we somehow that in the most degraded condition we snatch at a chance to deceive ourselves into a fancied superiority to other whom we suppose lower in the scale than ourselves poor rose-water think i poor mulatto heaven send you a release from you humiliation to make plain the thing about to be related it need to repeat what have somewhere be previously mention that in _ tack ship _ every seaman in a man-of-war have a particular station assign he what that station be should be make know to he by the first lieutenant and when the word be pass to _ tack _ or _ wear _ it be every seaman 's duty to be find at he post but among the various _ number and station _ give to I by the senior lieutenant when i first come on board the frigate he have altogether omit inform I of my particular place at those time and up to the precise period now write of i have hardly know that i should have have any special place then at all for the rest of the man they seem to I to catch hold of the first rope that offer as in a merchant-man upon similar occasion indeed i subsequently discover that such be the state of discipline -- in this one particular at least -- that very few of the seaman could tell where they proper station be at _ tack or wear _ all hand tack ship ahoy such be the announcement make by the boatswain 's mate at the hatchway the morning after the hard fate of rose-water it be just eight bell -- noon and spring from my white jacket which i have spread between the gun for a bed on the main-deck i run up the ladder and as usual seize hold of the main-brace which fifty hand be streaming along forward when _ main-top-sail haul _ be give through the trumpet i pull at this brace with such heartiness and good-will that i almost flattered myself that my instrumentality in get the frigate round on the other tack deserve a public vote of thanks and a silver tankard from congress but something happen to be in the way aloft when the yard swing round a little confusion ensue and with anger on he brow captain claret come forward to see what occasion it no one to let go the weather-lift of the main-yard the rope be cast off however by a hand and the yard unobstructed come round when the last rope be coil away the captain desire to know of the first lieutenant who it might be that be station at the weather -lrb- then the starboard -rrb- main-lift with a vexed expression of countenance the first lieutenant send a midshipman for the station bill when upon glance it over my own name be find put down at the post in question at the time i be on the gun-deck below and do not know of these proceedings but a moment after i hear the boatswain 's mate bawl my name at all the hatch-way and along all three deck it be the first time i have ever hear it so send through the furthest recess of the ship and well know what this generally betoken to other seaman my heart jump to my throat and i hurriedly ask flute the boatswain 's - mate at the fore-hatchway what be want of I captain want ye at the mast he reply go to flog ye i guess what for my eye you have be chalk you face haus not ye what be i want for i repeat but at that instant my name be again thunder forth by the other boatswain 's mate and flute hurry I away hint that i would soon find out what the captain desire of I i swallow down my heart in I as i touch the spar-deck for a single instant balanced myself on my best center and then wholly ignorant of what be go to be allege against I advance to the dread tribunal of the frigate as i pass through the gangway i see the quarter-master rig the grating the boatswain with he green bag of scourge the master-at-arms ready to help off some one 's shirt again i make a desperate swallow of my whole soul in I and find myself stand before captain claret he flushed face obviously show he in ill-humour among the group of officer by he side be the first lieutenant who as i come aft eye I in such a manner that i plainly perceive he to be extremely vex at I for have be the innocent means of reflect upon the manner in which he keep up the discipline of the ship why be you not at you station sir ask the captain what station do you mean sir say i it be generally the custom with man-of-war 's - man to stand obsequiously touch they hat at every sentence they address to the captain but as this be not obligatory upon I by the article of war i do not do so upon the present occasion and previously i have never have the dangerous honor of a personal interview with captain claret he quickly notice my omission of the homage usually render he and instinct tell I that to a certain extent it set he heart against I what station sir do you mean say i you pretend ignorance he reply it will not help you sir glance at the captain the first lieutenant now produce the station bill and read my name in connection with that of the starboard main-lift captain claret say i it be the first time i ever hear of my be assign to that post how be this mr bridewell he say turn to the first lieutenant with a fault-finding expression it be impossible sir say that officer strive to hide he vexation but this man must have know he station i have never know it before this moment captain claret say i do you contradict my officer he return i shall flog you i have now be on board the frigate upward of a year and remain unscourged the ship be homeward-bound and in a few week at most i would be a free man and now after make a hermit of myself in some thing in order to avoid the possibility of the scourge here it be hang over I for a thing utterly unforeseen for a crime of which i be as utterly innocent but all that be as naught i see that my case be hopeless my solemn disclaimer be throw in my tooth and the boatswain 's mate stand curl he finger through the _ cat _ there be time when wild thought enter a man 's heart when he seem almost irresponsible for he act and he deed the captain stand on the weather-side of the deck sideways on a unobstructed line with he be the opening of the lee-gangway where the side-ladder be suspend in port nothing but a slight bit of sinnate-stuff serve to rail in this opening which be cut right down to the level of the captain 's foot show the far sea beyond i stand a little to windward of he and though he be a large powerful man it be certain that a sudden rush against he along the slanting deck would infallibly pitch he headforemost into the ocean though he who so rush must need go over with he my blood seem clotting in my vein i feel icy cold at the tip of my finger and a dimness be before my eye but through that dimness the boatswain 's mate scourge in hand loom like a giant and captain claret and the blue sea see through the opening at the gangway show with a awful vividness i can not analyze my heart though it then stand still within I but the thing that sway I to my purpose be not altogether the thought that captain claret be about to degrade I and that i have take a oath with my soul that he should not no i feel my man 's manhood so bottomless within I that no word no blow no scourge of captain claret could cut I deep enough for that i but swing to a instinct in I -- the instinct diffuse through all animated nature the same that prompt even a worm to turn under the heel lock souls-with he i mean to drag captain claret from this earthly tribunal of he to that of jehovah and let he decide between we no other way could i escape the scourge nature have not implant any power in man that be not mean to be exercise at time though too often we power have be abuse the privilege inborn and inalienable that every man have of die himself and inflict death upon another be not give to we without a purpose these be the last resource of a insult and unendurable existence to the grating sir say captain claret do you hear my eye be measure the distance between he and the sea captain claret say a voice advance from the crowd i turn to see who this might be that audaciously interpose at a juncture like this it be the same remarkably handsome and gentlemanly corporal of marine colbrook who have be previously allude to in the chapter describe killing time in a man-of-war i know that man say colbrook touch he cap and speaking in a mild firm but extremely deferential manner and i know that he would not be find absent from he station if he know where it be this speech be almost unprecedented seldom or never before have a marine dare to speak to the captain of a frigate in behalf of a seaman at the mast but there be something so unostentatiously command in the calm manner of the man that the captain though astounded do not in any way reprimand he the very unusualness of he interference seem colbrook 's protection take heart perhaps from colbrook 's example jack chase interpose and in a manly but carefully respectful manner in substance repeat the corporal 's remark add that he have never find I want in the top the captain look from chase to colbrook and from colbrook to chase -- one the foremost man among the seaman the other the foremost man among the soldier -- then all round upon the packed and silent crew and as if a slave to fate though supreme captain of a frigate he turn to the first lieutenant make some indifferent remark and say to I _ you may go _ saunter aft into he cabin while i who in the desperation of my soul have but just escape be a murderer and a suicide almost burst into tear of thanks-giving where i stand chapter lxviii a man-of-war fountain and other thing let we forget the scourge and the gangway a while and jot down in we memory a few little thing pertain to we man-of-war world i let nothing slip however small and feel myself actuate by the same motive which have prompt many worthy old chronicler to set down the merest trifle concern thing that be destine to pass away entirely from the earth and which if not preserve in the nick of time must infallibly perish from the memory of man who know that this humble narrative may not hereafter prove the history of a obsolete barbarism who know that when men-of-war shall be no more white-jacket may not be quote to show to the people in the millennium what a man-of-war be god hasten the time lo ye year escort it hither and bless we eye ere we die there be no part of a frigate where you will see more go and come of stranger and overhear more greeting and gossiping of acquaintance than in the immediate vicinity of the scuttle-butt just forward of the main-hatchway on the gun-deck the scuttle-butt be a goodly round paint cask standing on end and with its upper head remove show a narrow circular shelf within where rest a number of tin cup for the accommodation of drinker central within the scuttle-butt itself stand a iron pump which connect with the immense water-tank in the hold furnish a unfailing supply of the much-admired pale ale first brew in the brook of the garden of eden and stamp with the _ brand _ of we old father adam who never know what wine be we be indebted to the old vintner noah for that the scuttle-butt be the only fountain in the ship and here alone can you drink unless at you meal night and day a armed sentry pace before it bayonet in hand to see that no water be take away except accord to law i wonder that they station no sentry at the port-hole to see that no air be breathe except accord to navy regulation as five hundred man come to drink at this scuttle-butt as it be often surround by officer ' servant draw water for they master to wash by the cook of the range who hither come to fill they coffee-pot and by the cook of the ship 's mess to procure water for they _ duff _ the scuttle-butt may be denominate the town-pump of the ship and would that my fine countryman hawthorne of salem have but serve on board a man-of-war in he time that he might give we the reading of a _ rill _ from the scuttle-butt \* \* \* \* \* as in all extensive establishment -- abbey arsenal college treasury metropolitan post-office and monastery -- there be many snug little niche wherein be ensconce certain superannuated old pensioner official and more especially as in most ecclesiastical establishment a few choice prebendary stall be to be find furnish with well-filled manger and rack so in a man-of-war there be a variety of similar snuggery for the benefit of decrepit or rheumatic old tar chief among these be the office of _ mast-man _ there be a stout rail on deck at the base of each mast where a number of _ brace lift _ and _ buntline _ be belay to the pin it be the sole duty of the mast-man to see that

and at the close of the day old abraham sit at the door of he tent bide he time to die so sit we old mast-man on the _ coat of the mast _ glance round he with patriarchal benignity and that mild

mast-man have be blow out of vesuvius to look alone at he scar blacken forehead chin and cheek but gaze down into he eye and though all the snow of time have drift higher and higher upon he brow yet deep down in that eye you behold a infantile sinless look the same that answer the glance of this old man 's mother when first she cry for the babe to be lay by she side that look be the fadeless ever

stage he can not be so August a personage after all but the mightiest potentate keep the most behind the veil you might tarry in constantinople a month and never catch a glimpse of the sultan the grand lama of thibet accord to some account be never behold by the people but if any one doubt the majesty of a commodore let he know that accord to xlii of the article of war he be invest with a prerogative which accord to monarchical jurist be inseparable from the throne -- the plenary pardoning power he may pardon all offence commit in the squadron under he command but this prerogative be only he while at sea or on a foreign station a circumstance peculiarly significant of the great difference between the stately absolutism of a commodore enthrone on he poop in a foreign harbor and a unlaced commodore negligently recline in a easy-chair in the bosom of he family at home chapter lxix prayer at the gun the training-day or general quarter now and then take place in we frigate have already be describe also the Sunday devotions on the half-deck but nothing have yet be say concern the daily morning and evening quarter when the man silently stand at they gun and the chaplain simply offer up a prayer let we now enlarge upon this matter we have plenty of time the occasion invite for behold the homeward-bound neversink bowl along over a jubilant sea shortly after breakfast the drum beat to quarter and among five hundred man scatter over all three deck and engage in all manner of way that sudden rolling march be magical as the monitory sound to which every good mussulman at sunset drop to the ground whatsoever he hand might have find to do and throughout all turkey the people in concert kneel toward they holy mecca the sailor run to and fro-some up the deck-ladder some down -- to gain they respective station in the shortest possible time in three minute all be compose one by one the various officer station over the separate division of the ship then approach the first lieutenant on the quarter-deck and report they respective man at they quarter it be curious to watch they countenance at this time a profound silence prevail and emerge through the hatchway from one of the lower deck a slender young officer appear hug he sword to he thigh and advance through the long lane of sailor at they gun he serious eye all the time fix upon the first lieutenant 's -- he polar star sometimes he essay a stately and graduate step a erect and martial bearing and seem full of the vast national importance of what he be about to communicate but when at last he gain he destination you be amaze to perceive that all he have to say be impart by a freemason touch of he cap and a bow he then turn and make off to he division perhaps pass several brother lieutenant all bind on the same errand he himself have just achieve for about five minute these officer be come and go bring in thrilling intelligence from all quarter of the frigate most stoically receive however by the first lieutenant with he leg apart so as to give a broad foundation for the superstructure of he dignity this gentleman stand stiff as a pike-staff on the quarter-deck one hand hold he sabre -- a appurtenance altogether unnecessary at the time and which he accordingly tuck point backward under he arm like a umbrella on a sun-shiny day the other hand be continually bob up and down to the leather front of he cap in response to the report and salute of he subordinate to whom he never deign to vouchsafe a syllable merely go through the motion of accept they news without bestow thanks for they pain this continual touch of cap between officer on board a man-of-war be the reason why you invariably notice that the glaze front of they cap look jade lack-lustre and worn sometimes slightly oleaginous -- though in other respects the cap may appear glossy and fresh but as for the first lieutenant he ought to have extra pay allow to he on account of he extraordinary outlay in cap front for he it be to whom all day long report of various kind be incessantly be make by the junior lieutenant and no report be make by they however trivial but cap be touch on the occasion it be obvious that these individual salute must be greatly multiply and aggregate upon the senior lieutenant who must return they all indeed when a subordinate officer be first promote to that rank he generally complain of the same exhaustion about the shoulder and elbow that la fayette mourn over when in visit america he do little else but shake the sturdy hand of patriotic farmer from sunrise to sunset the various officer of division have present they respects and make good they return to they station the first lieutenant turn round and march aft endeavor to catch the eye of the captain in order to touch he own cap to that personage and thereby without add a word of explanation communicate the fact of all hand be at they gun 's he be a sort of retort or receiver-general to concentrate the whole sum of the information impart to he and discharge it upon he superior at one touch of he cap front but sometimes the captain feel out of sort or in ill-humour or be pleased to be somewhat capricious or have a fancy to show a touch of he omnipotent supremacy or peradventure it have so happen that the first lieutenant have in some way pique or offend he and he be not unwilling to show a slight specimen of he dominion over he even before the eye of all hand at all event only by some one of these supposition can the singular circumstance be account for that frequently captain claret would pertinaciously promenade up and down the poop purposely avert he eye from the first lieutenant who would stand below in the most awkward suspense wait the first wink from he superior 's eye now i have he he must have say to himself as the captain would turn toward he in he walk now be my time and up would go he hand to he cap but alas the captain be off again and the man at the gun would cast sly wink at each other as the embarrassed lieutenant would bite he lip with suppress vexation upon some occasion this scene would be repeat several time till at last captain claret think that in the eye of all hand he dignity must by this time be pretty well bolster would stalk towards he subordinate look he full in the eye whereupon up go he hand to the cap front and the captain nod he acceptance of the report descend from he perch to the quarter-deck by this time the stately commodore slowly emerge from he cabin and soon stand lean alone against the brass rail of the after-hatchway in pass he the captain make a profound salutation which he superior return in token that the captain be at perfect liberty to proceed with the ceremony of the hour march on captain claret at last halt near the main-mast at the head of a group of the ward-room officer and by the side of the chaplain at a sign from he finger the brass band strike up the portuguese hymn this over from commodore to hammock-boy all hand uncover and the chaplain read a prayer upon its conclusion the drum beat the retreat and the ship 's company disappear from the gun at sea or in harbor this ceremony be repeat every morning and evening by those station on the quarter-deck the chaplain be distinctly hear but the quarter-deck gun division embrace but a tenth part of the ship 's company many of whom be below on the main-deck where not one syllable of the prayer can be hear this seem a great misfortune for i well know myself how bless and soothing it be to mingle twice every day in these peaceful devotions and with the commodore and captain and smallest boy unite in acknowledge almighty god there be also a touch of the temporary equality of the church about it exceedingly grateful to a man-of-war 's - man like I my carronade-gun happen to be directly opposite the brass railing against which the commodore invariably lean at prayer bring so close together twice every day for more than a year we could not but become intimately acquaint with each other 's face to this fortunate circumstance it be to be ascribe that some time after reach home we be able to recognize each other when we chance to meet in washington at a ball give by the russian minister the baron de bodisco and though while on board the frigate the commodore never in any manner personally address I -- nor do i he -- yet at the minister 's social entertainment we _ there _ become exceedingly chatty nor do i fail to observe among that crowd of foreign dignitary and magnate from all part of america that my worthy friend do not appear so exalted as when lean in solitary state against the brass railing of the neversink 's quarter-deck like many other gentleman he appear to the best advantage and be treat with the most deference in the bosom of he home the frigate we morning and evening quarter be agreeably diversify for some week by a little circumstance which to some of we at least always seem very please at callao half of the commodore 's cabin have be hospitably yield to the family of a certain aristocratic-looking magnate who be go ambassador from peru to the court of the brazil at rio this dignified diplomatist sport a long twirling mustache that almost envelop he mouth the sailor say he look like a rat with he tooth through a bunch of oakum or a st jago monkey peep through a prickly-pear bush he be accompany by a very beautiful wife and a still more beautiful little daughter about six year old between this dark-eyed little gipsy and we chaplain there soon spring up a cordial love and good feeling so much so that they be seldom apart and whenever the drum beat to quarter and the sailor be hurry to they station this little signorita would outrun they all to gain she own quarter at the capstan where she would stand by the chaplain 's side grasp he hand and look up archly in he face it be a sweet relief from the domineering sternness of we martial discipline -- a sternness not relax even at we devotions before the altar of the common god of commodore and cabin-boy -- to see that lovely little girl standing among the thirty-two pounder and now and then cast a wonder commiserate glance at the array of grim seaman around she chapter lxx monthly muster round the capstan besides general quarter and the regular morning and evening quarter for prayer on board the neversink on the first Sunday of every month we have a grand _ muster round the capstan _ when we pass in solemn review before the captain and officer who closely scan we frock and trowser to see whether they be accord to the navy cut in some ship every man be require to bring he bag and hammock along for inspection this ceremony acquire its chief solemnity and to a novice be render even terrible by the reading of the article of war by the captain 's clerk before the assemble ship 's company who in testimony of they enforced reverence for the code stand bareheaded till the last sentence be pronounced to a mere amateur reader the quiet perusal of these article of war would be attend with some nervous emotion imagine then what _ my _ feeling must have be when with my hat deferentially in my hand i stand before my lord and master captain claret and hear these article read as the law and gospel the infallible unappealable dispensation and code whereby i live and move and have my be on board of the united state ship neversink of some twenty offence -- make penal -- that a seaman may commit and which be specify in this code thirteen be punishable by death _ shall suffer death _ this be the burden of nearly every article read by the captain 's clerk for he seem to have be instruct to omit the longer article and only present those which be brief and to the point _ shall suffer death _ the repeat announcement fall on you ear like the intermit discharge of artillery after it have be repeat again and again you listen to the reader as he deliberately begin a new paragraph you hear he recite the involve but comprehensive and clear arrangement of the sentence detail all possible particulars of the offence describe and you breathlessly await whether _ that _ clause also be go to be conclude by the discharge of the terrible minute-gun when lo it again boom on you ear -- _ shall suffer death _ no reservation no contingency not the remotest promise of pardon or reprieve not a glimpse of commutation of the sentence all hope and consolation be shut out -- _ shall suffer death _ that be the simple fact for you to digest and it be a tougher morsel believe white-jacket when he say it than a forty-two-pound cannon-ball but there be a glimmering of a alternative to the sailor who infringe these article some of they thus terminate : _ shall suffer death or such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge _ but hint this at a penalty still more serious perhaps it mean _ death or worse punishment _ you honor of the spanish inquisition loyolum and torquemada produce reverend gentleman you most secret code and match these article of war if you can jack ketch _ you _ also be experience in these thing thou most benevolent of mortal who standest by we and hangest round we neck when all the rest of this world be against we -- tell we hangman what punishment be this horribly hint at as be worse than death be it upon a empty stomach to read the article of war every morning for the term of one 's natural life or be it to be imprison in a cell with its wall paper from floor to ceiling with print copy in italics of these article of war but it need not to dilate upon the pure bubble milk of human kindness and christian charity and forgiveness of injury which pervade this charming document so thoroughly imbue as a christian code with the benignant spirit of the sermon on the mount but as it be very nearly alike in the foremost state of christendom and as it be nationally set forth by those state it indirectly become a index to the true condition of the present civilization of the world as month after month i would stand bareheaded among my shipmate and hear this document read i have think to myself well well white-jacket you be in a sad box indeed but prick you ear there go another minute-gun it admonish you to take all bad usage in good part and never to join in any public meeting that may be hold on the gun-deck for a redress of grievance

art xx if any person in the navy shall sleep upon he watch he shall suffer death murderous but then in time of peace they do not enforce these blood-thirsty law do they not indeed what happen to those

three american white-jacket -- those three sailor even as you who once be alive but now be dead _ shall suffer death _ those be the three word that hang those three sailor have a care then have a care lest you come to a sad end even the end of a rope lest with a black-and-blue throat you turn a dumb diver after pearl-shell put to bed for ever and tuck in in you own hammock at the bottom of the sea and there you will lie white-jacket while hostile navy be play cannon-ball billiards over you grave by the main-mast then in a time of profound peace i be subject to the cut-throat martial law and when my own brother who happen to be dwelling ashore and do not serve he country as i be now do -- when _ he _ be at liberty to call personally upon the president of the united state and express he disapprobation of the whole national administration here be i liable at any time to be run up at the yard-arm with a necklace make by no jeweler round my neck a hard case truly white-jacket but it can

then the martial law might hunt you straight through the other world and out again at its other end follow you through all eternity like a endless thread on the inevitable track of its own point pass unnumbered needle through chapter lxxi the genealogy of the article of war as the article of war form the ark and constitution of the penal law of the american navy in all sobriety and earnestness it may be well to glance at they origin whence come they and how be it that one arm of the national defence of a republic come to be rule by a turkish code whose every section almost like each of the tube of a revolving pistol fire nothing short of death into the heart of a offender how come it that by virtue of a law solemnly ratify by a congress of freeman the representative of freeman thousand of american be subject to the most despotic usage and from the dockyard of a republic absolute monarchy be launch with the glorious star and stripe for a ensign by what unparalleled anomaly by what monstrous grafting of tyranny upon freedom do these article of war ever come to be so much as hear of in the american navy whence come they they can not be the indigenous growth of those political institution which be base upon that arch-democrat thoma jefferson 's declaration of independence no they be a importation from abroad even from britain whose law we american hurl off as tyrannical and yet retain the most tyrannical of all but we stop not here for these article of war have they congenial origin in a period of the history of britain when the puritan republic have yield to a monarchy restore when a hangman judge jeffrey sentence a world 's champion like algernon sidney to the block when one of a race by some deem accursed of god -- even a stuart be on the throne and a stuart also be at the head of the navy as lord high admiral one the son of a king behead for encroachment upon the rights of he people and the other he own brother afterward a king jame ii who be hurl from the throne for he tyranny this be the origin of the article of war and it carry with it a unmistakable clew to they despotism -lrb- 4 -rrb- -- -lrb- footnote-4 -rrb- the first naval article of war in the english language be pass in the thirteenth year of the reign of charle the second under the title of _ a act for establish article and order for the regulating and better government of he majesty 's navy ships-of-war and force by sea _ this act be repeal and so far as concern the officer a modification of it substitute in the twenty-second year of the reign of george the second shortly after the peace of aix la chapelle just one century ago this last act it be believe comprise in substance the article of war at this day in force in the british navy it be not a little curious nor without mean that neither of these act explicitly empower a officer to inflict the lash it would almost seem as if in this case the british lawgiver be willing to leave such a stigma out of a organic statute and bestow the power of the lash in some less solemn and perhaps less public manner indeed the only broad enactment directly sanction naval scourging at sea be to be find in the united state statute book and in the sea law of the absolute monarch loui le grand of france -lrb- 41 -rrb- take for they basis the above-mentioned british naval code and ingrafting upon it the positive scourging law which britain be loth to recognize as organic statute we american lawgiver in the year 1800 frame the article of war now govern the american navy they may be find in the second volume of the united state statute at large under chapter xxxiii -- a act for the _ better _ government of the navy of the united state -lrb- 41 -rrb- for reference to the latter -lrb- l'ord de la marine -rrb- _ vide _ curti 's treatise on the rights and duty of merchant-seamen accord to the general maritime law part ii c i -- nor be it a dumb thing that the man who in democratic cromwell 's time first prove to the nation the toughness of the british oak and the hardihood of the british sailor -- that in cromwell 's time whose fleet strike terror into the cruiser of france spain portugal and holland and the corsair of algier and the levant in cromwell 's time when robert blake sweep the narrow sea of all the keel of a dutch admiral who insultingly carry a broom at he fore-mast it be not a dumb thing that at a period deem so glorious to the british navy these article of war be unknown nevertheless it be grant that some law or other must have govern blake 's sailor at that period but they must have be far less severe than those lay down in the write code which supersede they since accord to the father-in-law of jame ii the historian of the rebellion the english navy prior to the enforcement of the new code be full of officer and sailor who of all man be the most republican moreover the same author inform we that the first work undertake by he respected son-in-law then duke of york upon enter on the duty of lord high admiral be to have a grand re-christening of the men-of-war which still carry on they stern name too democratic to suit he high-tory ear but if these article of war be unknown in blake 's time and also during the most brilliant period of admiral benbow 's career what inference must follow that such tyrannical ordinance be not indispensable -- even during war -- to the highest possible efficiency of a military marine chapter lxxii herein be the good ordinance of the sea which wise man who voyage round the world give to we ancestor and which constitute the book of the science of good custom -- _ the consulate of the sea _ the present usage of the american navy be such that though there be no government enactment to that effect yet in many respect its commander seem virtually invest with the power to observe or violate as seem to they fit several of the article of war accord to article xv _ no person in the navy shall quarrel with any other person in the navy nor use provoke or reproachful word gesture or menace on pain of such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge _ _ provoke or reproachful word _ officer of the navy answer I have you not many of you a thousand time violate this law and address to man whose tongue be tie by this very article language which no landsman would ever hearken to without fly at the throat of he insulter i know that worse word than _ you _ ever use be to be hear address by a merchant-captain to he crew but the merchant-captain do not live under this xvth article of war not to make a example of he nor to gratify any personal feeling but to furnish one certain illustration of what be here assert i honestly declare that captain claret of the neversink repeatedly violate this law in he own proper person accord to article iii no officer or other person in the navy shall be guilty of oppression fraud profane swearing drunkenness or any other scandalous conduct again let I ask you officer of the navy whether many of you have not repeatedly and in more than one particular violate this law and here again as a certain illustration i must once more cite captain claret as a offender especially in the matter of profane swearing i must also cite four of the lieutenant some eight of the midshipman and nearly all the seaman additional article might be quote that be habitually violate by the officer while nearly all those _ exclusively _ refer to the sailor be unscrupulously enforce yet those article by which the sailor be scourge at the gangway be not one whit more law than those _ other _ article bind upon the officer that have become obsolete from immemorial disuse while still other article to which the sailor alone be obnoxious be observe or violate at the caprice of the captain now if it be not so much the severity as the certainty of punishment that deter from transgression how fatal to all proper reverence for the enactment of congress must be this disregard of its statute still more this violation of the law on the part of the officer in many case involve oppression to the sailor but throughout the whole naval code which so hem in the mariner by law upon law and which invest the captain with so much judicial and administrative authority over he -- in most case entirely discretionary -- not one solitary clause be to be find which in any way provide means for a seaman deem himself aggrieved to obtain redress indeed both the write and unwritten law of the american navy be as destitute of individual guarantee to the mass of seaman as the statute book of the despotic empire of russium who put this great gulf between the american captain and the american sailor or be the captain a creature of like passion with ourselves or be he a infallible archangel incapable of the shadow of error or have a sailor no mark of humanity no attribute of manhood that bind hand and foot he be cast into a american frigate shear of all rights and defence while the notorious lawlessness of the commander have pass into a proverb familiar to man-of-war 's - man _ the law be not make for the captain _ indeed he may almost be say to put off the citizen when he touch he quarter-deck and almost exempt from the law of the land himself he come down upon other with a judicial severity unknown on the national soil with the article of war in one hand and the cat-o ' - nine-tail in the other he stand a undignified parody upon mohammed enforce moslemism with the sword and the koran the conclude section of the article of war treat of the naval courts-martial before which officer be try for serious offence as well as the seaman the oath administer to member of these court -- which sometimes sit upon matter of life and death -- explicitly enjoin that the member shall not at any time divulge the vote or opinion of any particular member of the court unless require so to do before a court of justice in due course of law here then be a council of ten and a star chamber indeed remember also that though the sailor be sometimes try for he life before a tribunal like this in no case do he fellow-sailor he peer form part of the court yet that a man should be try by he peer be the fundamental principle of all civilised jurisprudence and not only try by he peer but he peer must be unanimous to render a verdict whereas in a court-martial the concurrence of a majority of conventional and social superior be all that be requisite in the english navy it be say they have a law which authorise the sailor to appeal if he choose from the decision of the captain -- even in a comparatively trivial case -- to the higher tribunal of a court-martial it be a english seaman who relate this to I when i say that such a law must be a fatal clog to the exercise of the penal power in the captain he in substance tell I the follow story a top-man guilty of drunkenness be send to the grating and the scourge about to be inflict he turn round and demand a court-martial the captain smile and order he to be take down and put into the brig there he be keep in iron some week when despair of be liberate he offer to compromise at two dozen lash sick of you bargain then be you say the captain no no a court-martial you demand and a court-martial you shall have be at last try before the bar of quarter-deck officer he be condemn to two hundred lash what for for he have be drunk no for he have have the insolence to appeal from a authority in maintain which the man who try and condemn he have so strong a sympathetic interest whether this story be wholly true or not or whether the particular law involve prevail or ever do prevail in the english navy the thing nevertheless illustrate the idea that man-of-war 's - man themselves have touch the tribunal in question what can be expect from a court whose deed be do in the darkness of the recluse court of the spanish inquisition when that darkness be solemnise by a oath on the bible when a oligarchy of epaulet sit upon the bench and a plebeian top-man without a jury stand judicially naked at the bar in view of these thing and especially in view of the fact that in several case the degree of punishment inflict upon a man-of-war 's - man be absolutely leave to the discretion of the court what shame should american legislator take to themselves that with perfect truth we may apply to the entire body of the american man-of-war 's - man that infallible principle of sir edward coke : it be one of the genuine mark of servitude to have the law either conceal or precarious but still better may we subscribe to the say of sir matthew hale in he history of the common law that the martial law be base upon no settle principle be in truth and reality no law but something indulge rather than allow as a law i know it may be say that the whole nature of this naval code be purposely adapt to the war exigency of the navy but waive the grave question that might be raise concern the moral not judicial lawfulness of this arbitrary code even in time of war be it ask why it be in force during a time of peace the united state have now exist as a nation upward of seventy year and in all that time the alleged necessity for the operation of the naval code -- in case deem capital -- have only exist during a period of two or three year at most some may urge that the severest operation of the code be tacitly make null in time of peace but though with respect to several of the article this hold true yet at any time any and all of they may be legally enforce nor have there be want recent instance illustrate the spirit of this code even in case where the letter of the code be not altogether observe the well-known case of a united state brig furnish a memorable example which at any moment may be repeat three man in a time of peace be then hang at the yard-arm merely because in the captain 's judgment it become necessary to hang they to this day the question of they complete guilt be socially discuss how shall we characterise such a deed say black-stone if any one that have commission of martial authority doth in time of peace hang or otherwise execute any man by color of martial law this be murder for it be against magna charta \* -lrb- \* commentary b i c xiii -rrb- magna charta we modern who may be landsman may justly boast of civil immunity not possess by we forefather but we remoter forefather who happen to be mariner may straighten themselves even in they ash to think that they lawgiver be wiser and more humane in they generation than we lawgiver in ours compare the sea-law of we navy with the roman and rhodian ocean ordinance compare they with the consulate of the sea compare they with the law of the hanse town compare they with the ancient wisbury law in the last we find that they be ocean democrat in those day if he strike he ought to receive blow for blow thus speak out the wisbury law concern a gothland sea-captain in final reference to all that have be say in previous chapter touch the severity and unusualness of the law of the american navy and the large authority vest in its commanding officer be it here observe that white-jacket be not unaware of the fact that the responsibility of a officer command at sea -- whether in the merchant service or the national marine -- be unparalleled by that of any other relation in which man may stand to man nor be he unmindful that both wisdom and humanity dictate that from the peculiarity of he position a sea-officer in command should be clothe with a degree of authority and discretion inadmissible in any master ashore but at the same time these principle -- recognize by all writer on maritime law -- have undoubtedly furnished warrant for clothing modern sea-commander and naval courts-martial with power which exceed the due limit of reason and necessity nor be this the only instance where right and salutary principle in themselves almost self-evident and infallible have be advance in justification of thing which in themselves be just as self-evidently wrong and pernicious be it here once and for all understand that no sentimental and theoretic love for the common sailor no romantic belief in that peculiar noble-heartedness and exaggerated generosity of disposition fictitiously imputed to he in novel and no prevail desire to gain the reputation of be he friend have actuate I in anything i have say in any part of this work touch the gross oppression under which i know that the sailor suffer indifferent as to who may be the party concerned i but desire to see wrong thing right and equal justice administer to all nor as have be elsewhere hint be the general ignorance or depravity of any race of man to be allege as a apology for tyranny over they on the contrary it can not admit of a reasonable doubt in any unbiased mind conversant with the interior life of a man-of-war that most of the sailor iniquity practice therein be indirectly to be ascribe to the morally debasing effect of the unjust despotic and degrading law under which the man-of-war 's - man live chapter lxxiii night and day gambling in a man-of-war mention have be make that the game of draught or checkers be permit to be play on board the neversink at the present time while there be little or no shipwork to be do and all hand in high spirit be sail homeward over the warm smooth sea of the tropics so numerous become the player scatter about the deck that we first lieutenant use ironically to say that it be a pity they be not tesselate with square of white and black marble for the express benefit and convenience of the player have this gentleman have he way we checker-board would very soon have be pitch out of the port but the captain -- usually lenient in some thing -- permit they and so mr bridewell be fain to hold he peace but although this one game be allowable in the frigate all kind of gambling be strictly interdict under the penalty of the gangway nor be card or dice tolerate in any way whatever this regulation be indispensable for of all human being man-of-war 's - man be perhaps the most inclined to gamble the reason must be obvious to any one who reflect upon they condition on shipboard and gambling -- the most mischievous of vice anywhere -- in a man-of-war operate still more perniciously than on shore but quite as often as the law against smuggling spirit be transgress by the unscrupulous sailor the statute against card and dice be evade sable night which since the beginning of the world have wink and look on at so many deed of iniquity -- night be the time usually select for they operation by man-of-war gambler the place pitch upon be generally the berth-deck where the hammock be swing and which be light so stintedly as not to disturb the sleep seaman with any obtruding glare in so spacious a area the two lantern swing from the stanchion diffuse a subdue illumination like a night-taper in the apartment of some invalid owing to they position also these lantern be far from shed a impartial light however dim but fling long angular ray here and there like burglar 's dark-lantern in the fifty-acre vault of the west indium dock on the thame it may well be imagine therefore how well adapt be this mysterious and subterranean hall of ebli to the clandestine proceedings of gambler especially as the hammock not only hang thickly but many of they swing very low within two foot of the floor thus form innumerable little canvas glen grotto nook corner and cranny where a good deal of wickedness may be practice by the wary with considerable impunity now the master-at-arms assist by he mate the ship 's corporal reign supreme in these bowels of the ship throughout the night these policeman relieve each other at stand guard over the premise and except when the watch be call they sit in the midst of a profound silence only invade by trumpeter ' snore or the rambling of some old sheet-anchor-man in he sleep the two ship 's corporal go among the sailor by the name of legg and pounce pounce have be a policeman it be say in liverpool legg a turnkey attach to the tomb in new york hence they education eminently fit they for they station and bland the master-at-arms ravish with they dexterity in prying out offender use to call they he two right hand when man-of-war 's - man desire to gamble they appoint the hour and select some certain corner in some certain shadow behind some certain hammock they then contribute a small sum toward a joint fund to be invest in a bribe for some argus-eyed shipmate who shall play the part of a spy upon the master-at-arms and corporal while the gaming be in progress in nine case out of ten these arrangement be so cunning and comprehensive that the gambler elude all vigilance conclude they game unmolested but now and then seduce into unwariness or perhaps from parsimony be unwilling to employ the service of a spy they be suddenly light upon by the constable remorselessly collar and drag into the brig there to await a dozen lash in the morning several time at midnight i have be startle out of a sound sleep by a sudden violent rush under my hammock cause by the abrupt break up of some nest of gambler who have scatter in all direction brushing under the tier of swing pallet and set they all in a rock commotion it be however while lay in port that gamble most thrive in a man-of-war then the man frequently practice they dark deed in the light of the day and the additional guard which at such time they deem indispensable be not unworthy of note more especially they extra precaution in engage the service of several spy necessitate a considerable expenditure so that in port the diversion of gambling rise to the dignity of a nabob luxury during the day the master-at-arms and he corporal be continually prowl about on all three deck eager to spy out iniquity at one time for example you see legg switch he magisterial rattan and lurk round the fore-mast on the spar-deck the next moment perhaps he be three deck down out of sight prowling among the cable-tier just so with he master and pounce he coadjutor they be here there and everywhere seemingly gifted with ubiquity in order successfully to carry on they proceedings by day the gambler must see to it that each of these constable be relentlessly dog wherever he go so that in case of he approach toward the spot where themselves be engage they may be warn of the fact in time to make good they escape accordingly light and active scout be select to follow the constable about from they youthful alertness and activity the boy of the mizzen-top be generally choose for this purpose but this be not all onboard of most men-of-war there be a set of sly knavish fox among the crew destitute of every principle of honor and on a par with irish informer in man-of-war parlance they come under the denomination of _ fancy-men _ and _ white-mouse _ they be call _ fancy-men _ because from they zeal in craftily report offender they be presume to be regard with high favor by some of the officer though it be seldom that these informer can be certainly individualise so secret and subtle be they in lay they information yet certain of the crew and especially certain of the marine be invariably suspect to be _ fancy-men _ and _ white-mouse _ and be accordingly more or less hate by they comrade now in addition to have a eye on the master-at-arms and he aid the day-gambler must see to it that every person suspect of be a _ white-mouse _ or _ fancy-man _ be like-wise dogged wherever he go additional scout be retain constantly to snuff at they trail but the mystery of man-of-war vice be wonderful and it be now to be record that from long habit and observation and familiarity with the _ guardo move _ and _ maneuver _ of a frigate the master-at-arms and he aid can almost invariably tell when any gambling be go on by day though in the crowded vessel abound in deck top dark place and outlandish corner of all sort they may not be able to pounce upon the identical spot where the gambler be hide during the period that bland be suspend from he office as master-at-arms a person who among the sailor go by the name of sneak have be long suspect to have be a _ white-mouse _ be put in bland 's place he prove a hangdog sidelong catch-thief but gifted with a marvellous perseverance in ferret out culprit follow in they track like a inevitable cuba blood-hound with he noiseless nose when disconcert however you sometimes hear he bay the muffle dice be somewhere around sneak would say to he aid there be they three chap there be dog I about for the last half-hour i say pounce have any one be scout around _ you _ this morning four on 'em say pounce i know would it i know would the muffle dice be rattlin ' legg say the master-at-arms to he other aid legg how be it with _ you _ -- any spy ten on ' em say legg there be one on 'em now -- that fellow stitch a hat halloo you sir cry the master-at-arms top you boom and sail large now if i see you about I again i 'll have you up to the mast what be i a-doin ' now say the hat-stitcher with a face as long as a rope-walk can not a feller be workin ' here without be ` spect of tom coxe 's traverse up one ladder and down t ` other oh i know the move sir i have be on board a _ guardo _ top you boom i say and be off or i 'll have you haul up and rivet in a clinch -- both fore-tack over the main-yard and no bloody knife to cut the seize sheer or i 'll pitch into you like a shin of beef into a beggar 's wallet it be often observable that in vessel of all kind the man who talk the most sailor lingo be the least sailor-like in reality you may sometimes hear even marine jerk out more salt phrase than the captain of the forecastle himself on the other hand when not actively engage in he vocation you would take the best specimen of a seaman for a landsman when you see a fellow yawn about the dock like a homeward-bound indiaman a long commodore 's pennant of black ribbon fly from he mast-head and fetch up at a grog-shop with a slew of he hull as if a admiral be come alongside a three-decker in he barge you may put that man down for what man-of-war 's - man call a _ damn-my-eyes-tar _ that be a humbug and many damn-my-eyes hum-bug there be in this man-of-war world of ours chapter lxxiv the main-top at night the whole of we run from rio to the line be one delightful yachting so far as fine weather and the ship 's sailing be concern it be especially pleasant when we quarter-watch lounge in the main-top divert ourselves in many agreeable way remove from the immediate presence of the officer we there harmlessly enjoy ourselves more than in any other part of the ship by day many of we be very industrious make hat or mend we clothes but by night we become more romantically inclined often jack chase a enthusiastic admirer of sea-scenery would direct we attention to the moonlight on the wave by fine snatch from he catalogue of poet i shall never forget the lyric air with which one morning at dawn of day when all the east be flush with red and gold he stand lean against the top-mast shroud and stretch he bold hand over the sea exclaim here come aurora : top-mate see and in a liquid long-lingering tone he recite the line with gentle hand as seeming oft to pause the purple curtain of the morn she draw commodore camoen white-jacket -- but bear a hand there we must rig out that stun ' - sail boom -- the wind be shift from we lofty perch of a moonlight night the frigate itself be a glorious sight she be go large before the wind she stun ' - sail set on both side so that the canvas on the main-mast and fore-mast present the appearance of majestic taper pyramid more than a hundred foot broad at the base and terminate in the cloud with the light copestone of the royal that immense area of snow-white canvas slide along the sea be indeed a magnificent spectacle the three shroud mast look like the apparition of three gigantic turkish emir stride over the ocean nor at time be the sound of music want to augment the poetry of the scene the whole band would be assemble on the poop regale the officer and incidentally ourselves with they fine old air to these some of we would occasionally dance in the _ top _ which be almost as large as a ordinary size parlor when the instrumental melody of the band be not to be have we nightingale muster they voice and give we a song upon these occasion jack chase be often call out and regale we in he own free and noble style with the _ spanish lady _ -- a favorite thing with british man-of-war 's - man -- and many other salt-sea ballad and ditty include sir patrick spen be the best sailor that ever sail the sea also and three time around spin we gallant ship three time around spin she three time around spin we gallant ship and she go to the bottom of the sea -- the sea the sea the sea and she go to the bottom of the sea these song would be vary by sundry _ yarn _ and _ twister _ of the top-men and it be at these time that i always endeavor to draw out the oldest triton into narrative of the war-service they have see there be but few of they it be true who have be in action but that only make they narrative the more valuable there be a old negro who go by the name of tawney a sheet-anchor-man whom we often invite into we top of tranquil night to hear he discourse he be a staid and sober seaman very intelligent with a fine frank bearing one of the best man in the ship and hold in high estimation by every one it seem that during the last war between england and america he have with several other be impress upon the high sea out of a new england merchantman the ship that impress he be a english frigate the macedonian afterward take by the neversink the ship in which we be sail it be the holy sabbath accord to tawney and as the briton bear down on the american -- she man at they quarter -- tawney and he countryman who happen to be station at the quarter-deck battery respectfully accost the captain -- a old man by the name of cardan -- as he pass they in he rapid promenade he spy-glass under he arm again they assure he that they be not englishman and that it be a most bitter thing to lift they hand against the flag of that country which harbour the mother that bear they they conjure he to release they from they gun and allow they to remain neutral during the conflict but when a ship of any nation be run into action it be no time for argument small time for justice and not much time for humanity snatch a pistol from the belt of a boarder standing by the captain level it at the head of the three sailor and command they instantly to they quarter under penalty of be shoot on the spot so side by side with he country 's foe tawney and he companion toil at the gun and fight out the fight to the last with the exception of one of they who be kill at he post by one of he own country 's ball at length have lose she fore and main-top-mast and she mizzen-mast have be shoot away to the deck and she fore-yard lie in two piece on she shattered forecastle and in a hundred place have be _ hull _ with round shot the english frigate be reduce to the last extremity captain cardan order he signal quarter-master to strike the flag tawney be one of those who at last help pull he on board the neversink as he touch the deck cardan salute decatur the hostile commander and offer he sword but it be courteously decline perhaps the victor remember the dinner party that he and the englishman have enjoy together in norfolk just previous to the break out of hostility -- and while both be in command of the very frigate now cripple on the sea the macedonian it seem have go into norfolk with dispatch _ then _ they have laugh and joke over they wine and a wager of a beaver hat be say to have be make between they upon the event of the hostile meeting of they ship gaze upon the heavy battery before he cardan say to decatur this be a seventy-four not a frigate no wonder the day be yours this remark be found upon the neversink 's superiority in gun the neversink 's main-deck-battery then consist as now of twenty-four-pounder the macedonian 's of only eighteen in all the neversink number fifty-four gun and four hundred and fifty man the macedonian forty-nine gun and three hundred man a very great disparity which unite to the other circumstance of this action deprive the victory of all claim to glory beyond those that might be set up by a river-horse get the better of a seal but if tawney speak truth -- and he be a truth-telling man this fact seem counterbalance by a circumstance he relate when the gun of the englishman be examine after the engagement in more than one instance the wad be find ram against the cartridge without intercept the ball and though in a frantic sea-fight such a thing might be imputed to hurry and remissness yet tawney a stickler for he tribe always ascribe it to quite a different and less honorable cause but even grant the cause he assign to have be the true one it do not involve anything inimical to the general valor display by the british crew yet from all that may be learn from candid person who have be in sea-fight there can be but little doubt that on board of all ship of whatever nation in time of action no very small number of the man be exceedingly nervous to say the least at the gun ram and sponge at a venture and what special patriotic interest could a impressed man for instance take in a fight into which he have be drag from the arm of he wife or be it to be wonder at that impressed english seaman have not scruple in time of war to cripple the arm that have enslave they during the same general war which prevail at and previous to the period of the frigate-action here speak of a british flag-officer in write to the admiralty say everything appear to be quiet in the fleet but in prepare for battle last week several of the gun in the after part of the ship be find to be spike that be to say render useless who have spike they the dissatisfied seaman be it altogether improbable then that the gun to which tawney refer be man by man who purposely refrain from make they tell on the foe that in this one action the victory america gain be partly win for she by the sulky insubordination of the enemy himself during this same period of general war it be frequently the case that the gun of english armed ship be find in the morning with they breeching cut over night this maiming of the gun and for the time incapacitate they be only to be imputed to that secret spirit of hatred to the service which induce the spiking above refer to but even in case where no deep-seated dissatisfaction be presume to prevail among the crew and where a seaman in time of action impel by pure fear shirk from he gun it seem but fly in the face of he who make such a seaman what he constitutionally be to sew _ coward _ upon he back and degrade and agonise the already tremble wretch in numberless other way nor seem it a practice warrant by the sermon on the mount for the officer of a battery in time of battle to stand over the man with he draw sword -lrb- as be do in the macedonian -rrb- and run through on the spot the first seaman who show a semblance of fear tawney tell I that he distinctly hear this order give by the english captain to he officer of division be the secret history of all sea-fight write the laurel of sea-hero would turn to ash on they brow and how nationally disgraceful in every conceivable point of view be the iv of we american article of war : if any person in the navy shall pusillanimously cry for quarter he shall suffer death thus with death before he face from the foe and death behind he back from he countryman the best valor of a man-of-war 's - man can never assume the merit of a noble spontaneousness in this as in every other case the article of war hold out no reward for good conduct but only compel the sailor to fight like a hire murderer for he pay by digging he grave before he eye if he hesitate but this article iv be open to still graver objection courage be the most common and vulgar of the virtue the only one share with we by the beast of the field the one most apt by excess to run into viciousness and since nature generally take away with one hand to counter-balance she gift with the other excessive animal courage in many case only find room in a character vacate of loftier thing but in a naval officer animal courage be exalt to the loftiest merit and often procure he a distinguished command hence if some brainless bravo be captain of a frigate in action he may fight she against invincible odds and seek to crown himself with the glory of the shambles by permit he hopeless crew to be butcher before he eye while at the same time that crew must consent to be slaughter by the foe under penalty of be murder by the law look at the engagement between the american frigate essex with the two english cruiser the phoebe and cherub off the bay of valparaiso during the late war it be admit on all hand that the american captain continue to fight he cripple ship against a greatly superior force and when at last it become physically impossible that he could ever be otherwise than vanquish in the end and when from peculiarly unfortunate circumstance he man merely stand up to they nearly useless battery to be dismember and blow to piece by the incessant fire of the enemy 's long gun nor by thus continue to fight do this american frigate one iota promote the true interest of she country i seek not to underrate any reputation which the american captain may have gain by this battle he be a brave man _ that _ no sailor will deny but the whole world be make up of brave man yet i would not be at all understand as impugn he special good name nevertheless it be not to be doubt that if there be any common-sense sailor at the gun of the essex however valiant they may have be those common-sense sailor must have greatly prefer to strike they flag when they see the day be fairly lose than postpone that inevitable act till there be few american arm leave to assist in haul it down yet have these man under these circumstance pusillanimously cry for quarter by the iv article of war they might have be legally hung accord to the negro tawney when the captain of the macedonian -- see that the neversink have he vessel completely in she power -- give the word to strike the flag one of he officer a man hate by the seaman for he tyranny howl out the most terrific remonstrance swearing that for he part he would not give up but be for sink the macedonian alongside the enemy have he be captain doubtless he would have do so thereby gain the name of a hero in this world -- but what would they have call he in the next but as the whole matter of war be a thing that smite common-sense and christianity in the face so everything connect with it be utterly foolish unchristian barbarous brutal and savor of the feejee island cannibalism saltpetre and the devil it be generally the case in a man-of-war when she strike she flag that all discipline be at a end and the man for a time be ungovernable this be so on board of the english frigate the spirit-room be break open and bucket of grog be pass along the deck where many of the wound be lie between the gun these mariner seize the bucket and spite of all remonstrance gulp down the burning spirit till as tawney say the blood suddenly spirt out of they wound and they fall dead to the deck the negro have many more story to tell of this fight and frequently he would escort I along we main-deck battery -- still mount the same gun use in the battle -- point out they ineffaceable indentation and scar coat over with the accumulate paint of more than thirty year they be almost invisible to a casual eye but tawney know they all by heart for he have return home in the neversink and have behold these scar shortly after the engagement one afternoon i be walk with he along the gun-deck when he pause abreast of the main-mast this part of the ship say he we call the _ slaughter-house _ on board the macedonian here the man fall five and six at a time a enemy always direct its shot here in order to hurl over the mast if possible the beam and carline overhead in the macedonian _ slaughter-house _ be spatter with blood and brain about the hatchway it look like a butcher 's stall bit of human flesh sticking in the ring-bolt a pig that run about the deck escape unharmed but he hide be so clotted with blood from root among the pool of gore that when the ship strike the sailor heave the animal overboard swearing that it would be rank cannibalism to eat he another quadrup a goat lose its fore leg in this fight the sailor who be kill -- accord to the usual custom -- be order to be throw overboard as soon as they fall no doubt as the negro say that the sight of so many corpse lie around might not appall the survivor at the gun among other instance he relate the follow a shot enter one of the port-hole dash dead two third of a gun 's crew the captain of the next gun drop he lock-string which he have just pull turn over the heap of body to see who they be when perceive a old messmate who have sail with he in many cruise he burst into tear and take the corpse up in he arm and go with it to the side hold it over the water a moment and eye it cry oh god tom -- d -- n you prayer over that thing overboard with it and down to you gun roar a wounded lieutenant the order be obey and the heart-stricken sailor return to he post tawney 's recital be enough to snap this man-of-war world 's sword in its scabbard and thinking of all the cruel carnal glory work out by naval hero in scene like these i ask myself whether indeed that be a glorious coffin in which lord nelson be entomb -- a coffin present to he during life by captain hallowell it have be dig out of the main-most of the french line-of-battle ship l'orient which burn up with british fire destroy hundred of frenchman at the battle of the nile peace to lord nelson where he sleep in he moulder mast but rather would i be urn in the trunk of some green tree and even in death have the vital sap circulate round I give of my dead body to the living foliage that shaded my peaceful tomb chapter lxxv sink burn and destroy _ print admiralty order in time of war _ among innumerable _ yarn and twister _ reel off in we main-top during we pleasant run to the north none could match those of jack chase we captain never be there better company than ever-glorious jack the thing which most man only read of or dream about he have see and experience he have be a dash smuggler in he day and could tell of a long nine-pounder ram home with wad of french silk of cartridge stuff with the finest gunpowder tea of cannister-shot full of west indium sweetmeat of sailor frock and trowser quilt inside with costly lace and table leg hollow as musket barrel compactly stow with rare drug and spice he could tell of a wicked widow too -- a beautiful receiver of smuggle goods upon the english coast -- who smile so sweetly upon the smuggler when they sell she silk and lace cheap as tape and gingham she call they gallant fellow heart of game and bid they bring she more he could tell of desperate fight with he british majesty 's cutter in midnight cove upon a stormy coast of the capture of a reckless band and they be draft on board a man-of-war of they swearing that they chief be slay of a writ of habeas corpus send on board for one of they for a debt -- a reserved and handsome man -- and he go ashore strongly suspect of be the slaughter captain and this a successful scheme for he escape but more than all jack could tell of the battle of navarino for he have be a captain of one of the main-deck gun on board admiral codrington 's flag-ship the asia be mine the style of stout old chapman 's homer even then i would scarce venture to give noble jack 's own version of this fight wherein on the 20th of October a d 1827 thirty-two sail of englishman frenchman and russian attack and vanquish in the levant a ottoman fleet of three ships-of-the line twenty-five frigate and a swarm of fire ship and hornet craft we bay to be at they say jack and when we _ do _ open fire we be like dolphin among the flying-fish ` every man take he bird ' be the cry when we train we gun and those gun all smoke like row of dutch pipe-bowl my hearty my gun 's crew carry small flag in they bosom to nail to the mast in case the ship 's color be shoot away strip to the waistband we fight like skin tiger and bowl down the turkish frigate like nine-pin among they shroud -- swarm thick with small-arm man like flight of pigeon light on pine-tree -- we marine send they leaden pea and goose-berry like a shower of hail-stone in labrador it be a stormy time my hearty the blast turk pitch into the old asia 's hull a whole quarry of marble shot each ball one hundred and fifty pound they knock three port-hole into one but we give they better than they send ` up and at they my bull-dog ' say i patting my gun on the breech ` tear open hatchway in they moslem side white-jacket my lad you ought to have be there the bay be cover with mast and yard as i have see a raft of snag in the arkansa river shower of burn rice and olive from the explode foe fall upon we like manna in the wilderness ' _ allah allah mohamm mohammed _ ' split the air some cry it out from the turkish port-hole other shriek it forth from the drown water they top-knot float on they shaven skull like black snake on half-tide rock by those top-knot they believe that they prophet would drag they up to paradise but they sink fifty fathom my hearty to the bottom of the bay ` be not the bloody ` hometon go to strike yet ' cry my first loader a guernsey man thrust he neck out of the port-hole and look at the turkish line-of-battle-ship near by that instant he head blow by I like a burst paixhan shot and the flag of neb knowle himself be haul down for ever we drag he hull to one side and avenge he with the cooper 's anvil which endway we ram home a mess-mate shove in the dead man 's bloody scotch cap for the wad and send it fly into the line-of-battle ship by the god of war boy we hardly leave enough of that craft to boil a pot of water with it be a hard day 's work -- a sad day 's work my hearty that night when all be over i sleep sound enough with a box of cannister shot for my pillow but you ought to have see the boat-load of turkish flag one of we captain carry home he swear to dress he father 's orchard in color with they just as we spar be dress for a gala day though you torment the turk at navarino noble jack yet you come off yourself with only the loss of a splinter it seem say a top-man glancing at we cap-tain 's maimed hand yes but i and one of the lieutenant have a narrower escape than that a shot strike the side of my port-hole and send the splinter right and leave one take off my hat rim clean to my brow another _ raze _ the lieutenant 's left boot by slice off the heel a third shot kill my powder-monkey without touch he how jack it _ whiz _ the poor babe dead he be seat on a _ cheese of wad _ at the time and after the dust of the pow-dered bulwark have blow away i notice he yet sit still he eye wide open ' _ my little hero _ ' cry i and i clap he on the back but he fall on he face at my foot i touch he heart and find he be dead there be not a little finger mark on he silence now fall upon the listener for a time break at last by the second captain of the top noble jack i know you never brag but tell we what you do yourself that day why my hearty i do not do quite as much as my gun but i flatter myself it be that gun that bring clown the turkish admiral 's main-mast and the stump leave be not long enough to make a wooden leg for lord nelson how but i think by the way you pull a lock-string on board here and look along the sight that you can steer a shot about right -- hey jack it be the admiral of the fleet -- god almighty -- who direct the shot that dismast the turkish admiral say jack i only point the gun but how do you feel jack when the musket-ball carry away one of you hook there feel only a finger the lighter i have seven more left besides thumb and they do good service too in the tear rig the day after the fight for you must know my hearty that the hardest work come after the gun be run in three day i help work with one hand in the rigging in the same trowser that i wear in the action the blood have dry and stiffen they look like glaze red morocco now this jack chase have a heart in he like a mastodon 's i have see he weep when a man have be flog at the gangway yet in relate the story of the battle of navarino he plainly show that he hold the god of the bless bible to have be the british commodore in the levant on the bloody 20th of October a d 1827 and thus it would seem that war almost make blasphemer of the best of man and bring they all down to the feejee standard of humanity some man-of-war 's - man have confess to I that as a battle have rage more and more they heart have harden in infernal harmony and like they own gun they have fight without a thought soldier or sailor the fight man be but a fiend and the staff and body-guard of the devil muster many a baton but war at time be inevitable must the national honor be trample under foot by a insolent foe say on say on but know you this and lay it to heart war-voting bench of bishop that he on whom we believe _ himself _ have enjoin we to turn the left cheek if the right be smitten never mind what follow that passage you can not expunge from the bible that passage be as binding upon we as any other that passage embody the soul and substance of the christian faith without it christianity be like any other faith and that passage will yet by the blessing of god turn the world but in some thing we must turn quaker first but though unlike most scene of carnage which have prove useless murder of man admiral codrington 's victory undoubtedly achieve the emancipation of greece and terminate the turkish atrocity in that tomahawked state yet who shall lift he hand and swear that a divine providence lead the van of the combined fleet of england france and russium at the battle of navarino for if this be so then it lead the van against the church 's own elect -- the persecute waldens in switzerland -- and kindle the smithfield fire in bloody mary 's time but all event be mix in a fusion indistinguishable what we call fate be even heartless and impartial not a fiend to kindle bigot flame nor a philanthropist to espouse the cause of greece we may fret fume and fight but the thing call fate everlastingly sustain a armed neutrality yet though all this be so nevertheless in we own heart we mould the whole world 's hereafter and in we own heart we fashion we own god each mortal cast he vote for whom he will to rule the world i have a voice that help to shape eternity and my volition stir the orbit of the furthest sun in two sens we be precisely what we worship ourselves be fate chapter lxxvi the chain when wearied with the tumult and occasional contention of the gun-deck of we frigate i have often retreat to a port-hole and calm myself down by gaze broad off upon a placid sea after the battle-din of the last two chapter let we now do the like and in the sequestered fore-chain of the neversink tranquillise ourselves if we may notwithstanding the domestic communism to which the seaman in a man-of-war be condemn and the publicity in which action the most diffident and retire in they nature must be perform there be yet a odd corner or two where you may sometimes steal away and for a few moment almost be private chief among these place be the _ chain _ to which i would sometimes hie during we pleasant homeward-bound glide over those pensive tropical latitudes after hear my fill of the wild yarn of we top here would i recline -- if not disturb -- serenely concoct information into wisdom the chain designate the small platform outside of the hull at the base of the large shroud lead down from the three mast-head to the bulwark at present they seem to be get out of vogue among merchant-vessel along with the fine old-fashioned quarter-gallery little turret-like ap-purtenance which in the day of the old admiral set off the angle of a armed ship 's stern here a naval officer might lounge away a hour after action smoking a cigar to drive out of he whisker the villainous smoke of the gun-powder the picturesque delightful stern-gallery also a broad balcony overhang the sea and enter from the captain 's cabin much as you might enter a bower from a lady 's chamber this charming balcony where sailing over summer sea in the day of the old peruvian viceroy the spanish cavalier mendanna of lima make love to the lady isabellum as they voyage in quest of the solomon island the fabulous ophir the grand cyclade and the lady isabellum at sunset blush like the orient and gaze down to the gold-fish and silver-hued flying-fish that weave the woof and warp of they wake in bright scaly tartan and plaid underneath where the lady recline this charming balcony -- exquisite retreat -- have be cut away by vandalic innovation ay that claw-footed old gallery be no longer in fashion in commodore 's eye be no longer genteel out on all furniture fashion but those that be past give I my grandfather 's old arm-chair plant upon four carve frog as the hindoo fabled the world to be support upon four tortoise give I he cane with the gold-loaded top -- a cane that like the musket of general washington 's father and the broadsword of william wallace would break down the back of the switch-carrying dandy of these spindle-shank day give I he broad-breasted vest come bravely down over the hip and furnish with two strong-box of pocket to keep guinea in toss this topple cylinder of a beaver overboard and give I my grandfather 's gallant gable-ended cock hat but though the quarter-gallery and the stern-gallery of a man-of-war be depart yet the _ chain _ still linger nor can there be imagine a more agreeable retreat the huge block and lanyard form the pedestal of the shroud divide the chain into numerous little chapel alcove niche and altar where you lazily lounge -- outside of the ship though on board but there be plenty to divide a good thing with you in this man-of-war world often when snugly seat in one of these little alcove gaze off to the horizon and thinking of cathay i have be startle from my repose by some old quarter-gunner who have newly paint a parcel of match-tub want to set they to dry at other time one of the tattooing artist would crawl over the bulwark follow by he sitter and then a bare arm or leg would be extend and the disagreeable business of _ prick _ commence right under my eye or a irruption of tar with ditty-bag or sea-reticule and pile of old trowser to mend would break in upon my seclusion and form a sewing-circle drive I off with they chatter but once -- it be a Sunday afternoon -- i be pleasantly recline in a particularly shady and secluded little niche between two lanyard when i hear a low supplicating voice peep through the narrow space between the rope i perceive a aged seaman on he knee he face turn seaward with closed eye bury in prayer softly rise i steal through a port-hole and leave the venerable worshipper alone he be a sheet-anchor-man a earnest baptist and be well know in he own part of the ship to be constant in he solitary devotions in the _ chain _ he remind I of st anthony go out into the wilderness to pray this man be captain of the starboard bow-chaser one of the two long twenty-four-pounder on the forecastle in time of action the command of that iron thalaba the destroyer would devolve upon _ he _ it would be he business to train it properly to see it well load the grape and cannister ram home also to prick the cartridge take the sight and give the word for the match-man to apply he wand bidding a sudden hell to flash forth from the muzzle in wide combustion and death now this captain of the bow-chaser be a upright old man a sincere humble believer and he but earn he bread in be captain of that gun but how with those hand of he begrime with powder could he break that _ other _ and most peaceful and penitent bread of the supper though in that hallowed sacrament it seem he have often partaken ashore the omission of this rite in a man-of-war -- though there be a chaplain to preside over it and at least a few communicant to partake -- must be ascribe to a sense of religious propriety in the last degree to be commend ah the best righteousness of we man-of-war world seem but a unrealised ideal after all and those maxim which in the hope of bring about a millennium we busily teach to the heathen we christian ourselves disregard in view of the whole present social frame-work of we world so ill adapt to the practical adoption of the meekness of christianity there seem almost some ground for the thought that although we bless savior be full of the wisdom of heaven yet he gospel seem lack in the practical wisdom of earth -- in a due appreciation of the necessity of nation at time demand bloody massacre and war in a proper estimation of the value of rank title and money but all this only the more crown the divine consistency of jesus since burnet and the best theologian demonstrate that he nature be not merely human -- be not that of a mere man of the world chapter lxxvii the hospital in a man-of-war after run with a fine steady breeze up to the line it fall calm and there we lay three day enchant on the sea we be a most puissant man-of-war no doubt with we five hundred man commodore and captain back by we long battery of thirty-two and twenty-four pounder yet for all that there we lay rock helpless as a infant in the cradle have it only be a gale instead of a calm gladly would we have charge upon it with we gallant bowsprit as with a stout lance in rest but as with man-kind this serene passive foe -- unresisting and irresistible -- live it out unconquered to the last all these three day the heat be excessive the sun draw the tar from the seam of the ship the awning be spread fore and aft the deck be keep constantly sprinkle with water it be during this period that a sad event occur though not a unusual one on shipboard but in order to prepare for its narration some account of a part of the ship call the _ sick-bay _ must need be present the _ sick-bay _ be that part of a man-of-war where the invalid seaman be place in many respects it answer to a public hospital ashore as with most frigate the sick-bay of the neversink be on the berth-deck -- the third deck from above it be in the extreme forward part of that deck embrace the triangular area in the bow of the ship it be therefore a subterranean vault into which scarce a ray of heaven 's glad light ever penetrate even at noon in a sea-going frigate that have all she armament and store on board the floor of the berth-deck be partly below the surface of the water but in a smooth harbor some circulation of air be maintain by open large auger-hole in the upper portion of the side call air-port not much above the water level before go to sea however these air-port must be close caulk and the seam hermetically seal with pitch these place for ventilation be shut the sick-bay be entirely bar against the free natural admission of fresh air in the neversink a few lungsful be force down by artificial means but as the ordinary _ wind-sail _ be the only method adopt the quantity of fresh air send down be regulate by the force of the wind in a calm there be none to be have while in a severe gale the wind-sail have to be haul up on account of the violent draught flow full upon the cot of the sick a open-work partition divide we sick-bay from the rest of the deck where the hammock of the watch be sling it therefore be expose to all the uproar that ensue upon the watch be relieve a official call the surgeon 's steward assist by subordinate preside over the place he be the same individual allude to as officiating at the amputation of the top-man he be always to be find at he post by night and by day this surgeon 's steward deserve a description he be a small pale hollow-eyed young man with that peculiar lazarus-like expression so often notice in hospital attendant seldom or never do you see he on deck and when he _ do _ emerge into the light of the sun it be with a abashed look and a uneasy wink eye the sun be not make for _ he _ he nervous organization be confound by the sight of the robust old sea-dog on the forecastle and the general tumult of the spar-deck and he mostly bury himself below in a atmosphere which long habit have make congenial this young man never indulge in frivolous conversation he only talk of the surgeon 's prescription he every word be a bolus he never be know to smile nor do he even look sober in the ordinary way but he countenance ever wear a aspect of cadaverous resignation to he fate strange that so many of those who would fain minister to we own health should look so much like invalid themselves connect with the sick-bay over which the surgeon 's steward preside -- but remove from it in place be next door to the counting-room of the purser 's steward -- be a regular apothecary 's shop of which he keep the key it be fit up precisely like a apothecary 's on shore dis-playing tier of shelf on all four side fill with green bottle and gallipot beneath be multitudinous drawer bear incomprehensible gilded inscription in abbreviated latin he generally open he shop for a hour or two every morning and evening there be a venetian blind in the upper part of the door which he throw up when inside so as to admit a little air and there you would see he with a green shade over he eye seat on a stool and pound he pestle in a great iron mortar that look like a howitzer mix some jallapy compound a smoky lamp shed a flicker yellow-fever tinge upon he pallid face and the closely-packed regiment of gallipot several time when i feel in need of a little medicine but be not ill enough to report myself to the surgeon at he levee i would call of a morning upon he steward at the sign of the mortar and beg he to give I what i want when without speak a word this cadaverous young man would mix I my potion in a tin cup and hand it out through the little opening in he door like the boxed-up treasurer give you you change at the ticket-office of a theater but there be a little shelf against the wall of the door and upon this i would set the tin cup for a while and survey it for i never be a julius caesar at take medicine and to take it in this way without a single attempt at dis-guising it with no counteract little morsel to hurry down after it in short to go to the very apothecary 's in person and there at the counter swallow down you dose as if it be a nice mint-julep take at the bar of a hotel -- _ this _ be a bitter bolus indeed but then this pallid young apothecary charge nothing for it and _ that _ be no small satisfaction for be it not remarkable to say the least that a shore apothecary should actually charge you money -- round dollar and cent -- for give you a horrible nausea my tin cup would wait a long time on that little shelf yet pill as the sailor call he never heed my linger but in sober silent sadness continue pound he mortar or folding up he powder until at last some other customer would appear and then in a sudden frenzy of resolution i would gulp clown my sherry-cobbler and carry its unspeakable flavor with I far up into the frigate 's main-top i do not know whether it be the wide roll of the ship as feel in that giddy perch that occasion it but i always get sea-sick after take medicine and go aloft with it seldom or never do it do I any lasting good now the surgeon 's steward be only a subordinate of surgeon cuticle himself who live in the ward-room among the lieutenant sailing-master chaplain and purser the surgeon be by law charge with the business of overlook the general sanitary affair of the ship if anything be go on in any of its department which he judge to be detrimental to the healthfulness of the crew he have a right to protest against it formally to the captain when a man be be scourge at the gangway the surgeon stand by and if he think that the punishment be become more than the culprit 's constitution can well bear he have a right to interfere and demand its cessation for the time but though the navy regulation nominally vest he with this high discretionary authority over the very commodore himself how seldom do he exercise it in case where humanity demand it three year be a long time to spend in one ship and to be at sword ' point with its captain and lieutenant during such a period must be very unsocial and every way irksome no otherwise than thus at least can the remissness of some surgeon in remonstrate against cruelty be account for not to speak again of the continual dampness of the deck consequent upon flood they with salt water when we be drive near to cape horn it need only to be mention that on board of the neversink man know to be in consumption gasp under the scourge of the boatswain 's mate when the surgeon and he two attendant stand by and never interpose but where the unscrupulousness of martial discipline be maintain it be in vain to attempt soften its rigor by the ordaining of humanitarian law sooner might you tame the grizzly bear of missourus than humanise a thing so essentially cruel and heartless but the surgeon have yet other duty to perform not a seaman enter the navy without undergo a corporal examination to test he soundness in wind and limb one of the first place into which i be introduce when i first enter on board the neversink be the sick-bay where i find one of the assistant surgeon seat at a green-baize table it be he turn for visit the apartment have be command by the deck officer to report my business to the functionary before I i accordingly hem to attract he attention and then catch he eye politely intimate that i call upon he for the purpose of be accurately lay out and survey strip be the answer and roll up he gold-laced cuff he proceed to manipulate I he punch I in the rib smite I across the chest command I to stand on one leg and hold out the other horizontally he ask I whether any of my family be consumptive whether i ever feel a tendency to a rush of blood to the head whether i be gouty how often i have be bleed during my life how long i have be ashore how long i have be afloat with several other question which have altogether slipped my memory he conclude he interrogatory with this extraordinary and unwarranted one -- be you pious it be a lead question which somewhat stagger I but i say not a word when feeling of my calf he look up and incomprehensibly say i be afraid you be not at length he declare I a sound animal and write a certificate to that effect with which i return to the deck this assistant surgeon turn out to be a very singular character and when i become more acquaint with he i cease to marvel at the curious question with which he have conclude he examination of my person he be a thin knock-kneed man with a sour saturnine expression render the more peculiar from he shave he beard so remorselessly that he chin and cheek always look blue as if pinch with cold he long familiarity with nautical invalid seem to have fill he full of theological hypo concern the state of they soul he be at once the physician and priest of the sick wash down he bolus with ghostly consolation and among the sailor go by the name of the pelican a fowl whose hang pouch impart to it a most chop-fallen lugubrious expression the privilege of go off duty and lie by when you be sick be one of the few point in which a man-of-war be far better for the sailor than a merchantman but as with every other matter in the navy the whole thing be subject to the general discipline of the vessel and be conduct with a severe unyielding method and regularity make no allowance for exception to rule during the half-hour precede morning quarter the surgeon of a frigate be to be find in the sick-bay where after go he round among the invalid he hold a levee for the benefit of all new candidate for the sick-list if after look at you tongue and feeling of you pulse he pronounce you a proper candidate he secretary put you down on he book and you be thenceforth relieve from all duty and have abundant leisure in which to recover you health let the boatswain blow let the deck officer bellow let the captain of you gun hunt you up yet if it can be answer by you mess-mate that you be _ down on the list _ you ride it all out with impunity the commodore himself have then no authority over you but you must not be too much elate for you immunity be only secure while you be immure in the dark hospital below should you venture to get a mouthful of fresh air on the spar-deck and be there discover by a officer you will in vain plead you illness for it be quite impossible it seem that any true man-of-war invalid can be hearty enough to crawl up the ladder besides the raw sea air as they will tell you be not good for the sick but notwithstanding all this notwithstanding the darkness and closeness of the sick-bay in which a alleged invalid must be content to shut himself up till the surgeon pronounce he cure many instance occur especially in protracted bad weather where pretend invalid will sub-mit to this dismal hospital durance in order to escape hard work and wet jacket there be a story tell somewhere of the devil take down the confession of a woman on a strip of parchment and be oblige to stretch it longer and longer with he tooth in order to find room for all the lady have to say much thus be it with we purser 's steward who have to lengthen out he manuscript sick-list in order to accommodate all the name which be present to he while we be off the pitch of cape horn what sailor call the _ cape horn fever _ alarmingly prevail though it disappear altogether when we get into the weather which as with many other invalid be solely to be imputed to the wonder-working effect of a entire change of climate it seem very strange but it be really true that off cape horn some _ soger _ of sailor will stand cup and bleed and blister before they will budge on the other hand there be case where a man actually sick and in need of medicine will refuse to go on the sick-list because in that case he allowance of _ grog _ must be stop on board of every american man-of-war bind for sea there be a goodly supply of wine and various delicacy put on board -- accord to law -- for the benefit of the sick whether officer or sailor and one of the chicken-coop be always reserve for the government chicken destine for a similar purpose but on board of the neversink the only delicacy give to invalid sailor be a little sago or arrow-root and they do not get _ that _ unless severely ill but so far as i could learn no wine in any quantity be ever prescribe for they though the government bottle often go into the ward-room for the benefit of indisposed officer and though the government chicken-coop be replenish at every port yet not four pair of drum-stick be ever boil into broth for sick sailor where the chicken go some one must have know but as i can not vouch for it myself i will not here back the hardy assertion of the man which be that the pious pelican -- true to he name -- be extremely fond of poultry i be the still less disposed to believe this scandal from the continue leanness of the pelican which could hardly have be the case do he nourish himself by so nutritious a dish as the drum-stick of fowl a diet prescribe to pugilist in training but who can avoid be suspicious of a very suspicious person pelican i rather suspect you still chapter lxxviii dismal time in the mess it be on the first day of the long hot calm which we have on the equator that a mess-mate of mine by the name of shenly who have be for some week complain at length go on the sick-list a old gunner 's mate of the mess -- prime the man with the hare-lip who true to he tribe be charge to the muzzle with bile and moreover ram home on top of it a wad of sailor superstition -- this gunner 's mate indulge in some gloomy and savage remark -- strangely tinge with genuine feeling and grief -- at the announcement of the sick-ness of shenly come as it do not long after the almost fatal accident befalling poor baldy captain of the mizzen-top another mess-mate of ours and the dreadful fate of the amputate fore-top-man whom we

indifference need i say how i cursed my jacket that it thus seem the means of fasten on I the murder of one of my shipmate and the probable murder of two more for have it not be for my jacket doubtless i have yet be a member of my old mess and so have escape make the luckless odd number among my present companion all i could say in private to priming have no effect though i often take he aside to convince he of the philosophical impossibility of my have be accessary to the misfortune of baldy the bury sailor in rio and shenly but priming know better nothing could move he and he ever afterward eye I as virtuous citizen do some notorious underhand villain go unhung of justice jacket jacket thou hast much to answer for jacket chapter lxxix how man-of-war 's - man die at sea shenly my sick mess-mate be a middle-aged handsome intelligent seaman whom some hard calamity or perhaps some unfortunate excess must have drive into the navy he tell I he have a wife and two child in portsmouth in the state of new hampshire upon be examine by cuticle the surgeon he be on purely scientific grounds reprimand by that functionary for not have previously appear before he he be immediately consign to one of the invalid cot as a serious case he complaint be of long stand a pulmonary one now attend with general prostration the same evening he grow so much worse that accord to man-of-war usage we he mess-mate be officially notify that we must take turn at sit up with he through the night we at once make we arrangement allot two hour for a watch not till the third night do my own turn come round during the day precede it be state at the mess that we poor mess-mate be run down completely the surgeon have give he up at four bell -lrb- two o'clock in the morning -rrb- i go down to relieve one of my mess-mate at the sick man 's cot the profound quietude of the calm pervade the entire frigate through all she deck the watch on duty be doze on the carronade-slide far above the sick-bay and the watch below be fast asleep in they hammock on the same deck with the invalid grope my way under these two hundred sleeper i en-tered the hospital a dim lamp be burn on the table which be screw down to the floor this light shed dreary shadow over the white-washed wall of the place make it look look a white sepulchre underground the wind-sail have collapse and lay motionless on the deck the low groan of the sick be the only sound to be hear and as i advance some of they roll upon I they sleepless silent tormented eye fan he and keep he forehead wet with this sponge whisper my mess-mate whom i come to relieve as i draw near to shenly 's cot and wash the foam from he mouth nothing more can be do for he if he die before you watch be out call the surgeon 's steward he sleep in that hammock point it out good-bye good-bye mess-mate he then whisper stoop over the sick man and so say he leave the place shenly be lie on he back he eye be close form two dark-blue pit in he face he breath be come and go with a slow long-drawn mechanical precision it be the mere foundering hull of a man that be before I and though it present the well-known feature of my mess-mate yet i know that the living soul of shenly never more would look out of those eye so warm have it be during the day that the surgeon himself when visit the sick-bay have enter it in he shirt-sleeve and so warm be now the night that even in the lofty top i have worn but a loose linen frock and trowser but in this subterranean sick-bay bury in the very bowels of the ship and at sea cut off from all ventilation the heat of the night calm be intense the sweat drip from I as if i have just emerge from a bath and strip myself naked to the waist i sit by the side of the cot and with a bit of crumpled paper -- put into my hand by the sailor i have relieve -- keep fan the motionless white face before I i could not help think as i gaze whether this man 's fate have not be accelerate by he confinement in this heated furnace below and whether many a sick man round I might not soon improve if but permit to swing he hammock in the airy vacancy of the half-deck above open to the port-hole but reserve for the promenade of the officer at last the heavy breathing grow more and more irregular and gradually die away leave forever the unstirring form of shenly call the surgeon 's steward he at once tell I to rouse the master-at-arms and four or five of my mess-mate the master-at-arms approach and immediately demand the dead man 's bag which be accordingly drag into the bay have be lay on the floor and wash with a bucket of water which i draw from the ocean the body be then dress in a white frock trowser and neckerchief take out of the bag while this be go on the master-at-arms -- stand over the operation with he rattan and direct myself and mess-mate -- indulge in much discursive levity intend to manifest he fearlessness of death pierre who have be a _ chummy _ of shenly 's spend much time in tie the neckerchief in a elaborate bow and affectionately adjust the white frock and trowser but the master-at-arms put a end to this by order we to carry the body up to the gun-deck it be place on the death-board -lrb- use for that purpose -rrb- and we proceed with it toward the main hatchway awkwardly crawl under the tier of hammock where the entire watch-below be sleep as unavoidably we rock they pallet the man-of-war 's - man would cry out against we through the muttering of curse the corpse reach the hatchway here the board slip and some time be spend in readjust the body at length we deposit it on the gun-deck between two gun and a union-jack be throw over it for a pall i be leave again to watch by its side i have not be seat on my shot-box three minute when the messenger-boy pass I on he way forward presently the slow regular stroke of the ship 's great bell be hear proclaim through the calm the expiration of the watch it be four o'clock in the morning poor shenly thought i that sound like you knell and here you lie becalm in the last calm of all hardly have the brazen din die away when the boatswain and he mate muster round the hatchway within a yard or two of the corpse and the usual thundering call be give for the watch below to turn out all the starboard-watch ahoy on deck there below wide awake there sleeper but the dreamless sleeper by my side who have so often spring from he hammock at that summons move not a limb the blue sheet over he lay unwrinkled a mess-mate of the other watch now come to relieve I but i tell he i choose to remain where i be till daylight come chapter lxxx the last stitch just before daybreak two of the sail-maker 's gang draw near each with a lantern carry some canvas two large shot needle and twine i know they errand for in men-of-war the sail-maker be the undertaker they lay the body on deck and after fitting the canvas to it seat themselves cross-leg like tailor one on each side and with they lantern before they go to stitch away as if mend a old sail both be old man with grizzled hair and beard and shrunken face they belong to that small class of aged seaman who for they previous long and faithful service be

instrument on a _ shave day _ for the deceased seaman have inform he of the circumstance when he come to have he beard reap on the morning of the event in the purser 's opinion this settle the

imaginary shoal by unimaginable observation of the moon and the star and learn lecture be deliver upon great gun small arm and the curvilinear line describe by bomb in the air _ the professor _ be the title bestow upon the erudite gentleman who conduct this seminary and by that title alone be he know throughout the ship he be domicile in the ward-room and circulate there on a social par with the purser surgeon and other _ non-combatant _ and quaker by be advance to the dignity of a peerage in the ward-room science and learning be ennoble in the person of this professor even as divinity be honor in the chaplain enjoy the rank of a spiritual peer every other afternoon while at sea the professor assemble he pupil on the half-deck near the long twenty-four pounder a bass drum-head be he desk he pupil form a semicircle around he seat on shot-box and match-tub they be in the jelly of youth and this learn professor pour into they susceptible heart all the gentle gunpowder maxim of war president of peace society and superintendent of sabbath-school must it not have be a most interesting sight but the professor himself be a noteworthy person a tall thin spectacled man about forty year old with a student 's stoop in he shoulder and wear uncommonly scanty pantaloons exhibit a undue proportion of he boot in early life he have be a cadet in the military academy of west point but become very weak-sighted and thereby in a good manner disqualify for active service in the field he have decline enter the army and accept the office of professor in the navy he study at west point have thoroughly ground he in a knowledge of gunnery and as he be not a little of a pedant it be sometimes amusing when the sailor be at quarter to hear he criticise they evolution at the battery he would quote dr hutton 's tract on the subject also in the original _ the french bombardier _ and wind up by italian passage from the _ prattica manuale dell ' artiglieria _ though not require by the navy regulation to instruct he scholar in aught but the application of mathematics to navigation yet besides this and besides instruct they in the theory of gunnery he also seek to root they in the theory of frigate and fleet tactic to be sure he himself do not know how to splice a rope or furl a sail and owe to he partiality for strong coffee he be apt to be nervous when we fire salute yet all this do not prevent he from deliver lecture on cannonading and break the enemy 's line he have arrive at he knowledge of tactic by silent solitary study and earnest meditation in the sequestered retreat of he state-room he case be somewhat parallel to the scotchman 's -- john clerk esq of eldin -- who though he have never be to sea compose a quarto treatise on fleet-fighting which to this day remain a text-book and he also originate a nautical maneuver which have give to england many a victory over she foe now there be a large black-board something like a great-gun target -- only it be square -- which during the professor 's lecture be place upright on the gun-deck support behind by three boarding-pike and here he would chalk out diagram of great fleet engagement make mark like the sole of shoe for the ship and draw a dog-vane in one corner to denote the assumed direction of the wind this do with a cutlass he would point out every spot of interest now young gentleman the board before you exhibit the disposition of the british west indian squadron under rodney when early on the morning of the 9th of April in the year of we bless lord 1782 he discover part of the french fleet command by the count de grasse lie under the north end of the island of dominica it be at this juncture that the admiral give the signal for the british line to prepare for battle and stand on d'ye understand young gentleman well the british van have nearly fetch up with the center of the enemy -- who be it remembered be then on the starboard tack -- and rodney 's center and rear be yet becalm under the lee of the land -- the question i ask you be what should rodney now do blaze away by all means respond a rather confident reefer who have zealously be observe the diagram but sir he center and rear be still becalm and he van have not yet close with the enemy wait till he _ do _ come in range and _ then _ blaze away say the reefer permit I to remark mr pert that ' _ blaze away _ ' be not a strictly technical term and also permit I to hint mr pert that you should consider the subject rather more deeply before you hurry forward you opinion this rebuke not only abashed mr pert but for a time intimidate the rest and the professor be oblige to proceed and extricate the british fleet by himself he conclude by award admiral rodney the victory which must have be exceedingly gratify to the family pride of the survive relative and connection of that distinguished hero shall i clean the board sir now ask mr pert brighten up no sir not till you have save that cripple french ship in the corner that ship young gentleman be the glorieuse : you perceive she be cut off from she consort and the whole british fleet be give chase to she she bowsprit be go she rudder be tear away she have one hundred round shot in she hull and two third of she man be dead or die what be to be do the wind be at northeast by north well sir say mr dash a chivalric young gentleman from virginia i would not strike yet i would nail my color to the main-royal-mast i would by jove that would not save you ship sir besides you main-mast have go by the board i think sir say mr slim a diffident youth i think sir i would haul back the fore-top-sail and why so of what service would _ that _ be i should like to know mr slim i can not tell exactly but i think it would help she a little be the timid reply not a whit sir -- not one particle besides you can not haul back you fore-top-sail -- you fore-mast be lie across you forecastle haul back the main-top-sail then suggest another can not be do you main-mast also have go by the board mizzen-top-sail meekly suggest little boat-plug you mizzen-top-mast let I inform you sir be shoot down in the first of the fight well sir cry mr dash i would tack ship anyway bid 'em good-by with a broadside nail my flag to the keel if there be no other place and blow my brain out on the poop idle idle sir worse than idle you be carry away mr dash by you ardent southern temperament let I inform you young gentleman that this ship touch it with he cutlass _ can not _ be save then throw down he cutlass mr pert have the goodness to hand I one of those cannon-ball from the rack balance the iron sphere in one hand the learn professor begin finger it with the other like columbus illustrate the rotundity of the globe before the royal commission of castilian ecclesiastic young gentleman i resume my remark on the passage of a shot _ in vacuo _ which remark be interrupted yesterday by general quarter after quote that admirable passage in ` spearman 's british gunner ' i then lay it down you remember that the path of a shot _ in vacuo _ describe a parabolic curve i now add that agreeably to the method pursue by the illustrious newton in treat the subject of curvilinear motion i consider the _ trajectory _ or curve describe by a move body in space as consist of a series of right line describe in successive interval of time and constitute the diagonal of parallelogram form in a vertical plane between the vertical deflection cause by gravity and the production of the line of motion which have be describe in each precede interval of time this must be obvious for if you say that the passage _ in vacuo _ of this cannon-ball now hold in my hand would describe otherwise than a series of right line etc then you be bring to the _ reductio ad absurdum _ that the diagonal of parallelogram be -- all hand reef top-sail be now thunder forth by the boatswain 's mate the shot fall from the professor 's palm he spectacles drop on he nose and the school tumultuously break up the pupil scramble up the ladder with the sailor who have be overhear the lecture chapter lxxxiv man-of-war barber the allusion to one of the ship 's barber in a previous chapter together with the recollection of how conspicuous a part they enact in a tragical drama soon to be related lead I now to introduce they to the reader among the numerous artist and professor of polite trade in the navy none be hold in higher estimation or drive a more profitable business than these barber and it may well be imagine that the five hundred head of hair and five hundred beard of a frigate should furnish no small employment for those to whose faithful care they may be intrust as everything connect with the domestic affair of a man-of-war come under the supervision of the martial executive so certain barber be formally license by the first lieutenant the better to attend to the profitable duty of they call they be exempt from all ship 's duty except that of stand night-watch at sea muster at quarter and come on deck when all hand be call they be rate as _ able seaman _ or _ ordinary seaman _ and receive they wages as such but in addition to this they be liberally recompense for they professional service herein they rate of pay be fix for every sailor manipulate -- so much per quarter which be charge to the sailor and credit to he barber on the book of the purser it have be see that while a man-of-war barber be shave he customer at so much per chin he wages as a seaman be still run on which make he a sort of _ sleep partner _ of a sailor nor be the sailor wages he receive altogether to be reckon as earnings consider the circumstance however not much objection can be make to the barber on this score but there be instance of man in the neversink receive government money in part pay for work do for private individual among these be several accomplished tailor who nearly the whole cruise sit cross-legged on the half deck make coat pantaloons and vest for the quarter-deck officer some of these man though know little or nothing about sailor duty and seldom or never perform they stand upon the ship 's book as ordinary seaman entitle to ten dollar a month why be this previous to ship they have divulge the fact of they be tailor true the officer who employ they upon they wardrobe pay they for they work but some of they in such a way as to elicit much grumble from the tailor at any rate these maker and mender of clothes do not receive from some of these officer a amount equal to what they could have fairly earn ashore by do the same work it be a considerable saving to the officer to have they clothes make on board the man belong to the carpenter 's gang furnish another case in point there be some six or eight allot to this department all the cruise they be hard at work at what mostly make chest of drawer cane little ship and schooner swift and other elaborate trifle chiefly for the captain what do the captain pay they for they trouble nothing but the united state government pay they two of they -lrb- the mate -rrb- at nineteen dollar a month and the rest receive the pay of able seaman twelve dollar to return the regular day upon which the barber shall exercise they vocation be set down on the ship 's calendar and know as _ shaving day _ on board of the neversink these day be wednesday and saturday when immediately after breakfast the barber ' shop be open to customer they be in different part of the gun-deck between the long twenty-four pounder they furniture however be not very elaborate hardly equal to the sumptuous appointment of metropolitan barber indeed it merely consist of a match-tub elevated upon a shot-box as a barber 's chair for the patient no psyche glass no hand-mirror no ewer and basin no comfortable padded footstool nothing in short that make a shore _ shave _ such a luxury nor be the implement of these man-of-war barber out of keep with the rude appearance of they shop they razor be of the simplest pattern and from they jagged-ness would seem better fit for the prepare and harrowing of the soil than for the ultimate reap of the crop but this be no matter for wonder since so many chin be to be shaven and a razor-case hold but two razor for only two razor do a man-of-war barber have and like the marine sentry at the gangway in port these razor go off and on duty in rotation one brush too brush every chin and one lather lather they all no private brush and box no reservation whatever as it would be altogether too much trouble for a man-of-war 's - man to keep he own shaving-tool and shave himself at sea and since therefore nearly the whole ship 's company patronise the ship 's barber and as the seaman must be shave by evening quarter of the day appoint for the business it may be readily imagine what a scene of bustle and confusion there be when the razor be be apply first come first serve be the motto and often you have to wait for hour together stick to you position -lrb- like one of a indian file of merchant ' clerk get letter out of the post-office -rrb- ere you have a chance to occupy the pedestal of the match-tub often the crowd of quarrelsome candidate wrangle and fight for precedency while at all time the interval be employ by the garrulous in every variety of ship-gossip as the shaving day be unalterable they often fall upon day of high sea and tempestuous wind when the vessel pitch and roll in a frightful manner in consequence many valuable life be jeopardise from the razor be ply under such untoward circumstance but these sea-barber pride themselves upon they sea-leg and often you will see they stand over they patient with they foot wide apart and scientifically sway they body to the motion of the ship as they flourish they edge-tool about the lip nostril and jugular as i look upon the practitioner and patient at such time i could not help think that if the sailor have any insurance on he life it would certainly be deem forfeit should the president of the company chance to lounge by and behold he in that imminent peril for myself i account it a excellent preparation for go into a sea-fight where fortitude in stand up to you gun and run the risk of all splinter comprise part of the practical quality that make up a efficient man-of-war 's man it remain to be relate that these barber of ours have they labor considerably abridge by a fashion prevail among many of the crew of wear very large whisker so that in most case the only part need a shave be the upper lip and suburb of the chin this have be more or less the custom during the whole three year ' cruise but for some time previous to we weather cape horn very many of the seaman have redouble they assiduity in cultivate they beard preparatory to they return to america there they anticipate create no small impression by they immense and magnificent _ homeward-bounder _ -- so they call the long fly-brush at they chin in particular the more aged sailor embrace the old guard of sea grenadier on the forecastle and the begrimed gunner 's mate and quarter-gunner sport most venerable beard of a exceed length and hoariness like long trail moss hanging from the bough of some aged oak above all the captain of the forecastle old ushant -- a fine specimen of a sea sexagenarian -- wear a wide spreading beard gizzle and gray that flow over he breast and often become tangled and knot with tar this ushant in all weather be ever alert at he duty intrepidly mount the fore-yard in a gale he long beard streaming like neptune 's off cape horn it look like a miller 's be all over powdered with frost sometimes it glitter with minute icicle in the pale cold moonlit patagonian night but though he be so active in time of tempest yet when he duty do not call for exertion he be a remarkably staid reserved silent and majestic old man hold himself aloof from noisy revelry and never participate in the boisterous sport of the crew he resolutely set he beard against they boyish frolicking and often hold forth like a oracle concern the vanity thereof indeed at time he be wont to talk philosophy to he ancient companion -- the old sheet-anchor-man around he -- as well as to the hare-brained tenant of the fore-top and the giddy lad in the mizzen nor be he philosophy to be despise it abound in wisdom for this ushant be a old man of strong natural sense who have see nearly the whole terraqueous globe and could reason of civilized and savage of gentile and jew of christian and moslem the long night-watch of the sailor be eminently adapt to draw out the reflective faculty of any serious-minded man however humble or uneducated judge then what half a century of battle out watch on the ocean must have do for this fine old tar he be a sort of a sea-socrate in he old age pour out he last philosophy and life as sweet spenser have it and i never could look at he and survey he right reverend beard without bestow upon he that title which in one of he satire persius give to the immortal quaffer of the hemlock -- _ magister barbatus _ -- the bearded master not a few of the ship 's company have also bestow great pain upon they hair which some of they -- especially the genteel young sailor buck of the after-guard -- wear over they shoulder like the ringleted cavalier many sailor with naturally tendril lock pride themselves upon what they call _ love curl _ wear at the side of the head just before the ear -- a custom peculiar to tar and which seem to have fill the vacate place of the old-fashioned lord rodney cue which they use to wear some fifty year ago but there be other of the crew labor under the misfortune of long lank winnebago lock carroty bunch of hair or rebellious bristle of a sandy hue ambitious of redundant mop these still suffer they carrot to grow spite of all ridicule they look like hun and scandinavian and one of they a young down easter the unenvied proprietor of a thick crop of inflexible yellow bamboo go by the name of _ peter the wild boy _ for like peter the wild boy in france it be suppose that he must have be catch like a catamount in the pine wood of maine but there be many fine flow head of hair to counter-balance such sorry exhibition as peter 's what with long whisker and venerable beard then of every variety of cut -- charle the fifth 's and aurelian 's -- and endless _ goatee _ and _ imperial _ and what with abound lock we crew seem a company of merovingian or long-haired king mix with savage lombard or longobardus so call from they lengthy beard chapter lxxxv the great massacre of the beard the precede chapter fitly pave the way for the present wherein it sadly befall white-jacket to chronicle a calamitous event which fill the neversink with long lamentation that echo through all she deck and top after dwelling upon we redundant lock and thrice-noble beard fain would i cease and let the sequel remain undisclosed but truth and fidelity forbid as i now deviously hover and lingeringly skirmish about the frontier of this melancholy recital a feeling of sadness come over I that i can not withstand such a heartless massacre of hair such a bartholomew 's day and sicilian vespers of assassinate beard ah who would believe it with intuitive sympathy i feel of my own brown beard while i write and thank my kind star that each precious hair be for ever beyond the reach of the ruthless barber of a man-of-war it need that this sad and most serious matter should be faithfully detail throughout the cruise many of the officer have express they abhorrence of the impunity with which the most extensive plantation of hair be cultivate under they very nose and they frown upon every beard with even greater dislike they say it be unseamanlike not _ ship-shape _ in short it be disgraceful to the navy but as captain claret say nothing and as the officer of themselves have no authority to preach a crusade against whiskerando the old guard on the forecastle still complacently stroke they beard and the sweet youth of the after-guard still lovingly thread they finger through they curl perhaps the captain 's generosity in thus far permit we beard spring from the fact that he himself wear a small speck of a beard upon he own imperial cheek which if rumor say true be to hide something as plutarch relate of the emperor adrian but to do he justice -- as i always have do -- the captain 's beard do not exceed the limit prescribe by the navy department accord to a then recent ordinance at washington the beard of both officer and seaman be to be accurately lay out and survey and on no account must come lower than the mouth so as to correspond with the army standard -- a regulation directly oppose to the theocratical law lay down in the nineteenth chapter and twenty-seventh verse of leviticus where it be expressly ordain _ thou shalt not mar the corner of thy beard _ but legislator do not always square they statute by those of the bible at last when we have cross the northern tropic and be stand up to we gun at evening quarter and when the setting sun streaming in at the port-hole light up every hair till to a observer on the quarter-deck the two long even line of beard seem one dense grove in that evil hour it must have be that a cruel thought enter into the heart of we captain a pretty set of savage think he be i take home to america people will think they all catamount and turk besides now that i think of it it be against the law it will never do they must be shaven and shear -- that be flat there be no know indeed whether these be the very word in which the captain meditate that night for it be yet a mooted point among metaphysician whether we think in word or whether we think in thought but something like the above must have be the captain 's cogitation at any rate that very evening the ship 's company be astounded by a extraordinary announcement make at the main-hatch-way of the gun-deck by the boat-swain 's mate there station he be afterwards discover to have be tipsy at the time d'ye hear there fore and aft all you that have hair on you head shave they off and all you that have beard trim 'em small shave off we christian head and then place they between we knee trim small we worshipped beard the captain be mad but directly the boatswain come rush to the hatchway and after soundly rate he tipsy mate thunder forth a true version of the order that have issue from the quarter-deck as amend it run thus : d'ye hear there fore and aft all you that have long hair cut it short and all you that have large whisker trim they down accord to the navy regulation this be a amendment to be sure but what barbarity after all what not thirty day ' run from home and lose we magnificent homeward-bounder the homeward-bounder we have be cultivate so long lose they at one fall swoop be the vile barber of the gun-deck to reap we long nodding harvest and expose we innocent chin to the chill air of the yankee coast and we viny lock be they also to be shear be a grand sheep-shearing such as they annually have at nantucket to take place and we ignoble barber to carry off the fleece captain claret in cut we beard and we hair you cut we the unkindest cut of all be we go into action captain claret -- go to fight the foe with we heart of flame and we arm of steel then would we gladly offer up we beard to the terrific god of war and _ that _ we would account but a wise precaution against have they tweak by the foe _ then _ captain claret you would but be imitate the example of alexander who have he macedonian all shave that in the hour of battle they beard might not be handle to the persian but _ now _ captain claret when after we long long cruise we be return to we home tenderly stroke the fine tassel on we chin and thinking of father or mother or sister or brother or daughter or son to cut off we beard now -- the very beard that be frost white off the pitch of patagonium -- _ this _ be too bitterly bad captain claret and by heaven we will not submit train you gun inboard let the marine fix they bayonet let the officer draw they sword we _ will not _ let we beard be reap -- the last insult inflict upon a vanquished foe in the east where be you sheet-anchor-men captain of the top gunner 's mate mariner all muster round the capstan you venerable beard and while you braid they together in token of brotherhood cross hand and swear that we will enact over again the mutiny of the nore and sooner perish than yield up a hair the excitement be intense throughout that whole evening group of ten and twenty be scatter about all the deck discuss the mandate and inveigh against its barbarous author the long area of the gun-deck be something like a populous street of broker when some terrible commercial tiding have newly arrive one and all they resolve not to succumb and every man swear to stand by he beard and he neighbor twenty-four hour after -- at the next evening quarter -- the captain 's eye be observe to wander along the man at they gun -- not a beard be shave when the drum beat the retreat the boatswain -- now attend by all four of he mate to give additional solemnity to the announcement -- repeat the previous day 's order and conclude by say that twenty-four hour would be give for all to acquiesce but the second day pass and at quarter untouched every beard bristle on its chin forthwith captain claret summon the midshipman who receive he order hurry to the various division of the gun and communicate they to the lieutenant respectively station over division the officer command mine turn upon we and say man if tomorrow night i find any of you with long hair or whisker of a standard violate the navy regulation the name of such offender shall be put down on the report the affair have now assume a most serious aspect the captain be in earnest the excitement increase ten-fold and a great many of the older seaman exasperate to the uttermost talk about _ knock of duty _ till the obnoxious mandate be revoke i think it impossible that they would seriously think of such a folly but there be no know what man-of-war 's - man will sometimes do under provocation -- witness parker and the nore that same night when the first watch be set the man in a body drive the two boatswain 's mate from they station at the fore and main hatchway and unshipped the ladder thus cut off all communication between the gun and spar deck forward of the main-mast mad jack have the trumpet and no sooner be this incipient mutiny report to he than he jump right down among the mob and fearlessly mingle with they exclaim what do you mean man do not be fool this be no way to get what you want turn to my lad turn to boatswain 's mate ship that ladder so up you tumble now my hearty away you go he gallant off-handed confident manner recognize no attempt at mutiny operate upon the sailor like magic they _ tumble up _ as command and for the rest of that night contented themselves with privately fulminate they displeasure against the captain and publicly emblazon every anchor-button on the coat of admire mad jack captain claret happen to be take a nap in he cabin at the moment of the disturbance and it be quell so soon that he know nothing of it till it be officially report to he it be afterward rumor through the ship that he reprimand mad jack for act as he do he main-tain that he should at once have summon the marine and charge upon the mutineer but if the saying imputed to the captain be true he nevertheless refrain from subsequently notice the disturbance or attempt to seek out and punish the ringleader this be but wise for there be time when even the most potent governor must wink at transgression in order to preserve the law inviolate for the future and great care be to be take by timely management to avert a incontestable act of mutiny and so prevent man from be rouse by they own consciousness of transgression into all the fury of a unbounded insurrection _ then _ for the time both soldier and sailor be irresistible as even the valor of caesar be make to know and the prudence of germanicus when they legion rebel and not all the concession of earl spencer as first lord of the admiralty nor the threat and entreaty of lord bridport the admiral of the fleet -- no nor he gracious majesty 's plenary pardon in prospective could prevail upon the spithead mutineer -lrb- when at last fairly lash up to the mark -rrb- to succumb until desert by they own mess-mate and a handful be leave in the breach therefore mad jack you do right and no one else could have acquit himself better by you crafty simplicity good-natured daring and off-handed air -lrb- as if nothing be happen -rrb- you perhaps quell a very serious affair in the bud and prevent the disgrace to the american navy of a tragical mutiny grow out of whisker soap-suds and razor think of it if future historian should devote a long chapter to the great _ rebellion of the beard _ on board the united state ship neversink why through all time thereafter barber would cut down they spiralised pole and substitute miniature main-mast for the emblem of they call and here be ample scope for some pregnant instruction how that event of vast magnitude in we man-of-war world may originate in the pettiest of trifle but that be a old theme we waive it and proceed on the morning follow though it be not a regular shave day the gun-deck barber be observe to have they shop open they match-tub accommodation in readiness and they razor display with they brush raise a mighty lather in they tin pot they stand eye the pass throng of seaman silently invite they to walk in and be serve in addition to they usual implement they now flourish at interval a huge pair of sheep-shears by way of more forcibly remind the man of the edict which that day must be obey or woe betide they for some hour the seaman pace to and fro in no very good humor vow not to sacrifice a hair beforehand they denounce that man who should abase himself by compliance but habituation to discipline be magical and ere long a old forecastle-man be discover elevated upon a match-tub while with a malicious grin he barber -- a fellow who from he merciless rasp be call blue-skin -- seize he by he long beard and at one fall stroke cut it off and toss it out of the port-hole behind he this forecastle-man be ever afterwards know by a significant title -- in the main equivalent to that name of reproach fasten upon that athenian who in alexander 's time previous to which all the greek sport beard first submit to the deprivation of he own but spite of all the contempt hurl on we forecastle-man so prudent a example be soon follow presently all the barber be busy sad sight at which any one but a barber or a tartar would have weep beard three year old _ goatee _ that would have grace a chamoix of the alp _ imperial _ that count d'orsay would have envy and _ love-curl _ and man-of-war ringlet that would have measure inch for inch with the longest tress of the fair one with the golden lock -- all go by the board captain claret how can you rest in you hammock by this brown beard which now wave from my chin -- the illustrious successor to that first young vigorous beard i yield to you tyranny -- by this manly beard i swear it be barbarous my noble captain jack chase be indignant not even all the special favor he have receive from captain claret and the plenary pardon extend to he for he desertion into the peruvian service could restrain the expression of he feeling but in he cooler moment jack be a wise man he at last deem it but wisdom to succumb when he go to the barber he almost draw tear from he eye seat himself mournfully on the match-tub he look sideways and say to the barber who be _ slither _ he sheep-shears in readiness to begin : my friend i trust you scissors be consecrate let they not touch this beard if they have yet to be dip in holy water beard be sacred thing barber have you no feeling for beard my friend think of it and mournfully he lay he deep-dyed russet cheek upon he hand two summer have go by since my chin have be reap i be in coquimbo then on the spanish main and when the husband-man be sowing he autumnal grain on the vega i start this bless beard and when the vine-dresser be trim they vine in the vineyard i first trim it to the sound of a flute ah barber have you no heart this beard have be caress by the snow-white hand of the lovely tomasita of tombez -- the castilian belle of all lower peru think of _ that _ barber i have wear it as a officer on the quarter-deck of a peruvian man-of-war i have sport it at brilliant fandango in lima i have be alow and aloft with it at sea yea barber it have stream like a admiral 's pennant at the mast-head of this same gallant frigate the neversink oh barber barber it stab I to the heart -- talk not of haul down you ensign and standard when vanquish -- what be _ that _ barber to strike the flag that nature herself have nail to the mast here noble jack 's feeling overcome he : he drop from the animated attitude into which he enthusiasm have momentarily transport he he proud head sink upon he chest and he long sad beard almost graze the deck ay trail you beard in grief and dishonor oh crew of the neversink sigh jack barber come closer -- now tell I my friend have you obtain absolution for this deed you be about to commit you have not then barber i will absolve you you hand shall be wash of this sin it be not you but another and though you be about to shear off my manhood yet barber i freely forgive you kneel kneel barber that i may bless you in token that i cherish no malice so when this barber who be the only tender-hearted one of he tribe have kneel be absolved and then bless jack give up he beard into he hand and the barber clipping it off with a sigh hold it high aloft and parody the style of the boatswain 's mate cry aloud d'ye hear fore and aft this be the beard of we matchless jack chase the noble captain of this frigate 's main-top chapter lxxxvi the rebel bring to the mast though many head of hair be shear and many fine beard reap that day yet several still hold out and vow to defend they sacred hair to the last gasp of they breath these be chiefly old sailor -- some of they petty officer -- who presume upon they age or rank doubtless thought that after so many have comply with the captain 's command _ they _ be but a handful would be exempt from compliance and remain a monument of we master 's clemency that same evening when the drum beat to quarter the sailor go sullenly to they gun and the old tar who still sport they beard stand up grim defy and motionless as the row of sculptured assyrian king who with they magnificent beard have recently be exhume by layard when the proper time arrive they name be take down by the officer of division and they be afterward summon in a body to the mast where the captain stand ready to receive they the whole ship 's company crowd to the spot and amid the breathless multitude the vener-able rebel advance and unhatt it be a impose display they be old and venerable mariner they cheek have be burn brown in all latitudes wherever the sun send a tropical ray reverend old tar one and all some of they might have be grandsire with grandchild in every port round the world they ought to have command the veneration of the most frivolous or magisterial beholder even captain claret they ought to have humiliate into deference but a scythian be touch with no reverential prompting and as the roman student well know the August senator themselves seat in the senate-house on the majestic hill of the capitol have they holy beard tweak by the insolent chief of the goth such a array of beard spade-shaped hammer-shaped dagger-shaped triangular square peak round hemispherical and fork but chief among they all be old ushant 's the ancient captain of the forecastle of a gothic venerableness it fall upon he breast like a continual iron-gray storm ah old ushant nestor of the crew it promote my longevity to behold you he be a man-of-war 's - man of the old benbow school he wear a short cue which the wag of the mizzen-top call he _ plug of pig-tail _ about he waist be a broad boarder 's belt which he wear he say to brace he main-mast mean he backbone for at time he complain of rheumatic twinge in the spine consequent upon sleep on deck now and then during the night-watch of upward of half a century he sheath-knife be a antique -- a sort of

more in obedience to order they then parade themselves at the mast and address the captain say sir we _ muzzle-lashing _ be cast off nor be it unworthy of be chronicle that not a single sailor who comply with the general order but refuse to sport the vile _ regulation-whisker _ prescribe by the navy department no like hero they cry shave I clean i will not wear a hair since i can not wear all on the morrow after breakfast ushant be take out of iron and with the master-at-arms on one side and a armed sentry on the other be escort along the gun-deck and up the ladder to the main-mast there the captain stand firm as before they must have guard the old man thus to prevent he escape to the shore something less than a thousand mile distant at the time well sir will you have that beard take

little time to abate and when at last old ushant be tie up by the arm and leg and he venerable back be expose -- that back which have bow at the gun of the frigate constitution when she capture the guerriere -- the captain seem to relent you be a very old man he say and i be sorry to flog you but my order must be obey i will give you one more chance will you have that beard take off captain claret say the old man turn round painfully in he bond you may flog I if you will but sir in this one thing i _ can not _ obey you lay on i 'll see he backbone roar the captain in a sudden fury by

say the captain and now go and cut you own throat hoarsely whisper a old sheet-anchor-man a mess-mate of ushant 's when the master-at-arms advance with the prisoner 's shirt ushant wave he off with the dignified air of a brahim say do you think master-at-arms that i be hurt i will put on my own garment i be never the worse for it man and ` tis no dishonor when he who would dishonor you only dishonor himself what say he cry the captain what say that tarry old philosopher with the smoking back tell it to I sir if you dare sentry take that man back to the brig stop john ushant you have be captain of the forecastle i break you and now you go into the brig there to remain till you consent to have that beard take off my beard be my own say the old man quietly sen-try i be ready and back he go into durance between the gun but after lie some four or five day in iron a order come to remove they but he be still keep confine book be allow he and he spend much time in reading but he also spend many hour in braid he beard and interweave with it strip of red bunting as if he desire to dress out and adorn the thing which have triumph over all opposition he remain a prisoner till we arrive in america but the very moment he hear the chain rattle out of the hawse-hole and the ship swing to she anchor he start to he foot dash the sentry aside and gain the deck exclaim at home with my beard he term of service have some month previous expire and the ship be now in harbor he be beyond the reach of naval law and the officer dare not molest he but without unduly avail himself of these circumstance the old man merely get he bag and hammock together hire a boat and throw himself into the stern be row ashore amid the unsuppressible cheer of all hand it be a glorious conquest over the conqueror himself as well worthy to be celebrate as the battle of the nile though as i afterward learn ushant be earnestly entreat to put the case into some lawyer 's hand he firmly decline say i have win the battle my friend and i do not care for the prize-money but even have he comply with these entreaty from precedent in similar case it be almost certain that not a sou 's worth of satisfaction would have be receive i know not in what frigate you sail now old ushant but heaven protect you storied old beard in whatever typhoon it may blow and if ever it must be shear old man may it fare like the royal beard of henry i of england and be clip by the right reverend hand of some archbishop of see as for captain claret let it not be suppose that it be here seek to impale he before the world as a cruel black-hearted man such he be not nor be he upon the whole regard by he crew with anything like the feeling which man-of-war 's - man sometimes cherish toward signally tyrannical commander in truth the majority of the neversink 's crew -- in previous cruise habituate to flagrant misusage -- deem captain claret a lenient officer in many thing he certainly refrain from oppress they it have be relate what privilege he accord to the seaman respect the free playing of checkers -- a thing almost unheard of in most american man-of-war in the matter of oversee the man 's clothing also he be remarkably indulgent compare with the conduct of other navy captain who by sumptuary regulation oblige they sailor to run up large bill with the purser for clothes in a word of whatever act captain claret might have be guilty in the neversink perhaps none of they proceed from any personal organic hard-heartedness what he be the usage of the navy have make he have he be a mere landsman -- a merchant say -- he would no doubt have be consider a kind-hearted man there may be some who shall read of this bartholomew massacre of beard who will yet marvel perhaps that the loss of a few hair more or less should provoke such hostility from the sailor lash they into so froth a rage indeed come near breed a mutiny but these circumstance be not without precedent not to speak of the riot attend with the loss of life which once occur in madrid in resistance to a arbitrary edict of the king 's seek to suppress the cloak of the cavalier and not to make mention of other instance that might be quote it need only to point out the rage of the saxon in the time of william the conqueror when that despot command the hair on they upper lip to be shave off -- the hereditary mustach which whole generation have sport the multitude of the dispirited vanquish be oblige to acquiesce but many saxon franklin and gentleman of spirit choosing rather to lose they castle than they mustach voluntarily desert they fireside and go into exile all this be indignantly relate by the stout saxon friar matthew pari in he _ historium major _ begin with the norman conquest and that we man-of-war 's - man be right in desire to perpetuate they beard as martial appurtenance must seem very plain when it be consider that as the beard be the token of manhood so in some shape or other have it ever be hold the true badge of a warrior bonaparte 's grenadier be stout whiskerando and perhaps in a charge those fierce whisker of theirs do as much to appall the foe as the sheen of they bayonet most all fight creature sport either whisker or beard it seem a law of dame nature witness the boar the tiger the cougar man the leopard the ram the cat -- all warrior and all whiskerando whereas the peace-loving tribe have mostly enameled chin chapter lxxxviii flog through the fleet the flogging of a old man like ushant most landsman will probably regard with abhorrence but though from peculiar circumstance he case occasion a good deal of indignation among the people of the neversink yet upon its own proper grounds they do not denounce it man-of-war 's - man be so habituate to what landsman would deem excessive cruelty that they be almost reconcile to inferior severity and here though the subject of punishment in the navy have be canvass in previous chapter and though the thing be every way a most unpleasant and grievous one to enlarge upon and though i painfully nerve myself to it while i write a feeling of duty compel I to enter upon a branch of the subject till now undiscussed i would not be like the man who see a outcast perishing by the roadside turn about to he friend say let we cross the way my soul so sicken at this sight that i can not endure it there be certain enormity in this man-of-war world that often secure impunity by they very excessiveness some ignorant people will refrain from permanently remove the cause of a deadly malaria for fear of the temporary spread of its offensiveness let we not be of such the more repugnant and repel the greater the evil leave we woman and child behind let we freely enter this golgotha year ago there be a punishment inflict in the english and i believe in the american navy call _ keel-hauling _ -- a phrase still employ by man-of-war 's - man when they would express some signal vengeance upon a personal foe the practice still remain in the french national marine though it be by no means resort to so frequently as in time past it consist of attach tackle to the two extremity of the main-yard and pass the rope under the ship 's bottom to one end of this rope the culprit be secure he own shipmate be then make to run he up and down first on this side then on that -- now scrape the ship 's hull under water -- anon hoist stunned and breathless into the air but though this barbarity be now abolish from the english and american navy there still remain another practice which if anything be even worse than _ keel-hauling _ this remnant of the middle age be know in the navy as _ flog through the fleet _ it be never inflict except by authority of a court-martial upon some trespasser deem guilty of a flagrant offence never that i know of have it be inflict by a american man-of-war on the home station the reason probably be that the officer well know that such a spectacle would raise a mob in any american seaport by xli of the article of war a court-martial shall not for any one offence not capital inflict a punishment beyond one hundred lash in case not capital this law may be and have be quote in judicial justification of the infliction of more than one hundred lash indeed it would cover a thousand thus : one act of a sailor may be construe into the commission of ten different transgression for each of which he may be legally condemn to a hundred lash to be inflict without intermission it will be perceive that in any case deem capital a sailor under the above article may legally be flog to the death but neither by the article of war nor by any other enactment of congress be there any direct warrant for the extraordinary cruelty of the mode in which punishment be inflict in case of flog through the fleet but as in numerous other instance the incidental aggravation of this penalty be indirectly cover by other clause in the article of war : one of which authorise the authority of a ship -- in certain indefinite case -- to correct the guilty _ accord to the usage of the sea-service _ one of these usage be the following : all hand be call to witness punishment in the ship to which the culprit belong the sentence of the court-martial condemn he be read when with the usual solemnity a portion of the punishment be inflict in order that it shall not lose in severity by the slightest exhaustion in the arm of the executioner a fresh boatswain 's mate be call out at every dozen as the lead idea be to strike terror into the beholder the greatest number of lash be inflict on board the culprit 's own ship in order to render he the more shocking spectacle to the crew of the other vessel the first infliction be conclude the culprit 's shirt be throw over he he be put into a boat -- the rogue 's march be play meanwhile -- and row to the next ship of the squadron all hand of that ship be then call to man the rigging and another portion of the punishment be inflict by the boatswain 's mate of that ship the bloody shirt be again throw over the seaman and thus he be carry through the fleet or squadron till the whole sentence be inflict in other case the launch -- the largest of the boat -- be rig with a platform -lrb- like a headsman 's scaffold -rrb- upon which halberd something like those use in the english army be erect they consist of two stout pole plant upright upon the platform stand a lieutenant a surgeon a master-at-arms and the executioner with they cat they be row through the fleet stop at each ship till the whole sentence be inflict as before in some case the attend surgeon have professionally interfere before the last lash have be give allege that immediate death must ensue if the remainder should be administer without a respite but instead of humanely remit the remain lash in a case like this the man be generally consign to he cot for ten or twelve day and when the surgeon officially report he capable of undergo the rest of the sentence it be forthwith inflict shylock must have he pound of flesh to say that after be flog through the fleet the prisoner 's back be sometimes puff up like a pillow or to say that in other case it look as if burn black before a roast fire or to say that you may track he through the squadron by the blood on the bulwark of every ship would only be say what many seaman have see several week sometimes whole month elapse before the sailor be sufficiently recover to resume he duty during the greater part of that interval he lie in the sick-bay groan out he day and night and unless he have the hide and constitution of a rhinoceros he never be the man he be before but break and shatter to the marrow of he bone sink into death before he time instance have occur where he have expire the day after the punishment no wonder that the englishman dr granville -- himself once a surgeon in the navy -- declare in he work on russium that the barbarian knout itself be not a greater torture to undergo than the navy cat-o ' - nine-tail some year ago a fire break out near the powder magazine in a american national ship one of the squadron at anchor in the bay of naple the utmost alarm prevail a cry go fore and aft that the ship be about to blow up one of the seaman spring overboard in affright at length the fire be get under and the man be pick up he be try before a court-martial find guilty of cowardice and condemn to be flog through the fleet in due time the squadron make sail for algier and in that harbor once haunt by pirate the punishment be inflict -- the bay of naple though wash the shore of a absolute king not be deem a fit place for such a exhibition of american naval law while the neversink be in the pacific a american sailor who have deposit a vote for general harrison for president of the united state be flog through the fleet chapter lxxxix the social state in a man-of-war bur the flogging at the gangway and the flogging through the fleet the stealing highway robbery swearing gambling blaspheming thimble-riggings smuggling and tippling of a man-of-war which throughout this narrative have be here and there sketch from the life by no means comprise the whole catalogue of evil one single feature be full of significance all large ship of war carry soldier call marine in the neversink there be something less than fifty two third of whom be irishman they be officer by a lieutenant a orderly sergeant two sergeant and two corporal with a drummer and fifer the custom generally be to have a marine to each gun which rule usually furnish the scale for distribute the soldier in vessel of different force we marine have no other than martial duty to perform except that at sea they stand watch like the sailor and now and then lazily assist in pull the rope but they never put foot in rigging or hand in tar-bucket on the quarter-bill these man be station at none of the great gun on the station-bill they have no post at the rope what then be they for to serve they country in time of battle let we see when a ship be run into action she marine generally lie flat on they face behind the bulwark -lrb- the sailor be sometimes order to do the same -rrb- and when the vessel be fairly engage they be usually draw up in the ship 's waist -- like a company review in the park at close quarter they musket may pick off a seaman or two in the rigging but at long-gun distance they must passively stand in they rank and be decimate at the enemy 's leisure only in one case in ten -- that be when they vessel be attempt to be board by a large party be these marine of any essential service as fight man with they bayonet they be then call upon to repel if comparatively so useless as soldier why have marine at all in the navy know then that what standing army be to nation what turnkey be to jail these marine be to the seaman in all large men-of-war they musket be they key with those musket they stand guard over the fresh water over the grog when dole over the provision when be serve out by the master 's mate over the brig or jail at the commodore 's and captain 's cabin door and in port at both gangway and forecastle surely the crowd of sailor who besides have so many sea-officer over they be thus additionally guard by soldier even when they quench they thirst -- surely these man-of-war 's - man must be desperado indeed or else the naval service must be so tyrannical that the worst be fear from they possible insubordination either reason hold good or both accord to the character of the officer and crew it must be evident that the man-of-war 's - man cast but a evil eye on a marine to call a man a horse-marine be among seaman one of the greatest term of contempt but the mutual contempt and even hatred subsist between these two body of man -- both cling to one keel both lodge in one household -- be hold by most navy officer as the height of the perfection of navy discipline it be regard as the button that cap the uttermost point on they main-mast thus they reason : secure of this antagonism between the marine and the sailor we can always rely upon it that if the sailor mutiny it need no great incitement for the marine to thrust he bayonet through he heart if the marine revolt the pike of the sailor be impatient to charge check and balance blood against blood _ that _ be the cry and the argument what apply to the relation in which the marine and sailor stand toward each other -- the mutual repulsion imply by a system of check -- will in degree apply to nearly the entire interior of a man-of-war 's discipline the whole body of this discipline be emphatically a system of cruel cog and wheel systematically grind up in one common hopper all that might minister to the moral well-being of the crew it be the same with both officer and man if a captain have a grudge against a lieutenant or a lieutenant against a midshipman how easy to torture he by official treatment which shall not lay open the superior officer to legal rebuke and if a midshipman bear a grudge against a sailor how easy for he by cunning practice bear of a boyish spite to have he degrade at the gangway through all the endless ramification of rank and station in most men-of-war there run a sinister vein of bitterness not exceed by the fireside hatred in a family of stepson ashore it be sicken to detail all the paltry irritability jealousy and cabal the spiteful detraction and animosity that lurk far down and cling to the very kelson of the ship it be unman to think of the immutable ceremony and iron etiquette of a man-of-war the spiked barrier separate the various grade of rank the delegated absolutism of authority on all hand the impossibility on the part of the common seaman of appeal from incidental abuse and many more thing that might be enumerate all tend to beget in most armed ship a general social condition which be the precise reverse of what any christian could desire and though there be vessel that in some measure furnish exception to this and though in other ship the thing may be glaze over by a guard punctilious exterior almost completely hide the truth from casual visitor while the worst fact touch the common sailor be systematically keep in the background yet it be certain that what have here be say of the domestic interior of a man-of-war will in a greater or less degree apply to most vessel in the navy it be not that the officer be so malevolent nor altogether that the man-of-war 's - man be so vicious some of these evil be unavoidably generate through the operation of the naval code other be absolutely organic to a navy establishment and like other organic evil be incurable except when they dissolve with the body they live in chapter xc the manning of navy the gallows and the sea refuse nothing be a very old sea say and among all the wondrous print of hogarth there be none remain more true at the present day than that dramatic boat-scene where after consort with harlot and gamble on tomb-stone the idle apprentice with the villainous low forehead be at last represent as be push off to sea with a ship and a gallows in the distance but hogarth should have convert the ship 's mast themselves into tyburn-tree and thus with the ocean for a background close the career of he hero it would then have have all the dramatic force of the opera of don juan who after run he impious course be sweep from we sight in a tornado of devil for the sea be the true tophet and bottomless pit of many worker of iniquity and as the german mystic feign gehenna within gehenna even so be men-of-war familiarly know among sailor as float hell and as the sea accord to old fuller be the stable of brute monster glide hither and thither in unspeakable swarm even so be it the home of many moral monster who fitly divide its empire with the snake the shark and the worm nor be sailor and man-of-war 's - man especially at all blind to a true sense of these thing _ purser rig and parish damned _ be the sailor say in the american navy when the tyro first mount the line frock and blue jacket aptly manufacture for he in a state prison ashore no wonder that lure by some _ crimp _ into a service so galling and perhaps persecute by a vindictive lieutenant some repentant sailor have actually jump into the sea to escape from they fate or set themselves adrift on the wide ocean on the grating without compass or rudder in one case a young man after be nearly cut into dog 's meat at the gangway load he pocket with shot and walk overboard some year ago i be in a whaling ship lie in a harbor of the pacific with three french men-of-war alongside one dark moody night a suppress cry be hear from the face of the water and think it be some one drown a boat be lower when two french sailor be pick up half dead from exhaustion and nearly throttle by a bundle of they clothes tie fast to they shoulder in this manner they have attempt they escape from they vessel when the french officer come in pursuit these sailor rally from they exhaustion fight like tiger to resist be capture though this story concern a french armed ship it be not the less applicable in degree to those of other nation mix with the man in a american armed ship mark how many foreigner there be though it be against the law to enlist they nearly one third of the petty officer of the neversink be bear east of the atlantic why be this because the same principle that operate in hinder american from hire themselves out as menial domestic also restrain they in a great measure from voluntarily assume a far worse servitude in the navy _ sailor want for the navy _ be a common announcement along the wharf of we sea-port they be always _ want _ it may have be in part owe to this scarcity man-of-war 's man that not many year ago black slave be frequently to be find regularly enlist with the crew of a american frigate they master receive they pay this be in the tooth of a law of congress expressly prohibit slave in the navy this law indirectly mean black slave nothing be say concern white one but in view of what john randolph of roanoke say about the frigate that carry he to russium and in view of what most armed vessel actually be at present the american navy be not altogether a inappropriate place for hereditary bondman still the circumstance of they be find in it be of such a nature that to some it may hardly appear credible the incredulity of such person nevertheless must yield to the fact that on board of the united state ship neversink during the present cruise there be a virginian slave regularly ship as a seaman he owner receive he wages guinea -- such be he name among the crew -- belong to the purser who be a southern gentleman he be employ as he body servant never do i feel my condition as a man-of-war 's - man so keenly as when see this guinea freely circulate about the deck in citizen 's clothes and through the influence of he master almost entirely exempt from the disciplinary degradation of the caucasian crew fare sumptuously in the ward-room sleek and round he ebon face fairly polished with content : ever gay and hilarious ever ready to laugh and joke that african slave be actually envy by many of the seaman there be time when i almost envy he myself lemsford once envy he outright ah guinea he sigh you have peaceful time you never open the book i read in one morning when all hand be call to witness punishment the purser 's slave as usual be observe to be hurry down the ladder toward the ward-room he face wear that peculiar pinched blueness which in the negro answer to the paleness cause by nervous agitation in the white where be you go guinea cry the deck-officer a humorous gentleman who sometimes divert himself with the purser 's slave and well know what answer he would now receive from he where be you go guinea say this officer turn about do not you hear the call sir ' _ scuse _ I massa say the slave with a low salutation i can not ` tand it i can not indeed massa and so say he disappear beyond the hatchway he be the only person on board except the hospital-steward and the invalid of the sick-bay who be exempt from be present at the administer of the scourge accustom to light and easy duty from he birth and so fortunate as to meet with none but gentle master guinea though a bondman liable to be saddle with a mortgage like a horse -- guinea in india-rubber manacle enjoy the liberty of the world though he body-and-soul proprietor the purser never in any way individualise I while i serve on board the frigate and never do I a good office of any kind -lrb- it be hardly in he power -rrb- yet from he pleasant kind indulgent manner toward he slave i always imputed to he a generous heart and cherish a involuntary friendliness toward he upon we arrival home he treatment of guinea under circumstance peculiarly calculate to stir up the resentment of a slave-owner still more augmented my estimation of the purser 's good heart mention have be make of the number of foreigner in the american navy but it be not in the american navy alone that foreigner bear so large a proportion to the rest of the crew though in no navy perhaps have they ever bear so large a proportion as in we own accord to a english estimate the foreigner serve in the king 's ship at one time amount to one eighth of the entire body of seaman how it be in the french navy i can not with certainty say but i have repeatedly sail with english seaman who have serve in it one of the effect of the free introduction of foreigner into any navy can not be sufficiently deplore during the period i live in the neversink i be repeatedly strike by the lack of patriotism in many of my shipmate true they be mostly foreigner who unblushingly avow that be it not for the difference of pay they would as lief man the gun of a english ship as those of a american or frenchman nevertheless it be evident that as for any high-toned patriotic feeling there be comparatively very little -- hardly any of it -- evince by we sailor as a body upon reflection this be not to be wonder at from they roving career and the sundering of all domestic tie many sailor all the world over be like the free companion who some century ago wander over europe ready to fight the battle of any prince who could purchase they sword the only patriotism be bear and nurture in a stationary home and upon a immovable hearth-stone but the man-of-war 's - man though in he voyaging he wed the two pole and bring both indy together yet let he wander where he will he carry he one only home along with he : that home be he hammock _ bear under a gun and educate on the bowsprit _ accord to a phrase of he own the man-of-war-man roll round the world like a billow ready to mix with any sea or be suck down to death in the maelstrom of any war yet more the dread of the general discipline of a man-of-war the special obnoxiousness of the gangway the protracted confinement on board ship with so few liberty day and the pittance of pay -lrb- much less than what can always be have in the merchant service -rrb- these thing contrive to deter from the navy of all country by far the majority of they best seaman this will be obvious when the follow statistical fact take from macpherson 's annals of commerce be consider at one period upon the peace establishment the number of man employ in the english navy be 25000 at the same time the english merchant service be employ 118952 but while the necessity of a merchantman render it indispensable that the greater part of she crew be able seaman the circumstance of a man-of-war admit of she mustering a crowd of landsmen soldier and boy in she service by a statement of captain marryat 's in he pamphlet -lrb- a d 1822 -rrb- on the abolition of impressment it appear that at the close of the bonaparte war a full third of all the crew of he majesty 's fleet consist of landsman and boy far from enter with enthusiasm into the king 's ship when they country be menace the great body of english seaman appal at the discipline of the navy adopt unheard-of device to escape its press-gang some even hide themselves in cave and lonely place inland fear to run the risk of seek a berth in a outward-bound merchantman that might have carry they beyond sea in the true narrative of john nichol mariner publish in 1822 by blackwood in edinburgh and cadell in london and which everywhere bear the spontaneous impress of truth the old sailor in the most artless touching and almost uncomplaining manner tell of he skulk like a thief for whole year in the country round about edin-burgh to avoid the press-gang prowl through the land like bandit and burker at this time -lrb- bonaparte 's war -rrb- accord to steel 's list there be forty-five regular press-gang station in great britain -lrb- 5 -rrb- -- -lrb- footnote-5 -rrb- besides this domestic kidnapping british frigate in friendly or neutral harbor in some instance press into they service foreign sailor of all nation from the public wharf in certain case where american be concern when _ protection _ be find upon they person these be destroy and to prevent the american consul from claim he sailor countryman the press-gang generally go on shore the night previous to the sailing of the frigate so that the kidnap seaman be far out to sea before they could be miss by they friend these thing should be know for in case the english government again go to war with its fleet and should again resort to indiscriminate impressment to man they it be well that both englishman and american that all the world be prepare to put down a iniquity outrageous and insulting to god and man -- in a later instance a large body of british seaman solemnly assemble upon the eve of a anticipated war and together determine that in case of its break out they would at once flee to america to avoid be press into the service of they country -- a service which degrade she own guardian at the gangway at another time long previous to this accord to a english navy officer lieutenant tomlinson three thousand seaman impel by the same motive flee ashore in a panic from the collier between yarmouth road and the nore elsewhere he say in speaking of some of the man on board the king 's ship that they be most miserable object this remark be perfectly corroborate by other testimony refer to another period in allude to the lament scarcity of good english seaman during the war of 1808 etc the author of a pamphlet on naval subject say that all the best seaman the steadiest and best-behaved man generally succeed in avoid the impress this writer be or have be himself a captain in the british fleet now it may be easily imagine who be the man and of what moral character they be who even at the present day be willing to enlist as full-grown adult in a service so galling to all shore-manhood as the navy hence it come that the skulker and scoundrel of all sort in a man-of-war be chiefly compose not of regular seaman but of these dock-loper of landsmen man who enter the navy to draw they grog and murder they time in the notorious idleness of a frigate but if so idle why not reduce the number of a man-of-war 's crew and reasonably keep employ the rest it can not be do in the first place the magnitude of most of these ship require a large number of hand to brace the heavy yard hoist the enormous top-sail and weigh the ponderous anchor and though the occasion for the employment of so many man come but seldom it be true yet when that occasion _ do _ come -- and come it may at any moment -- this multitude of man be indispensable but besides this and to crown all the battery must be man there must be enough man to work all the gun at one time and thus in order to have a sufficiency of mortal at hand to sink burn and destroy a man-of-war through she vice hopelessly deprave the volunteer landsman and ordinary seaman of good habit who occasionally enlist -- must feed at the public cost a multitude of person who if they do not find a home in the navy would probably fall on the parish or linger out they day in a prison among other these be the man into whose mouth dibdin put he patriotic verse full of sea-chivalry and romance with a exception in the last line they might be sing with equal propriety by both english and american man-of-war 's - man as for I in all weather all time tide and end naught 's a trouble from duty that spring for my heart be my poll 's and my rhino 's my friend and as for my life it be the king 's to rancor unknown to no passion a slave nor unmanly nor mean nor a railer etc i do not unite with a high critical authority in consider dibdin 's ditty as slang song for most of they breathe the very poetry of the ocean but it be remarkable that those song -- which would lead one to think that man-of-war 's - man be the most care-free contented virtuous and patriotic of mankind -- be compose at a time when the english navy be principally man by felon and pauper as mention in a former chapter still more these song be pervade by a true mohammedan sensualism a reckless acquiescence in fate and a implicit unquestioning dog-like devotion to whoever may be lord and master dibdin be a man of genius but no wonder dibdin be a government pensioner at l200 per annum but notwithstanding the iniquity of a man-of-war man be to be find in they at time so use to a hard life so drill and discipline to servitude that with a incomprehensible philosophy they seem cheerfully to resign themselves to they fate they have plenty to eat spirit to drink clothing to keep they warm a hammock to sleep in tobacco to chew a doctor to medicine they a parson to pray for they and to a penniless castaway must not all this seem as a luxurious bill of fare there be on board of the neversink a fore-top-man by the name of landless who though he back be cross-barred and plaided with the ineffaceable scar of all the flogging accumulate by a reckless tar during a ten year ' service in the navy yet he perpetually wear a hilarious face and at joke and repartee be a very joe miller that man though a sea-vagabond be not create in vain he enjoy life with the zest of everlasting adolescence and though crib in a oaken prison with the turnkey sentry all round he yet he pace the gun-deck as if it be broad as a prairie and diversify in landscape as the hill and valley of the tyrol nothing ever disconcert he nothing could transmute he laugh into anything like a sigh those glandular secretion which in other captive sometimes go to the formation of tear in _ he _ be expectorate from the mouth tinge with the golden juice of a weed wherewith he solace and comfort he ignominious day rum and tobacco say landless what more do a sailor want he favorite song be _ dibdin 's true english sailor _ begin jack dance and sing and be always content in he vow to he lass he 'll ne'er fail she he anchor 's atrip when he money 's all spend and this be the life of a sailor but poor landless dance quite as often at the gangway under the lash as in the sailor dance-houses ashore another of he song also set to the significant tune of _ the king god bless he _ muster the follow line among many similar one : oh when safely land in boston or ` york oh how i will tipple and jig it and toss off my glass while my rhino hold out in drinking success to we frigate during the many idle hour when we frigate be lie in harbor this man be either merrily play at checkers or mend he clothes or snore like a trumpeter under the lee of the boom when fast asleep a national salute from we battery could hardly move he whether order to the main-truck in a gale or roll by the drum to the grog-tub or command to walk up to the grating and be lash landess always obey with the same invincible indifference he advice to a young lad who ship with we at valparaiso embody the pith and marrow of that philosophy which enable some man-of-war 's - man to wax jolly in the service _ shippy _ say landless take the pale lad by he neckerchief as if he have he by the halter shippy i have see sarvice with uncle sam -- i have sail in many _ andrew miller _ now take my advice and steer clear of all trouble d'ye see touch you tile whenever a swob -lrb- officer -rrb- speak to you and never mind how much they rope 's - end you keep you red-rag belay for you must know as how they do not fancy sea-lawyer and when the sarve out of slop come round stand up to it stiffly it be only a oh lord or two and a few oh my god -- that be all and what then why you sleep it off in a few night and turn out at last all ready for you grog this landless be a favorite with the officer among whom he go by the name of _ happy jack _ and it be just such happy jack as landless that most sea-officer profess to admire a fellow without shame without a soul so dead to the least dignity of manhood that he could hardly be call a man whereas a seaman who exhibit trait of moral sensitiveness whose demeanor show some dignity within this be the man they in many case instinctively dislike the reason be they feel such a man to be a continual reproach to they as be mentally superior to they power he have no business in a man-of-war they do not want such man to they there be a insolence in he manly freedom contempt in he very carriage he be unendurable as a erect lofty-minded african would be to some slave-driving planter let it not be suppose however that the remark in this and the precede chapter apply to _ all _ men-of-war there be some vessel bless with patriarchal intellectual captain gentlemanly and brotherly officer and docile and christianised crew the peculiar usage of such vessel insensibly soften the tyrannical rigor of the article of war in they scourge be unknown to sail in such ship be hardly to realize that you live under the martial law or that the evil above mention can anywhere exist and jack chase old ushant and several more fine tar that might be add sufficiently attest that in the neversink at least there be more than one noble man-of-war 's - man who almost redeem all the rest wherever throughout this narrative the american navy in any of its bearing have form the theme of a general discussion hardly one syllable of admiration for what be account illustrious in its achievement have be permit to escape I the reason be this : i consider that so far as what be call military renown be concern the american navy need no eulogist but history it be superfluous for white-jacket to tell the world what it know already the office impose upon I be of another cast and though i foresee and feel that it may subject I to the pillory in the hard thought of some man yet support by what god have give I i tranquilly abide the event whatever it may prove chapter xci smoking-club in a man-of-war with scene on the gun-deck drawing near home there be a fable about a painter move by jove to the painting of the head of medusa though the picture be true to the life yet the poor artist sicken at the sight of what he forced pencil have draw thus bear through my task toward the end my own soul now sink at what i myself have portray but let we forget past chapter if we may while we paint less repugnant thing metropolitan gentleman have they club provincial gossiper they news-room village quidnunc they barber 's shop the chinese they opium-house american indian they council-fire and even cannibal they _ noojona _ or talk-stone where they assemble at time to discuss the affair of the day nor be there any government however despotic that venture to deny to the least of its subject the privilege of a sociable chat not the thirty tyrant even -- the club post-captain of old athen -- could stop the wag tongue at the street-corner for chat man must and by we immortal bill of rights that guarantee to we liberty of speech chat we yankee will whether on board a frigate or on board we own terra-firma plantation in men-of-war the galley or cookery on the gun-deck be the grand center of gossip and news among the sailor here crowd assemble to chat away the half-hour elapse after every meal the reason why this place and these hour be select rather than other be this : in the neighborhood of the galley alone and only after meal be the man-of-war 's - man permit to regale himself with a smoke a sumptuary edict truly that deprive white-jacket for one of a luxury to which he have long be attach for how can the mystical motive the capricious impulse of a luxurious smoker go and come at the beck of a commodore 's command no when i smoke be it because of my sovereign good pleasure i choose so to do though at so unseasonable a hour that i send round the town for a brasier of coal what smoke by a sun-dial smoke on compulsion make a trade a business a vile recur calling of smoking and perhaps when those sedative fume have steep you in the grandest of reverie and circle over circle solemnly rise some immeasurable dome in you soul -- far away swell and heave into the vapor you raise -- as if from one mozart 's grandest march of a temple be rise like venus from the sea -- at such a time to have you whole parthenon tumble about you ear by the knell of the ship 's bell announce the expiration of the half-hour for smoking whip I ye fury toast I in saltpetre smite I some thunderbolt charge upon I endless squadron of mamaluke devour I feejee but preserve I from a tyranny like this no though i smoked like a indian summer ere i enter the neversink so abhorrent be this sumptuary law that i altogether abandon the luxury rather than enslave it to a time and a place herein do i not right ancient and honorable old guard of smoker all round the world but there be other of the crew not so fastidious as myself after every meal they hie to the galley and solace they soul with a whiff now a bunch of cigar all band together be a type and a symbol of the brotherly love between smoker likewise for the time in a community of pipe be a community of heart nor be it a ill thing for the indian sachem to circulate they calumet tobacco-bowl -- even as we own forefather circulate they punch-bowl -- in token of peace charity and good-will friendly feeling and sympathise soul and this it be that make the gossiper of the galley so loving a club so long as the vapoury bond unite they it be a pleasant sight to behold they group in the recess between the gun they chat and laugh like row of convivialist in the box of some vast dining-saloon take a flemish kitchen full of good fellow from tenier add a fireside group from wilkie throw in a naval sketch from cruickshank and then stick a short pipe into every mother 's son 's mouth and you have the smoking scene at the galley of the neversink not a few be politician and as there be some thought of a war with england at the time they discussion wax warm i tell you what it be _ shippy _ cry the old captain of gun no 1 on the forecastle if that ` ere president of ourn do not luff up into the wind by the battle of the nile he 'll be get we into a grand fleet engagement afore the yankee nation have ram home she cartridge -- let alone blow the match who talk of luff roar a royster fore-top-man keep we yankee nation large before the wind say i till you come plump on the enemy 's bow and then board he in the smoke and with that there come forth a mighty blast from he pipe who say the old man at the helm of the yankee nation can not steer he _ trick _ as well as george washington himself cry a sheet-anchor-man but they say he be a cold-water customer bill cry another and sometimes o ' night i somehow have a presentation that he be goin ' to stop we grog d'ye hear there fore and aft roar the boatswain 's mate at the gangway all hand tumble up and ` bout ship that be the talk cry the captain of gun no 1 as in obedience to the summons all hand drop they pipe and crowd toward the ladder and that be what the president must do -- go in stay my lad and put the yankee nation on the other tack but these political discussion by no means supply the staple of conversation for the gossip smoker of the galley the interior affair of the frigate itself form they principal theme rumor about the private life of the commodore in he cabin about the captain in he about the various officer in the ward-room about the _ reefer _ in the steerage and they madcap frolicking and about a thousand other matter touch the crew themselves all these -- form the eternally shift domestic by-play of a man-of-war -- prove inexhaustible topic for we quidnunc the animation of these scene be very much heighten as we draw nearer and nearer we port it rise to a climax when the frigate be report to be only twenty-four hour ' sail from the land what they should do when they land how they should invest they wages what they should eat what they should drink and what lass they should marry -- these be the topic which absorb they sink the sea cry a forecastle man once more ashore and you 'll never again catch old boombolt afloat i mean to settle down in a sail-loft cable-tier pincher blister all tarpaulin hat cry a young after-guard 's - man i mean to go back to the counter shipmate take I by the arm and swab up the lee-scupper with I but i mean to steer a clam-cart before i go again to a ship 's wheel let the navy go by the board -- to sea again i will not start my soul-bolt maty if any more blue peter and sailing signal fly at my fore cry the captain of the head my wages will buy a wheelbarrow if nothing more i have take my last dose of salt say the captain of the waist and after this mean to stick to fresh water ay maty ten of we waisters mean to club together and buy a _ serving-mallet boat _ d'ye see and if ever we drown it will be in the ` rage canal ' blast the sea shipmate say i profane not the holy element say lemsford the poet of the gun-deck lean over a cannon know ye not man-of-war 's - man that by the parthian magus the ocean be hold sacred do not tiridate the eastern monarch take a immense land circuit to avoid desecrate the mediterranean in order to reach he imperial master nero and do homage for he crown what lingo be that cry the captain of the waist who be commodore tiddery-eye cry the forecastle-man hear I out resume lemsford like tiridate i venerate the sea and venerate it so highly shipmate that evermore i shall abstain from cross it in _ that _ sense captain of the waist i echo you cry it be indeed a remarkable fact that nine man out of every ten of the neversink 's crew have form some plan or other to keep themselves ashore for life or at least on fresh water after the expiration of the present cruise with all the experience of that cruise accumulate in one intense recollection of a moment with the smell of tar in they nostril out of sight of land with a stout ship under foot and snuff the ocean air with all the thing of the sea surround they in they cool sober moment of reflection in the silence and solitude of the deep during the long night-watch when all they holy home association be throng round they heart in the spontaneous piety and devotion of the last hour of so long a voyage in the fullness and the frankness of they soul when there be naught to jar the well-poised equilibrium of they judgment -- under all these circumstance at least nine tenth of a crew of five hundred man-of-war 's - man resolve for ever to turn they back on the sea but do man ever hate the thing they love do man forswear the hearth and the homestead what then must the navy be but alas for the man-of-war 's - man who though he may take a hannibal oath against the service yet cruise after cruise and after forswear it again and again he be drive back to the spirit-tub and the gun-deck by he old hereditary foe the ever-devilish god of grog on this point let some of the crew of the neversink be call to the stand you captain of the waist and you seaman of the fore-top and you after-guard 's - man and other how come you here at the gun of the north carolina after register you solemn vow at the galley of the neversink they all hang they head i know the cause poor fellow perjure yourselve not again swear not at all hereafter ay these very tar -- the foremost in denounce the navy who have bind themselves by the most tremendous oath -- these very man not three day after get ashore be roll round the street in penniless drunkenness and next day many of they be to be find on board of the _ guardo _ or receiving-ship thus in part be the navy man but what be still more surprising and tend to impart a new and strange insight into the character of sailor and overthrow some long-established idea concern they as a class be this : number of man who during the cruise have pass for exceedingly prudent nay parsimonious person who would even refuse you a patch or a needleful of thread and from they stinginess procure the name of _ raveling _ -- no sooner be these man fairly adrift in harbor and under the influence of frequent quaffing than they three-year ' - earn wages fly right and left they summon whole boarding-house of sailor to the bar and treat they over and over again fine fellow generous-hearted tar see this sight i think to myself well these generous-hearted tar on shore be the greatest curmudgeon afloat it be the bottle that be generous not they yet the popular conceit concern a sailor be derive from he behavior ashore whereas ashore he be no longer a sailor but a landsman for the time a man-of-war 's - man be only a man-of-war 's - man at sea and the sea be the place to learn what he be but we have see that a man-of-war be but this old-fashioned world of ours afloat full of all manner of character -- full of strange contradiction and though boast some fine fellow here and there yet upon the whole charge to the combing of she hatchway with the spirit of belial and all unrighteousness chapter xcii the last of the jacket already have white-jacket chronicle the mishap and inconvenience trouble and tribulation of all sort bring upon he by that unfortunate but indispensable garment of he but now it befall he to record how this jacket for the second and last time come near prove he shroud of a pleasant midnight we good frigate now somewhere off the cape of virginium be run on bravely when the breeze gradually die leave we slowly glide toward we still invisible port head by jack chase the quarter-watch be recline in the top talk about the shore delight into which they intend to plunge while we captain often break in with allusion to similar conversation when he be on board the english line-of-battle ship the asia draw nigh to portsmouth in england after the battle of navarino suddenly a order be give to set the main-top-gallant-stun ' - sail and the halyard not be rove jack chase assign to I that duty now this reeving of the halyard of a main-top-gallant-stun ' - sail be a business that eminently demand sharpsightedness skill and celerity consider that the end of a line some two hundred foot long be to be carry aloft in you tooth if you please and drag far out on the giddiest of yard and after be worm and twist about through all sort of intricacy -- turn abrupt corner at the abruptest of angle -- be to be drop clear of all obstruction in a straight plumb-line right down to the deck in the course of this business there be a multitude of sheeve-hole and block through which you must pass it often the rope be a very tight fit so as to make it like thread a fine cambric needle with rather coarse thread indeed it be a thing only deftly to be do even by day judge then what it must be to be thread cambric needle by night and at sea upward of a hundred foot aloft in the air with the end of the line in one hand i be mount the top-mast shroud when we captain of the top tell I that i have better off jacket but though it be not a very cold night i have be recline so long in the top that i have become somewhat chilly so i think best not to comply with the hint have reeve the line through all the inferior block i go out with it to the end of the weather-top-gallant-yard-arm and be in the act of lean over and pass it through the suspend jewel-block there when the ship give a plunge in the sudden swell of the calm sea and pitch I still further over the yard throw the heavy skirt of my jacket right over my head completely muffle I somehow i think it be the sail that have flap and under that impression throw up my hand to drag it from my head rely upon the sail itself to support I meanwhile just then the ship give another sudden jerk and head-foremost i pitch from the yard i know where i be from the rush of the air by my ear but all else be a nightmare a bloody film be before my eye through which ghost-like pass and repass my father mother and sister a utterable nausea oppress I i be conscious of gasp there seem no breath in my body it be over one hundred foot that i fall -- down down with lung collapse as in death ten thousand pound of shot seem tie to my head as the irresistible law of gravitation drag I head foremost and straight as a die toward the infallible center of this terraqueous globe all i have see and read and hear and all i have think and feel in my life seem intensify in one fix idea in my soul but dense as this idea be it be make up of atom have fall from the project yard-arm end i be conscious of a collect satisfaction in feeling that i should not be dash on the deck but would sink into the speechless profound of the sea with the bloody blind film before my eye there be a still stranger hum in my head as if a hornet be there and i think to myself great god this be death yet these thought be unmixed with alarm like frost-work that flash and shift its scared hue in the sun all my braided blended emotion be in themselves icy cold and calm so protracted do my fall seem that i can even now recall the feeling of wonder how much longer it would be ere all be over and i strike time seem to stand still and all the world seem poise on they pole as i fall soul-becalmed through the eddy whirl and swirl of the maelstrom air at first as i have say i must have be precipitated head-foremost but i be conscious at length of a swift fling motion of my limb which involuntarily throw themselves out so that at last i must have fall in a heap this be more likely from the circumstance that when i strike the sea i feel as if some one have smite I slantingly across the shoulder and along part of my right side as i gushed into the sea a thunder-boom sound in my ear my soul seem fly from my mouth the feeling of death flood over I with the billow the blow from the sea must have turn I so that i sink almost foot foremost through a soft seething foamy lull some current seem hurry I away in a trance i yield and sink deeper down with a glide purple and pathless be the deep calm now around I fleck by summer lightning in a azure afar the horrible nausea be go the bloody blind film turn a pale green i wonder whether i be yet dead or still die but of a sudden some fashionless form brush my side -- some inert coiled fish of the sea the thrill of be alive again tingle in my nerve and the strong shun of death shock I through for one instant a agonising revulsion come over I as i find myself utterly sink next moment the force of my fall be expand and there i hang vibrate in the mid-deep what wild sound then ring in my ear one be a soft moan as of low wave on the beach the other wild and heartlessly jubilant as of the sea in the height of a tempest oh soul thou then heardest life and death : as he who stand upon the corinthian shore hear both the ionian and the aegean wave the life-and-death poise soon pass and then i find myself slowly ascend and catch a dim glimmering of light quicker and quicker i mount till at last i bound up like a buoy and my whole head be bath in the bless air i have fall in a line with the main-mast i now find myself nearly abreast of the mizzen-mast the frigate slowly glide by like a black world in the water she vast hull loom out of the night show hundred of seaman in the hammock-netting some toss over rope other madly fling overboard the hammock but i be too far out from they immediately to reach what they throw i essayed to swim toward the ship but instantly i be conscious of a feeling like be pinion in a feather-bed and move my hand feel my jacket puff out above my tight girdle with water i strove to tear it off but it be loop together here and there and the string be not then to be sunder by hand i whip out my knife that be tuck at my belt and rip my jacket straight up and down as if i be rip open myself with a violent struggle i then burst out of it and be free heavily soak it slowly sink before my eye sink sink oh shroud think i sink forever accursed jacket that thou art see that white shark cry a horrified voice from the taffrail he 'll have that man down he hatchway quick the _ grain _ the _ grain _ the next instant that barb bunch of harpoon pierce through and through the unfortunate jacket and swiftly speed down with it out of sight be now astern of the frigate i strike out boldly toward the elevated pole of one of the life-buoy which have be cut away soon after one of the cutter pick I up as they drag I out of the water into the air the sudden transition of element make my every limb feel like lead and i helplessly sink into the bottom of the boat ten minute after i be safe on board and spring aloft be order to reeve anew the stun ' - sail-halyard which slip through the block when i have let go the end have unrove and fall to the deck the sail be soon set and as if purposely to salute it a gentle breeze soon come and the neversink once more glide over the water a soft ripple at she bow and leave a tranquil wake behind chapter xciii cable and anchor all clear and now that the white jacket have sink to the bottom of the sea and the bless cape of virginium be believe to be broad on we bow -- though still out of sight -- we five

reckless improvident seaman who have live too fast during the cruise have little or nothing now stand on the credit side of they purser 's account shall i tell of the retreat of the five hundred inland not alas in battle-array as at quarter but scatter broadcast over the land shall i tell how the neversink be at last strip of spar shroud and sail -- have she gun hoist out -- she
