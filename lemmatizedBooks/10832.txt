produce by suzanne shell project gutenberg beginner project carnacki the ghost finder by william hope hodgson 1910 1912 no 1 -- the gateway of the monster in response to carnackus 's usual card of invitation to have dinner and listen to a story i arrive promptly at 427 cheyne walk to find the three other who be always invite to these happy little time there before I five minute later carnackus arkright jessop taylor and i be all engage in the pleasant occupation of dine you have not be long away this time i remark as i finish my soup forget momentarily carnackus 's dislike of be ask even to skirt the border of he story until such time as he be ready then he would not stint word that be all he reply with brevity and i change the subject remark that i have be buy a new gun to which piece of news he give a intelligent nod and a smile which i think show a genuinely good-humored appreciation of my intentional change of the conversation later when dinner be finish carnackus snug himself comfortably down in he big chair along with he pipe and begin he story with very little circumlocution : -- as dodgson be remark just now i have only be away a short time and for a very good reason too -- i have only be away a short distance the exact locality i be afraid i must not tell you but it be less than twenty mile from here though except for change a name that will not spoil the story and it be a story too one of the most extraordinary thing ever i have run against i receive a letter a fortnight ago from a man i must call anderson ask for a appointment i arrange a time and when he come i find that he wish I to investigate and see whether i could not clear up a long-standing and well -- too well -- authenticate case of what he term ` haunt ' he give I very full particulars and finally as the case seem to present something unique i decide to take it up two day later i drive to the house late in the afternoon i find it a very old place standing quite alone in its own grounds anderson have leave a letter with the butler i find plead excuse for he absence and leave the whole house at my disposal for my investigation the butler evidently know the object of my visit and i question he pretty thoroughly during dinner which i have in rather lonely state he be a old and privileged servant and have the history of the gray room exact in detail from he i learn more particulars regard two thing that anderson have mention in but a casual manner the first be that the door of the gray room would be hear in the dead of night to open and slam heavily and this even though the butler know it be lock and the key on the bunch in he pantry the second be that the bedclothes would always be find tear off the bed and hurl in a heap into a corner but it be the door slam that chiefly bother the old butler many and many a time he tell I have he lie awake and just get shiver with fright listen for sometimes the door would be slam time after time -- thud thud thud -- so that sleep be impossible from anderson i know already that the room have a history extend back over a hundred and fifty year three people have be strangle in it -- a ancestor of he and he wife and child this be authentic as i have take very great pain to discover so that you can imagine it be with a feeling i have a striking case to investigate that i go upstairs after dinner to have a look at the gray room peter the old butler be in rather a state about my go and assure I with much solemnity that in all the twenty year of he service no one have ever enter that room after nightfall he beg I in quite a fatherly way to wait till the morning when there would be no danger and then he could accompany I himself of course i smile a little at he and tell he not to bother i explain that i should do no more than look ` round a bit and perhaps affix a few seal he need not fear i be use to that sort of thing but he shake he head when i say that ` there be not many ghost like ours sir ' he assure I with mournful pride and by jove he be right as you will see i take a couple of candle and peter follow with he bunch of key he unlock the door but would not come inside with I he be evidently in a fright and he renew he request that i would put off my examination until daylight of course i laugh at he again and tell he he could stand sentry at the door and catch anything that come out ` it never come outside sir ' he say in he funny old solemn manner somehow he manage to make I feel as if i be go to have the ` creep ' right away anyway it be one to he you know i leave he there and examine the room it be a big apartment and well furnished in the grand style with a huge four-poster which stand with its head to the end wall there be two candle on the mantelpiece and two on each of the three table that be in the room i light the lot and after that the room feel a little less inhumanly dreary though mind you it be quite fresh and well keep in every way after i have take a good look ` round i seal length of baby ribbon across the window along the wall over the picture and over the fireplace and the wall closet all the time as i work the butler stand just without the door and i could not persuade he to enter though i jest he a little as i stretch the ribbon and go here and there about my work every now and again he would say : -- ` you 'll excuse I i be sure sir but i do wish you would come out sir i be fair in a quake for you ' i tell he he need not wait but he be loyal enough in he way to what he consider he duty he say he could not go away and leave I all alone there he apologize but make it very clear that i do not realize the danger of the room and i could see generally that he be in a pretty frightened state all the same i have to make the room so that i should know if anything material enter it so i ask he not to bother I unless he really hear or see something he be begin to get on my nerve and the ` feel ' of the room be bad enough without make it any nastier for a time further i work stretch ribbon across the floor and seal they so that the merest touch would have break they be anyone to venture into the room in the dark with the intention of play the fool all this have take I far longer than i have anticipate and suddenly i hear a clock strike eleven i have take off my coat soon after commence work now however as i have practically make a end of all that i intend to do i walk across to the settee and pick it up i be in the act of get into it when the old butler 's voice -lrb- he have not say a word for the last hour -rrb- come sharp and frightened : -- ` come out sir quick there be something go to happen ' jove but i jump and then in the same moment one of the candle on the table to the left go out now whether it be the wind or what i do not know but just for a moment i be enough startle to make a run for the door though i be glad to say that i pull up before i reach it i simply could not bunk out with the butler standing there after have as it be read he a sort of lesson on ` bein ' brave y' know ' so i just turn right ` round pick up the two candle off the mantelpiece and walk across to the table near the bed well i see nothing i blow out the candle that be still alight then i go to those on the two table and blow they out then outside of the door the old man call again : -- ` oh sir do be tell do be tell ' ` all right peter ' i say and by jove my voice be not as steady as i should have like i make for the door and have a bit of work not to start run i take some thundering long stride as you can imagine near the door i have a sudden feeling that there be a cold wind in the room it be almost as if the window have be suddenly open a little i get to the door and the old butler give back a step in a sort of instinctive way ` collar the candle peter ' i say pretty sharply and shove they into he hand i turn and catch the handle and slam the door shut with a crash somehow do you know as i do so i think i feel something pull back on it but it must have be only fancy i turn the key in the lock and then again double-locking the door i feel easier then and set-to and seal the door in addition i put my card over the keyhole and seal it there after which i pocket the key and go downstairs -- with peter who be nervous and silent lead the way poor old beggar it have not strike I until that moment that he have be endure a considerable strain during the last two or three hour about midnight i go to bed my room lay at the end of the corridor upon which open the door of the gray room i count the door between it and mine and find that five room lay between and i be sure you can understand that i be not sorry then just as i be begin to undress a idea come to I and i take my candle and seal wax and seal the door of all five room if any door slam in the night i should know just which one i return to my room lock the door and go to bed i be wake suddenly from a deep sleep by a loud crash somewhere out in the passage i sit up in bed and listen but hear nothing then i light my candle i be in the very act of light it when there come the bang of a door be violently slam along the corridor i jump out of bed and get my revolver i unlock the door and go out into the passage hold my candle high and keep the pistol ready then a queer thing happen i could not go a step toward the gray room you all know i be not really a cowardly chap i have go into too many case connect with ghostly thing to be accuse of that but i tell you i funk it simply funk it just like any bless kid there be something precious unholy in the air that night i run back into my bedroom and shut and lock the door then i sit on the bed all night and listen to the dismal thudding of a door up the corridor the sound seem to echo through all the house daylight come at last and i wash and dress the door have not slam for about a hour and i be get back my nerve again i feel ashamed of myself though in some way it be silly for when you be meddle with that sort of thing you nerve be bind to go sometimes and you just have to sit quiet and call yourself a coward until daylight sometimes it be more than just cowardice i fancy i believe at time it be something warn you and fight _ for _ you but all the same i always feel mean and miserable after a time like that when the day come properly i open my door and keep my revolver handy go quietly along the passage i have to pass the head of the stair along the way and who should i see come up but the old butler carry a cup of coffee he have merely tuck he nightshirt into he trousers and he have a old pair of carpet slipper on ` hullo peter ' i say feeling suddenly cheerful for i be as glad as any lose child to have a live human be close to I ` where be you off to with the refreshment ' the old man give a start and slop some of the coffee he stare up at I and i could see that he look white and done-up he come on up the stair and hold out the little tray to I ` i be very thankful indeed sir to see you safe and well ' he say ' i fear one time you might risk go into the gray room sir i have lie awake all night with the sound of the door and when it come light i think i would make you a cup of coffee i know you would want to look at the seal and somehow it seem safer if there be two sir ' ` peter ' i say ` you be a brick this be very thoughtful of you ' and i drink the coffee ` come along ' i tell he and hand he back the tray ` i be go to have a look at what the brute have be up to i simply have not the pluck to in the night ' ` i be very thankful sir ' he reply ` flesh and blood can do nothing sir against devil and that be what be in the gray room after dark ' i examine the seal on all the door as i go along and find they right but when i get to the gray room the seal be break though the card over the keyhole be untouched i rip it off and unlock the door and go in rather cautiously as you can imagine but the whole room be empty of anything to frighten one and there be heap of light i examine all my seal and not a single one be disturb the old butler have follow I in and suddenly he call out : -- ` the bedclothes sir ' i run up to the bed and look over and surely they be lie in the corner to the left of the bed jove you can imagine how queer i feel something _ have _ be in the room i stare for a while from the bed to the clothes on the floor i have a feeling that i do not want to touch either old peter though do not seem to be affect that way he go over to the bed covering and be go to pick they up as doubtless he have do every day these twenty year back but i stop he i want nothing touch until i have finish my examination this i must have spend a full hour over and then i let peter straighten up the bed after which we go out and i lock the door for the room be get on my nerve i have a short walk and then breakfast after which i feel more my own man and so return to the gray room and with peter 's help and one of the maid i have everything take out of the room except the bed -- even the very picture i examine the wall floor and ceiling then with probe hammer and magnifying glass but find nothing suspicious and i can assure you i begin to realize in very truth that some incredible thing have be loose in the room during the past night i seal up everything again and go out lock and seal the door as before after dinner peter and i unpacked some of my stuff and i fix up my camera and flashlight opposite to the door of the gray room with a string from the trigger of the flashlight to the door then you see if the door be really open the flashlight would blare out and there would be possibly a very queer picture to examine in the morning the last thing i do before leave be to uncap the lens and after that i go off to my bedroom and to bed for i intend to be up at midnight and to ensure this i set my little alarm to call I also i leave my candle burn the clock wake I at twelve and i get up and into my dress gown and slipper i shove my revolver into my right side-pocket and open my door then i light my darkroom lamp and withdraw the slide so that it would give a clear light i carry it up the corridor about thirty foot and put it down on the floor with the open side away from I so that it would show I anything that might approach along the dark passage then i go back and sit in the doorway of my room with my revolver handy stare up the passage toward the place where i know my camera stand outside the door of the gray room i should think i have watch for about a hour and a half when suddenly i hear a faint noise away up the corridor i be immediately conscious of a queer prickle sensation about the back of my head and my hand begin to sweat a little the follow instant the whole end of the passage flick into sight in the abrupt glare of the flashlight there come the succeed darkness and i peered nervously up the corridor listen tensely and try to find what lay beyond the faint glow of my dark-lamp which now seem ridiculously dim by contrast with the tremendous blaze of the flash-power and then as i stooped forward stare and listen there come the crash thud of the door of the gray room the sound seem to fill the whole of the large corridor and go echo hollowly through the house i tell you i feel horrible -- as if my bone be water simply beastly jove how i do stare and how i listen and then it come again -- thud thud thud and then a silence that be almost worse than the noise of the door for i keep fancy that some awful thing be steal upon I along the corridor and then suddenly my lamp be put out and i could not see a yard before I i realize all at once that i be do a very silly thing sit there and i jump up even as i do so i _ think _ i hear a sound in the passage and quite _ near _ I i make one backward spring into my room and slam and lock the door i sit on my bed and stare at the door i have my revolver in my hand but it seem a abominably useless thing i feel that there be something the other side of that door for some unknown reason i _ know _ it be press up against the door and it be soft that be just what i think most extraordinary thing to think presently i get hold of myself a bit and mark out a pentacle hurriedly with chalk on the polished floor and there i sit in it almost until dawn and all the time away up the corridor the door of the gray room thud at solemn and horrid interval it be a miserable brutal night when the day begin to break the thudding of the door come gradually to a end and at last i get hold of my courage and go along the corridor in the half light to cap the lens of my camera i can tell you it take some do but if i have not do so my photograph would have be spoil and i be tremendously keen to save it i get back to my room and then set-to and rub out the five-pointed star in which i have be sit half a hour later there be a tap at my door it be peter with my coffee when i have drunk it we both go along to the gray room as we go i have a look at the seal on the other door but they be untouched the seal on the door of the gray room be break as also be the string from the trigger of the flashlight but the card over the keyhole be still there i rip it off and open the door nothing unusual be to be see until we come to the bed then i see that as on the previous day the bedclothes have be tear off and hurl into the left-hand corner exactly where i have see they before i feel very queer but i do not forget to look at all the seal only to find that not one have be break then i turn and look at old peter and he look at I nod he head ` let 's get out of here ' i say ` it be no place for any live human to enter without proper protection ' we go out then and i lock and seal the door again after breakfast i develop the negative but it show only the door of the gray room half open then i leave the house as i want to get certain matter and implement that might be necessary to life perhaps to the spirit for i intend to spend the come night in the gray room i get back in a cab about half-past five with my apparatus and this peter and i carry up to the gray room where i pile it carefully in the center of the floor when everything be in the room include a cat which i have bring i lock and seal the door and go toward the bedroom tell peter i should not be down for dinner he say ` yes sir ' and go downstairs think that i be go to turn in which be what i want he to believe as i know he would have worry both I and himself if he have know what i intend but i merely get my camera and flashlight from my bedroom and hurry back to the gray room i lock and seal myself in and set to work for i have a lot to do before it get dark first i clear away all the ribbon across the floor then i carry the cat -- still fasten in its basket -- over toward the far wall and leave it i return then to the center of the room and measure out a space twenty-one foot in diameter which i sweep with a ` broom of hyssop ' about this i draw a circle of chalk take care never to step over the circle beyond this i smudge with a bunch of garlic a broad belt right around the chalk circle and when this be complete i take from among my store in the center a small jar of a certain water i break away the parchment and withdraw the stopper then dip my left forefinger in the little jar i go ` round the circle again make upon the floor just within the line of chalk the second sign of the saaamaaa ritual and join each sign most carefully with the left-handed crescent i can tell you i feel easier when this be do and the ` water circle ' complete then i unpacked some more of the stuff that i have bring and place a light candle in the ` valley ' of each crescent after that i draw a pentacle so that each of the five point of the defensive star touch the chalk circle in the five point of the star i place five portion of the bread each wrap in linen and in the five ` vale ' five open jar of the water i have use to make the ` water circle ' and now i have my first protective barrier complete now anyone except you who know something of my method of investigation might consider all this a piece of useless and foolish superstition but you all remember the black veil case in which i believe my life be save by a very similar form of protection whilst aster who sneer at it and would not come inside die i get the idea from the sigsand m write so far as i can make out in the 14th century at first naturally i imagine it be just a expression of the superstition of he time and it be not until a year later that it occur to I to test he ` defense ' which i do as i have just say in that horrible black veil business you know how _ that _ turn out later i use it several time and always i come through safe until that move fur case it be only a partial ` defense ' therefore and i nearly die in the pentacle after that i come across professor garder 's ` experiment with a medium ' when they surround the medium with a current in vacuum he lose he power -- almost as if it cut he off from the immaterial that make I think a lot and that be how i come to make the electric pentacle which be a most marvelous ` defense ' against certain manifestation i use the shape of the defensive star for this protection because i have personally no doubt at all but that there be some extraordinary virtue in the old magic figure curious thing for a twentieth century man to admit be it not but then as you all know i never do and never will allow myself to be blind by the little cheap laughter i ask question and keep my eye open in this last case i have little doubt that i have run up against a supernatural monster and i mean to take every possible care for the danger be abominable i turned-to now to fit the electric pentacle set it so that each of its ` point ' and ` vale ' coincide exactly with the ` point ' and ` vale ' of the draw pentagram upon the floor then i connect up the battery and the next instant the pale blue glare from the intertwine vacuum tube shine out i glance about I then with something of a sigh of relief and realize suddenly that the dusk be upon I for the window be gray and unfriendly then ` round at the big empty room over the double barrier of electric and candle light i have a abrupt extraordinary sense of weirdness thrust upon I -- in the air you know as it be a sense of something inhuman impend the room be full of the stench of bruised garlic a smell i hate i turn now to the camera and see that it and the flashlight be in order then i test my revolver carefully though i have little thought that it would be need yet to what extent materialization of a ab-natural creature be possible give favorable condition no one can say and i have no idea what horrible thing i be go to see or feel the presence of i might in the end have to fight with a materialize monster i do not know and could only be prepare you see i never forget that three other people have be strangle in the bed close to I and the fierce slamming of the door i have hear myself i have no doubt that i be investigate a dangerous and ugly case by this time the night have come though the room be very light with the burning candle and i find myself glance behind I constantly and then all ` round the room it be nervy work wait for that thing to come then suddenly i be aware of a little cold wind sweep over I come from behind i give one great nerve-thrill and a prickly feeling go all over the back of my head then i hove myself ` round with a sort of stiff jerk and stare straight against that queer wind it seem to come from the corner of the room to the left of the bed -- the place where both time i have find the heap of toss bedclothes yet i could see nothing unusual no opening -- nothing abruptly i be aware that the candle be all a-flicker in that unnatural wind i believe i just squat there and stare in a horribly frightened wooden way for some minute i shall never be able to let you know how disgustingly horrible it be sit in that vile cold wind and then flick flick flick all the candle ` round the outer barrier go out and there be i lock and seal in that room and with no light beyond the weakish blue glare of the electric pentacle a time of abominable tenseness pass and still that wind blow upon I and then suddenly i know that something stir in the corner to the left of the bed i be make conscious of it rather by some inward unused sense than by either sight or sound for the pale short-radius glare of the pentacle give but a very poor light for see by yet as i stare something begin slowly to grow upon my sight -- a move shadow a little darker than the surround shadow i lose the thing amid the vagueness and for a moment or two i glance swiftly from side to side with a fresh new sense of impend danger then my attention be direct to the bed all the cover 's be be draw steadily off with a hateful stealthy sort of motion i hear the slow drag slither of the clothes but i could see nothing of the thing that pull i be aware in a funny subconscious introspective fashion that the ` creep ' have come upon I yet that i be cooler mentally than i have be for some minute sufficiently so to feel that my hand be sweating coldly and to shift my revolver half-consciously whilst i rub my right hand dry upon my knee though never for a instant take my gaze or my attention from those move clothes the faint noise from the bed cease once and there be a most intense silence with only the sound of the blood beating in my head yet immediately afterward i hear again the slurring of the bedclothes be drag off the bed in the midst of my nervous tension i remember the camera and reach ` round for it but without look away from the bed and then you know all in a moment the whole of the bed covering be tear off with extraordinary violence and i hear the flump they make as they be hurl into the corner there be a time of absolute quietness then for perhaps a couple of minute and you can imagine how horrible i feel the bedclothes have be throw with such savageness and then again the brutal unnaturalness of the thing that have just be do before I abruptly over by the door i hear a faint noise -- a sort of crickling sound and then a pitter or two upon the floor a great nervous thrill sweep over I seem to run up my spine and over the back of my head for the seal that secure the door have just be break something be there i could not see the door at least i mean to say that it be impossible to say how much i actually see and how much my imagination supply i make it out only as a continuation of the gray wall and then it seem to I that something dark and indistinct move and waver there among the shadow abruptly i be aware that the door be open and with a effort i reach again for my camera but before i could aim it the door be slam with a terrific crash that fill the whole room with a sort of hollow thunder i jump like a frightened child there seem such a power behind the noise as though a vast wanton force be ` out ' can you understand the door be not touch again but directly afterward i hear the basket in which the cat lay creak i tell you i fairly pringled all along my back i know that i be go to learn definitely whether whatever be abroad be dangerous to life from the cat there rise suddenly a hideous caterwaul that cease abruptly and then -- too late -- i snap off the flashlight in the great glare i see that the basket have be overturn and the lid be wrench open with the cat lie half in and half out upon the floor i see nothing else but i be full of the knowledge that i be in the presence of some be or thing that have power to destroy during the next two or three minute there be a odd noticeable quietness in the room and you much remember i be half-blinded for the time because of the flashlight so that the whole place seem to be pitchy dark just beyond the shine of the pentacle i tell you it be most horrible i just kneel there in the star and whirl ` round try to see whether anything be come at I my power of sight come gradually and i get a little hold of myself and abruptly i see the thing i be look for close to the ` water circle ' it be big and indistinct and waver curiously as though the shadow of a vast spider hang suspend in the air just beyond the barrier it pass swiftly ` round the circle and seem to probe ever toward I but only to draw back with extraordinary jerky movement as might a live person if they touch the hot bar of a grate ` round and ` round it move and ` round and ` round i turn then just opposite to one of the vale ' in the pentacle it seem to pause as though preliminary to a tremendous effort it retire almost beyond the glow of the vacuum light and then come straight toward I appear to gather form and solidity as it come there seem a vast malign determination behind the movement that must succeed i be on my knee and i jerk back fall on to my left hand and hip in a wild endeavor to get back from the advance thing with my right hand i be grab madly for my revolver which i have let slip the brutal thing come with one great sweep straight over the garlic and the ` water circle ' almost to the vale of the pentacle i believe i yell then just as suddenly as it have sweep over it seem to be hurl back by some mighty invisible force it must have be some moment before i realize that i be safe and then i get myself together in the middle of the pentacle feel horribly go and shake and glance ` round and ` round the barrier but the thing have vanish yet i have learn something for i know now that the gray room be haunt by a monstrous hand suddenly as i crouch there i see what have so nearly give the monster a opening through the barrier in my movement within the pentacle i must have touch one of the jar of water for just where the thing have make its attack the jar that guard the ` deep ' of the ` vale ' have be move to one side and this have leave one of the ` five doorway ' unguarded i put it back quickly and feel almost safe again for i have find the cause and the ` defense ' be still good and i begin to hope again that i should see the morning come in when i see that thing so nearly succeed i have a awful weak overwhelming feeling that the ` barrier ' could never bring I safe through the night against such a force you can understand for a long time i could not see the hand but presently i think i see once or twice a odd wavering over among the shadow near the door a little later as though in a sudden fit of malignant rage the dead body of the cat be pick up and beat with dull sickening blow against the solid floor that make I feel rather queer a minute afterward the door be open and slam twice with tremendous force the next instant the thing make one swift vicious dart at I from out of the shadow instinctively i start sideways from it and so plucked my hand from upon the electric pentacle where -- for a wickedly careless moment -- i have place it the monster be hurl off from the neighborhood of the pentacle though -- owe to my inconceivable foolishness -- it have be enable for a second time to pass the outer barrier i can tell you i shake for a time with sheer funk i move right to the center of the pentacle again and kneel there make myself as small and compact as possible as i knelt there come to I presently a vague wonder at the two ` accident ' which have so nearly allow the brute to get at I be i be _ influence _ to unconscious voluntary action that endanger I the thought take hold of I and i watch my every movement abruptly i stretch a tired leg and knock over one of the jar of water some be spill but because of my suspicious watchfulness i have it upright and back within the vale while yet some of the water remain even as i do so the vast black half-materialized hand beat up at I out of the shadow and seem to leap almost into my face so nearly do it approach but for the third time it be throw back by some altogether enormous overmaster force yet apart from the dazed fright in which it leave I i have for a moment that feeling of spiritual sickness as if some delicate beautiful inward grace have suffer which be feel only upon the too near approach of the ab-human and be more dreadful in a strange way than any physical pain that can be suffer i know by this more of the extent and closeness of the danger and for a long time i be simply cow by the butt-headed brutality of that force upon my spirit i can put it no other way i knelt again in the center of the pentacle watch myself with more fear almost than the monster for i know now that unless i guard myself from every sudden impulse that come to I i might simply work my own destruction do you see how horrible it all be i spend the rest of the night in a haze of sick fright and so tense that i could not make a single movement naturally i be in such fear that any desire for action that come to I might be prompt by the influence that i know be at work on I and outside of the barrier that ghastly thing go ` round and ` round grabbing and grab in the air at I twice more be the body of the dead cat molest the second time i hear every bone in its body scrunch and crack and all the time the horrible wind be blow upon I from the corner of the room to the left of the bed then just as the first touch of dawn come into the sky that unnatural wind cease in a single moment and i could see no sign of the hand the dawn come slowly and presently the wan light fill all the room and make the pale glare of the electric pentacle look more unearthly yet it be not until the day have fully come that i make any attempt to leave the barrier for i do not know but that there be some method abroad in the sudden stop of that wind to entice I from the pentacle at last when the dawn be strong and bright i take one last look ` round and run for the door i get it unlock in a nervous and clumsy fashion then lock it hurriedly and go to my bedroom where i lay on the bed and try to steady my nerve peter come presently with the coffee and when i have drunk it i tell he i mean to have a sleep as i have be up all night he take the tray and go out quietly and after i have lock my door i turn in properly and at last get to sleep i wake about midday and after some lunch go up to the gray room i switch off the current from the pentacle which i have leave on in my hurry also i remove the body of the cat you can understand i do not want anyone to see the poor brute after that i make a very careful search of the corner where the bedclothes have be throw i make several hole and probe and find nothing then it occur to I to try with my instrument under the skirt i do so and hear my wire ring on metal i turn the hook end that way and fish for the thing at the second go i get it it be a small object and i take it to the window i find it to be a curious ring make of some greying material the curious thing about it be that it be make in the form of a pentagon that be the same shape as the inside of the magic pentacle but without the ` mount ' which form the point of the defensive star it be free from all chase or engrave you will understand that i be excite when i tell you that i feel sure i hold in my hand the famous luck ring of the anderson family which indeed be of all thing the one most intimately connect with the history of the haunting this ring be hand on from father to son through generation and always -- in obedience to some ancient family tradition -- each son have to promise never to wear the ring the ring i may say be bring home by one of the crusader under very peculiar circumstance but the story be too long to go into here it appear that young sir hulbert a ancestor of anderson 's make a bet in drink you know that he would wear the ring that night he do so and in the morning he wife and child be find strangle in the bed in the very room in which i stand many people it would seem thought young sir hulbert be guilty of have do the thing in drunken anger and he in a attempt to prove he innocence sleep a second night in the room he also be strangle since then as you may imagine no one have ever spend a night in the gray room until i do so the ring have be lose so long that it have become almost a myth and it be most extraordinary to stand there with the actual thing in my hand as you can understand it be whilst i stand there look at the ring that i get a idea suppose that it be in a way a doorway -- you see what i mean a sort of gap in the world-hedge it be a queer idea i know and probably be not my own but come to I from the outside you see the wind have come from that part of the room where the ring lay i think a lot about it then the shape -- the inside of a pentacle it have no ` mount ' and without mount as the sigsand m have it : -- ` thee mownts wych be thee five hill of safetie to lack be to gyve pow ' r to thee daemon and surelie to fayvor the evill thynge ' you see the very shape of the ring be significant and i determine to test it i unmade the pentacle for it must be make afresh _ and around _ the one to be protect then i go out and lock the door after which i leave the house to get certain matter for neither ` yarb nor fyre nor waier ' must be use a second time i return about seven thirty and as soon as the thing i have bring have be carry up to the gray room i dismiss peter for the night just as i have do the evening before when he have go downstairs i let myself into the room and lock and seal the door i go to the place in the center of the room where all the stuff have be pack and set to work with all my speed to construct a barrier about I and the ring i do not remember whether i explain it to you but i have reason that if the ring be in any way a ` medium of admission ' and it be enclose with I in the electric pentacle it would be to express it loosely insulate do you see the force which have visible expression as a hand would have to stay beyond the barrier which separate the ab from the normal for the ` gateway ' would be remove from accessibility as i be say i work with all my speed to get the barrier complete about I and the ring for it be already later than i care to be in that room ` unprotected ' also i have a feeling that there would be a vast effort make that night to regain the use of the ring for i have the strongest conviction that the ring be a necessity to materialization you will see whether i be right i complete the barrier in about a hour and you can imagine something of the relief i feel when i feel the pale glare of the electric pentacle once more all about I from then onward for about two hour i sit quietly face the corner from which the wind come about eleven o'clock a queer knowledge come that something be near to I yet nothing happen for a whole hour after that then suddenly i feel the cold queer wind begin to blow upon I to my astonishment it seem now to come from behind I and i whip ` round with a hideous quake of fear the wind meet I in the face it be blow up from the floor close to I i stare down in a sickening maze of new fright what on earth have i do now the ring be there close beside I where i have put it suddenly as i stare bewildered i be aware that there be something queer about the ring -- funny shadowy movement and convolution i look at they stupidly and then abruptly i know that the wind be blow up at I from the ring a queer indistinct smoke become visible to I seem to pour upward through the ring and mix with the move shadow suddenly i realize that i be in more than any mortal danger for the convoluting shadow about the ring be take shape and the death-hand be form _ within _ the pentacle my goodness do you realize it i have bring the ` gateway ' into the pentacle and the brute be come through -- pour into the material world as gas might pour out from the mouth of a pipe i should think that i knelt for a moment in a sort of stunned fright then with a mad awkward movement i snatch at the ring intend to hurl it out of the pentacle yet it elude I as though some invisible living thing jerk it hither and thither at last i grip it yet in the same instant it be tear from my grasp with incredible and brutal force a great black shadow cover it and rise into the air and come at I i see that it be the hand vast and nearly perfect in form i give one crazy yell and jump over the pentacle and the ring of burn candle and run despairingly for the door i fumble idiotically and ineffectually with the key and all the time i stare with a fear that be like insanity toward the barrier the hand be plunge toward I yet even as it have be unable to pass into the pentacle when the ring be without so now that the ring be within it have no power to pass out the monster be chained as surely as any beast would be be chain rivet upon it even then i get a flash of this knowledge but i be too utterly shake with fright to reason and the instant i manage to get the key turn i spring into the passage and slam the door with a crash i lock it and get to my room somehow for i be tremble so that i could hardly stand as you can imagine i lock myself in and manage to get the candle light then i lay down on my bed and keep quiet for a hour or two and so i get steady i get a little sleep later but wake when peter bring my coffee when i have drunk it i feel altogether better and take the old man along with I whilst i have a look into the gray room i open the door and peep in the candle be still burn wan against the daylight and behind they be the pale glowing star of the electric pentacle and there in the middle be the ring the gateway of the monster lie demure and ordinary nothing in the room be touch and i know that the brute have never manage to cross the pentacle then i go out and lock the door after a sleep of some hour i leave the house i return in the afternoon in a cab i have with I a oxy-hydrogen jet and two cylinder contain the gas i carry the thing into the gray room and there in the center of the electric pentacle i erect the little furnace five minute later the luck ring once the ` luck ' but now the ` bane ' of the anderson family be no more than a little solid splash of hot metal carnackus feel in he pocket and pull out something wrap in tissue paper he pass it to I i open it and find a small circle of greyish metal something like lead only harder and rather brighter well i ask at length after examine it and hand it ` round to the other do that stop the haunting carnackus nod yes he say i sleep three night in the gray room before i leave old peter nearly faint when he know that i mean to but by the third night he seem to realize that the house be just safe and ordinary and you know i believe in he heart he hardly approve carnackus stand up and begin to shake hand out you go he say genially and presently we go ponder to we various home no 2 -- the house among the laurel this be a curious yarn that i be go to tell you say carnackus as after a quiet little dinner we make ourselves comfortable in he cozy dining room i have just get back from the west of ireland he continue wentworth a friend of mine have lately have rather a unexpected legacy in the shape of a large estate and manor about a mile and a half outside of the village of korunton this place be name gannington manor and have be empty a great number of year as you will find be almost always the case with house repute to be haunt as it be usually term it seem that when wentworth go over to take possession he find the place in very poor repair and the estate totally uncared for and as i know look very desolate and lonesome generally he go through the big house by himself and he admit to I that it have a uncomfortable feeling about it but of course that might be nothing more than the natural dismalness of a big empty house which have be long uninhabited and through which you be wander alone when he have finish he look ` round he go down to the village mean to see the one-time agent of the estate and arrange for someone to go in as caretaker the agent who prove by the way to be a scotchman be very willing to take up the management of the estate once more but he assure wentworth that they would get no one to go in as caretaker and that he -- the agent 's -- advice be to have the house pull down and a new one build this naturally astonished my friend and as they go down to the village he manage to get a sort of explanation from the man it seem that there have be always curious story tell about the place which in the early day be call landru castle and that within the last seven year there have be two extraordinary death there in each case they have be tramp who be ignorant of the reputation of the house and have probably think the big empty place suitable for a night 's free lodging there have be absolutely no sign of violence to indicate the method by which death be cause and on each occasion the body have be find in the great entrance hall by this time they have reach the inn where wentworth have put up and he tell the agent that he would prove that it be all rubbish about the haunting by stay a night or two in the manor himself the death of the tramp be certainly curious but do not prove that any supernatural agency have be at work they be but isolate accident spread over a large number of year by the memory of the villager which be natural enough in a little place like korunton tramp have to die some time and in some place and it prove nothing that two out of possibly hundred who have sleep in the empty house have happen to take the opportunity to die under shelter but the agent take he remark very seriously and both he and denni the landlord of the inn try they best to persuade he not to go for he ` sowl 's sake ' irish denni beg he to do no such thing and because of he ` life 's sake ' the scotchman be equally in earnest it be late afternoon at the time and as wentworth tell I it be warm and bright and it seem such utter rot to hear those two talk seriously about the impossible he feel full of pluck and he make up he mind he would smash the story of the haunting at once by stay that very night in the manor he make this quite clear to they and tell they that it would be more to the point and to they credit if they offer to come up along with he and keep he company but poor old denni be quite shocked i believe at the suggestion and though tabbit the agent take it more quietly he be very solemn about it it seem that wentworth do go and though as he say to I when the evening begin to come on it seem a very different sort of thing to tackle a whole crowd of the villager assemble to see he off for by this time they all know of he intention wentworth have he gun with he and a big packet of candle and he make it clear to they all that it would not be wise for anyone to play any trick as he intend to shoot ` at sight ' and then you know he get a hint of how serious they consider the whole thing for one of they come up to he lead a great bullmastiff and offer it to he to take to keep he company wentworth pat he gun but the old man who own the dog shake he head and explain that the brute might warn he in sufficient time for he to get away from the castle for it be obvious that he do not consider the gun would prove of any use wentworth take the dog and thank the man he tell I that already he be begin to wish that he have not say definitely that he would go but as it be he be simply force to he go through the crowd of man and find suddenly that they have all turn in a body and be keep he company they stay with he all the way to the manor and then go right over the whole place with he it be still daylight when this be finish though turn to dusk and for a while the man stand about hesitate as if they feel ashamed to go away and leave wentworth there all alone he tell I that by this time he would gladly have give fifty pound to be go back with they and then abruptly a idea come to he he suggest that they should stay with he and keep he company through the night for a time they refuse and try to persuade he to go back with they but finally he make a proposition that get home to they all he plan that they should all go back to the inn and there get a couple of dozen bottle of whisky a donkey-load of turf and wood and some more candle then they would come back and make a great fire in the big fire-place light all the candle and put they ` round the place open the whisky and make a night of it and by jove he get they to agree they set off back and be soon at the inn and here whilst the donkey be be load and the candle and whisky distribute denni be do he best to keep wentworth from go back but he be a sensible man in he way for when he find that it be no use he stop you see he do not want to frighten the other from accompany wentworth ' i tell ye sorr ' he tell he '' ti of no use at all thryin ' ter reclaim ther castle ` tis curst with innocent blood a ' ye 'll be betther pullin ' it down a ' buildin ' a fine new wan but if ye be intendin ' to shtay this night kape the big dhoor open whide a ' watch for the bhlood-dhrip if so much as a single dhrip fall do not shtay though all the gold in the worrld be offer ye ' wentworth ask he what he mean by the blood-drip ` shure ' he say '' tis the bhlood av thim as ould black mick ` way back in the ould day kilt in they shlape 'twa a feud as he pretendid to patch up a ' he invite thim -- the o'haras they be -- siventy

grandfather ye have the sthory a ' sence thin ` tis death to any so they say to pass the night in the castle whin the bhlood-dhrip come ` twill put out candle a ' fire a ' thin in the darkness the virgin herself would be powerless to protect ye ' wentworth tell I he laugh at this chiefly because as he put it : -- ` one always must laugh at that sort of yarn however it make you feel inside ' he ask old denni whether he expect he to believe it ` yes sorr ' say denni ' i do mane ye to b ` lieve it a ' please god if ye 'll b ` lieve ye may be back safe befor ' mornin '' the man 's serious simplicity take hold of wentworth and he hold out he hand but for all that he go and i must admire he pluck there be now about forty man and when they get back to the manor -- or castle as the villager always call it -- they be not long in get a big fire go and light candle all ` round the great hall they have all bring stick so that they would have be a pretty formidable lot to tackle by anything simply physical and of course wentworth have he gun he keep the whisky in he own charge for he intend to keep they sober but he give they a good strong tot all ` round first so as to make thing seem cheerful and to get they yearning if you once let a crowd of man like that grow silent they begin to think and then to fancy thing the big entrance door have be leave wide open by he order which show that he have take some notice of dennis it be a quiet night so this do not matter for the light keep steady and all go on in a jolly sort of fashion for about three hour he have open a second lot of bottle and everyone be feel cheerful so much so that one of the man call out aloud to the ghost to come out and show themselves and then you know a very extraordinary thing happen for the ponderous main door swing quietly and steadily to as though push by a invisible hand and shut with a sharp click wentworth stare feeling suddenly rather chilly then he remember the man and look ` round at they several have cease they talk and be stare in a frightened way at the big door but the great number have never notice and be talk and yarn he reach for he gun and the follow instant the great bullmastiff set up a tremendous bark which draw the attention of the whole company the hall i should tell you be oblong the south wall be all window but the north and east have row of door lead into the house whilst the west wall be occupy by the great entrance the row of door lead into the house be all close and it be toward one of these in the north wall that the big dog run yet he would not go very close and suddenly the door begin to move slowly open until the blackness of the passage beyond be show the dog come back among the man whimper and for a minute there be a absolute silence then wentworth go out from the man a little and aim he gun at the doorway ` whoever be there come out or i shall fire ' he shout but nothing come and he blaze forth both barrel into the dark as though the report have be a signal all the door along the north and east wall move slowly open and wentworth and he man be stare frightened into the black shape of the empty doorway wentworth load he gun quickly and call to the dog but the brute be burrow away in among the man and this fear on the dog 's part frighten wentworth more he tell I than anything then something else happen three of the candle over in the corner of the hall go out and immediately about half a dozen in different part of the place more candle be put out and the hall have become quite dark in the corner the man be all stand now hold they club and crowd together and no one say a word wentworth tell I he feel positively ill with fright i know the feeling then suddenly something splash on to the back of he left hand he lift it and look it be cover with a great splash of red that drip from he finger a old irishman near to he see it and croak out in a quavering voice : -- ` the bhlood-dhrip ' when the old man call out they all look and in the same instant other feel it upon they there be frighten cry of : -- ` the bhlood-dhrip the bhlood-dhrip ' and then about a dozen candle go out simultaneously and the hall be suddenly dark the dog let out a great mournful howl and there be a horrible little silence with everyone standing rigid then the tension break and there be a mad rush for the main door they wrench it open and tumble out into the dark but something slam it with a crash after they and shut the dog in for wentworth hear it howl as they race down the drive yet no one have the pluck to go back to let it out which do not surprise I wentworth send for I the follow day he have hear of I in connection with that steeple monster case i arrive by the night mail and put up with wentworth at the inn the next day we go up to the old manor which certainly lie in rather a wilderness though what strike I most be the extraordinary number of laurel bush about the house the place be smother with they so that the house seem to be grow up out of a sea of green laurel these and the grim ancient look of the old building make the place look a bit dank and ghostly even by daylight the hall be a big place and well light by daylight for which i be not sorry you see i have be rather wound-up by wentworth 's yarn we find one rather funny thing and that be the great bullmastiff lie stiff with its neck break this make I feel very serious for it show that whether the cause be supernatural or not there be present in the house some force exceedingly dangerous to life later whilst wentworth stand guard with he shotgun i make a examination of the hall the bottle and mug from which the man have drunk they whisky be scatter about and all over the place be the candle stick upright in they own grease but in the somewhat brief and general search i find nothing and decide to begin my usual exact examination of every square foot of the place -- not only of the hall in this case but of the whole interior of the castle i spend three uncomfortable week search but without result of any kind and you know the care i take at this period be extreme for i have solve hundred of case of so-called ` haunting ' at this early stage simply by the most minute investigation and the keep of a perfectly open mind but as i have say i find nothing during the whole of the examination i get wentworth to stand guard with he loaded shotgun and i be very particular that we be never catch there after dusk i decide now to make the experiment of stay a night in the great hall of course ` protect ' i speak about it to wentworth but he own attempt have make he so nervous that he beg I to do no such thing however i think it well worth the risk and i manage in the end to persuade he to be present with this in view i go to the neighboring town of gaunt and by a arrangement with the chief constable i obtain the service of six policeman with they rifle the arrangement be unofficial of course and the man be allow to volunteer with a promise of payment when the constable arrive early that evening at the inn i give they a good feed and after that we all set out for the manor we have four donkey with we load with fuel and other matter also two great boarhound which one of the police lead when we reach the house i set the man to unload the donkey whilst wentworth and i set-to and seal all the door except the main entrance with tape and wax for if the door be really open i be go to be sure of the fact i be go to run no risk of be deceive by ghostly hallucination or mesmeric influence by the time that this be do the policeman have unloaded the donkey and be wait look about they curiously i set two of they to lay a fire in the big grate and the other i use as i require they i take one of the boarhound to the end of the hall furthest from the entrance and there i drive a staple into the floor to which i tie the dog with a short tether then ` round he i draw upon the floor the figure of a pentacle in chalk outside of the pentacle i make a circle with garlic i do exactly the same thing with the other hound but over more in the northeast corner of the big hall where the two row of door make the angle when this be do i clear the whole center of the hall and put one of the policeman to sweep it after which i have all my apparatus carry into the clear space then i go over to the main door and hook it open so that the hook would have to be lift out of the hasp before the door could be close after that i place light candle before each of the seal door and one in each corner of the big room and then i light the fire when i see that it be properly alight i get all the man together by the pile of thing in the center of the room and take they pipe from they for as the sigsand m have it : -- ` theyre must noe lyght come from wythin the barryier ' and i be go to make sure i get my tape measure then and measure out a circle thirty-three foot in diameter and immediately chalk it out the police and wentworth be tremendously interested and i take the opportunity to warn they that this be no piece of silly mumming on my part but do with a definite intention of erect a barrier between we and any ab-human thing that the night might show to we i warn they that as they value they life and more than they life it might be no one must on any account whatsoever pass beyond the limit of the barrier that i be make after i have draw the circle i take a bunch of the garlic and smudge it right ` round the chalk circle a little outside of it when this be complete i call for candle from my stock of material i set the police to light they and as they be light i take they and seal they down on the floor just within the chalk circle five inch apart as each candle measure approximately one inch in diameter it take sixty-six candle to complete the circle and i need hardly say that every number and measurement have a significance then from candle to candle i take a ` gayrd ' of human hair entwine it alternately to the left and to the right until the circle be complete and the end of the hair shod with silver and press into the wax of the sixty-sixth candle it have now be dark some time and i make haste to get the ` defense ' complete to this end i get the man well together and begin to fit the electric pentacle right around we so that the five point of the defensive star come just within the hair circle this do not take I long and a minute later i have connect up the battery and the weak blue glare of the intertwine vacuum tube shine all around we i feel happier then for this pentacle be as you all know a wonderful ` defense ' i have tell you before how the idea come to I after read professor garder 's ` experiment with a medium ' he find that a current of a certain number of vibration _ in vacuo _ ` insulate ' the medium it be difficult to suggest a explanation non-technically and if you be really interested you should read carder 's lecture on ` astral vibration compare with matero-involuted vibration below the six-billion limit ' as i stand up from my work i could hear outside in the night a constant drip from the laurel which as i have say come right up around the house very thick by the sound i know that a ` soft ' rain have set in and there be absolutely no wind as i could tell by the steady flame of the candle i stand a moment or two listen and then one of the man touch my arm and ask I in a low voice what they should do by he tone i could tell that he be feel something of the strangeness of it all and the other man include wentworth be so quiet that i be afraid they be begin to get shaky i set-to then and arrange they with they back to one common center so that they be sit flat upon the floor with they foot radiate outward then by compass i lay they leg to the eight chief point and afterward i draw a circle with chalk around they and opposite to they foot i make the eight sign of the saaamaaa ritual the eighth place be of course empty but ready for I to occupy at any moment for i have omit to make the seal sign to that point until i have finish all my preparation and could enter the inner star i take a last look ` round the great hall and see that the two big hound be lie quietly with they nose between they paw the fire be big and cheerful and the candle before the two row of door burnt steadily as well as the solitary one in the corner then i go ` round the little star of man and warn they not to be frightened whatever happen but to trust to the ` defense ' and to let nothing tempt or drive they to cross the barrier also i tell they to watch they movement and to keep they foot strictly to they place for the rest there be to be no shooting unless i give the word and now at last i go to my place and sit down make the eighth sign just beyond my foot then i arrange my camera and flashlight handy and examine my revolver wentworth sit behind the first sign and as the numbering go ` round reverse that put he next to I on my left i ask he in a low voice how he feel and he tell I rather nervous but that he feel confidence in my knowledge and be resolve to go through with the matter whatever happen we settle down to wait there be no talk except that once or twice the police bent toward one another and whisper odd remark concern the hall that appear queerly audible in the intense silence but in a while there be not even a whisper from anyone and only the monotonous drip drip of the quiet rain without the great entrance and the low dull sound of the fire in the big fireplace it be a queer group that we make sit there back to back with we leg star outward and all around we the strange blue glow of the pentacle and beyond that the brilliant shine of the great ring of light candle outside of the glare of the candle the large empty hall look a little gloomy by contrast except where the light shine before the seal door and the blaze of the big fire make a good honest mass of flame and the feeling of mystery can you picture it all it might have be a hour later that it come to I suddenly that i be aware of a extraordinary sense of dreeness as it be come into the air of the place not the nervous feeling of mystery that have be with we all the time but a new feeling as if there be something go to happen any moment abruptly there come a slight noise from the east end of the hall and i feel the star of man move suddenly ` steady keep steady ' i shout and they quieten i look up the hall and see that the dog be upon they foot and stare in a extraordinary fashion toward the great entrance i turn and stare also and feel the man move as they crane they head to look suddenly the dog set up a tremendous bark and i glance across to they and find they be still ` point ' for the big doorway they cease they noise just as quickly and seem to be listen in the same instant i hear a faint chink of metal to my left that set I stare at the hook which hold the great door wide it move even as i look some invisible thing be meddle with it a queer sickening thrill go through I and i feel all the man about I stiffen and go rigid with intensity i have a certainty of something impending : as it might be the impression of a invisible but overwhelming presence the hall be full of a queer silence and not a sound come from the dog _ then i see the hook slowly raise from out of its hasp without any visible thing touch it _ then a sudden power of movement come to I i raise my camera with the flashlight fix and snap it at the door there come the great blare of the flashlight and a simultaneous roar of bark from the two dog the intensity of the flash make all the place seem dark for some moment and in that time of darkness i hear a jingle in the direction of the door and strain to look the effect of the bright light pass and i could see clearly again the great entrance door be be slowly close it shut with a sharp snick and there follow a long silence break only by the whimpering of the dog i turn suddenly and look at wentworth he be look at I ` just as it do before ' he whisper ` most extraordinary ' i say and he nod and look ` round nervously the policeman be pretty quiet and i judge that they be feel rather worse than wentworth though for that matter you must not think that i be altogether natural yet i have see so much that be extraordinary that i daresay i can keep my nerve steady longer than most people i look over my shoulder at the man and caution they in a low voice not to move outside of the barrier _ whatever happen _ not even though the house should seem to be rock and about to tumble on to they for well i know what some of the great force be capable of do yet unless it should prove to be one of the case of the more terrible saiitius manifestation we be almost certain of safety so long as we keep to we order within the pentacle perhaps a hour and a half pass quietly except when once in a way the dog would whine distressfully presently however they cease even from this and i could see they lie on the floor with they paw over they nose in a most peculiar fashion and shiver visibly the sight make I feel more serious as you can understand suddenly the candle in the corner furthest from the main door go out a instant later wentworth jerk my arm and i see that the candle before one of the seal door have be put out i hold my camera ready then one after another every candle about the hall be put out and with such speed and irregularity that i could never catch one in the actual act of be extinguish yet for all that i take a flashlight of the hall in general there be a time in which i sit half-blinded by the great glare of the flash and i blame myself for not have remember to bring a pair of smoked goggles which i have sometimes use at these time i have feel the man jump at the sudden light and i call out loud to they to sit quiet and to keep they foot exactly to they proper place my voice as you can imagine sound rather horrid and frightening in the great room and altogether it be a beastly moment then i be able to see again and i stare here and there about the hall but there be nothing show unusual only of course it be dark now over in the corner suddenly i see that the great fire be blacken it be go out visibly as i look if i say that some monstrous invisible impossible creature suck the life from it i could best explain the way the light and flame go out of it it be most extraordinary to watch in the time that i watch it every vestige of fire be go from it and there be no light outside of the ring of candle around the pentacle the deliberateness of the thing trouble I more than i can make clear to you it convey to I such a sense of a calm deliberate force present in the hall : the steadfast intention to ` make a darkness ' be horrible the _ extent _ of the power to affect the material be horrible the extent of the power to affect the material be now the one constant anxious question in my brain you can understand behind I i hear the policeman move again and i know that they be get thoroughly frightened i turn half ` round and tell they quietly but plainly that they be safe only so long as they stay within the pentacle in the position in which i have put they if they once break and go outside of the barrier no knowledge of mine could state the full extent of the dreadfulness of the danger i steady they up by this quiet straight reminder but if they have know as i know that there be no certainty in any ` protection ' they would have suffer a great deal more and probably have break the ` defense ' and make a mad foolish run for a impossible safety another hour pass after this in a absolute quietness i have a sense of awful strain and oppression as though i be a little spirit in the company of some invisible brooding monster of the unseen world who as yet be scarcely conscious of we i lean across to wentworth and ask he in a whisper whether he have a feeling as if something be in the room he look very pale and he eye keep always on the move he glance just once at I and nod then stare away ` round the hall again and when i come to think i be do the same thing abruptly as though a hundred unseen hand have snuff they every candle in the barrier go dead out and we be leave in a darkness that seem for a little absolute for the light from the pentacle be too weak and pale to penetrate far across the great hall i tell you for a moment i just sit there as though i have be freeze solid i feel the ` creep ' go all over I and seem to stop in my brain i feel all at once to be give a power of hearing that be far beyond the normal i could hear my own heart thud most extraordinarily loud i begin however to feel better after a while but i simply have not the pluck to move you can understand presently i begin to get my courage back i grip at my camera and flashlight and wait my hand be simply soak with sweat i glance once at wentworth i could see he only dimly he shoulder be hunch a little he head forward but though it be motionless i know that he eye be not it be queer how one know that sort of thing at time the police be just as silent and thus a while pass a sudden sound break across the silence from two side of the room there come faint noise i recognize they at once as the breaking of the sealing-wax _ the seal door be open _ i raise the camera and flashlight and it be a peculiar mixture of fear and courage that help I to press the button as the great flare of light light up the hall i feel the man all about I jump the darkness fall like a clap of thunder if you can understand and seem tenfold yet in the moment of brightness i have see that all the seal door be wide open suddenly all around we there sound a drip drip drip upon the floor of the great hall i thrill with a queer realize emotion and a sense of a very real and present danger -- _ imminent _ the ` blood-drip ' have commence and the grim question be now whether the barrier could save we from whatever have come into the huge room through some awful minute the ` blood-drip ' continue to fall in a increasing rain and presently some begin to fall within the barrier i see several great drop splash and star upon the pale glowing intertwine tube of the electric pentacle but strangely enough i could not trace that any fall among we beyond the strange horrible noise of the ` drip ' there be no other sound and then abruptly from the boarhound over in the far corner there come a terrible yell howl of agony follow instantly by a sickening breaking noise and a immediate silence if you have ever when out shooting break a rabbit 's neck you will know the sound -- in miniature like lightning the thought spring into my brain : -- _ it have cross the pentacle _ for you will remember that i have make one about each of the dog i think instantly with a sick apprehension of we own barrier there be something in the hall with we that have pass the barrier of the pentacle about one of the dog in the awful succeed silence i positively quiver and suddenly one of the man behind I give out a scream like any woman and bolt for the door he fumble and have it open in a moment i yell to the other not to move but they follow like sheep and i hear they kick the candle fly in they panic one of they step on the electric pentacle and smash it and there be a utter darkness in a instant i realize that i be defenseless against the power of the unknown world and with one savage leap i be out of the useless barrier and instantly through the great doorway and into the night i believe i yell with sheer funk the man be a little ahead of I and i never cease run and neither do they sometimes i glance back over my shoulder and i keep glance into the laurel which grow all along the drive the beastly thing keep rustling rustling in a hollow sort of way as though something be keep parallel with I among they the rain have stop and a dismal little wind keep moan through the grounds it be disgusting i catch wentworth and the police at the lodge gate we get outside and run all the way to the village we find old denni up wait for we and half the villager to keep he company he tell we that he have know in he ` sowl ' that we should come back that be if we come back at all which be not a bad rendering of he remark fortunately i have bring my camera away from the house -- possibly because the strap have happen to be over my head yet i do not go straight away to develop but sit with the rest of the bar where we talk for some hour try to be coherent about the whole horrible business later however i go up to my room and proceed with my photography i be steadier now and it be just possible so i hope that the negative might show something on two of the plate i find nothing unusual : but on the third which be the first one that i snap i see something that make I quite excited i examine it very carefully with a magnifying glass then i put it to wash and slip a pair of rubber overshoe over my boot the negative have show I something very extraordinary and i have make up my mind to test the truth of what it seem to indicate without lose another moment it be no use tell anything to wentworth and the police until i be certain and also i believe that i stand a greater chance to succeed by myself though for that matter i do not suppose anything would have take they up to the manor again that night i take my revolver and go quietly downstairs and into the dark the rain have commence again but that do not bother I i walk hard when i come to the lodge gate a sudden queer instinct stop I from go through and i climb the wall into the park i keep away from the drive and approach the building through the dismal drip laurel you can imagine how beastly it be every time a leaf rustle i jump i make my way ` round to the back of the big house and get in through a little window which i have take note of during my search for of course i know the whole place from roof to cellar i go silently up the kitchen stair fairly quiver with funk and at the top i go to the left and then into a long corridor that open through one of the doorway we have seal into the big hall i look up it and see a faint flicker of light away at the end and i tiptoe silently toward it hold my revolver ready as i come near to the open door i hear man 's voice and then a burst of laugh i go on until i could see into the hall there be several man there all in a group they be well dress and one at least i saw be arm they be examine my ` barrier ' against the supernatural with a good deal of unkind laughter i never feel such a fool in my life it be plain to I that they be a gang of man who have make use of the empty manor perhaps for year for some purpose of they own and now that wentworth be attempt to take possession they be act up the tradition of the place with the view of drive he away and keep so useful a place still at they disposal but what they be i mean whether coiner thief inventor or what i could not imagine presently they leave the pentacle and gather ` round the living boarhound which seem curiously quiet as though it be half-drugged there be some talk as to whether to let the poor brute live or not but finally they decide it would be good policy to kill it i see two of they force a twisted loop of rope into its mouth and the two bight of the loop be bring together at the back of the hound 's neck then a third man thrust a thick walking-stick through the two loop the two man with the rope stoop to hold the dog so that i could not see what be do but the poor beast give a sudden awful howl and immediately there be a repetition of the uncomfortable breaking sound i have hear earlier in the night as you will remember the man stand up and leave the dog lie there quiet enough now as you may suppose for my part i fully appreciate the calculate remorselessness which have decide upon the animal 's death and the cold determination with which it have be afterward execute so neatly i guess that a man who might get into the ` light ' of those particular man would be likely to come to quite as uncomfortable a end a minute later one of the man call out to the rest that they should ` shift the wire ' one of the man come toward the doorway of the corridor in which i stand and i run quickly back into the darkness of the upper end i see the man reach up and take something from the top of the door and i hear the slight ringing jangle of steel wire when he have go i run back again and see the man pass one after another through a opening in the stair form by one of the marble step be raise when the last man have vanish the slab that make the step be shut down and there be not a sign of the secret door it be the seventh step from the bottom as i take care to count : and a splendid idea for it be so solid that it do not ring hollow even to a fairly heavy hammer as i find later there be little more to tell i get out of the house as quickly and quietly as possible and back to the inn the police come without any coax when they know the ` ghost ' be normal flesh and blood we enter the park and the manor in the same way that i have do yet when we try to open the step we fail and have finally to smash it this must have warn the haunter for when we descend to a secret room which we find at the end of a long and narrow passage in the thickness of the wall we find no one the police be horribly disgusted as you can imagine but for my part i do not care either way i have ` lay the ghost ' as you might say and that be what i set out to do i be not particularly afraid of be laugh at by the other for they have all be thoroughly ` take in ' and in the end i have score without they help we search right through the secret way and find that there be a exit at the end of a long tunnel which open in the side of a well out in the grounds the ceiling of the hall be hollow and reach by a little secret stairway inside of the big staircase the ` blood-drip ' be merely color water drop through the minute crevice of the ornamented ceiling how the candle and the fire be put out i do not know for the haunter certainly do not act quite up to tradition which hold that the light be put out by the ` blood-drip ' perhaps it be too difficult to direct the fluid without positively squirt it which might have give the whole thing away the candle and the fire may possibly have be extinguish by the agency of carbonic acid gas but how suspend i have no idea the secret hiding pace be of course ancient there be also do i tell you a bell which they have rig up to ring when anyone enter the gate at the end of the drive if i have not climb the wall i should have find nothing for my pain for the bell would have warn they have i go in through the gateway what be on the negative i ask with much curiosity a picture of the fine wire with which they be grapple for the hook that hold the entrance door open they be do it from one of the crevice in the ceiling they have evidently make no preparation for lift the hook i suppose they never think that anyone would make use of it and so they have to improvise a grapple the wire be too fine to be see by the amount of light we have in the hall but the flashlight ` pick it out ' do you see the opening of the inner door be manage by wire as you will have guess which they unshipp after use or else i should soon have find they when i make my search i think i have now explain everything the hound be kill of course by the man direct you see they make the place as dark as possible first of course if i have manage to take a flashlight just at that instant the whole secret of the haunting would have be expose but fate just order it the other way and the tramp i ask oh you mean the two tramp who be find dead in the manor say carnacki well of course it be impossible to be sure one way or the other perhaps they happen to find out something and be give a hypodermic or it be just as probable that they have come to the time of they die and just die naturally it be conceivable that a great many tramp have sleep in the old house at one time or another carnackus stand up and knock out he pipe we rise also and go for we coat and hat out you go say carnackus genially use the recognize formulum and we go out on to the embankment and presently through the darkness to we various home no 3 -- the whistle room carnackus shake a friendly fist at I as i enter late then he open the door into the dining room and usher the four of we -- jessop arkright taylor and myself -- in to dinner we dine well as usual and equally as usual carnackus be pretty silent during the meal at the end we take we wine and cigar to we usual position and carnackus -- have get himself comfortable in he big chair -- begin without any preliminary : -- i have just get back from ireland again he say and i think you chap would be interested to hear my news besides i fancy i shall see the thing clearer after i have tell it all out straight i must tell you this though at the beginning -- up to the present moment i have be utterly and completely ` stump ' i have tumble upon one of the most peculiar case of ` haunt ' -- or devilment of some sort -- that i have come against now listen i have be spend the last few week at iastrae castle about twenty mile northeast of galway i get a letter about a month ago from a mr sid k tassoc who it seem have buy the place lately and move in only to find that he have buy a very peculiar piece of property when i get there he meet I at the station drive a jaunt car and drive I up to the castle which by the way he call a ` house shanty ' i find that he be ` pig it ' there with he boy brother and another american who seem to be half-servant and half-companion it seem that all the servant have leave the place in a body as you might say and now they be manage among themselves assist by some day-help the three of they get together a scratch feed and tassoc tell I all about the trouble whilst we be at table it be most extraordinary and different from anything that i have have to do with though that buzz case be very queer too tassoc begin right in the middle of he story ` we have get a room in this shanty ' he say ` which have get a most infernal whistle in it sort of haunt it the thing start any time you never know when and it go on until it frighten you all the servant have go as you know it be not ordinary whistle and it be not the wind wait till you hear it ' ` we be all carry gun ' say the boy and slap he coat pocket ` as bad as that ' i say and the older boy nod ` it may be soft ' he reply ` but wait till you have hear it sometimes i think it be some infernal thing and the next moment i be just as sure that someone 's play a trick on I ' ` why ' i ask ` what be to be gain ' ` you mean ' he say ` that people usually have some good reason for play trick as elaborate as this well i 'll tell you there be a lady in this province by the name of miss donnehue who be go to be my wife this day two month she be more beautiful than they make they and so far as i can see i have just stick my head into a irish hornet 's nest there be about a score of hot young irishman be court she these two year go and now that i be come along and cut they out they feel raw against I do you begin to understand the possibility ' ` yes ' i say ` perhaps i do in a vague sort of way but i do not see how all this affect the room ' ` like this ' he say ` when i would fix it up with miss donnehue i look out for a place and buy this little house shanty afterward i tell she -- one evening during dinner that i would decide to tie up here and then she ask I whether i be not afraid of the whistle room i tell she it must have be throw in grati as i would hear nothing about it there be some of she man friend present and i see a smile go ` round i find out after a bit of question that several people have buy this place during the last twenty-odd year and it be always on the market again after a trial ` well the chap start to bait I a bit and offer to take bet after dinner that i would not stay six month in the place i look once or twice to miss donnehue so as to be sure i be get the note of the talkee-talkee but i could see that she do not take it as a joke at all partly i think because there be a bit of a sneer in the way the man be tackle I and partly because she really believe there be something in this yarn of the whistle room ` however after dinner i do what i could to even thing up with the other i nail all they bet and screw they down hard and safe i guess some of they be go to be hard hit unless i lose which i do not mean to well there you have practically the whole yarn ' ` not quite ' i tell he ` all that i know be that you have buy a castle with a room in it that be in some way queer and that you have be do some bet also i know that you servant have get frightened and run away tell I something about the whistle ' ` oh that ' say tassoc ` that start the second night we be in i would have a good look ` round the room in the daytime as you can understand for the talk up at arlestra -- miss donnehue 's place -- have make I wonder a bit but it seem just as usual as some of the other room in the old wing only perhaps a bit more lonesome but that may be only because of the talk about it you know ` the whistle start about ten o'clock on the second night as i say tom and i be in the library when we hear a awfully queer whistle come along the east corridor -- the room be in the east wing you know ` that be that bless ghost ' i say to tom and we collar the lamp off the table and go up to have a look i tell you even as we dig along the corridor it take I a bit in the throat it be so beastly queer it be a sort of tune in a way but more as if a devil or some rotten thing be laugh at you and go to get ` round at you back that be how it make you feel ` when we get to the door we do not wait but rush it open and then i tell you the sound of the thing fairly hit I in the face tom say he get it the same way -- sort of feel stunned and bewildered we look all ` round and soon get so nervous we just clear out and i lock the door ` we come down here and have a stiff peg each then we get fit again and begin to think we would be nicely have so we take stick and go out into the grounds think after all it must be some of these confound irishman work the ghost-trick on we but there be not a leg stir ` we go back into the house and walk over it and then pay another visit to the room but we simply could not stand it we fairly run out and lock the door again i do not know how to put it into word but i have a feeling of be up against something that be rottenly dangerous you know we have carry we gun ever since ` of course we have a real turn out of the room next day and the whole house place and we even hunt ` round the grounds but there be nothing queer and now i do not know what to think except that the sensible part of I tell I that it be some plan of these wild irishman to try to take a rise out of I ' ` do anything since ' i ask he ` yes ' he say -- ` watch outside of the door of the room at night and chase ` round the grounds and sound the wall and floor of the room we have do everything we could think of and it be begin to get on we nerve so we send for you ' by this we have finish eat as we rise from the table tassoc suddenly call out : -- ` ssh hark ' we be instantly silent listen then i hear it a extraordinary hooning whistle monstrous and inhuman come from far away through corridor to my right ` by g -- d' say tassoc ` and it be scarcely dark yet collar those candle both of you and come along ' in a few moment we be all out of the door and race up the stair tassoc turn into a long corridor and we follow shield we candle as we run the sound seem to fill all the passage as we draw near until i have the feeling that the whole air throb under the power of some wanton immense force -- a sense of a actual taint as you might say of monstrosity all about we tassoc unlock the door then give it a push with he foot jump back and draw he revolver as the door fly open the sound beat out at we with a effect impossible to explain to one who have not hear it -- with a certain horrible personal note in it as if in there in the darkness you could picture the room rock and creak in a mad vile glee to its own filthy piping and whistle and hoon to stand there and listen be to be stun by realization it be as if someone show you the mouth of a vast pit suddenly and say : -- that be hell and you know that they have speak the truth do you get it even a little bit i step back a pace into the room and hold the candle over my head and look quickly ` round tassoc and he brother join I and the man come up at the back and we all hold we candle high i be deafen with the shrill piping hoon of the whistle and then clear in my ear something seem to be say to I : -- ` get out of here -- quick quick quick ' as you chap know i never neglect that sort of thing sometimes it may be nothing but nerve but as you will remember it be just such a warning that save I in the ` gray dog ' case and in the ` yellow finger ' experiment as well as other time well i turn sharp ` round to the other : ` out ' i say ` for god 's sake _ out _ quick ' and in a instant i have they into the passage there come a extraordinary yell scream into the hideous whistling and then like a clap of thunder a utter silence i slam the door and lock it then take the key i look ` round at the other they be pretty white and i imagine i must have look that way too and there we stand a moment silent ` come down out of this and have some whisky ' say tassoc at last in a voice he try to make ordinary and he lead the way i be the back man and i know we all keep look over we shoulder when we get downstairs tassoc pass the bottle ` round he take a drink himself and slap he glass down on to the table then sit down with a thud ` that be a lovely thing to have in the house with you be not it ' he say and directly afterward : -- ` what on earth make you hustle we all out like that carnackus ' ` something seem to be tell I to get out quick ' i say ` sound a bit silly superstitious i know but when you be meddle with this sort of thing you have get to take notice of queer fancy and risk be laugh at ' i tell he then about the ` gray dog ' business and he nod a lot to that ` of course ' i say ` this may be nothing more than those would-be rival of yours play some funny game but personally though i be go to keep a open mind i feel that there be something beastly and dangerous about this thing ' we talk for a while longer and then tassoc suggest billiards which we play in a pretty half-hearted fashion and all the time cock a ear to the door as you might say for sound but none come and later after coffee he suggest early bed and a thorough overhaul of the room on the morrow my bedroom be in the newer part of the castle and the door open into the picture gallery at the east end of the gallery be the entrance to the corridor of the east wing this be shut off from the gallery by two old and heavy oak door which look rather odd and quaint beside the more modern door of the various room when i reach my room i do not go to bed but begin to unpack my instrument trunk of which i have retain the key i intend to take one or two preliminary step at once in my investigation of the extraordinary whistle presently when the castle have settle into quietness i slip out of my room and across to the entrance of the great corridor i open one of the low squat door and throw the beam of my pocket searchlight down the passage it be empty and i go through the doorway and pushed-to the oak behind I then along the great passageway throw my light before and behind and keep my revolver handy i have hang a ` protection belt ' of garlic ` round my neck and the smell of it seem to fill the corridor and give I assurance for as you all know it be a wonderful ` protection ' against the more usual aeiirius form of semi-materialization by which i suppose the whistle might be produce though at that period of my investigation i be quite prepared to find it due to some perfectly natural cause for it be astonishing the enormous number of case that prove to have nothing abnormal in they in addition to wear the necklet i have plug my ear loosely with garlic and as i do not intend to stay more than a few minute in the room i hope to be safe when i reach the door and put my hand into my pocket for the key i have a sudden feeling of sickening funk but i be not go to back out if i could help it i unlock the door and turn the handle then i give the door a sharp push with my foot as tassoc have do and draw my revolver though i do not expect to have any use for it really i shone the searchlight all ` round the room and then step inside with a disgustingly horrible feeling of walk slap into a wait danger i stand a few seconds wait and nothing happen and the empty room show bare from corner to corner and then you know i realize that the room be full of a abominable silence can you understand that a sort of purposeful silence just as sickening as any of the filthy noise the thing have power to make do you remember what i tell you about that ` silent garden ' business well this room have just that same _ malevolent _ silence -- the beastly quietness of a thing that be look at you and not seeable itself and think that it have get you oh i recognize it instantly and i whip the top off my lantern so as to have light over the _ whole _ room then i set-to work like fury and keep my glance all about I i seal the two window with length of human hair right across and seal they at every frame as i work a queer scarcely perceptible tenseness steal into the air of the place and the silence seem if you can understand I to grow more solid i know then that i have no business there without ` full protection ' for i be practically certain that this be no mere aeiirius development but one of the worst form as the saiitius like that ` grunt man ' case -- you know i finish the window and hurry over to the great fireplace this be a huge affair and have a queer gallows-iron i think they be call project from the back of the arch i seal the opening with seven human hair -- the seventh cross the six other then just as i be make a end a low mocking whistle grow in the room a cold nervous prick go up my spine and ` round my forehead from the back the hideous sound fill all the room with a extraordinary grotesque parody of human whistle too gigantic to be human -- as if something gargantuan and monstrous make the sound softly as i stand there a last moment press down the final seal i have no doubt but that i have come across one of those rare and horrible case of the _ inanimate _ reproduce the function of the _ animate _ i make a grab for my lamp and go quickly to the door look over my shoulder and listen for the thing that i expect it come just as i get my hand upon the handle -- a squeal of incredible malevolent anger pierce through the low hooning of the whistle i dash out slam the door and lock it i lean a little against the opposite wall of the corridor feeling rather funny for it have be a narrow squeak ` theyr be noe sayfetie to be gain bye gayrd of holieness when the monyster have pow ' r to speak throe woode and stoene ' so run the passage in the sigsand m and i prove it in that ` nodding door ' business there be no protection against this particular form of monster except possibly for a fractional period of time for it can reproduce itself in or take to its purpose the very protective material which you may use and have the power to ' _ forme _ wythine the pentycle ' though not immediately there be of course the possibility of the unknown last line of the saaamaaa ritual be utter but it be too uncertain to count upon and the danger be too hideous and even then it have no power to protect for more than ` maybee fyve beat of the harte ' as the sigsand have it inside of the room there be now a constant meditative hooning whistle but presently this cease and the silence seem worse for there be such a sense of hidden mischief in a silence after a little i seal the door with cross hair and then clear off down the great passage and so to bed for a long time i lay awake but manage eventually to get some sleep yet about two o'clock i be wake by the hooning whistling of the room come to I even through the closed door the sound be tremendous and seem to beat through the whole house with a preside sense of terror as if -lrb- i remember thinking -rrb- some monstrous giant have be hold mad carnival with itself at the end of that great passage i get up and sit on the edge of the bed wonder whether to go along and have a look at the seal and suddenly there come a thump on my door and tassoc walk in with he dress gown over he pajamas ' i think it would have wake you so i come along to have a talk ' he say ' _ i _ can not sleep beautiful be not it ' ` extraordinary ' i say and toss he my case he light a cigarette and we sit and talk for about a hour and all the time that noise go on down at the end of the big corridor suddenly tassoc stand up : -- ` let 's take we gun and go and examine the brute ' he say and turn toward the door ` no ' i say ` by jove -- _ no _ i can not say anything definite yet but i believe that room be about as dangerous as it well can be ' ` haunt -- _ really _ haunt ' he ask keenly and without any of he frequent banter i tell he of course that i could not say a definite _ yes _ or _ no _ to such a question but that i hope to be able to make a statement soon then i give he a little lecture on the false re-materialization of the animate-force through the inanimate-inert he begin then to see the particular way in the room might be dangerous if it be really the subject of a manifestation about a hour later the whistle cease quite suddenly and tassoc go off again to bed i go back to mine also and eventually get another spell of sleep in the morning i go along to the room i find the seal on the door intact then i go in the window seal and the hair be all right but the seventh hair across the great fireplace be break this set I think i know that it might very possibly have snap through my have tension it too highly but then again it might have be break by something else yet it be scarcely possible that a man for instance could have pass between the six unbroken hair for no one would ever have notice they enter the room that way you see but just walk through they ignorant of they very existence i remove the other hair and the seal then i look up the chimney it go up straight and i could see blue sky at the top it be a big open flue and free from any suggestion of hide place or corner yet of course i do not trust to any such casual examination and after breakfast i put on my overalls and climb to the very top sound all the way but i find nothing then i come down and go over the whole of the room -- floor ceiling and wall map they out in six-inch square and sound with both hammer and probe but there be nothing abnormal afterward i make a three-weeks search of the whole castle in the same thorough way but find nothing i go even further then for at night when the whistle commence i make a microphone test you see if the whistle be mechanically produce this test would have make evident to I the working of the machinery if there be any such conceal within the wall it certainly be a up-to-date method of examination as you must allow of course i do not think that any of tassoc 's rival have fix up any mechanical contrivance but i think it just possible that there have be some such thing for produce the whistle make away back in the year perhaps with the intention of give the room a reputation that would ensure its be free of inquisitive folk you see what i mean well of course it be just possible if this be the case that someone know the secret of the machinery and be utilize the knowledge to play this devil of a prank on tassoc the microphone test of the wall would certainly have make this know to I as i have say but there be nothing of the sort in the castle so that i have practically no doubt at all now but that it be a genuine case of what be popularly term ` haunt ' all this time every night and sometimes most of each night the hooning whistling of the room be intolerable it be as if a intelligence there know that step be be take against it and pipe and hoon in a sort of mad mocking contempt i tell you it be as extraordinary as it be horrible time after time i go along -- tiptoe noiselessly on stockinged foot -- to the sealed door -lrb- for i always keep the room seal -rrb- i go at all hour of the night and often the whistle inside would seem to change to a brutally malignant note as though the half-animate monster see I plainly through the shut door and all the time the shriek hooning whistle would fill the whole corridor so that i use to feel a precious lonely chap mess about there with one of hell 's mystery and every morning i would enter the room and examine the different hair and seal you see after the first week i have stretch parallel hair all along the wall of the room and along the ceiling but over the floor which be of polished stone i have set out little colorless wafer tacky-side uppermost each wafer be number and they be arrange after a definite plan so that i should be able to trace the exact movement of any living thing that go across the floor you will see that no material be or creature could possibly have enter that room without leave many sign to tell I about it but nothing be ever disturb and i begin to think that i should have to risk a attempt to stay the night in the room in the electric pentacle yet mind you i know that it would be a crazy thing to do but i be get stumped and ready to do anything once about midnight i do break the seal on the door and have a quick look in but i tell you the whole room give one mad yell and seem to come toward I in a great belly of shadow as if the wall have belly in toward I of course that must have be fancy anyway the yell be sufficient and i slam the door and lock it feel a bit weak down my spine you know the feeling and then when i have get to that state of readiness for anything i make something of a discovery it be about one in the morning and i be walk slowly ` round the castle keep in the soft grass i have come under the shadow of the east front and far above I i could hear the vile hooning whistle of the room up in the darkness of the unlit wing then suddenly a little in front of I i hear a man 's voice speaking low but evidently in glee : -- ` by george you chap but i would not care to bring a wife home in that ' it say in the tone of the culture irish someone start to reply but there come a sharp exclamation and then a rush and i hear footstep run in all direction evidently the man have spot I for a few seconds i stand there feel a awful ass after all _ they _ be at the bottom of the haunting do you see what a big fool it make I seem i have no doubt but that they be some of tassoc 's rival and here i have be feel in every bone that i have hit a real bad genuine case and then you know there come the memory of hundred of detail that make I just as much in doubt again anyway whether it be natural or ab-natural there be a great deal yet to be clear up i tell tassoc next morning what i have discover and through the whole of every night for five night we keep a close watch ` round the east wing but there be never a sign of anyone prowl about and all the time almost from evening to dawn that grotesque whistle would hoon incredibly far above we in the darkness on the morning after the fifth night i receive a wire from here which bring I home by the next boat i explain to tassoc that i be simply bind to come away for a few day but tell he to keep up the watch ` round the castle one thing i be very careful to do and that be to make he absolutely promise never to go into the room between sunset and sunrise i make it clear to he that we know nothing definite yet one way or the other and if the room be what i have first think it to be it might be a lot better for he to die first than enter it after dark when i get here and have finish my business i think you chap would be interested and also i want to get it all spread out clear in my mind so i ring you up i be go over again to-morrow and when i get back i ought to have something pretty extraordinary to tell you by the way there be a curious thing i forget to tell you i try to get a phonographic record of the whistle but it simply produce no impression on the wax at all that be one of the thing that have make I feel queer i can tell you another extraordinary thing be that the microphone will not magnify the sound -- will not even transmit it seem to take no account of it and act as if it be nonexistent i be absolutely and utterly stump up to the present i be a wee bit curious to see whether any of you dear clever head can make daylight of it _ i _ can not -- not yet he rise to he foot good night all he say and begin to usher we out abruptly but without offence into the night a fortnight later he drop each of we a card and you can imagine that i be not late this time when we arrive carnackus take we straight into dinner and when we have finish and all make ourselves comfortable he begin again where he have leave off : -- now just listen quietly for i have get something pretty queer to tell you i get back late at night and i have to walk up to the castle as i have not warn they that i be come it be bright moonlight so that the walk be rather a pleasure than otherwise when i get there the whole place be in darkness and i think i would take a walk ` round outside to see whether tassoc or he brother be keep watch but i could not find they anywhere and conclude that they have get tire of it and go off to bed as i return across the front of the east wing i catch the hooning whistling of the room come down strangely through the stillness of the night it have a queer note in it i remember -- low and constant queerly meditative i look up at the window bright in the moonlight and get a sudden thought to bring a ladder from the stable yard and try to get a look into the room through the window with this notion i hunt ` round at the back of the castle among the straggle of office and presently find a long fairly light ladder though it be heavy enough for one goodness know and i think at first that i should never get it rear i manage at last and let the end rest very quietly against the wall a little below the sill of the larger window then go silently i go up the ladder presently i have my face above the sill and be look in alone with the moonlight of course the queer whistle sound louder up there but it still convey that peculiar sense of something whistle quietly to itself -- can you understand though for all the meditative lowness of the note the horrible gargantuan quality be distinct -- a mighty parody of the human as if i stand there and listen to the whistle from the lip of a monster with a man 's soul and then you know i see something the floor in the middle of the huge empty room be pucker upward in the center into a strange soft-looking mound part at the top into a ever change hole that pulsate to that great gentle hooning at time as i watch i see the heaving of the indented mound gap across with a queer inward suction as with the drawing of a enormous breath then the thing would dilate and pout once more to the incredible melody and suddenly as i stare dumb it come to I that the thing be live i be look at two enormous blacken lip blister and brutal there in the pale moonlight abruptly they bulge out to a vast pouting mound of force and sound stiffen and swollen and hugely massive and clean-cut in the moon-beam and a great sweat lay heavy on the vast upper-lip in the same moment of time the whistle have burst into a mad scream note that seem to stun I even where i stand outside of the window and then the following moment i be stare blankly at the solid undisturbed floor of the room -- smooth polished stone flooring from wall to wall and there be a absolute silence you can picture I stare into the quiet room and know what i know i feel like a sick frightened kid and want to slide _ quietly _ down the ladder and run away but in that very instant i hear tassoc 's voice call to I from within the room for help _ help _ my god but i get such a awful dazed feeling and i have a vague bewildered notion that after all it be the irishman who have get he in there and be take it out of he and then the call come again and i burst the window and jump in to help he i have a confused idea that the call have come from within the shadow of the great fireplace and i race across to it but there be no one there ` tassoc ' i shout and my voice go empty-sounding ` round the great apartment and then in a flash _ i know that tassoc have never call _ i whirl ` round sick with fear toward the window and as i do so a frightful exultant whistle scream burst through the room on my leave the end wall have bellied-in toward I in a pair of gargantuan lip black and utterly monstrous to within a yard of my face i fumble for a mad instant at my revolver not for _ it _ but myself for the danger be a thousand time worse than death and then suddenly the unknown last line of the saaamaaa ritual be whisper quite audibly in the room instantly the thing happen that i have know once before there come a sense as of dust fall continually and monotonously and i know that my life hang uncertain and suspend for a flash in a brief reel vertigo of unseeable thing then _ that _ end and i know that i might live my soul and body blended again and life and power come to I i dash furiously at the window and hurl myself out head-foremost for i can tell you that i have stop be afraid of death i crash down on to the ladder and slither grab and grab and so come some way or other alive to the bottom and there i sit in the soft wet grass with the moonlight all about I and far above through the break window of the room there be a low whistle that be the chief of it i be not hurt and i go ` round to the front and knock tassoc up when they let I in we have a long yarn over some good whisky -- for i be shake to piece -- and i explain thing as much as i could i tell tassoc that the room would have to come down and every fragment of it burn in a blast-furnace erect within a pentacle he nod there be nothing to say then i go to bed we turn a small army on to the work and within ten day that lovely thing have go up in smoke and what be leave be calcine and clean it be when the workman be strip the paneling that i get hold of a sound notion of the beginning of that beastly development over the great fireplace after the great oak panel have be tear down i find that there be let into the masonry a scrollwork of stone with on it a old inscription in ancient celtic that here in this room be burn dian tiansay jester of king alzof who make the song of foolishness upon king ernore of the seventh castle when i get the translation clear i give it to tassoc he be tremendously excite for he know the old tale and take I down to the library to look at a old parchment that give the story in detail afterward i find that the incident be well-known about the countryside but always regard more as a legend than as history and no one seem ever to have dream that the old east wing of iastrae castle be the remains of the ancient seventh castle from the old parchment i gather that there have be a pretty dirty job do away back in the year it seem that king alzof and king ernore have be enemy by birthright as you might say truly but that nothing more than a little raiding have occur on either side for year until dian tiansay make the song of foolishness upon king ernore and sing it before king alzof and so greatly be it appreciate that king alzof give the jester one of he lady to wife presently all the people of the land have come to know the song and so it come at last to king ernore who be so angered that he make war upon he old enemy and take and burn he and he castle but dian tiansay the jester he bring with he to he own place and have tear he tongue out because of the song which he have make and sing he imprison he in the room in the east wing -lrb- which be evidently use for unpleasant purpose -rrb- and the jester 's wife he keep for himself have a fancy for she prettiness but one night dian tiansay 's wife be not to be find and in the morning they discover she lie dead in she husband 's arm and he sit whistle the song of foolishness for he have no longer the power to sing it then they roasted dian tiansay in the great fireplace -- probably from that selfsame ` galley-iron ' which i have already mention and until he die dian tiansay cease not to whistle the song of foolishness which he could no longer sing but afterward ` in that room ' there be often hear at night the sound of something whistle and there ` grow a power in that room ' so that none dare to sleep in it and presently it would seem the king go to another castle for the whistle troubled he there you have it all of course that be only a rough rendering of the translation of the parchment but it sound extraordinarily quaint do not you think so yes i say answering for the lot but how do the thing grow to such a tremendous manifestation one of those case of continuity of thought produce a positive action upon the immediate surrounding material reply carnackus the development must have be go forward through century to have produce such a monstrosity it be a true instance of saiitius manifestation which i can best explain by liken it to a living spiritual fungus which involve the very structure of the aether-fiber itself and of course in so do acquire a essential control over the ` material substance ' involve in it it be impossible to make it plainer in a few word what break the seventh hair ask taylor but carnackus do not know he think it be probably nothing but be too severely tension he also explain that they find out that the man who have run away have not be up to mischief but have come over secretly merely to hear the whistle which indeed have suddenly become the talk of the whole countryside one other thing say arkright have you any idea what govern the use of the unknown last line of the saaamaaa ritual i know of course that it be use by the ab-human priest in the incantation of raaaee but what use it on you behalf and what make it you have better read harzan 's monograph and my addendum to it on astral and astral co-ordination and interference say carnackus it be a extraordinary subject and i can only say here that the human vibration may not be insulate from the astral -lrb- as be always believe to be the case in interference by the ab-human -rrb- without immediate action be take by those force which govern the spin of the outer circle in other word it be be prove time after time that there be some inscrutable protective force constantly intervene between the human soul -lrb- not the body mind you -rrb- and the outer monstrosity be i clear yes i think so i reply and you believe that the room have become the material expression of the ancient jester -- that he soul rotten with hatred have breed into a monster -- eh i ask yes say carnackus nodding i think you have put my thought rather neatly it be a queer coincidence that miss donnehue be suppose to be descend -lrb- so i have hear since -rrb- from the same king ernore it make one think some curious thought do not it the marriage come on and the room wake to fresh life if she have go into that room ever eh _ it _ have wait a long time sin of the father yes i have think of that they be to be marry next week and i be to be best man which be a thing i hate and he win he bet rather just think _ if _ ever she have go into that room pretty horrible eh he nod he head grimly and we four nod back then he rise and take we collectively to the door and presently thrust we forth in friendly fashion on the embankment and into the fresh night air good night we all call back and go to we various home if she have eh if she have that be what i keep think no 4 -- the horse of the invisible i have that afternoon receive a invitation from carnacki when i reach he place i find he sit alone as i come into the room he rise with a perceptibly stiff movement and extend he left hand he face seem to be badly scar and bruise and he right hand be bandage he shake hand and offer I he paper which i refuse then he pass I a handful of photograph and return to he read now that be just carnackus not a word have come from he and not a question from I he would tell we all about it later i spend about half a hour look at the photograph which be chiefly snap -lrb- some by flashlight -rrb- of a extraordinarily pretty girl though in some of the photograph it be wonderful that she prettiness be so evident for so frightened and startle be she expression that it be difficult not to believe that she have be photograph in the presence of some imminent and overwhelming danger the bulk of the photograph be of interior of different room and passage and in every one the girl might be see either full length in the distance or closer with perhaps little more than a hand or arm or portion of the head or dress include in the photograph all of these have evidently be take with some definite aim that do not have for its first purpose the picture of the girl but obviously of she surroundings and they make I very curious as you can imagine near the bottom of the pile however i come upon something _ definitely _ extraordinary it be a photograph of the girl standing abrupt and clear in the great blaze of a flashlight as be plain to be see she face be turn a little upward as if she have be frightened suddenly by some noise directly above she as though half-formed and come down out of the shadow be the shape of a single enormous hoof i examine this photograph for a long time without understand it more than that it have probably to do with some queer case in which carnackus be interested when jessop arkright and taylor come in carnackus quietly hold out he hand for the photograph which i return in the same spirit and afterward we all go in to dinner when we have spend a quiet hour at the table we pull we chair ` round and make ourselves snug and carnackus begin : i have be north he say speak slowly and painfully between puff at he pipe up to hisgin of east lancashire it have be a pretty strange business all ` round as i fancy you chap will think when i have finish i know before i go something about the ` horse story ' as i have hear it call but i never think of it come my way somehow also i know _ now _ that i never consider it seriously -- in spite of my rule always to keep a open mind funny creature we human well i get a wire ask for a appointment which of course tell I that there be some trouble on the date i fix old captain hisgin himself come up to see I he tell I a great many new detail about the horse story though naturally i have always know the main point and understand that if the first child be a girl that girl would be haunt by the horse during she courtship it be as you can see already a extraordinary story and though i have always know about it i have never think it to be anything more than a old-time legend as i have already hint you see for seven generation the hisgin family have have man child for they first-born and even the hisgins themselves have long consider the tale to be little more than a myth to come to the present the eldest child of the reign family be a girl and she have be often tease and warn in jest by she friend and relation that she be the first girl to be the eldest for seven generation and that she would have to keep she man friend at arm 's length or go into a nunnery if she hope to escape the haunting and this i think show we how thoroughly the tale have grow to be consider as nothing worthy of the least serious thought do not you think so two month ago miss hisgin become engage to beaumont a young naval officer and on the evening of the very day of the engagement before it be even formally announce a most extraordinary thing happen which result in captain hisgin make the appointment and my ultimately go down to they place to look into the thing from the old family record and papers that be entrust to I i find that there could be no possible doubt that prior to something like a hundred and fifty year ago there be some very extraordinary and disagreeable coincidence to put the thing in the least emotional way in the whole of the two century prior to that date there be five first-born girl out of a total of seven generation of the family each of these girl grow up to maidenhood and each become engage and each one die during the period of engagement two by suicide one by fall from a window one from a ` broken heart ' -lrb- presumably heart failure owe to sudden shock through fright -rrb- the fifth girl be kill one evening in the park ` round the house but just how there seem to be no _ exact _ knowledge only that there be a impression that she have be kick by a horse she be dead when find now you see all of these death might be attribute in a way -- even the suicide -- to natural cause i mean as distinct from supernatural you see yet in every case the maiden have undoubtedly suffer some extraordinary and terrifying experience during they various courtship for in all of the record there be mention either of the neighing of a unseen horse or of the sound of a invisible horse gallop as well as many other peculiar and quite inexplicable manifestation you begin to understand now i think just how extraordinary a business it be that i be ask to look into i gather from one account that the haunting of the girl be so constant and horrible that two of the girl ' lover fairly run away from they ladylove and i think it be this more than anything else that make I feel that there have be something more in it than a mere succession of uncomfortable coincidence i get hold of these fact before i have be many hour in the house and after this i go pretty carefully into the detail of the thing that happen on the night of miss hisgin 's engagement to beaumont it seem that as the two of they be go through the big lower corridor just after dusk and before the lamp have be light there have be a sudden horrible neighing in the corridor close to they immediately afterward beaumont receive a tremendous blow or kick which break he right forearm then the rest of the family and the servant come run to know what be wrong light be bring and the corridor and afterward the whole house search but nothing unusual be find you can imagine the excitement in the house and the half incredulous half believe talk about the old legend then later in the middle of the night the old captain be wake by the sound of a great horse gallop ` round and ` round the house several time after this both beaumont and the girl say that they have hear the sound of hoof near to they after dusk in several of the room and corridor three night later beaumont be wake by a strange neighing in the nighttime seem to come from the direction of he sweetheart 's bedroom he run hurriedly for she father and the two of they race to she room they find she awake and ill with sheer terror have be awaken by the neighing seemingly close to she bed the night before i arrive there have be a fresh happen and they be all in a frightfully nervy state as you can imagine i spend most of the first day as i have hint in get hold of detail but after dinner i slack off and play billiards all the evening with beaumont and miss hisgin we stop about ten o'clock and have coffee and i get beaumont to give I full particulars about the thing that have happen the evening before he and miss hisgin have be sit quietly in she aunt 's boudoir whilst the old lady chaperon they behind a book it be grow dusk and the lamp be at she end of the table the rest of the house be not yet light as the evening have come earlier than usual well it seem that the door into the hall be open and suddenly the girl say : ` h ` sh what be that ' they both listen and then beaumont hear it -- the sound of a horse outside of the front door ` you father ' he suggest but she remind he that she father be not ride of course they be both ready to feel queer as you can suppose but beaumont make a effort to shake this off and go into the hall to see whether anyone be at the entrance it be pretty dark in the hall and he could see the glass panel of the inner draft door clear-cut in the darkness of the hall he walk over to the glass and look through into the drive beyond but there nothing in sight he feel nervous and puzzle and open the inner door and go out on to the carriage-circle almost directly afterward the great hall door swing to with a crash behind he he tell I that he have a sudden awful feeling of have be trap in some way -- that be how he put it he whirl ` round and grip the door handle but something seem to be hold it with a vast grip on the other side then before he could be fix in he mind that this be so he be able to turn the handle and open the door he pause a moment in the doorway and peer into the hall for he have hardly steady he mind sufficiently to know whether he be really frightened or not then he hear he sweetheart blow he a kiss out of the greyness of the big unlit hall and he know that she have follow he from the boudoir he blow she a kiss back and step inside the doorway mean to go to she and then suddenly in a flash of sickening knowledge he know that it be not he sweetheart who have blow he that kiss he know that something be try to tempt he alone into the darkness and that the girl have never leave the boudoir he jump back and in the same instant of time he hear the kiss again nearer to he he call out at the top of he voice : ` mary stay in the boudoir do not move out of the boudoir until i come to you ' he hear she call something in reply from the boudoir and then he have strike a clump of a dozen or so match and be hold they above he head and look ` round the hall there be no one in it but even as the match burn out there come the sound of a great horse gallop down the empty drive now you see both he and the girl have hear the sound of the horse gallop but when i question more closely i find that the aunt have hear nothing though it be true she be a bit deaf and she be further back in the room of course both he and miss hisgin have be in a extremely nervous state and ready to hear anything the door might have be slam by a sudden puff of wind owe to some inner door be open and as for the grip on the handle that may have be nothing more than the snick catch with regard to the kiss and the sound of the horse gallop i point out that these might have seem ordinary enough sound if they have be only cool enough to reason as i tell he and as he know the sound of a horse gallop carry a long way on the wind so that what he have hear might have be nothing more than a horse be ride some distance away and as for the kiss plenty of quiet noise -- the rustle of a paper or a leaf -- have a somewhat similar sound especially if one be in a overstrung condition and imagine thing i finish preach this little sermon on commonsense versus hysteria as we put out the light and leave the billiard room but neither beaumont nor miss hisgin would agree that there have be any fancy on they part we have come out of the billiard room by this time and be go along the passage and i be still do my best to make both of they see the ordinary commonplace possibility of the happen when what kill my pig as the say go be the sound of a hoof in the dark billiard room we have just leave i feel the ` creep ' come on I in a flash up my spine and over the back of my head miss hisgin whoop like a child with the whooping cough and run up the passage give little gasping scream beaumont however rip ` round on he heel and jump back a couple of yard i give back too a bit as you can understand ` there it be ' he say in a low breathless voice ` perhaps you 'll believe now ' ` there be certainly something ' i whisper never take my gaze off the closed door of the billiard room ` h ` sh ' he mutter ` there it be again ' there be a sound like a great horse pacing ` round and ` round the billiard room with slow deliberate step a horrible cold fright take I so that it seem impossible to take a full breath you know the feeling and then i see we must have be walk backward for we find ourselves suddenly at the opening of the long passage we stop there and listen the sound go on steadily with a horrible sort of deliberateness as if the brute be take a sort of malicious gusto in walk about all over the room which we have just occupy do you understand just what i mean then there be a pause and a long time of absolute quiet except for a excited whispering from some of the people down in the big hall the sound come plainly up the wide stairway i fancy they be gather ` round miss hisgin with some notion of protect she i should think beaumont and i stand there at the end of the passage for about five minute listen for any noise in the billiard room then i realize what a horrible funk i be in and i say to he : ` i be go to see what be there ' ` so be i ' he answer he be pretty white but he have heap of pluck i tell he to wait one instant and i make a dash into my bedroom and get my camera and flashlight i slip my revolver into my right-hand pocket and a knuckle-duster over my left fist where it be ready and yet would not stop I from be able to work my flashlight then i run back to beaumont he hold out he hand to show I that he have he pistol and i nodded but whisper to he not to be too quick to shoot as there might be some silly practical joking at work after all he have get a lamp from a bracket in the upper hall which he be hold in the crook of he damaged arm so that we have a good light then we go down the passage toward the billiard room and you can imagine that we be a pretty nervous couple all this time there have not be a sound but abruptly when we be within perhaps a couple of yard of the door we hear the sudden clumping of a hoof on the solid _ parquet _ floor of the billiard room in the instant afterward it seem to I that the whole place shake beneath the ponderous hoof fall of some huge thing _ come toward the door _ both beaumont and i give back a pace or two and then realize and hang on to we courage as you might say and wait the great tread come right up to the door and then stop and there be a instant of absolute silence except that so far as i be concern the pulse in my throat and temple almost deafen I i dare say we wait quite half a minute and then come the further restless clumping of a great hoof immediately afterward the sound come right on as if some invisible thing pass through the closed door and the ponderous tread be upon we we jump each of we to we side of the passage and i know that i spread myself stiff against the wall the clungk clunck clungk clunck of the great hoof fall pass right between we and slowly and with deadly deliberateness down the passage i hear they through a haze of blood beat in my ear and temple and my body be extraordinarily rigid and pringling and i be horribly breathless i stand for a little time like this my head turn so that i could see up the passage i be conscious only that there be a hideous danger abroad do you understand and then suddenly my pluck come back to I i be aware that the noise of the hoof beat sound near the other end of the passage i twist quickly and get my camera to bear and snap off the flashlight immediately afterward beaumont let fly a storm of shot down the passage and begin to run shouting : ` it be after mary run run ' he rush down the passage and i after he we come out on the main landing and hear the sound of a hoof on the stair and after that nothing and from thence onward nothing down below we in the big hall i could see a number of the household ` round miss hisgin who seem to have faint and there be several of the servant clump together a little way off stare up at the main landing and no one say a single word and about some twenty step up the stair be the old captain hisgin with a draw sword in he hand where he have halt just below the last hoof sound i think i never see anything finer than the old man standing there between he daughter and that infernal thing i daresay you can understand the queer feeling of horror i have at pass that place on the stair where the sound have cease it be as if the monster be still stand there invisible and the peculiar thing be that we never hear another sound of the hoof either up or down the stair after they have take miss hisgin to she room i send word that i should follow so soon as they be ready for I and presently when a message come to tell I that i could come any time i ask she father to give I a hand with my instrument box and between we we carry it into the girl 's bedroom i have the bed pull well out into the middle of the room after which i erect the electric pentacle ` round the bed then i direct that lamp should be place ` round the room but that on no account must any light be make within the pentacle neither must anyone pass in or out the girl 's mother i have place within the pentacle and direct that she maid should sit without ready to carry any message so as to make sure that mr hisgin do not have to leave the pentacle i suggest also that the girl 's father should stay the night in the room and that he have better be arm when i leave the bedroom i find beaumont wait outside the door in a miserable state of anxiety i tell he what i have do and explain to he that miss hisgin be probably perfectly safe within the ` protection ' but that in addition to she father remain the night in the room i intend to stand guard at the door i tell he that i should like he to keep I company for i know that he could never sleep feeling as he do and i should not be sorry to have a companion also i want to have he under my own observation for there be no doubt but that he be actually in greater danger in some way than the girl at least that be my opinion and be still as i think you will agree later i ask he whether he would object to my draw a pentacle ` round he for the night and get he to agree but i see that he do not know whether to be superstitious about it or to regard it more as a piece of foolish mumming but he take it seriously enough when i give he some particulars about the black veil case when young aster die you remember he say it be a piece of silly superstition and stay outside poor devil the night pass quietly enough until a little while before dawn when we both hear the sound of a great horse gallop ` round and ` round the house just as old captain hisgin have describe it you can imagine how queer it make I feel and directly afterward i hear someone stir within the bedroom i knock at the door for i be uneasy and the captain come i ask whether everything be right to which he reply yes and immediately ask I whether i have hear the gallop so that i know he have hear they also i suggest that it might be well to leave the bedroom door open a little until the dawn come in as there be certainly something abroad this be do and he go back into the room to be near he wife and daughter i have better say here that i be doubtful whether there be any value in the ` defense ' about miss hisgin for what i term the ` personal sound ' of the manifestation be so extraordinarily material that i be incline to parallel the case with that one of harford 's where the hand of the child keep materialize within the pentacle and pat the floor as you will remember that be a hideous business yet as it chance nothing further happen and so soon as daylight have fully come we all go off to bed beaumont knock I up about midday and i go down and make breakfast into lunch miss hisgin be there and seem in very fair spirit consider she tell I that i have make she feel almost safe for the first time for day she tell I also that she cousin harry parsket be come down from london and she know that he would do anything to help fight the ghost and after that she and beaumont go out into the grounds to have a little time together i have a walk in the grounds myself and go ` round the house but see no trace of hoof mark and after that i spend the rest of the day make a examination of the house but find nothing i make a end of my search before dark and go to my room to dress for dinner when i get down the cousin have just arrive and i find he one of the nicest man i have meet for a long time a chap with a tremendous amount of pluck and the particular kind of man i like to have with I in a bad case like the one i be on i could see that what puzzle he most be we belief in the genuineness of the haunting and i find myself almost want something to happen just to show he how true it be as it chance something do happen with a vengeance beaumont and miss hisgin have go out for a stroll just before the dusk and captain hisgin ask I to come into he study for a short chat whilst parsket go upstairs with he trap for he have no man with he i have a long conversation with the old captain in which i point out that the ` haunt ' have evidently no particular connection with the house but only with the girl herself and that the sooner she be marry the better as it would give beaumont a right to be with she at all time and further than this it might be that the manifestation would cease if the marriage be actually perform the old man nod agreement to this especially to the first part and remind I that three of the girl who be say to have be ` haunt ' have be send away from home and meet they death whilst away and then in the midst of we talk there come a pretty frightening interruption for all at once the old butler rush into the room most extraordinarily pale : ` miss mary sir miss mary sir ' he gasp ` she be scream out in the park sir and they say they can hear the horse -- ' the captain make one dive for a rack of arm and snatch down he old sword and run out draw it as he run i dash out and up the stair snatch my camera-flashlight and a heavy revolver give one yell at parsket 's door : ` the horse ' and be down and into the grounds away in the darkness there be a confused shouting and i catch the sound of shoot out among the scatter tree and then from a patch of blackness to my leave there burst suddenly a infernal gobbling sort of neigh instantly i whip ` round and snap off the flashlight the great light blaze out momentarily show I the leaf of a big tree close at hand quiver in the night breeze but i see nothing else and then the ten-fold blackness come down upon I and i hear parsket shout a little way back to know whether i have see anything the next instant he be beside I and i feel safer for he company for there be some incredible thing near to we and i be momentarily blind because of the brightness of the flashlight ` what be it what be it ' he keep repeat in a excited voice and all the time i be stare into the darkness and answering mechanically ' i do not know i do not know ' there be a burst of shout somewhere ahead and then a shot we run toward the sound yell to the people not to shoot for in the darkness and panic there be this danger also then there come two of the game-keeper race hard up the drive with they lantern and gun and immediately afterward a row of light dance toward we from the house carry by some of the men-servant as the light come up i see we have come close to beaumont he be stand over miss hisgin and he have he revolver in he hand then i see he face and there be a great wound across he forehead by he be the captain turn he naked sword this way and that and peer into the darkness a little behind he stand the old butler a battle-axe from one of the arm stand in the hall in he hand yet there be nothing strange to be see anywhere we get the girl into the house and leave she with she mother and beaumont whilst a groom ride for a doctor and then the rest of we with four other keeper all arm with gun and carry lantern search ` round the home park but we find nothing when we get back we find that the doctor have be he have bind up beaumont 's wound which luckily be not deep and order miss hisgin straight to bed i go upstairs with the captain and find beaumont on guard outside of the girl 's door i ask he how he feel and then so soon as the girl and she mother be ready for we captain hisgin and i go into the bedroom and fix the pentacle again ` round the bed they have already get lamp about the room and after i have set the same order of watch as on the previous night i join beaumont outside of the door parsket have come up while i have be in the bedroom and between we we get some idea from beaumont as to what have happen out in the park it seem that they be come home after they stroll from the direction of the west lodge it have get quite dark and suddenly miss hisgin say : ` hush ' and come to a standstill he stop and listen but hear nothing for a little then he catch it -- the sound of a horse seemingly a long way off gallop toward they over the grass he tell the girl that it be nothing and start to hurry she toward the house but she be not deceive of course in less than a minute they hear it quite close to they in the darkness and they start run then miss hisgin catch she foot and fall she begin to scream and that be what the butler hear as beaumont lift the girl he hear the hoof come thudding right at he he stand over she and fire all five chamber of he revolver right at the sound he tell we that he be sure he see something that look like a enormous horse 's head right upon he in the light of the last flash of he pistol immediately afterward he be strike a tremendous blow which knock he down and then the captain and the butler come run up shout the rest of course we know about ten o'clock the butler bring we up a tray for which i be very glad as the night before i have get rather hungry i warn beaumont however to be very particular not to drink any spirit and i also make he give I he pipe and match at midnight i draw a pentacle ` round he and parsket and i sit one on each side of he outside the pentacle for i have no fear that there would be any manifestation make against anyone except beaumont or miss hisgin after that we keep pretty quiet the passage be light by a big lamp at each end so that we have plenty of light and we be all armed beaumont and i with revolver and parsket with a shotgun in addition to my weapon i have my camera and flashlight now and again we talk in whisper and twice the captain come out of the bedroom to have a word with we about half-past one we have all grow very silent and suddenly about twenty minute later i hold up my hand silently for there seem to be a sound of gallop out in the night i knock on the bedroom door for the captain to open it and when he come i whisper to he that we think we hear the horse for some time we stay listen and both parsket and the captain think they hear it but now i be not so sure neither be beaumont yet afterward i think i hear it again i tell captain hisgin i think he have better go into the bedroom and leave the door a little open and this he do but from that time onward we hear nothing and presently the dawn come in and we all go very thankfully to bed when i be call at lunchtime i have a little surprise for captain hisgin tell I that they have hold a family council and have decide to take my advice and have the marriage without a day 's more delay than possible beaumont be already on he way to london to get a special license and they hope to have the wedding next day this pleased I for it seem the sanest thing to be do in the extraordinary circumstance and meanwhile i should continue my investigation but until the marriage be accomplish my chief thought be to keep miss hisgin near to I after lunch i think i would take a few experimental photograph of miss hisgin and she _ surroundings _ sometimes the camera see thing that would seem very strange to normal human eyesight with this intention and partly to make a excuse to keep she in my company as much as possible i ask miss hisgin to join I in my experiment she seem glad to do this and i spend several hour with she wander all over the house from room to room and whenever the impulse come i take a flashlight of she and the room or corridor in which we chance to be at the moment after we have go right through the house in this fashion i ask she whether she feel sufficiently brave to repeat the experiment in the cellar she say yes and so i root out captain hisgin and parsket for i be not go to take she even into what you might call artificial darkness without help and companionship at hand when we be ready we go down into the wine cellar captain hisgin carry a shotgun and parsket a specially prepared background and a lantern i get the girl to stand in the middle of the cellar whilst parsket and the captain hold out the background behind she then i fire off the flashlight and we go into the next cellar where we repeat the experiment then in the third cellar a tremendous pitch-dark place something extraordinary and horrible manifest itself i have station miss hisgin in the center of the place with she father and parsket hold the background as before when all be ready and just as i press the trigger of the ` flash ' there come in the cellar that dreadful gobbling neighing that i have hear out in the park it seem to come from somewhere above the girl and in the glare of the sudden light i see that she be stare tensely upward but at no visible thing and then in the succeed comparative darkness i be shout to the captain and parsket to run miss hisgin out into the daylight this be do instantly and i shut and lock the door afterward make the first and eighth sign of the saaamaaa ritual opposite to each post and connect they across the threshold with a triple line in the meanwhile parsket and captain hisgin carry the girl to she mother and leave she there in a half faint condition whilst i stay on guard outside of the cellar door feeling pretty horrible for i know that there be some disgusting thing inside and along with this feeling there be a sense of half ashamedness rather miserable you know because i have expose miss hisgin to the danger i have get the captain 's shotgun and when he and parsket come down again they be each carry gun and lantern i could not possibly tell you the utter relief of spirit and body that come to I when i hear they come but just try to imagine what it be like stand outside of that cellar can you i remember notice just before i go to unlock the door how white and ghastly parsket look and the old captain be grey-looking and i wonder whether my face be like theirs and this you know have its own distinct effect upon my nerve for it seem to bring the beastliness of the thing crash down on to I in a fresh way i know it be only sheer will power that carry I up to the door and make I turn the key i pause one little moment and then with a nervy jerk send the door wide open and hold my lantern over my head parsket and the captain come one on each side of I and hold up they lantern but the place be absolutely empty of course i do not trust to a casual look of this kind but spend several hour with the help of the two other in sound every square foot of the floor ceiling and wall yet in the end i have to admit that the place itself be absolutely normal and so we come away but i seal the door and outside opposite each doorpost i make the first and last sign of the saaamaaa ritual join they as before with a triple line can you imagine what it be like search that cellar when we get upstairs i inquire very anxiously how miss hisgin be and the girl come out herself to tell I that she be all right and that i be not to trouble about she or blame myself as i tell she i have be do i feel happier then and go off to dress for dinner and after that be do parsket and i take one of the bathroom to develop the negative that i have be take yet none of the plate have anything to tell we until we come to the one that be take in the cellar parsket be develop and i have take a batch of the fix plate out into the lamplight to examine they i have just go carefully through the lot when i hear a shout from parsket and when i run to he he be look at a partly-developed negative which he be hold up to the red lamp it show the girl plainly look upward as i have see she but the thing that astonish I be the shadow of a enormous hoof right above she as if it be come down upon she out of the shadow and you know i have run she bang into that danger that be the thought that be chief in my mind as soon as the develop be complete i fix the plate and examine it carefully in a good light there be no doubt about it at all the thing above miss hisgin be a enormous shadowy hoof yet i be no nearer to come to any definite knowledge and the only thing i could do be to warn parsket to say nothing about it to the girl for it would only increase she fright but i show the thing to she father for i consider it right that he should know that night we take the same precaution for miss hisgin 's safety as on the two previous night and parsket keep I company yet the dawn come in without anything unusual have happen and i go off to bed when i get down to lunch i learn that beaumont have wire to say that he would be in soon after four also that a message have be send to the rector and it be generally plain that the lady of the house be in a tremendous fluster beaumont 's train be late and he do not get home until five but even then the rector have not put in a appearance and the butler come in to say that the coachman have return without he as he have be call away unexpectedly twice more during the evening the carriage be send down but the clergyman have not return and we have to delay the marriage until the next day that night i arrange the ` defense ' ` round the girl 's bed and the captain and he wife sit up with she as before beaumont as i expect insist on keep watch with I and he seem in a curiously frightened mood not for himself you know but for miss hisgin he have a horrible feeling he tell I that there would be a final dreadful attempt on he sweetheart that night this of course i tell he be nothing but nerve yet really it make I feel very anxious for i have see too much not to know that under such circumstance a premonitory _ conviction _ of impend danger be not necessarily to be put down entirely to nerve in fact beaumont be so simply and earnestly convince that the night would bring some extraordinary manifestation that i get parsket to rig up a long cord from the wire of the butler 's bell to come along the passage handy to the butler himself i give direction not to undress and to give the same order to two of the footman if i ring he be to come instantly with the footman carry lantern and the lantern be to be keep ready light all night if for any reason the bell do not ring and i blow my whistle he be to take that as a signal in the place of the bell after i have arrange all these minor detail i draw a pentacle about beaumont and warn he very particularly to stay within it whatever happen and when this be do there be nothing to do but wait and pray that the night would go as quietly as the night before we scarcely talk at all and by about one be we be all very tense and nervous so that at last parsket get up and begin to walk up and down the corridor to steady himself a bit presently i slip off my pump and join he and we walk up and down whisper occasionally for something over a hour until in turn i catch my foot in the bell cord and go down on my face but without hurt myself or make a noise when i get up parsket nudge I ` do you notice that the bell never ring ' he whisper ` jove ' i say ` you be right ' ` wait a minute ' he answer ` i 'll bet it be only a kink somewhere in the cord ' he leave he gun and slip along the passage and take the top lamp tiptoe away into the house carry beaumont 's revolver ready in he right hand he be a plucky chap i remember think then and again later just then beaumont motion to I for absolute quiet directly afterward i hear the thing for which he listen -- the sound of a horse gallop out in the night i think that i may say i fairly shiver the sound die away and leave a horrible desolate eerie feeling in the air you know i put my hand out to the bell cord hope parsket have get it clear then i wait glancing before and behind perhaps two minute pass full of what seem like a almost unearthly quiet and then suddenly down the corridor at the light end there sound the clumping of a great hoof and instantly the lamp be throw with a tremendous crash and we be in the dark i tug hard on the cord and blow the whistle then i raise my snapshot and fire the flashlight the corridor blaze into brilliant light but there be nothing and then the darkness fall like thunder i hear the captain at the bedroom door and shout to he to bring out a lamp _ quick _ but instead something start to kick the door and i hear the captain shout within the bedroom and then the scream of the woman i have a sudden horrible fear that the monster have get into the bedroom but in the same instant from up the corridor there come abruptly the vile gobbling neigh that we have hear in the park and the cellar i blow the whistle again and grope blindly for the bell cord shout to beaumont to stay in the pentacle whatever happen i yell again to the captain to bring out a lamp and there come a smash sound against the bedroom door then i have my match in my hand to get some light before that incredible unseen monster be upon we the match scrape on the box and flare up dully and in the same instant i hear a faint sound behind I i whip ` round in a kind of mad terror and see something in the light of the match -- a monstrous horse-head close to beaumont ` look out beaumont ' i shout in a sort of scream ` it be behind you ' the match go out abruptly and instantly there come the huge bang of parsket 's double-barrel -lrb- both barrel at once -rrb- fire evidently single-handed by beaumont close to my ear as it seem i catch a momentary glimpse of the great head in the flash and of a enormous hoof amid the belch of fire and smoke seeming to be descend upon beaumont in the same instant i fire three chamber of my revolver there be the sound of a dull blow and then that horrible gobbling neigh break out close to I i fire twice at the sound immediately afterward something strike I and i be knock backward i get on to my knee and shout for help at the top of my voice i hear the woman scream behind the closed door of the bedroom and be dully aware that the door be be smash from the inside and directly afterward i know that beaumont be struggle with some hideous thing near to I for a instant i hold back stupidly paralyze with funk and then blindly and in a sort of rigid chill of goose flesh i go to help he shout he name i can tell you i be nearly sick with the naked fear i have on I there come a little choke scream out of the darkness and at that i jump forward into the dark i grip a vast furry ear then something strike I another great blow knock I sick i hit back weak and blind and grip with my other hand at the incredible thing abruptly i be dimly aware of a tremendous crash behind I and a great burst of light there be other light in the passage and a noise of foot and shout my hand-grip be tear from the thing they hold i shut my eye stupidly and hear a loud yell above I and then a heavy blow like a butcher chop meat and then something fall upon I i be help to my knee by the captain and the butler on the floor lay a enormous horse-head out of which protrude a man 's trunk and leg on the wrist be fix great hoof it be the monster the captain cut something with the sword that he hold in he hand and stoop and lift off the mask for that be what it be i see the face then of the man who have wear it it be parsket he have a bad wound across the forehead where the captain 's sword have bite through the mask i look bewilderedly from he to beaumont who be sit up lean against the wall of the corridor then i stare at parsket again ` by jove ' i say at last and then i be quiet for i be so ashamed for the man you can understand can not you and he be open he eye and you know i have grow so to like he and then you know just as parsket be get back he wit and look from one to the other of we and begin to remember there happen a strange and incredible thing for from the end of the corridor there sound suddenly the clumping of a great hoof i look that way and then instantly at parsket and see a horrible fear in he face and eye he wrench himself ` round weakly and stare in mad terror up the corridor to where the sound have be and the rest of we stare in a frozen group i remember vaguely half sob and whisper from miss hisgin 's bedroom all the while that i stare frightenedly up the corridor the silence last several seconds and then abruptly there come again the clumping of the great hoof away at the end of the corridor and immediately afterward the clungk clunk -- clungk clunk of mighty hoof come down the passage toward we even then you know most of we think it be some mechanism of parsket 's still at work and we be in the queerest mixture of fright and doubt i think everyone look at parsket and suddenly the captain shout out : ` stop this damned fool at once have not you do enough ' for my part i be now frighten for i have a _ sense _ that there be something horrible and wrong and then parsket manage to gasp out : ` it be not I my god it be not I my god it be not I ' and then you know it seem to come home to everyone in a instant that there be really some dreadful thing come down the passage there be a mad rush to get away and even old captain hisgin give back with the butler and the footman beaumont faint outright as i find afterward for he have be badly maul i just flatten back against the wall kneel as i be too stupid and dazed even to run and almost in the same instant the ponderous hoof fall sound close to I and seem to shake the solid floor as they pass abruptly the great sound cease and i know in a sort of sick fashion that the thing have halt opposite to the door of the girl 's bedroom and then i be aware that parsket be stand rock in the doorway with he arm spread across so as to fill the doorway with he body parsket be extraordinarily pale and the blood be run down he face from the wound in he forehead and then i notice that he seem to be look at something in the passage with a peculiar desperate fix incredibly masterful gaze but there be really nothing to be see and suddenly the clungk clunk -- clungk clunk recommence and pass onward down the passage in the same moment parsket pitch forward out of the doorway on to he face there be shout from the huddle of man down the passage and the two footman and the butler simply run carry they lantern but the captain go against the side-wall with he back and put the lamp he be carry over he head the dull tread of the horse go past he and leave he unharmed and i hear the monstrous hoof fall go away and away through the quiet house and after that a dead silence then the captain move and come toward we very slow and shaky and with a extraordinarily gray face i creep toward parsket and the captain come to help I we turn he over and you know i know in a moment that he be dead but you can imagine what a feeling it send through I i look at the captain and suddenly he say : ` that -- that -- that -- ' and i know that he be try to tell I that parsket have stand between he daughter and whatever it be that have go down the passage i stand up and steady he though i be not very steady myself and suddenly he face begin to work and he go down on to he knee by parsket and cry like some shake child then the woman come out of the doorway of the bedroom and i turn away and leave he to they whilst i over to beaumont that be practically the whole story and the only thing that be leave to I be to try to explain some of the puzzling part here and there perhaps you have see that parsket be in love with miss hisgin and this fact be the key to a good deal that be extraordinary he be doubtless responsible for some portion of the ` haunt ' in fact i think for nearly everything but you know i can prove nothing and what i have to tell you be chiefly the result of deduction in the first place it be obvious that parsket 's intention be to frighten beaumont away and when he find that he could not do this i think he grow so desperate that he really intend to kill he i hate to say this but the fact force I to think so i be quite certain that it be parsket who break beaumont 's arm he know all the detail of the so-called ` horse legend ' and get the idea to work upon the old story for he own end he evidently have some method of slip in and out of the house probably through one of the many french window or possibly he have a key to one or two of the garden door and when he be suppose to be away he be really come down on the quiet and hide somewhere in the neighborhood the incident of the kiss in the dark hall i put down to sheer nervous imagining on the part of beaumont and miss hisgin yet i must say that the sound of the horse outside of the front door be a little difficult to explain away but i be still incline to keep to my first idea on this point that there be nothing really unnatural about it the hoof sound in the billiard room and down the passage be do by parsket from the floor below by bump up against the paneled ceiling with a block of wood tie to one of the window hook i prove this by a examination which show the dent in the woodwork the sound of the horse gallop ` round the house be possibly make also by parsket who must have have a horse tie up in the plantation nearby unless indeed he make the sound himself but i do not see how he could have go fast enough to produce the illusion in any case i do not feel perfect certainty on this point i fail to find any hoof mark as you remember the gobble neighing in the park be a ventriloquial achievement on the part of parsket and the attack out there on beaumont be also by he so that when i think he be in he bedroom he must have be outside all the time and join I after i run out of the front door this be almost probable i mean that parsket be the cause for if it have be something more serious he would certainly have give up he foolishness know that there be no longer any need for it i can not imagine how he escape be shoot both then and in the last mad action of which i have just tell you he be enormously without fear of any kind for himself as you can see the time when parsket be with we when we think we hear the horse gallop ` round the house we must have be deceive no one be very sure except of course parsket who would naturally encourage the belief the neighing in the cellar be where i consider there come the first suspicion into parsket 's mind that there be something more at work than he sham haunt the neighing be do by he in the same way that he do it in the park but when i remember how ghastly he look i feel sure that the sound must have have some infernal quality add to they which frighten the man himself yet later he would persuade himself that he have be get fanciful of course i must not forget that the effect upon miss hisgin must have make he feel pretty miserable then about the clergyman be call away we find afterward that it be a bogus errand or rather call and it be apparent that parsket be at the bottom of this so as to get a few more hour in which to achieve he end and what that be a very little imagination will show you for he have find that beaumont would not be frighten away i hate to think this but i be bind to anyway it be obvious that the man be temporarily a bit off he normal balance love 's a queer disease then there be no doubt at all but that parsket leave the cord to the butler 's bell hitch somewhere so as to give he a excuse to slip away naturally to clear it this also give he the opportunity to remove one of the passage lamp then he have only to smash the other and the passage be in utter darkness for he to make the attempt on beaumont in the same way it be he who lock the door of the bedroom and take the key -lrb- it be in he pocket -rrb- this prevent the captain from bring a light and come to the rescue but captain hisgin break down the door with the heavy fender curb and it be he smash the door that sound so confusing and frightening in the darkness of the passage the photograph of the monstrous hoof above miss hisgin in the cellar be one of the thing that i be less sure about it might have be fake by parsket whilst i be out of the room and this would have be easy enough to anyone who know how but you know it do not look like a fake yet there be as much evidence of probability that it be fake as against and the thing be too vague for a examination to help to a definite decision so that i will express no opinion one way or the other it be certainly a horrible photograph and now i come to that last dreadful thing there have be no further manifestation of anything abnormal so that there be a extraordinary uncertainty in my conclusion if we have not hear those last sound and if parsket have not show that enormous sense of fear the whole of this case could be explain in the way in which i have show and in fact as you have see i be of the opinion that almost all of it can be clear up but i see no way of go past the thing we hear at the last and the fear that parsket show he death -- no that prove nothing at the inquest it be describe somewhat untechnically as due to heart spasm that be normal enough and leave we quite in the dark as to whether he die because he stand between the girl and some incredible thing of monstrosity the look on parsket 's face and the thing he call out when he hear the great hoof sound come down the passage seem to show that he have the sudden realization of what before then may have be nothing more than a horrible suspicion and he fear and appreciation of some tremendous danger approach be probably more keenly real even than mine and then he do the one fine great thing and the cause i say what cause it carnackus shake he head god know he answer with a peculiar sincere reverence if that thing be what it seem to be one might suggest a explanation which would not offend one 's reason but which may be utterly wrong yet i have think though it would take a long lecture on thought induction to get you to appreciate my reason that parsket have produce what i might term a kind of ` induced haunting ' a kind of induce simulation of he mental conception to he desperate thought and brooding it be impossible to make it clearer in a few word but the old story i say why may not there have be something in _ that _ there may have be something in it say carnackus but i do not think it have anything to do with this i have not clearly think out my reason yet but later i may be able to tell you why i think so and the marriage and the cellar -- be there anything find there ask taylor yes the marriage be perform that day in spite of the tragedy carnackus tell we it be the wisest thing to do consider the thing that i can not explain yes i have the floor of that big cellar up for i have a feeling i might find something there to give I some light but there be nothing you know the whole thing be tremendous and extraordinary i shall never forget the look on parsket 's face and afterward the disgusting sound of those great hoof go away through the quiet house carnackus stand up out you go he say in friendly fashion use the recognize formulum and we go presently out into the quiet of the embankment and so to we home no 5 -- the searcher of the end house it be still evening as i remember and the four of we jessop arkright taylor and i look disappointedly at carnackus where he sit silent in he great chair we have come in response to the usual card of invitation which -- as you know -- we have come to consider as a sure prelude to a good story and now after tell we the short incident of the three straw platter he have lapse into a contented silence and the night not half go as i have hint however as it chance some pity fate jog carnackus 's elbow or he memory and he begin again in he queer level way : -- the ` straw platter ' business remind I of the ` searcher ' case which i have sometimes think might interest you it be some time ago in fact a deuce of a long time ago that the thing happen and my experience of what i might term ` curious ' thing be very small at that time i be live with my mother when it occur in a small house just outside of appledorn on the south coast the house be the last of a row of detach cottage villa each house standing in its own garden and very dainty little place they be very old and most of they smother in rose and all with those quaint old leaded window and door of genuine oak you must try to picture they for the sake of they complete niceness now i must remind you at the beginning that my mother and i have live in that little house for two year and in the whole of that time there have not be a single peculiar happen to worry we and then something happen it be about two o'clock one morning as i be finish some letter that i hear the door of my mother 's bedroom open and she come to the top of the stair and knock on the banister ` all right dear ' i call for i suppose she be merely remind I that i should have be in bed long ago then i hear she go back to she room and i hurry my work for fear she should lie awake until she hear I safe up to my room when i be finish i light my candle put out the lamp and go upstairs as i come opposite the door of my mother 's room i see that it be open call good night to she very softly and ask whether i should close the door as there be no answer i know that she have drop off to sleep again and i close the door very gently and turn into my room just across the passage as i do so i experience a momentary half-aware sense of a faint peculiar disagreeable odor in the passage but it be not until the follow night that i _ realize _ i have notice a smell that offend I you follow I it be so often like that -- one suddenly know a thing that really record itself on one 's consciousness perhaps a year before the next morning at breakfast i mention casually to my mother that she have ` drop off ' and i have shut the door for she to my surprise she assure I she have never be out of she room i remind she about the two rap she have give upon the banister but she still be certain i must be mistaken and in the end i tease she say she have grow so accustomed to my bad habit of sit up late that she have come to call I in she sleep of course she deny this and i let the matter drop but i be more than a little puzzle and do not know whether to believe my own explanation or to take the mater 's which be to put the noise down to the mouse and the open door to the fact that she could not have properly latch it when she go to bed i suppose away in the subconscious part of I i have a stir of less reasonable thought but certainly i have no real uneasiness at that time the next night there come a further development about two thirty be i hear my mother 's door open just as on the previous night and immediately afterward she rap sharply on the banister as it seem to I i stop my work and call up that i would not be long as she make no reply and i do not hear she go back to bed i have a quick sense of wonder whether she might not be do it in she sleep after all just as i have say with the thought i stand up and take the lamp from the table begin to go toward the door which be open into the passage it be then i get a sudden nasty sort of thrill for it come to I all at once that my mother never knock when i sit up too late she always call you will understand i be not really frighten in any way only vaguely uneasy and pretty sure she must really be do the thing in she sleep i go quickly up the stair and when i come to the top my mother be not there but she door be open i have a bewildered sense though believe she must have go quietly back to bed without my hear she i enter she room and find she sleeping quietly and naturally for the vague sense of trouble in I be sufficiently strong to make I go over to look at she when i be sure that she be perfectly right in every way i be still a little bother but much more inclined to think my suspicion correct and that she have go quietly back to bed in she sleep without know what she have be do this be the most reasonable thing to think as you must see and then it come to I suddenly that vague queer mildewy smell in the room and it be in that instant i become aware i have smell the same strange uncertain smell the night before in the passage i be definitely uneasy now and begin to search my mother 's room though with no aim or clear thought of anything except to assure myself that there be nothing in the room all the time you know i never _ expect really _ to find anything only my uneasiness have to be assure in the middle of my search my mother wake up and of course i have to explain i tell she about she door opening and the knock on the banister and that i have come up and find she asleep i say nothing about the smell which be not very distinct but tell she that the thing happen twice have make I a bit nervous and possibly fanciful and i think i would take a look ` round just to feel satisfied i have think since that the reason i make no mention of the smell be not only that i do not want to frighten my mother for i be scarcely that myself but because i have only a vague half-knowledge that i associate the smell with fancy too indefinite and peculiar to bear talk about you will understand that i be able _ now _ to analyze and put the thing into word but _ then _ i do not even know my chief reason for say nothing let alone appreciate its possible significance it be my mother after all who put part of my vague sensation into word : -- ` what a disagreeable smell ' she exclaim and be silent a moment look at I then : -- ` you feel there be something wrong ' still look at I very quietly but with a little nervous note of question expectancy ' i do not know ' i say ' i can not understand it unless you have really be walk about in you sleep ' ` the smell ' she say ` yes ' i reply ` that be what puzzle I too i 'll take a walk through the house but i do not suppose it be anything ' i light she candle and take the lamp i go through the other bedroom and afterward all over the house include the three underground cellar which be a little try to the nerve see that i be more nervous than i would admit then i go back to my mother and tell she there be really nothing to bother about and you know in the end we talk ourselves into believe it be nothing my mother would not agree that she might have be sleepwalk but she be ready to put the door open down to the fault of the latch which certainly snick very lightly as for the knock they might be the old warped woodwork of the house crack a bit or a mouse rattle a piece of loose plaster the smell be more difficult to explain but finally we agree that it might easily be the queer night smell of the moist earth come in through the open window of my mother 's room from the back garden or -- for that matter -- from the little churchyard beyond the big wall at the bottom of the garden and so we quieten down and finally i go to bed and to sleep i think this be certainly a lesson on the way we human can delude ourselves for there be not one of these explanation that my reason could really accept try to imagine yourself in the same circumstance and you will see how absurd we attempt to explain the happening really be in the morning when i come down to breakfast we talk it all over again and whilst we agree that it be strange we also agree that we have begin to imagine funny thing in the back of we mind which now we feel half ashamed to admit this be very strange when you come to look into it but very human and then that night again my mother 's door be slam once more just after midnight i catch up the lamp and when i reach she door i find it shut i open it quickly and go in to find my mother lie with she eye open and rather nervous have be wake by the bang of the door but what upset I more than anything be the fact that there be a disgusting smell in the passage and in she room whilst i be ask she whether she be all right a door slam twice downstairs and you can imagine how it make I feel my mother and i look at one another and then i light she candle and take the poker from the fender go downstairs with the lamp begin to feel really nervous the cumulative effect of so many queer happening be get hold of I and all the _ apparently _ reasonable explanation seem futile the horrible smell seem to be very strong in the downstairs passage also in the front room and the cellar but chiefly in the passage i make a very thorough search of the house and when i have finish i know that all the lower window and door be properly shut and fasten and that there be no living thing in the house beyond we two self then i go up to my mother 's room again and we talk the thing over for a hour or more and in the end come to the conclusion that we might after all be read too much into a number of little thing but you know inside of we we do not believe this later when we have talk ourselves into a more comfortable state of mind i say good night and go off to bed and presently manage to get to sleep in the early hour of the morning whilst it be still dark i be wake by a loud noise i sit up in bed and listen and from downstairs i hear : -- bang bang bang one door after another be slam at least that be the impression the sound give to I i jump out of bed with the tingle and shiver of sudden fright on I and at the same moment as i light my candle my door be push slowly open i have leave it unlatched so as not to feel that my mother be quite shut off from I ` who be there ' i shout out in a voice twice as deep as my natural one and with a queer breathlessness that sudden fright so often give one ` who be there ' then i hear my mother say : -- ` it be I thomas whatever be happen downstairs ' she be in the room by this and i see she have she bedroom poker in one hand and she candle in the other i could have smile at she have it not be for the extraordinary sound downstairs i get into my slipper and reach down a old sword bayonet from the wall then i pick up my candle and beg my mother not to come but i know it would be little use if she have make up she mind and she have with the result that she act as a sort of rearguard for I during we search i know in some way i be very glad to have she with I as you will understand by this time the door slamming have cease and there seem probably because of the contrast to be a appalling silence in the house however i lead the way hold my candle high and keep the sword bayonet very handy downstairs we find all the door wide open although the outer door and the window be close all right i begin to wonder whether the noise have be make by the door after all of one thing only be we sure and that be there be no living thing in the house beside ourselves while everywhere throughout the house there be the taint of that disgusting odor of course it be absurd to try to make believe any longer there be something strange about the house and as soon as it be daylight i set my mother to packing and soon after breakfast i see she off by train then i set to work to try to clear up the mystery i go first to the landlord and tell he all the circumstance from he i find that twelve or fifteen year back the house have get rather a curious name from three or four tenant with the result that it have remain empty a long while in the end he have let it at a low rent to a captain tobia on the one condition that he should hold he tongue if he see anything peculiar the landlord 's idea -- as he tell I frankly -- be to free the house from these tale of ` something queer ' by keep a tenant in it and then to sell it for the best price he could get however when captain tobia leave after a ten year ' tenancy there be no longer any talk about the house so when i offer to take it on a five year ' lease he have jump at the offer this be the whole story so he give I to understand when i press he for detail of the suppose peculiar happening in the house all those year back he say the tenant have talk about a woman who always move about the house at night some tenant never see anything but other would not stay out the first month 's tenancy one thing the landlord be particular to point out that no tenant have ever complain about knocking or door slamming as for the smell he seem positively indignant about it but why i do not suppose he know himself except that he probably have some vague feeling that it be a indirect accusation on my part that the drain be not right in the end i suggest that he should come down and spend the night with I he agree at once especially as i tell he i intend to keep the whole business quiet and try to get to the bottom of the curious affair for he be anxious to keep the rumor of the haunting from get about about three o'clock that afternoon he come down and we make a thorough search of the house which however reveal nothing unusual afterward the landlord make one or two test which show he the drainage be in perfect order after that we make we preparation for sit up all night first we borrow two policeman 's dark lantern from the station nearby and where the superintendent and i be friendly and as soon as it be really dusk the landlord go up to he house for he gun i have the sword bayonet i have tell you about and when the landlord get back we sit talk in my study until nearly midnight then we light the lantern and go upstairs we place the lantern gun and bayonet handy on the table then i shut and seal the bedroom door afterward we take we seat and turn off the light from then until two o'clock nothing happen but a little after two as i find by hold my watch near the faint glow of the closed lantern i have a time of extraordinary nervousness and i bent toward the landlord and whisper to he that i have a queer feeling something be about to happen and to be ready with he lantern at the same time i reach out toward mine in the very instant i make this movement the darkness which fill the passage seem to become suddenly of a dull violet color not as if a light have be shine but as if the natural blackness of the night have change color and then come through this violet night through this violet-colored gloom come a little naked child run in a extraordinary way the child seem not to be distinct from the surround gloom but almost as if it be a concentration of that extraordinary atmosphere as if that gloomy color which have change the night come from the child it seem impossible to make clear to you but try to understand it the child go past I run with the natural movement of the leg of a chubby human child but in a absolute and inconceivable silence it be a very small child and must have pass under the table but i see the child through the table as if it have be only a slightly darker shadow than the color gloom in the same instant i see that a fluctuate glimmer of violet light outline the metal of the gun-barrel and the blade of the sword bayonet make they seem like faint shape of glimmer light float unsupported where the tabletop should have show solid now curiously as i see these thing i be subconsciously aware that i hear the anxious breathing of the landlord quite clear and labor close to my elbow where he wait nervously with he hand on the lantern i realize in that moment that he see nothing but wait in the darkness for my warn to come true even as i take heed of these minor thing i see the child jump to one side and hide behind some half-seen object that be certainly nothing belong to the passage i stare intently with a most extraordinary thrill of expectant wonder with fright make goose flesh of my back and even as i stare i solve for myself the less important problem of what the two black cloud be that hung over a part of the table i think it very curious and interesting the double working of the mind often so much more apparent during time of stress the two cloud come from two faintly shine shape which i know must be the metal of the lantern and the thing that look black to the sight with which i be then see could be nothing else but what to normal human sight be know as light this phenomenon i have always remembered i have twice see a somewhat similar thing in the dark light case and in that trouble of maetheson 's which you know about even as i understand this matter of the light i be look to my leave to understand why the child be hide and suddenly i hear the landlord shout out : -- ` the woman ' but i see nothing i have a disagreeable sense that something repugnant be near to I and i be aware in the same moment that the landlord be grip my arm in a hard frightened grip then i be look back to where the child have hide i see the child peep out from behind its hiding place seem to be look up the passage but whether in fear i could not tell then it come out and run headlong away through the place where should have be the wall of my mother 's bedroom but the sense with which i be see these thing show I the wall only as a vague upright shadow unsubstantial and immediately the child be lose to I in the dull violet gloom at the same time i feel the landlord press back against I as if something have pass close to he and he call out again a hoarse sort of cry : -- ` the woman the woman ' and turn the shade clumsily from off he lantern but i have see no woman and the passage show empty as he shine the beam of he light jerkily to and fro but chiefly in the direction of the doorway of my mother 's room he be still clutch my arm and have rise to he foot and now mechanically and almost slowly i pick up my lantern and turn on the light i shone it a little dazedly at the seal upon the door but none be break then i send the light to and fro up and down the passage but there be nothing and i turn to the landlord who be say something in a rather incoherent fashion as my light pass over he face i note in a dull sort of way that he be drench with sweat then my wit become more handleable and i begin to catch the drift of he word : -- ` do you see she do you see she ' he be say over and over again and then i find myself tell he in quite a level voice that i have not see any woman he become more coherent then and i find that he have see a woman come from the end of the passage and go past we but he could not describe she except that she keep stop and look about she and have even peer at the wall close beside he as if look for something but what seem to trouble he most be that she have not seem to see he at all he repeat this so often that in the end i tell he in a absurd sort of way that he ought to be very glad she have not what do it all mean be the question somehow i be not so frightened as utterly bewildered i have see less then than since but what i have see have make I feel adrift from my anchorage of reason what do it mean he have see a woman search for something _ i _ have not see this woman _ i _ have see a child run away and hide from something or someone _ he _ have not see the child or the other thing -- only the woman and _ i _ have not see she what do it all mean i have say nothing to the landlord about the child i have be too bewildered and i realize that it would be futile to attempt a explanation he be already stupid with the thing he have see and not the kind of man to understand all this go through my mind as we stand there shine the lantern to and fro all the time intermingled with a streak of practical reasoning i be question myself what do it all mean what be the woman search for what be the child run from suddenly as i stand there bewilder and nervous make random answer to the landlord a door below be violently slam and directly i catch the horrible reek of which i have tell you ` there ' i say to the landlord and catch he arm in my turn ` the smell do _ you _ smell it ' he look at I so stupidly that in a sort of nervous anger i shake he ` yes ' he say in a queer voice try to shine the light from he shake lantern at the stair head ` come on ' i say and pick up my bayonet and he come carry he gun awkwardly i think he come more because he be afraid to be leave alone than because he have any pluck left poor beggar i never sneer at that kind of funk at least very seldom for when it take hold of you it make rag of you courage i lead the way downstairs shine my light into the lower passage and afterward at the door to see whether they be shut for i have close and latch they place a corner of a mat against each door so i should know which have be open i see at once that none of the door have be open then i throw the beam of my light down alongside the stairway in order to see the mat i have place against the door at the top of the cellar stair i get a horrid thrill for the mat be flat i pause a couple of seconds shine my light to and fro in the passage and hold fast to my courage i go down the stair as i come to the bottom step i see patch of wet all up and down the passage i shone my lantern on they it be the imprint of a wet foot on the oilcloth of the passage not a ordinary footprint but a queer soft flabby spreading imprint that give I a feeling of extraordinary horror backward and forward i flash the light over the impossible mark and see they everywhere suddenly i notice that they lead to each of the closed door i feel something touch my back and glance ` round swiftly to find the landlord have come close to I almost press against I in he fear ` it be all right ' i say but in a rather breathless whisper mean to put a little courage into he for i could feel that he be shake through all he body even then as i try to get he steady enough to be of some use he gun go off with a tremendous bang he jump and yell with sheer terror and i swear because of the shock ` give it to I for god 's sake ' i say and slip the gun from he hand and in the same instant there be a sound of run step up the garden path and immediately the flash of a bull 's - eye lantern upon the fan light over the front door then the door be try and directly afterward there come a thunderous knock which tell I a policeman have hear the shot i go to the door and open it fortunately the constable know I and when i have beckon he in i be able to explain matter in a very short time while do this inspector johnstone come up the path have miss the officer and see light and the open door i tell he as briefly as possible what have occur and do not mention the child or the woman for it would have seem too fantastic for he to notice i show he the queer wet footprint and how they go toward the closed door i explain quickly about the mat and how that the one against the cellar door be flat which show the door have be open the inspector nod and tell the constable to guard the door at the top of the cellar stair he then ask the hall lamp to be light after which he take the policeman 's lantern and lead the way into the front room he pause with the door wide open and throw the light all ` round then he jump into the room and look behind the door there be no one there but all over the polished oak floor between the scatter rug go the mark of those horrible spreading footprint and the room permeate with the horrible odor the inspector search the room carefully and then go into the middle room use the same precaution there be nothing in the middle room or in the kitchen or pantry but everywhere go the wet footmark through all the room show plainly wherever there be woodwork or oilcloth and always there be the smell the inspector cease from he search of the room and spend a minute in try whether the mat would really fall flat when the door be open or merely ruckle up in a way as to appear they have be untouched but in each case the mat fall flat and remain so ` extraordinary ' i hear johnstone mutter to himself and then he go toward the cellar door he have inquire at first whether there be window to the cellar and when he learn there be no way out except by the door he have leave this part of the search to the last as johnstone come up to the door the policeman make a motion of salute and say something in a low voice and something in the tone make I flick my light across he i see then that the man be very white and he look strange and bewildered ` what ' say johnstone impatiently ` speak up ' ' a woman come along ` ere sir and go through this ` ere door ' say the constable clearly but with a curious monotonous intonation that be sometimes hear from a unintelligent man ` speak up ' shout the inspector ' a woman come along and go through this ` ere door ' repeat the man monotonously the inspector catch the man by the shoulder and deliberately sniff he breath ` no ' he say and then sarcastically : -- ' i hope you hold the door open politely for the lady ' ` the door be not open sir ' say the man simply ` be you mad -- ' begin johnstone ` no ' break in the landlord 's voice from the back speaking steadily enough ' i see the woman upstairs ' it be evident that he have get back he control again ` i be afraid inspector johnstone ' i say ` that there be more in this than you think i certainly see some very extraordinary thing upstairs ' the inspector seem about to say something but instead he turn again to the door and flash he light down and ` round about the mat i see then that the strange horrible footmark come straight up to the cellar door and the last print show _ under _ the door yet the policeman say the door have not be open and suddenly without any intention or realization of what i be say i ask the landlord : -- ` what be the foot like ' i receive no answer for the inspector be order the constable to open the cellar door and the man be not obey johnstone repeat the order and at last in a queer automatic way the man obey and push the door open the loathsome smell beat up at we in a great wave of horror and the inspector come backward a step ` my god ' he say and go forward again and shine he light down the step but there be nothing visible only that on each step show the unnatural footprint the inspector bring the beam of the light vividly on the top step and there clear in the light there be something small move the inspector bent to look and the policeman and i with he i do not want to disgust you but the thing we look at be a maggot the policeman back suddenly out of the doorway : ` the churchyard ' he say ' at the back of the ` ouse ' ` silence ' say johnstone with a queer break in the word and i know that at last he be frighten he put he lantern into the doorway and shine it from step to step follow the footprint down into the darkness then he step back from the open doorway and we all give back with he he look ` round and i have a feeling that he be look for a weapon of some kind ` you gun ' i say to the landlord and he bring it from the front hall and pass it over to the inspector who take it and eject the empty shell from the right barrel he hold out he hand for a live cartridge which the landlord bring from he pocket he load the gun and snap the breech he turn to the constable : -- ` come on ' he say and move toward the cellar doorway ' i be not comin ' sir ' say the policeman very white in the face with a sudden blaze of passion the inspector take the man by the scruff and heave he bodily down into the darkness and he go downward scream the inspector follow he instantly with he lantern and the gun and i after the inspector with the bayonet ready behind I i hear the landlord at the bottom of the stair the inspector be help the policeman to he foot where he stand sway a moment in a bewildered fashion then the inspector go into the front cellar and he man follow he in stupid fashion but evidently no longer with any thought of run away from the horror we all crowd into the front cellar flash we light to and fro inspector johnstone be examine the floor and i see that the footmark go all ` round the cellar into all the corner and across the floor i think suddenly of the child that be run away from something do you see the thing that i be see vaguely we go out of the cellar in a body for there be nothing to be find in the next cellar the footprint go everywhere in that queer erratic fashion as of someone search for something or follow some blind scent in the third cellar the print end at the shallow well that have be the old water supply of the house the well be full to the brim and the water so clear that the pebbly bottom be plainly to be see as we shine the light into the water the search come to a abrupt end and we stand about the well look at one another in a absolute horrible silence johnstone make another examination of the footprint then he shine he light again into the clear shallow water search each inch of the plainly see bottom but there be nothing there the cellar be full of the dreadful smell and everyone stand silent except for the constant turning of the lamp to and fro around the cellar the inspector look up from he search of the well and nod quietly across at I with he sudden acknowledgment that we belief be now he belief the smell in the cellar seem to grow more dreadful and to be as it be a menace -- the material expression that some monstrous thing be there with we invisible ' i think -- ' begin the inspector and shine he light toward the stairway and at this the constable 's restraint go utterly and he run for the stair make a queer sound in he throat the landlord follow at a quick walk and then the inspector and i he wait a single instant for I and we go up together tread on the same step and with we light hold backward at the top i slam and lock the stair door and wipe my forehead and my hand be shake the inspector ask I to give he man a glass of whisky and then he send he on he beat he stay a short while with the landlord and I and it be arrange that he would join we again the follow night and watch the well with we from midnight until daylight then he leave we just as the dawn be come in the landlord and i lock up the house and go over to he place for a sleep in the afternoon the landlord and i return to the house to make arrangement for the night he be very quiet and i feel he be to be rely on now that he have be ` salt ' as it be with he fright of the previous night we open all the door and window and blow the house through very thoroughly and in the meanwhile we light the lamp in the house and take they into the cellar where we set they all about so as to have light everywhere then we carry down three chair and a table and set they in the cellar where the well be sink after that we stretch thin piano wire across the cellar about nine inch from the floor at such a height that it should catch anything move about in the dark when this be do i go through the house with the landlord and seal every window and door in the place except only the front door and the door at the top of the cellar stair meanwhile a local wire-smith be make something to my order and when the landlord and i have finish tea at he house we go down to see how the smith be get on we find the thing complete it look rather like a huge parrot 's cage without any bottom of very heavy gage wire and stand about seven foot high and be four foot in diameter fortunately i remember to have it make longitudinally in two half or else we should never have get it through the doorway and down the cellar stair i tell the wire-smith to bring the cage up to the house so he could fit the two half rigidly together as we return i call in at a ironmonger 's where i buy some thin hemp rope and a iron rack pulley like those use in lancashire for haul up the ceiling clothes rack which you will find in every cottage i buy also a couple of pitchfork ` we sha not want to touch it i say to the landlord and he nod rather white all at once as soon as the cage arrive and have be fit together in the cellar i send away the smith and the landlord and i suspend it over the well into which it fit easily after a lot of trouble we manage to hang it so perfectly central from the rope over the iron pulley that when hoist to the ceiling and drop it go every time plunk into the well like a candle-extinguisher when we have it finally arrange i hoist it up once more to the ready position and make the rope fast to a heavy wooden pillar which stand in the middle of the cellar by ten o'clock i have everything arrange with the two pitchfork and the two police lantern also some whisky and sandwich underneath the table i have several bucket full of disinfectant a little after eleven o'clock there be a knock at the front door and when i go i find inspector johnstone have arrive and bring with he one of he plainclothes man you will understand how pleased i be to see there would be this addition to we watch for he look a tough nerveless man brainy and collect and one i should have pick to help we with the horrible job i feel pretty sure we should have to do that night when the inspector and the detective have enter i shut and lock the front door then while the inspector hold the light i seal the door carefully with tape and wax at the head of the cellar stair i shut and lock that door also and seal it in the same way as we enter the cellar i warn johnstone and he man to be careful not to fall over the wire and then as i see he surprise at my arrangement i begin to explain my idea and intention to all of which he listen with strong approval i be please to see also that the detective be nod he head as i talk in a way that show he appreciate all my precaution as he put he lantern down the inspector pick up one of the pitchfork and balanced it in he hand he look at I and nod ` the best thing ' he say ' i only wish you would get two more ' then we all take we seat the detective get a wash stool from the corner of the cellar from then until a quarter to twelve we talk quietly whilst we make a light supper of whisky and sandwich after which we clear everything off the table except the lantern and the pitchfork one of the latter i hand to the inspector the other i take myself and then have set my chair so as to be handy to the rope which lower the cage into the well i go ` round the cellar and put out every lamp i groped my way to my chair and arrange the pitchfork and the dark lantern ready to my hand after which i suggest that everyone should keep a absolute silence throughout the watch i ask also that no lantern should be turn on until i give the word i put my watch on the table where a faint glow from my lantern make I able to see the time for a hour nothing happen and everyone keep a absolute silence except for a occasional uneasy movement about half-past one however i be conscious again of the same extraordinary and peculiar nervousness which i have feel on the previous night i put my hand out quickly and ease the hitch rope from around the pillar the inspector seem aware of the movement for i see the faint light from he lantern move a little as if he have suddenly take hold of it in readiness a minute later i notice there be a change in the color of the night in the cellar and it grow slowly violet tint upon my eye i glance to and fro quickly in the new darkness and even as i look i be conscious that the violet color deepen in the direction of the well but seem to be at a great distance there be as it be a nucleus to the change and the nucleus come swiftly toward we appear to come from a great space almost in a single moment it come near and i see again that it be a little naked child run and seem to be of the violet night in which it run the child come with a natural run movement exactly as i describe it before but in a silence so peculiarly intense that it be as if it bring the silence with it about half-way between the well and the table the child turn swiftly and look back at something invisible to I and suddenly it go down into a crouching attitude and seem to be hide behind something that show vaguely but there be nothing there except the bare floor of the cellar nothing i mean of we world i could hear the breathing of the three other man with a wonderful distinctness and also the tick of my watch upon the table seem to sound as loud and as slow as the tick of a old grandfather 's clock someway i know that none of the other see what i be see abruptly the landlord who be next to I let out he breath with a little hissing sound i know then that something be visible to he there come a creak from the table and i have a feeling that the inspector be lean forward look at something that i could not see the landlord reach out he hand through the darkness and fumble a moment to catch my arm : -- ` the woman ' he whisper close to my ear ` over by the well ' i stare hard in that direction but see nothing except that the violet color of the cellar seem a little duller just there i look back quickly to the vague place where the child be hide i see it be peer back from its hiding place suddenly it rise and run straight for the middle of the table which show only as vague shadow half-way between my eye and the unseen floor as the child run under the table the steel prong of my pitchfork glimmer with a violet fluctuate light a little way off there show high up in the gloom the vaguely shine outline of the other fork so i know the inspector have it raise in he hand ready there be no doubt but that he see something on the table the metal of the five lantern shine with the same strange glow and about each lantern there be a little cloud of absolute blackness where the phenomenon that be light to we natural eye come through the fitting and in this complete darkness the metal of each lantern show plain as might a cat 's - eye in a nest of black cotton wool just beyond the table the child pause again and stand seem to oscillate a little upon its foot which give the impression that it be lighter and vaguer than a thistle-down and yet in the same moment another part of I seem to know that it be to I as something that might be beyond thick invisible glass and subject to condition and force that i be unable to comprehend the child be look back again and my gaze go the same way i stare across the cellar and see the cage hang clear in the violet light every wire and tie outline with its glimmer above it there be a little space of gloom and then the dull shine of the iron pulley which i have screw into the ceiling i stare in a bewildered way ` round the cellar there be thin line of vague fire cross the floor in all direction and suddenly i remember the piano wire that the landlord and i have stretch but there be nothing else to be see except that near the table there be indistinct glimmering of light and at the far end the outline of a dull glowing revolver evidently in the detective 's pocket i remember a sort of subconscious satisfaction as i settle the point in a queer automatic fashion on the table near to I there be a little shapeless collection of the light and this i know after a instant 's consideration to be the steel portion of my watch i have look several time at the child and ` round at the cellar whilst i be decide these trifle and have find it still in that attitude of hide from something but now suddenly it run clear away into the distance and be nothing more than a slightly deeper color nucleus far away in the strange color atmosphere the landlord give out a queer little cry and twist over against I as if to avoid something from the inspector there come a sharp breathing sound as if he have be suddenly drench with cold water then suddenly the violet color go out of the night and i be conscious of the nearness of something monstrous and repugnant there be a tense silence and the blackness of the cellar seem absolute with only the faint glow about each of the lantern on the table then in the darkness and the silence there come a faint tinkle of water from the well as if something be rise noiselessly out of it and the water run back with a gentle tinkling in the same instant there come to I a sudden waft of the awful smell i give a sharp cry of warn to the inspector and loose the rope there come instantly the sharp splash of the cage enter the water and then with a stiff frightened movement i open the shutter of my lantern and shine the light at the cage shout to the other to do the same as my light strike the cage i see that about two foot of it project from the top of the well and there be something protrude up out of the water into the cage i stare with a feeling that i recognize the thing and then as the other lantern be open i see that it be a leg of mutton the thing be hold by a brawny fist and arm that rise out of the water i stand utterly bewildered watch to see what be come in a moment there rise into view a great bearded face that i feel for one quick instant be the face of a drowned man long dead then the face open at the mouth part and splutter and cough another big hand come into view and wipe the water from the eye which blink rapidly and then fix themselves into a stare at the light from the detective there come a sudden shout : -- ` captain tobia ' he shout and the inspector echo he and instantly burst into loud roar of laughter the inspector and the detective run across the cellar to the cage and i follow still bewilder the man in the cage be hold the leg of mutton as far away from he as possible and hold he nose ` lift thig dam trap quig ' he shout in a stifled voice but the inspector and the detective simply double before he and try to hold they nose whilst they laugh and the light from they lantern go dance all over the place ` quig quig ' say the man in the cage still hold he nose and try to speak plainly then johnstone and the detective stop laugh and lift the cage the man in the well throw the leg across the cellar and turn swiftly to go down into the well but the officer be too quick for he and have he out in a twinkling whilst they hold he drip upon the floor the inspector jerk he thumb in the direction of the offend leg and the landlord have harpoon it with one of the pitchfork run with it upstairs and so into the open air meanwhile i have give the man from the well a stiff tot of whisky for which he thank I with a cheerful nod and have empty the glass at a draft hold he hand for the bottle which he finish as if it have be so much water as you will remember it be a captain tobia who have be the previous tenant and this be the very man who have appear from the well in the course of the talk that follow i learn the reason for captain tobia leave the house he have be want by the police for smuggling he have undergo imprisonment and have be release only a couple of week earlier he have return to find new tenant in he old home he have enter the house through the well the wall of which be not continue to the bottom -lrb- this i will deal with later -rrb- and go up by a little stairway in the cellar wall which open at the top through a panel beside my mother 's bedroom this panel be open by revolve the left doorpost of the bedroom door with the result that the bedroom door always become unlatched in the process of open the panel the captain complain without any bitterness that the panel have warped and that each time he open it it make a crack noise this have be evidently what i mistook for rap he would not give he reason for enter the house but it be pretty obvious that he have hide something which he want to get however as he find it impossible to get into the house without the risk of be catch he decide to try to drive we out rely on the bad reputation of the house and he own artistic effort as a ghost i must say he succeed he intend then to rent the house again as before and would then of course have plenty of time to get whatever he have hide the house suit he admirably for there be a passage -- as he show I afterward -- connect the dummy well with the crypt of the church beyond the garden wall and these in turn be connect with certain cave in the cliff which go down to the beach beyond the church in the course of he talk captain tobia offer to take the house off my hand and as this suit I perfectly for i be about stall with it and the plan also suit the landlord it be decide that no step should be take against he and that the whole business should be hush up i ask the captain whether there be really anything queer about the house whether he have ever see anything he say yes that he have twice see a woman go about the house we all look at one another when the captain say that he tell we she never bother he and that he have only see she twice and on each occasion it have follow a narrow escape from the revenue people captain tobia be a observant man he have see how i have place the mat against the door and after enter the room and walk all about they so as to leave the foot-mark of a old pair of wet woollen slipper everywhere he have deliberately put the mat back as he find they the maggot which have drop from he disgusting leg of mutton have be a accident and beyond even he horrible planning he be hugely delighted to learn how it have affect we the moldy smell i have notice be from the little closed stairway when the captain open the panel the door slamming be also another of he contribution i come now to the end of the captain 's ghost play and to the difficulty of try to explain the other peculiar thing in the first place it be obvious there be something genuinely strange in the house which make itself manifest as a woman many different people have see this woman under differ circumstance so it be impossible to put the thing down to fancy at the same time it must seem extraordinary that i should have live two year in the house and see nothing whilst the policeman see the woman before he have be there twenty minute the landlord the detective and the inspector all see she i can only surmise that _ fear _ be in every case the key as i might say which open the sens to the presence of the woman the policeman be a highly-strung man and when he become frightened be able to see the woman the same reasoning apply all ` round _ i _ saw nothing until i become really frightened then i see not the woman but a child run away from something or someone however i will touch on that later in short until a very strong degree of fear be present no one be affect by the force which make itself evident as a woman my theory explain why some tenant be never aware of anything strange in the house whilst other leave immediately the more sensitive they be the less would be the degree of fear necessary to make they aware of the force present in the house the peculiar shine of all the metal object in the cellar have be visible only to I the cause naturally i do not know neither do i know why i alone be able to see the shine the child i ask can you explain that part at all why _ you _ do not see the woman and why _ they _ do not see the child be it merely the same force appear differently to different people no say carnackus i can not explain that but i be quite sure that the woman and the child be not only two complete and different entity but even they be each not in quite the same plane of existence to give you a root idea however it be hold in the sigsand m that a child ' _ still_born ' be ` snatych back bye thee hagg ' this be crude but may yet contain a elemental truth yet before i make this clearer let I tell you a thought that have often be make it may be that physical birth be but a secondary process and that prior to the possibility the mother spirit search for until it find the small element -- the primal ego or child 's soul it may be that a certain waywardness would cause such to strive to evade capture by the mother spirit it may have be such a thing as this that i see i have always try to think so but it be impossible to ignore the sense of repulsion that i feel when the unseen woman go past I this repulsion carry forward the idea suggest in the sigsand m that a stillborn child be thus because its ego or spirit have be snatch back by the ` hag ' in other word by certain of the monstrosity of the outer circle the thought be inconceivably terrible and probably the more so because it be so fragmentary it leave we with the conception of a child 's soul adrift half-way between two life and run through eternity from something incredible and inconceivable -lrb- because not understand -rrb- to we sens the thing be beyond further discussion for it be futile to attempt to discuss a thing to any purpose of which one have a knowledge so fragmentary as this there be one thought which be often mine perhaps there be a mother spirit -- and the well say arkwright how do the captain get in from the other side as i say before answer carnackus the side wall of the well do not reach to the bottom so that you have only to dip down into the water and come up again on the other side of the wall under the cellar floor and so climb into the passage of course the water be the same height on both side of the wall do not ask I who make the well entrance or the little stairway for i do not know the house be very old as i have tell you and that sort of thing be useful in the old day and the child i say come back to the thing which chiefly interested I you would say that the birth must have occur in that house and in this way one might suppose that the house to have become _ en rapport _ if i can use the word in that way with the force that produce the tragedy yes reply carnackus this be suppose we take the suggestion of the sigsand m to account for the phenomenon there may be other house -- i begin there be say carnackus and stand up out you go he say genially use the recognize formulum and in five minute we be on the embankment go thoughtfully to we various home no 6 -- the thing invisible carnackus have just return to cheyne walk chelsea i be aware of this interesting fact by reason of the curt and quaintly word postcard which i be reread and by which i be request to present myself at he house not later than seven o'clock on that evening mr carnackus have as i and the other of he strictly limited circle of friend know be away in kent for the past three week but beyond that we have no knowledge carnackus be genially secretive and curt and speak only when he be ready to speak when this stage arrive i and he three other friend -- jessop arkright and taylor -- would receive a card or a wire ask we to call not one of we ever willingly miss for after a thoroughly sensible little dinner carnackus would snuggle down into he big armchair light he pipe and wait whilst we arrange ourselves comfortably in we accustomed seat and nook then he would begin to talk upon this particular night i be the first to arrive and find carnackus sit quietly smoking over a paper he stand up shake I firmly by the hand point to a chair and sit down again never have utter a word for my part i say nothing either i know the man too well to bother he with question or the weather and so take a seat and a cigarette presently the three other turn up and after that we spend a comfortable and busy hour at dinner dinner over carnackus snug himself down into he great chair as i have say be he habit fill he pipe and puff for awhile he gaze direct thoughtfully at the fire the rest of we if i may so express it make ourselves cozy each after he own particular manner a minute or so later carnackus begin to speak ignore any preliminary remark and go straight to the subject of the story we know he have to tell : i have just come back from sir alfred jarnock 's place at burtontree in south kent he begin without remove he gaze from the fire most extraordinary thing have be happen down there lately and mr george jarnock the eldest son wire to ask I to run over and see whether i could help to clear matter up a bit i go when i get there i find that they have a old chapel attach to the castle which have have quite a distinguished reputation for be what be popularly term ` haunt ' they have be rather proud of this as i manage to discover until quite lately when something very disagreeable occur which serve to remind they that family ghost be not always content as i might say to remain purely ornamental it sound almost laughable i know to hear of a long-respected supernatural phenomenon grow unexpectedly dangerous and in this case the tale of the haunting be consider as little more than a old myth except after nightfall when possibly it become more plausible seem but however this may be there be no doubt at all but that what i might term the haunting essence which live in the place have become suddenly dangerous -- deadly dangerous too the old butler be nearly stab to death one night in the chapel with a peculiar old dagger it be in fact this dagger which be popularly suppose to ` haunt ' the chapel at least there have be always a story hand down in the family that this dagger would attack any enemy who should dare to venture into the chapel after nightfall but of course this have be take with just about the same amount of seriousness that people take most ghost tale and that be not usually of a worryingly _ real _ nature i mean that most people never quite know how much or how little they believe of matter ab-human or ab-normal and generally they never have a opportunity to learn and indeed as you be all aware i be as big a skeptic concern the truth of ghost tale as any man you be likely to meet only i be what i might term a unprejudiced skeptic i be not give to either believe or disbelieve thing ` on principle ' as i have find many idiot prone to be and what be more some of they not ashamed to boast of the insane fact i view all report ` haunting ' as unproven until i have examine into they and i be bind to admit that ninety-nine case in a hundred turn out to be sheer bosh and fancy but the hundredth well if it be not for the hundredth i should have few story to tell you -- eh of course after the attack on the butler it become evident that there be at least ` something ' in the old story concern the dagger and i find everyone in a half belief that the queer old weapon do really strike the butler either by the aid of some inherent force which i find they peculiarly unable to explain or else in the hand of some invisible thing or monster of the outer world from considerable experience i know that it be much more likely that the butler have be ` knife ' by some vicious and quite material human naturally the first thing to do be to test this probability of human agency and i set to work to make a pretty drastic examination of the people who know most about the tragedy the result of this examination both pleased and surprised I for it leave I with very good reason for belief that i have come upon one of those extraordinary rare ` true manifestation ' of the extrusion of a force from the outside in more popular phraseology -- a genuine case of haunt these be the fact : on the previous Sunday evening but one sir alfr jarnock 's household have attend family service as usual in the chapel you see the rector go over to officiate twice each Sunday after conclude he duty at the public church about three mile away at the end of the service in the chapel sir alfr jarnock he son mr george jarnock and the rector have stand for a couple of minute talk whilst old bellett the butler go ` round put out the candle suddenly the rector remember that he have leave he small prayer book on the communion table in the morning he turn and ask the butler to get it for he before he blow out the chancel candle now i have particularly call you attention to this because it be important in that it provide witness in a most fortunate manner at a extraordinary moment you see the rector 's turn to speak to bellett have naturally cause both sir alfred jarnock and he son to glance in the direction of the butler and it be at this identical instant and whilst all three be look at he that the old butler be stab -- there full in the candlelight before they eye i take the opportunity to call early upon the rector after i have question mr george jarnock who reply to my query in place of sir alfr jarnock for the older man be in a nervous and shake condition as a result of the happen and he son wish he to avoid dwelling upon the scene as much as possible the rector 's version be clear and vivid and he have evidently receive the astonishment of he life he picture to I the whole affair -- bellett up at the chancel gate go for the prayer book and absolutely alone and then the _ blow _ out of the void he describe it and the _ force _ prodigious -- the old man be drive headlong into the body of the chapel like the kick of a great horse the rector say he benevolent old eye bright and intense with the effort he have actually witness in defiance of all that he have hitherto believe when i leave he he go back to the writing which he have put aside when i appear i feel sure that he be develop the first unorthodox sermon that he have ever evolve he be a dear old chap and i should certainly like to have hear it the last man i visit be the butler he be of course in a frightfully weak and shake condition but he could tell I nothing that do not point to there be a power abroad in the chapel he tell the same tale in every minute particle that i have learn from the other he have be just go up to put out the altar candle and fetch the rector 's book when something strike he a enormous blow high up on the left breast and he be drive headlong into the aisle examination have show that he have be stab by the dagger -- of which i will tell you more in a moment -- that hung always above the altar the weapon have enter fortunately some inch above the heart just under the collarbone which have be break by the stupendous force of the blow the dagger itself be drive clean through the body and out through the scapula behind the poor old fellow could not talk much and i soon leave he but what he have tell I be sufficient to make it unmistakable that no live person have be within yard of he when he be attack and as i know this fact be verify by three capable and responsible witness independent of bellett himself the thing now be to search the chapel which be small and extremely old it be very massively build and enter through only one door which lead out of the castle itself and the key of which be keep by sir alfr jarnock the butler have no duplicate the shape of the chapel be oblong and the altar be rail off after the usual fashion there be two tomb in the body of the place but none in the chancel which be bare except for the tall candlestick and the chancel rail beyond which be the undraped altar of solid marble upon which stand four small candlestick two at each end above the altar hang the ` waeful dagger ' as i have learn it be name i fancy the term have be take from a old vellum which describe the dagger and its suppose abnormal property i take the dagger down and examine it minutely and with method the blade be ten inch long two inch broad at the base and taper to a round but sharp point rather peculiar it be double-edged the metal sheath be curious for have a crosspiece which take with the fact that the sheath itself be continue three part up the hilt of the dagger -lrb- in a most inconvenient fashion -rrb- give it the appearance of a cross that this be not unintentional be show by a engraving of the christ crucify upon one side whilst upon the other in latin be the inscription : ` vengeance be mine i will repay ' a quaint and rather terrible conjunction of idea upon the blade of the dagger be grave in old english capital : i watch i strike on the butt of the hilt there be carve deeply a pentacle this be a pretty accurate description of the peculiar old weapon that have have the curious and uncomfortable reputation of be able -lrb- either of its own accord or in the hand of something invisible -rrb- to strike murderously any enemy of the jarnock family who may chance to enter the chapel after nightfall i may tell you here and now that before i leave i have very good reason to put certain doubt behind I for i test the deadliness of the thing myself as you know however at this point of my investigation i be still at that stage where i consider the existence of a supernatural force unproven in the meanwhile i treat the chapel drastically sound and scrutinize the wall and floor deal with they almost foot by foot and particularly examine the two tomb at the end of this search i have in a ladder and make a close survey of the groin roof i pass three day in this fashion and by the evening of the third day i have prove to my entire satisfaction that there be no place in the whole of that chapel where any living be could have hide and also that the only way of ingress and egress to and from the chapel be through the doorway which lead into the castle the door of which be always keep lock and the key keep by sir alfr jarnock himself as i have tell you i mean of course that this doorway be the only entrance practicable to material people yes as you will see even have i discover some other opening secret or otherwise it would not have help at all to explain the mystery of the incredible attack in a normal fashion for the butler as you know be strike in full sight of the rector sir jarnock and he son and old bellett himself know that no live person have touch he _ ` out of the void ' _ the rector have describe the inhumanly brutal attack ` out of the void ' a strange feeling it give one -- eh and this be the thing that i have be call in to bottom after considerable thought i decide on a plan of action i propose to sir alfred jarnock that i should spend a night in the chapel and keep a constant watch upon the dagger but to this the old knight -- a little wizened nervous man -- would not listen for a moment he at least i feel assure have no doubt of the reality of some dangerous supernatural force a roam at night in the chapel he inform I that it have be he habit every evening to lock the chapel door so that no one might foolishly or heedlessly run the risk of any peril that it might hold at night and that he could not allow I to attempt such a thing after what have happen to the butler i could see that sir alfr jarnock be very much in earnest and would evidently have hold himself to blame have he allow I to make the experiment and any harm come to I so i say nothing in argument and presently plead the fatigue of he year and health he say goodnight and leave I have give I the impression of be a polite but rather superstitious old gentleman that night however whilst i be undress i see how i might achieve the thing i wish and be able to enter the chapel after dark without make sir alfr jarnock nervous on the morrow when i borrow the key i would take a impression and have a duplicate make then with my private key i could do just what i like in the morning i carry out my idea i borrow the key as i want to take a photograph of the chancel by daylight when i have do this i lock up the chapel and hand the key to sir alfred jarnock have first take a impression in soap i have bring out the expose plate -- in its slide -- with I but the camera i have leave exactly as it be as i want to take a second photograph of the chancel that night from the same position i take the dark slide into burtontree also the cake of soap with the impress the soap i leave with the local ironmonger who be something of a locksmith and promise to let I have my duplicate finish if i would call in two hour this i do have in the meanwhile find out a photographer where i develop the plate and leave it to dry tell he i would call next day at the end of the two hour i go for my key and find it ready much to my satisfaction then i return to the castle after dinner that evening i play billiards with young jarnock for a couple of hour then i have a cup of coffee and go off to my room tell he i be feel awfully tired he nod and tell I he feel the same way i be glad for i want the house to settle as soon as possible i lock the door of my room then from under the bed -- where i have hide they earlier in the evening -- i draw out several fine piece of plate armor which i have remove from the armory there be also a shirt of chain mail with a sort of quilted hood of mail to go over the head i buckle on the plate armor and find it extraordinarily uncomfortable and over all i draw on the chain mail i know nothing about armor but from what i have learn since i must have put on part of two suit anyway i feel beastly clamp and clumsy and unable to move my arm and leg naturally but i know that the thing i be think of do call for some sort of protection for my body over the armor i pull on my dress gown and shove my revolver into one of the side pocket -- and my repeat flash-light into the other my dark lantern i carry in my hand as soon as i be ready i go out into the passage and listen i have be some considerable time make my preparation and i find that now the big hall and staircase be in darkness and all the house seem quiet i step back and close and lock my door then very slowly and silently i go downstairs to the hall and turn into the passage that lead to the chapel i reach the door and try my key it fit perfectly and a moment later i be in the chapel with the door lock behind I and all about I the utter dree silence of the place with just the faint showing of the outline of the stain lead window make the darkness and lonesomeness almost the more apparent now it would be silly to say i do not feel queer i feel very queer indeed you just try any of you to imagine yourself stand there in the dark silence and remember not only the legend that be attach to the place but what have really happen to the old butler only a little while go i can tell you as i stand there i could believe that something invisible be come toward I in the air of the chapel yet i have get to go through with the business and i just take hold of my little bit of courage and set to work first of all i switch on my light then i begin a careful tour of the place examine every corner and nook i find nothing unusual at the chancel gate i hold up my lamp and flash the light at the dagger it hang there right enough above the altar but i remember thinking of the word ` demure ' as i look at it however i push the think away for what i be do need no addition of uncomfortable thought i complete the tour of the place with a constantly grow awareness of its utter chill and unkind desolation -- a atmosphere of cold dismalness seem to be everywhere and the quiet be abominable at the conclusion of my search i walk across to where i have leave my camera focus upon the chancel from the satchel that i have put beneath the tripod i take out a dark slide and insert it in the camera draw the shutter after that i uncap the lens pull out my flashlight apparatus and press the trigger there be a intense brilliant flash that make the whole of the interior of the chapel jump into sight and disappear as quickly then in the light from my lantern i insert the shutter into the slide and reverse the slide so as to have a fresh plate ready to expose at any time after i have do this i shut off my lantern and sit down in one of the pew near to my camera i can not say what i expect to happen but i have a extraordinary feeling almost a conviction that something peculiar or horrible would soon occur it be you know as if i know a hour pass of absolute silence the time i know by the far-off faint chime of a clock that have be erect over the stable i be beastly cold for the whole place be without any kind of heating pipe or furnace as i have notice during my search so that the temperature be sufficiently uncomfortable to suit my frame of mind i feel like a kind of human periwinkle encase in boilerplate and freeze with cold and funk and you know somehow the dark about I seem to press coldly against my face i can not say whether any of you have ever have the feeling but if you have you will know just how disgustingly unnerving it be and then all at once i have a horrible sense that something be move in the place it be not that i could hear anything but i have a kind of intuitive knowledge that something have stir in the darkness can you imagine how i feel suddenly my courage go i put up my mail arm over my face i want to protect it i have get a sudden sickening feeling that something be hover over I in the dark talk about fright i could have shout if i have not be afraid of the noise and then abruptly i hear something away up the aisle there sound a dull clang of metal as it might be the tread of a mail heel upon the stone of the aisle i sit immovable i be fight with all my strength to get back my courage i could not take my arm down from over my face but i know that i be get hold of the gritty part of I again and suddenly i make a mighty effort and lower my arm i hold my face up in the darkness and i tell you i respect myself for the act because i think truly at that moment that i be go to die but i think just then by the slow revulsion of feeling which have assist my effort i be less sick in that instant at the thought of have to die than at the knowledge of the utter weak cowardice that have so unexpectedly shake I all to bit for a time do i make myself clear you understand i feel sure that the sense of respect which i speak of be not really unhealthy egotism because you see i be not blind to the state of mind which help I i mean that if i have uncover my face by a sheer effort of will unhelp by any revulsion of feeling i should have do a thing much more worthy of mention but even as it be there be element in the act worthy of respect you follow I do not you and you know nothing touch I after all so that in a little while i have get back a bit to my normal and feel steady enough to go through with the business without any more funking i daresay a couple of minute pass and then away up near the chancel there come again that clang as though a armored foot step cautiously by jove but it make I stiffen and suddenly the thought come that the sound i hear might be the rattle of the dagger above the altar it be not a particularly sensible notion for the sound be far too heavy and resonant for such a cause yet as can be easily understand my reason be bind to submit somewhat to my fancy at such a time i remember now that the idea of that insensate thing become animate and attack I do not occur to I with any sense of possibility or reality i think rather in a vague way of some invisible monster of outer space fumble at the dagger i remember the old rector 's description of the attack on the butler _ of the void _ and he have describe the stupendous force of the blow as be ` like the kick of a great horse ' you can see how uncomfortably my thought be run i feel ` round swiftly and cautiously for my lantern i find it close to I on the pew seat and with a sudden jerky movement i switch on the light i flash it up the aisle to and fro across the chancel but i could see nothing to frighten I i turn quickly and send the jet of light dart across and across the rear end of the chapel then on each side of I before and behind up at the roof and down at the marble floor but nowhere be there any visible thing to put I in fear not a thing that need have set my flesh thrilling just the quiet chapel cold and eternally silent you know the feeling i have be stand whilst i send the light about the chapel but now i pull out my revolver and then with a tremendous effort of will switch off the light and sit down again in the darkness to continue my constant watch it seem to I that quite half a hour or even more must have pass after this during which no sound have break the intense stillness i have grow less nervously tense for the flash of the light ` round the place have make I feel less out of all bound of the normal -- it have give I something of that unreasoned sense of safety that a nervous child obtain at night by cover its head up with the bedclothes this just about illustrate the completely human illogicalness of the workings of my feeling for as you know whatever creature thing or be it be that have make that extraordinary and horrible attack on the old butler it have certainly not be visible and so you must picture I sit there in the dark clumsy with armor and with my revolver in one hand and nursing my lantern ready with the other and then it be after this little time of partial relief from intense nervousness that there come a fresh strain on I for somewhere in the utter quiet of the chapel i think i hear something i listen tense and rigid my heart boom just a little in my ear for a moment then i think i hear it again i feel sure that something have move at the top of the aisle i strain in the darkness to hark and my eye show I blackness within blackness wherever i glance so that i take no heed of what they tell I for even if i look at the dim loom of the stain window at the top of the chancel my sight give I the shape of vague shadow pass noiseless and ghostly across constantly there be a time of almost peculiar silence horrible to I as i feel just then and suddenly i seem to hear a sound again nearer to I and repeat infinitely stealthy it be as if a vast soft tread be come slowly down the aisle can you imagine how i feel i do not think you can i do not move any more than the stone effigy on the two tomb but sit there _ stiffen _ i fancied now that i hear the tread all about the chapel and then you know i be just as sure in a moment that i could not hear it -- that i have never hear it some particularly long minute pass about this time but i think my nerve must have quiet a bit for i remember be sufficiently aware of my feeling to realize that the muscle of my shoulder _ ache _ with the way that they must have be contract as i sit there hunch myself rigid mind you i be still in a disgusting funk but what i might call the ` imminent sense of danger ' seem to have ease from around I at any rate i feel in some curious fashion that there be a respite -- a temporary cessation of malignity from about I it be impossible to word my feeling more clearly to you for i can not see they more clearly than this myself yet you must not picture I as sit there free from strain for the nerve tension be so great that my heart action be a little out of normal control the blood beat make a dull boom at time in my ear with the result that i have the sensation that i could not hear acutely this be a simply beastly feeling especially under such circumstance i be sit like this listen as i might say with body and soul when suddenly i get that hideous conviction again that something be move in the air of the place the feeling seem to stiffen I as i sit and my head appear to tighten as if all the scalp have grow _ tense _ this be so real that i suffer a actual pain most peculiar and at the same time intense the whole head pained i have a fierce desire to cover my face again with my mail arm but i fight it off if i have give way then to that i should simply have bunk straight out of the place i sit and sweat coldly -lrb- that be the bald truth -rrb- with the ` creep ' busy at my spine and then abruptly once more i think i hear the sound of that huge soft tread on the aisle and this time closer to I there be a awful little silence during which i have the feeling that something enormous be bend over toward I from the aisle and then through the booming of the blood in my ear there come a slight sound from the place where my camera stand -- a disagreeable sort of slither sound and then a sharp tap i have the lantern ready in my left hand and now i snap it on desperately and shine it straight above I for i have a conviction that there be something there but i see nothing immediately i flash the light at the camera and along the aisle but again there be nothing visible i wheel ` round shooting the beam of light in a great circle about the place to and fro i shone it jerk it here and there but it show I nothing i have stand up the instant that i have see that there be nothing in sight over I and now i determine to visit the chancel and see whether the dagger have be touch i step out of the pew into the aisle and here i come to a abrupt pause for a almost invincible sick repugnance be fight I back from the upper part of the chapel a constant queer prickling go up and down my spine and a dull ache take I in the small of the back as i fight with myself to conquer this sudden new feeling of terror and horror i tell you that no one who have not be through these kind of experience have any idea of the sheer actual physical pain attendant upon and result from the intense nerve strain that ghostly fright set up in the human system i stand there feel positively ill but i get myself in hand as it be in about half a minute and then i go walk i expect as jerky as a mechanical tin man and switch the light from side to side before and behind and over my head continually and the hand that hold my revolver sweat so much that the thing fairly slip in my fist do not sound very heroic do it i pass through the short chancel and reach the step that lead up to the small gate in the chancel rail i throw the beam from my lantern upon the dagger yes i think it be all right abruptly it seem to I that there be something want and i lean forward over the chancel gate to peer hold the light high my suspicion be hideously correct _ the dagger have go _ only the cross-shaped sheath hang there above the altar in a sudden frightened flash of imagination i picture the thing adrift in the chapel move here and there as though of its own volition for whatever force wield it be certainly beyond visibility i turn my head stiffly over to the left glancing frightenedly behind I and flash the light to help my eye in the same instant i be strike a tremendous blow over the left breast and hurl backward from the chancel rail into the aisle my armor clang loudly in the horrible silence i land on my back and slither along on the polished marble my shoulder strike the corner of a pew front and bring I up half stunned i scramble to my foot horribly sick and shake but the fear that be on I make little of that at the moment i be minus both revolver and lantern and utterly bewildered as to just where i be stand i bow my head and make a scramble run in the complete darkness and dash into a pew i jump back staggering get my bearing a little and race down the center of the aisle put my mail arm over my face i plunge into my camera hurl it among the pew i crash into the font and reel back then i be at the exit i fumble madly in my dress gown pocket for the key i find it and scrape at the door feverishly for the keyhole i find the keyhole turn the key burst the door open and be into the passage i slam the door and lean hard against it gasp whilst i feel crazily again for the keyhole this time to lock the door upon what be in the chapel i succeed and begin to feel my way stupidly along the wall of the corridor presently i have come to the big hall and so in a little to my room in my room i sit for a while until i have steady down something to the normal after a time i commence to strip off the armor i see then that both the chain mail and the plate armor have be pierce over the breast and suddenly it come home to I that the thing have strike for my heart strip rapidly i find that the skin of the breast over the heart have just be cut sufficiently to allow a little blood to stain my shirt nothing more only the whole breast be badly bruise and intensely painful you can imagine what would have happen if i have not wear the armor in any case it be a marvel that i be not knock senseless i do not go to bed at all that night but sit upon the edge thinking and wait for the dawn for i have to remove my litter before sir alfr jarnock should enter if i be to hide from he the fact that i have manage a duplicate key so soon as the pale light of the morning have strengthen sufficiently to show I the various detail of my room i make my way quietly down to the chapel very silently and with tense nerve i open the door the chill light of the dawn make distinct the whole place -- everything seem instinct with a ghostly unearthly quiet can you get the feeling i wait several minute at the door allow the morning to grow and likewise my courage i suppose presently the rise sun throw a odd beam right in through the big east window make color sunshine all the length of the chapel and then with a tremendous effort i force myself to enter i go up the aisle to where i have overthrow my camera in the darkness the leg of the tripod be stick up from the interior of a pew and i expect to find the machine smash to piece yet beyond that the ground glass be break there be no real damage do i replace the camera in the position from which i have take the previous photography but the slide contain the plate i have expose by flashlight i remove and put into one of my side pocket regret that i have not take a second flash picture at the instant when i hear those strange sound up in the chancel have tidy my photographic apparatus i go to the chancel to recover my lantern and revolver which have both -- as you know -- be knock from my hand when i be stab i find the lantern lie hopelessly bent with smash lens just under the pulpit my revolver i must have hold until my shoulder strike the pew for it be lie there in the aisle just about where i believe i cannoned into the pew corner it be quite undamaged have secure these two article i walk up to the chancel rail to see whether the dagger have return or be return to its sheath above the altar before however i reach the chancel rail i have a slight shock for there on the floor of the chancel about a yard away from where i have be strike lay the dagger quiet and demure upon the polished marble pavement i wonder whether you will any of you understand the nervousness that take I at the sight of the thing with a sudden unreasoned action i jump forward and put my foot on it to hold it there can you understand do you and you know i could not stoop down and pick it up with my hand for quite a minute i should think afterward when i have do so however and handle it a little this feeling pass away and my reason -lrb- and also i expect the daylight -rrb- make I feel that i have be a little bit of a ass quite natural though i assure you yet it be a new kind of fear to I i be take no notice of the cheap joke about the ass i be talk about the curiousness of learn in that moment a new shade or quality of fear that have hitherto be outside of my knowledge or imagination do it interest you i examine the dagger minutely turn it over and over in my hand and never -- as i suddenly discover -- hold it loosely it be as if i be subconsciously surprise that it lay quiet in my hand yet even this feeling pass largely after a short while the curious weapon show no sign of the blow except that the dull color -- of the blade be slightly brighter on the rounded point that have cut through the armor presently when i have make a end of stare at the dagger i go up the chancel step and in through the little gate then kneel upon the altar i replace the dagger in its sheath and come outside of the rail again close the gate after I and feeling awarely uncomfortable because the horrible old weapon be back again in its accustomed place i suppose without analyze my feeling very deeply i have a unreasoned and only half-conscious belief that there be a greater probability of danger when the dagger hang in its five century rest place than when it be out of it yet somehow i do not think this be a very good explanation when i remember the _ demure _ look the thing seem to have when i see it lie on the floor of the chancel only i know this that when i have replace the dagger i have quite a touch of nerve and i stop only to pick up my lantern from where i have place it whilst i examine the weapon after which i go down the quiet aisle at a pretty quick walk and so get out of the place that the nerve tension have be considerable i realize when i have lock the door behind I i feel no inclination now to think of old sir alfr as a hypochondriac because he have take such hyperseeming precaution regard the chapel i have a sudden wonder as to whether he might not have some knowledge of a long prior tragedy in which the dagger have be concern i return to my room wash shave and dress after which i read awhile then i go downstairs and get the act butler to give I some sandwich and a cup of coffee half a hour later i be head for burtontree as hard as i could walk for a sudden idea have come to I which i be anxious to test i reach the town a little before eight thirty and find the local photographer with he shutter still up i do not wait but knock until he appear with he coat off evidently in the act of deal with he breakfast in a few word i make clear that i want the use of he dark room immediately and this he at once place at my disposal i have bring with I the slide which contain the plate that i have use with the flashlight and as soon as i be ready i set to work to develop yet it be not the plate which i have expose that i first put into the solution but the second plate which have be ready in the camera during all the time of my wait in the darkness you see the lens have be uncapped all that while so that the whole chancel have be as it be under observation you all know something of my experiment in ` lightless photography ' that be appreciate light it be x-ray work that start I in that direction yet you must understand though i be attempt to develop this ` unexposed ' plate i have no definite idea of result -- nothing more than a vague hope that it might show I something yet because of the possibility it be with the most intense and absorb interest that i watch the plate under the action of the developer presently i see a faint smudge of black appear in the upper part and after that other indistinct and wavering of outline i hold the negative up to the light the mark be rather small and be almost entirely confine to one end of the plate but as i have say lack definiteness yet such as they be they be sufficient to make I very excited and i shove the thing quickly back into the solution for some minute further i watch it lift it out once or twice to make a more exact scrutiny but could not imagine what the marking might represent until suddenly it occur to I that in one of two place they certainly have shape suggestive of a cross hilted dagger yet the shape be sufficiently indefinite to make I careful not to let myself be overimpress by the uncomfortable resemblance though i must confess the very think be sufficient to set some odd thrill adrift in I i carry development a little further then put the negative into the hypo and commence work upon the other plate this come up nicely and very soon i have a really decent negative that appear similar in every respect -lrb- except for the difference of lighting -rrb- to the negative i have take during the previous day i fix the plate then have wash both it and the ` unexposed ' one for a few minute under the tap i put they into methylate spirit for fifteen minute after which i carry they into the photographer 's kitchen and dry they in the oven whilst the two plate be dry the photographer and i make a enlargement from the negative i have take by daylight then we do the same with the two that i have just develop wash they as quickly as possible for i be not troubling about the permanency of the print and dry they with spirit when this be do i take they to the window and make a thorough examination commence with the one that appear to show shadowy dagger in several place yet though it be now enlarged i be still unable to feel convinced that the mark truly represent anything abnormal and because of this i put it on one side determine not to let my imagination play too large a part in construct weapon out of the indefinite outline i take up the two other enlargement both of the chancel as you will remember and commence to compare they for some minute i examine they without be able to distinguish any difference in the scene they portray and then abruptly i see something in which they vary in the second enlargement -- the one make from the flashlight negative -- the dagger be not in its sheath yet i have feel sure it be there but a few minute before i take the photograph after this discovery i begin to compare the two enlargement in a very different manner from my previous scrutiny i borrow a pair of caliper from the photographer and with these i carry out a most methodical and exact comparison of the detail show in the two photograph suddenly i come upon something that set I all tingle with excitement i throw the caliper down pay the photographer and walk out through the shop into the street the three enlargement i take with I make they into a roll as i go at the corner of the street i have the luck to get a cab and be soon back at the castle i hurry up to my room and put the photograph away then i go down to see whether i could find sir alfred jarnock but mr george jarnock who meet I tell I that he father be too unwell to rise and would prefer that no one enter the chapel unless he be about young jarnock make a half apologetic excuse for he father remark that sir alfr jarnock be perhaps incline to be a little over careful but that consider what have happen we must agree that the need for he carefulness have be justified he add also that even before the horrible attack on the butler he father have be just as particular always keep the key and never allow the door to be unlock except when the place be in use for divine service and for a hour each forenoon when the cleaner be in to all this i nod understandingly but when presently the young man leave I i take my duplicate key and make for the door of the chapel i go in and lock it behind I after which i carry out some intensely interesting and rather weird experiment these prove successful to such a extent that i come out of the place in a perfect fever of excitement i inquire for mr george jarnock and be tell that he be in the morning room ` come along ' i say when i have find he ` please give I a lift i have something exceedingly strange to show you ' he be palpably very much puzzle but come quickly as we stride along he ask I a score of question to all of which i just shake my head ask he to wait a little i lead the way to the armory here i suggest that he should take one side of a dummy dress in half plate armor whilst i take the other he nod though obviously vastly bewildered and together we carry the thing to the chapel door when he see I take out my key and open the way for we he appear even more astonished but hold himself in evidently wait for I to explain we enter the chapel and i lock the door behind we after which we cart the armored dummy up the aisle to the gate of the chancel rail where we put it down upon its round wooden stand ` stand back ' i shout suddenly as young jarnock make a movement to open the gate ` my god man you must not do that ' do what he ask half-startled and half-irritated by my word and manner one minute i say just stand to the side a moment and watch he step to the left whilst i take the dummy in my arm and turn it to face the altar so that it stand close to the gate then stand well away on the right side i press the back of the thing so that it lean forward a little upon the gate which fly open in the same instant the dummy be strike a tremendous blow that hurl it into the aisle the armor rattle and clang upon the polished marble floor good god shout young jarnock and run back from the chancel rail he face very white come and look at the thing i say and lead the way to where the dummy lay its armored upper limb all splayed adrift in queer contortion i stoop over it and point there drive right through the thick steel breastplate be the ` waeful dagger ' good god say young jarnock again good god it be the dagger the thing 's be stab same as bellett yes i reply and see he glance swiftly toward the entrance of the chapel but i will do he the justice to say that he never budge a inch come and see how it be do i say and lead the way back to the chancel rail from the wall to the left of the altar i take down a long curiously ornament iron instrument not unlike a short spear the sharp end of this i insert in a hole in the left-hand gatepost of the chancel gateway i lift hard and a section of the post from the floor upward bent inward toward the altar as though hinge at the bottom down it go leave the remain part of the post standing as i bent the movable portion lower there come a quick click and a section of the floor slide to one side show a long shallow cavity sufficient to enclose the post i put my weight to the lever and heave the post down into the niche immediately there be a sharp clang as some catch snick in and hold it against the powerful operating spring i go over now to the dummy and after a few minute 's work manage to wrench the dagger loose out of the armor i bring the old weapon and place its hilt in a hole near the top of the post where it fit loosely the point upward after that i go again to the lever and give another strong heave and the post descend about a foot to the bottom of the cavity catch there with another clang i withdraw the lever and the narrow strip of floor slide back cover post and dagger and look no different from the surround surface then i shut the chancel gate and we both stand well to one side i take the spear-like lever and give the gate a little push so that it open instantly there be a loud thud and something sing through the air strike the bottom wall of the chapel it be the dagger i show jarnock then that the other half of the post have spring back into place make the whole post as thick as the one upon the right-hand side of the gate there i say turn to the young man and tap the divide post there be the ` invisible ' thing that use the dagger but who the deuce be the person who set the trap i look at he keenly as i speak my father be the only one who have a key he say so it be practically impossible for anyone to get in and meddle i look at he again but it be obvious that he have not yet reach out to any conclusion see here mr jarnock i say perhaps rather curter than i should have do consider what i have to say be you quite sure that sir alfr be quite balanced -- mentally he look at I half frightenedly and flush a little i realize then how badly i put it ` i -- i do not know ' he reply after a slight pause and be then silent except for one or two incoherent half remark ` tell the truth ' i say ` have not you suspect something now and again you need not be afraid to tell I ' ` well ' he answer slowly ` i 'll admit i have think father a little -- a little strange perhaps at time but i have always try to think i be mistaken i have always hope no one else would see it you see i be very fond of the old guvnor ' i nod ` quite right too ' i say ` there be not the least need to make any kind of scandal about this we must do something though but in a quiet way no fuss you know i should go and have a chat with you father and tell he we have find out about this thing ' i touch the divide post young jarnock seem very grateful for my advice and after shake my hand pretty hard take my key and let himself out of the chapel he come back in about a hour look rather upset he tell I that my conclusion be perfectly correct it be sir alfred jarnock who have set the trap both on the night that the butler be nearly kill and on the past night indeed it seem that the old gentleman have set it every night for many year he have learn of its existence from a old manuscript book in the castle library it have be plan and use in a earlier age as a protection for the gold vessel of the ritual which be it seem keep in a hidden recess at the back of the altar this recess sir alfr jarnock have utilize secretly to store he wife 's jewelry she have die some twelve year back and the young man tell I that he father have never seem quite himself since i mention to young jarnock how puzzle i be that the trap have be set _ before _ the service on the night that the butler be strike for if i understand he aright he father have be in the habit of set the trap late every night and unsett it each morning before anyone enter the chapel he reply that he father in a fit of temporary forgetfulness -lrb- natural enough in he neurotic condition -rrb- must have set it too early and hence what have so nearly prove a tragedy that be about all there be to tell the old man be not -lrb- so far as i could learn -rrb- really insane in the popularly accept sense of the word he be extremely neurotic and have develop into a hypochondriac the whole condition probably bring about by the shock and sorrow resultant on the death of he wife lead to year of sad brooding and to overmuch of he own company and thought indeed young jarnock tell I that he father would sometimes pray for hour together alone in the chapel carnackus make a end of speaking and lean forward for a spill but you have never tell we just _ how _ you discover the secret of the divide post and all that i say speaking for the four of we oh that reply carnackus puffing vigorously at he pipe i find -- on compare the -- photo that the one -- take in the -- daytime show a thicker left-hand gatepost than the one take at night by the flashlight that put I on to the track i see at once that there might be some mechanical dodge at the back of the whole queer business and nothing at all of a abnormal nature i examine the post and the rest be simple enough you know by the way he continue rise and go to the mantelpiece you may be interested to have a look at the so-called ` waeful dagger ' young jarnock be kind enough to present it to I as a little memento of my adventure he hand it ` round to we and whilst we examine it stand silent before the fire puff meditatively at he pipe jarnock and i make the trap so that it will not work he remark after a few moment i have get the dagger as you see and old bellett 's get about again so that the whole business can be hush up decently all the same i fancy the chapel will never lose its reputation as a dangerous place should be pretty safe now to keep valuable in there be two thing you have not explain yet i say what do you think cause the two clangey sound when you be in the chapel in the dark and do you believe the soft tready sound be real or only a fancy with you be so work up and tense do not know for certain about the clang reply carnackus i have puzzle quite a bit about they i can only think that the spring which work the post must have ` give ' a trifle slipped you know in the catch if it do under such a tension it would make a bit of a ringing noise and a little sound go a long way in the middle of the night when you be think of ` ghostess ' you can understand that -- eh yes i agree and the other sound well the same thing -- i mean the extraordinary quietness -- may help to explain these a bit they may have be some usual enough sound that would never have be notice under ordinary condition or they may have be only fancy it be just impossible to say they be disgustingly real to I as for the slithery noise i be pretty sure that one of the tripod leg of my camera must have slip a few inch : if it do so it may easily have jolt the lens cap off the baseboard which would account for that queer little tap which i hear directly after how do you account for the dagger be in its place above the altar when you first examine it that night i ask how could it be there when at that very moment it be set in the trap that be my mistake reply carnackus the dagger could not possibly have be in its sheath at the time though i think it be you see the curious cross-hilted sheath give the appearance of the complete weapon as you can understand the hilt of the dagger protrude very little above the continued portion of the sheath -- a most inconvenient arrangement for draw quickly he nod sagely at the lot of we and yawn then glance at the clock out you go he say in friendly fashion use the recognize formulum i want a sleep we rise shake he by the hand and go out presently into the night and the quiet of the embankment and so to we home end of project gutenberg 's carnackus the ghost finder by william hope hodgson
