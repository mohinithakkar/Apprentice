the use of capital and italics save as record and to give -lrb- ii -rrb- a apparatus of variant reading as a appendix comprise the text of all the early issue that be to say of all edition prior to

variant chronologically arrange from the earliest to the latest quarto can easily be refer some of the early quarto no doubt offer better text of some of the play especially in the matter of verse and prose arrangement and have it be intend to print one text and one text only unaccompanied by a full apparatus of variorum reading something might be say in favor of a choice among the quarto and folio select here and there in the case of each play the particular text that seem the best but such choice could only be a extension of the eclectic method that have be reject in deal with alternative reading it seem to be equally unscientific and in view of the material in the appendix needless in common with all the quarto and the first folio the second folio have failing which will be note in

they conversation deliver they upon every pleasant occasion so fluent to talke a comedy he must be a bold man that dare undertake to write they life what i have to say be we have the precious _ remaine _ and as the wisest contemporary acknowledge they live a _ miracle _ i be very confident this volume can not die without one what more specially concerne these author and they worke be tell thee by another hand in the follow epistle of the _ stationer to the reader _ farwell reade and feare not thine owne understand this booke will create a cleare one in thee and when thou hast consider thy purchase thou wilt call the price of it a charity to thy selfe and at the same time forgive thy friend and these author humble admirer _ ja shirley the stationer to the reader _ gentleman _ before you engage farther be please to take notice of these particulars you have here a _ new booke _ i can speake it clearely for of all this large volume of _ comedy _ and _ tragedy _ not one till now be ever print before a _ collection of playe _ be commonly but a _ new impression _ the scatter piece which be print single be then onely republish together : ` tis otherwise here next as it be all new so here be not any thing _ spurious _ or _ impo would _ i have the originall from such as receive they from the author themselves by those and none other i publish this edition and as here 's nothing but what be genuine and theirs so you will finde here be no _ omission _ you have not onely all i could get but all that you must ever expect for -lrb- besides those which be formerly print -rrb- there be not any piece write by these _ author _ either joyntly or severally but what be now publish would to the world in this _ volume _ one only play i must except -lrb- for i meane to deale openly -rrb- ` tis a _ comedy _ call the _ wilde-goose chase _ which have beene long lose and i feare irrecoverable for a _ person of quality _ borrow it from the _ actor _ many yeare since and -lrb- by the negligence of a servant -rrb- it be never return would therefore now i put up this _ si quis _ that whosoever hereafter happily meete with it shall be thankfully satisfy if he please to send it home some _ playe _ -lrb- you know -rrb- write by these _ author _ be heretofore print : i think not convenient to mixe they with this _ volume _ which of it selfe be entirely new and indeed it would have rendr the booke so voluminous that _ lady _ and _ gentlewoman _ would have find it scarce manageable who in worke of this nature must first be remembr besides i consider those former piece have be so long print and re-printed that many gentleman be already furnish and i would have none say they pay twice for the same booke one thing i must answer before it bee object ` tis this : when these _ comedy _ and _ tragedy _ be present on the stage the _ actor _ omit some _ scene _ and passage -lrb- with the _ author 's _ consent -rrb- as occasion lead they and when private friend desir would a copy they then -lrb- and justly too -rrb- transcribe what they _ act _ but now you have both all that be _ act _ and all that be not even the perfect full originall without the least mutilation so that be the _ author _ living -lrb- and sure they can never dye -rrb- they themselves would challenge neither more nor lesse then what be here publish this volume be now so compleate and finish would that the reader must expect no future alteration for _ literall error _ commit by the printer ` tis the fashion to aske pardon and as much in fashion to take no notice of he that ask it but in this also i have do my endeavor ` twere vaine to mention the _ chargeablenesse _ of this work for those who own would the _ manuscript _ too well know they value to make a cheap estimate of any of these piece and though another joyn would with I in the _ purchase _ and printing yet the _ care & pain _ be wholly mine which i find to be more then you ' l easily imagine unlesse you know into how many hand the originall be disperse they be all now happily meet in this book have escape these _ publike trouble _ free and unmangled heretofore when gentleman desire but a copy of any of these _ playe _ the meanest piece here -lrb- if any may be call meane where every one be best -rrb- cost they more then foure time the price you pay for the whole _ volume _ i should scarce have adventure in these slippery time on such a work as this if know person have not generally assure mee that these _ author _ be the most unquestionable wit this kingdome have afford mr _ beaumont _ be ever acknowledge a man of a most strong and search braine and -lrb- he yeare consider -rrb- the most _ judicious wit _ these later age have produce he dye young for -lrb- which be a invaluable losse to this nation -rrb- he leave the world when hee be not full thirty yeare old mr _ fletcher _ survive and live till almost fifty whereof the world now enjoye the benefit it be once in my thought to have print mr _ fletcher 's _ worke by themselves because single & alone he would make a _ just volume _ : but since never part while they live i conceive it not equitable to seperate they ash it become not I to say -lrb- though it be a knowne truth -rrb- that these _ author _ have not only high unexpressible gift of _ nature _ but also excellent _ acquire part _ be furnish with art and science by that liberall education they have at the _ university _ which sure be the best place to make a great wit understand it selfe this they worke will soone make evident i be very ambitious to have get mr beaumont picture but could not possibly though i spare no enquirie in those _ noble family _ whence he be descend as also among those gentleman that be he acquaintance when he be of the _ inner temple _ : the best picture and those most like he you 'll finde in this _ volume _ this figure of mr _ fletcher _ be cut by severall originall piece which he friend lend I but withall they tell I that he unimitable soule do shine through he countenance in such _ ayre _ and _ spirit _ that the painter confess it be not easie to expresse he : as much as could be you have here and the _ graver _ have do he part what ever i have scene of mr _ fletcher _ owne hand be free from interline and he friend affirme he never writ any one thing twice : it seeme he have that rare felicity to prepare and perfect all first in he owne braine to shape and attire he _ notion _ to adde or loppe off before he commit one word to write and never touch pen till all be to stand as firme and immutable as if ingraven in brasse or marble but i keepe you too long from those _ friend _ of he whom ` tis fitter for you to read only accept of the honest endeavor of _ one that be a servant to you all _ humphrey moseley _ at
