mammy say mary after she have come from a trip to the outstation it hurt my heart to see how cruel these people be and those awful ugly cruel god they pray to the chief be so cruel and mean and have no mercy and then that terrible secret society the egbo i see some of they runner dress in fearful costume scare the people and whipping they with long whip i see a poor man whom they have beat almost

anderson you have not see anything yet there be million of these black people in the bush and far back in the interior most of they be slave they do not treat a slave any better than a pig the slave

whip or sell or kill when a chief die the tribe cut off the head of he wife and slave and they be bury with he the tribe be wild and cruel many of they be cannibal who eat people they spend they life in fight dancing and drinking but the way they treat twin be one of the worst thing they do what do they do to twin ask mary they kill they say mammy anderson sometimes they bury the twin alive and sometimes they just throw they out into the bush to die of hunger the mother be drive into the bush no one will have anything to do with she she be leave to die in the jungle or to be eat by the wild animal but why do they do such cruel wicked thing to harmless baby ask mary they believe that the father of one of the twin be a evil spirit or devil but they do not know which one 's father be a devil so they kill both to be sure of get the right one that must be stop say mary i will fight it as long as i live i will never give up jesus love twin just as much as other child the native must learn that they must learn that god say ` thou shalt not kill ' i 'll teach they mary make many friend not only among the child whom she teach but also among the grown-up native one day she hear a

think that mary would never marry she be forty-three year old and charle morrison she sweetheart be twenty-five he be a mission teacher at duke town the difference in they age do not bother the sweetheart they meet and have fall in love they want to marry i will marry you if the mission board will agree to let you work in the jungle with I say mary but suppose the board will not let I go into the jungle would not you be willing to come back to duke town with I ask charles no charle i could not i love you very much more than anyone i have ever know but my work for god be in the jungle there no one else have yet plant the gospel seed to leave a field like okoyong without a worker and go to one like duke town with ten or a dozen worker where the people have the bible and plenty of privilege -- that be foolish if god do not send you into the jungle with I then you must do you work and i must do mine where we have be place it be not long after mary have return to england that the mission board give its answer to she request the answer be no what the lord decide be right say mary i believe that the mission board be give I god 's answer because they be he servant what mary suffer no one know she long to have a life 's partner by she side in the great work of bring the gospel to the jungle but have give she life to god she feel that he must be she first love charle morrison however take the refusal very hard he become sick and have to go home later he go to america where he die now that mary be home in england she soon get over the jungle fever people want to hear about the missionary work in africa mary go from church to church tell about she work she do not like to do this she would rather be in the jungle tell the native about jesus it be hard for I to speak say mary but jesus have ask I to do it and it be a honor to speak for he i wish to do it cheerfully everywhere people be thrill to hear about the work for jesus in the jungle they want to do something too they give money they send box of clothes and food and other thing out to africa to help the heathen then mary get sick with influenza and bronchitis she could not go around speak any more instead she write some article for a missionary paper the gospel must be preach to the people of calabar she say then the people ought to be teach some trade they should learn to be carpenter and farmer and the like we ought to send out people who can teach they these trade so that they can make a living this be a new idea to many people they write to other missionary to find out what they think about it later a school the hope waddell training institute be start this school teach the boy and girl of calabar many trade mary be slow in get well she and janie the black girl she have bring with she go to the southern part of england where the climate be milder it be hope that the sea breeze and the mild climate would bring back she health day and week go by little by little mary get better the year 1891 come to a end the bell ring in the new year soon we can go back to dear calabar say mary oh how i want to get back and tell more people there about the lord jesus in February 1892

okoyong thing be much different from what they have be the first time she come now there be a fine mission house church and schoolhouse have be build in many of the village the people be slowly but surely turn away from they heathen custom formerly no chief ever die without the sacrifice of many human life but this be not do any more one of the chief say ma you white people be god almighty no other power could have do this there be still many chief who like to go to war and to fight with other tribe but mary have friend who would tell she of the plan of these chief she would have to go to they and persuade they not to fight one of mary 's dearest friend be ma eme when she would hear of trouble she would send a messenger to mary with a medicine bottle this would mean be ready for trouble mary be so good at settle the argument between the chief that the british government make she a vice-consul this be something like a governor and judge the jungle people would not let the white man come and make new law or settle they argument but they do listen to mary she be a very fair and honest judge the people love and obey she but life be not easy not all the native be christian even those who be be not always good christian but would sometimes slip back into the old heathen way then it be hard for mary and she helper to get to the different place there be no easy road through the jungle and wild animal be always there ready to kill the careless traveler mary receive many gift both from the native and from she friend in england and scotland one of the gift she love the best be a little steamboat which the native call smoking canoe the boy and girl in scotland have give the money to buy this boat but mary be not satisfied she do not want to take life easy as soon as she have build a church and the people be begin to become civilized she want to move on to wilder place i want to start new work say mary let those who be younger and who have not be in this work as long as i have take the place where the work have be begin many of mary 's friend among the native have go to akpap which be a village south of ekenge this village be about six mile from the cross

we can not at this time let you start work at akpap write the mission board to start there we would have to build a mission house and we do not have the money for that besides the nearest landing place be ikunetu this be six mile from akpap the forest be wild and hard to get through we believe you should continue the work at ekenge mary write again and again try to persuade the board to let she start work at akpap at last the mission board agree to let she start work there they promise to build a mission house and a boathouse for she steamboat mary do not wait for the house to be build in 1896 she build a two-room native shed here she begin she work the house be not as good as the first house she build in ekenge this do not bother mary she be more concerned about bring the gospel to the heathen the work here be like that in ekenge the chief come with the trouble they be have in they tribe they want she advice the people come with they family problem and want she to tell they what to do there be many heathen people who come from the jungle to visit she mary teach she class she conduct Sunday service she be busy all the time then one day the smallpox sickness break out you must

west of the cross river it stretch for mile and mile toward the niger river have not any missionary be there none have go into the forest missionary and trader have go along the edge of it when they go up the cross river what tribe live in this dark and mysterious country ask miss wright the ibo tribe live in most of the country but they be rule by the aro clan say mary who be they tell I something about they mary i know so little about the tribe except those who come to calabar or send they girl to we institute the aro clan be a wise but tricky people they live in thirty village near the district of arochuku where i would like to begin a mission they be strong and rule the ibo tribe because of they trade and religion they trade slave which they religion furnish when they can not get enough slave that way they raid ibo village and capture the people who live there and sell they you say they religion furnish they with slave how be that possible the ibo tribe and the aro pray to the juju god they believe the juju god live in a tree they think this tree be holy each village have its own god and sacred tree but the main juju use to be about a mile from arochuku but you have not tell I about the slave interrupted miss wright i be just come to that say mary this main juju call the long juju be reach by a wind road that go through a dense jungle and lead at last to a lake in the center of the lake be a island on which be the long juju here hundred of people come to ask advice from the priest and to worship when the people come here the aro clan have capture they then they be either sell as slave sacrifice to juju or eat by the tribe how terrible the aro be tricky one of they trick be to throw some of the people they capture into the water the water at once turn red the priest would tell the people that juju have eat the man the people believe it but really the red be only color the priest have throw into the river be the juju still there ask miss wright no the british soldier go over the cross river they have a battle with the native and beat they they capture arochuku then they chop down the long juju but of course the native still have they village juju they still do many wicked thing and you want to work among those terrible people yes do not you think they have a great need for the gospel oh they do but i would not have the courage to work among they i have no courage say mary except what god give I tell I mary have you go into that country at all i have make some short exploration trip i tell the trader to tell the chief that some day i would come to they country to live but they only answer be ` it be not safe ' that be what the people tell I when i want to go to okoyong i trust in my heavenly father and i be not afraid of the cannibal no matter how fierce and cruel they may be but mary do you know that when a chief die recently fifty or more people be eat at the funeral ceremony and twenty-five other have they head cut off and be bury with the chief yes i hear that but thing be almost as bad when i come to okoyong god bless my work and he can protect I in this strange new land of the cannibal i do hope the mission board will let I go and work among the aro and ibo the missionary in calabar want mary to work at ikorofiong and at unwana which be two town farther up the cross river from akpap but mary do not think these be good place for she work she want to be where she could reach the most people she want to work at arochuku the chief city of aro which be also near the efik ibo and ibibio tribe she want to open she first station at itu which be on the mouth of enyong creek she second station at arochuku and a third at bende the missionary at calabar do not agree but they decide to wait until a worker could be find to take mary 's place at akpap mary would not reave these people until they could be take care of by christian worker send a minister to take care of a station i can not build up a church the way a minister can say mary it look as though mary would not get to go to the land of aro then miss wright the teacher from the girl ' institute ask to be send to akpap as a assistant this request be send
